The Majles met yesterday in open session, chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the deputies from the cities of Dezful, Qazvin, and Bonab gave speeches. Then Dr. Rowhani discussed the recent crimes and aggression by the Serbs in Gorazde and the silence of the international organizations. These remarks were discussed in yesterday's issue. Continuing, the Majles then went into consultation. We direct the attention of our dear readers to the detailed proceedings. 'Ali Reza Sadra, Deputy From Dezful Despite the imperialist plots, the next century is the century of Islamic revolution. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Sadra, deputy from Dezful. During his speech he commemorated the anniversary last week of the severing of relations with America. He said: The world's hidden circles of power, consisting of the secret Zionist societies and the secret circles of international Freemasonry, have dreamed a very dangerous dream in the course of their imperialism and domination, the dream of the new world order and international order for the nations of the world in the 21st century. Continuing, he added: The new plot is the world in the power vacuum since the Cold War, under the pretext of avoiding divergence and conflict and apparently with the strategy of world alliance and unity, instead of international solidarity, following the realization of world economic, political and cultural dependence and military security. The speaker said the new world order is to be achieved through the establishment of a world empire and a racist, centralized secular dictatorship with world-devouring America as leader and center. He said: If it (the new world order) is achieved, not only will the oppressed nations, and especially the Islamic nations, not achieve their minimum legitimate rights, but the international gap between wealth and poverty among the nations will grow and become much deeper. He also said: The most important of these preliminaries are the changes and various international and regional measures such as NAFTA, GATT, Middle East compromise, the Unied Nations and changes in the structure of the Security Council and human rights aimed at achieving world interests and domination. Sadra also added: The major factor disturbing the dreams of the leaders of world imperialism, creating difficulties for the realization of the plot of world dictatorship and threatening it more every day, is the ever-expanding Islamic movement, and its pillar of inspiration and motivation is Islamic, revolution Iran. The deputy from Dezful discussed the fact that even now the world of Islam must be planned as a center of power in the new world order, for it is a unified, multi-polar, stable system. He said: However, the fierce approach world imperialism is taking towards the prominent manifestations of the Islamic movement is an illustration of its weakness and impotence, and it unmasks the evil plots and the savage face of the Satanic powers led by America. He discussed the fact that despite these plots, the coming century is the century of the Islamic revolution. Continuing, he said: As the center of the Islamic revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran is the center of power and guidance for the roaring waves of Islamic movements and it is reviving Islam in midst of the ignorance of the 20th and 21st centuries. He then said: Preserving and reinforcing this authority and refuge, which is one of the most important necessities of the age and for the current generation, depends more than anything else on preserving awareness and unity and absolute obedience to the exalted leader. Continuing, the speaker added: Now that the Majles has the study of the Second Five-Year Plan on its agenda, it is necessary that more attention than ever be given to the following, so that with the completion of the First Five-Year Plan's infrastructure projects and putting them into operation, we will see the emergence of a prosperous and constructive economy: we must adopt a policy of economizing, production and effort, removing oil from the commercial balance, putting the economic levers into the hands of native, sacrificing forces who lack the necessary resources, emphasis on agricultural conversion industries and agriculture, and avoiding excess and assembly industries. Continuing, the deputy from Dezful said: It is appropriate that attention be given to Khuzestan, with its unique regional position in the country, the Persian Gulf and among the oil-rich nations of the region, which has seen the greatest damage from imperialism and the imposed war. In addition to the oil and gas reserves, it has potential and abundant actual talents in agriculture, date orchards, medicinal herbs, animal husbandry, fisheries and other areas. Finally there are great water resources, of which more than three billion cubic meters leaves the country annually, and with the water crisis in the region, each water source is great wealth, sometimes at the level of oil revenues. At the end of his speech, Sadra asked the president of the republic to support the Khuzestan Development and Investment Company. He praised Martyr Delvari, the commander from Tangestan, and he praised the leader of this movement, Ayatollah Dezfuli, whose role has gone unrecognized. Seyyed Fatah Mortezavi, Deputy From Qazvin The great nation of Iran expects the Mr. Hashemi's government to put the market in order and to deal decisively with violators. The second preagenda speaker was Mortezavi, deputy from Qazvin. During his speech he commemorated Army Day and discussed society's economic problems. He said: The problem of high prices will be solved either when for some reason demand is reduced or a balance develops between supply and demand. This will not be possible without increasing the supply of goods to the level of demand through increased production. He added: Praise God the government of Mr. Hashemi has had great success moving in this direction. It has smoothed the path and overcome the basic difficulties. He then discussed the chaos reigning in the market. He said: The great nation of Iran recognizes Mr. Hashemi as the number-two figure in the revolution, the powerful hand of leadership and the management authority. For this reason they expect his government to put the market in order and to deal decisively with violators. Unfortunately, this will not be possible until this chaos no longer exists and each person stops doing whatever he wants to do, as long as they do not arrest the public bloodsuckers and leeches, and until they stop making oppressed people pessimistic about the revolution. Mortezavi then discussed the Council of Ministers' approval of province status for Qazvin and the sending of that measure to the Majles. He said: The Qazvin area has been carefully studied several times by the Ministry of Agriculture's Office of Divisions, and its conversion to a new province is recognized as one of the prominent outcomes of the Agricultural Divisions Law Enacted in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]. This is a law on the basis of which more than 43 municipalities, 145 districts, and about 2,000 villages were formed. He added: The establishment of the new province was desired for many years by the people of Qazvin, and they conveyed this wish in various ways to the officials of the Islamic republic. An example was the welcoming ceremonies for the president of the republic in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and his very positive and appropriate response to the request from the people. Another example was the unprecedented welcome for the speaker of the Majles last year in the month of Mehr [23 September-22 October]. As they welcomed him as the chief of the legislative power and one of the chiefs of the three powers in government work, he gave a positive response to their request. They thanked and praised him, and their thanks to him was thanks to all those working in the government and working to approve the bill. Concerning the bill's financial burden, my esteemed colleagues know that the government's budget is either for current expenses or development, and each of these cases it is either national or provincial. Whether the new province is established or not, the national and province development budgets are each spent based on the relevant law and regulations, and they have nothing to do with whether a place becomes a province or not. The same is true of the current expense budget. Most of the current expense budget is spent on education and training, health care and treatment and defense matters, and whether or not Qazvin becomes a province will not change this. Yes, if Qazvin becomes a province center, only a few ministries and organizations, which do not have separate organizations in Qazvin will need a little budget and some changes, because a significant number of the offices are now managed as independent general offices from the province center, or they are managed in such a way that they are higher than an ordinary office and their officials are deputy general managers. He added: It is the opinion of the experts that making Qazvin a province center will effectively promote the growth and development of Qazvin and consequently the growth and development of the nation. It is a region where significant investment has been done in industry and where more than 1,000 industrial units are active, ranking it third among the nation's provinces. Agriculturally it has more than 240,000 hectares of prime and second degree land in the Qazvin Plain alone. The establishment of the Qazvin Plain Development Organization in the years before the Islamic revolution is an indication of the extraordinary potential of this region, which can provide consumer goods for millions of people. Therefore, establishing the province of Qazvin means having appropriate and skilled management able to take effective steps for the growth and development of the nation and the region. Currently the management in the region lacks what is needed to solve the region's problems and difficulties and the existing installations are not suitable for the volume of work. The deputy from Qazvin noted: After approval by the Council of Ministers, the people of the region held numerous gatherings to offer thanks and praise, and even now their eyes are fixed on the votes of the Majles deputies, who are the pick of the nation, and they are counting the moments until voting time. With the wisdom and insight that we know the deputies have, we hope they will make more than one million people happy with their votes and solve this problem of several years standing. He asked the minister of petroleum for help providing gas service to the cities of Eqbaliyeh and Zibashahr, he asked the minister of roads and transportation for help with the creation of suitable rural roads in the deprived districts of al-Mowt, Rudbar-e Shahrestan, and Tarom-e Safali, and he issued a memo to the minister of health care, treatment and medical education asking for the establishment of hospitals in the cities of Elvand and Abik. Rasul Sadiqi, Deputy From Bonab Imperialism, in clinging to humanitarian issues such as human rights, constantly seeks to weaken independent and Islamic nations. The final preagenda speaker was Sadiqi, deputy from Bonab. In his talk he discussed the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan and the 8-percent growth under the First Five-Year Plan. He said: It is the nature of such growth, despite significant organization, that it is expensive in some areas in order to achieve the desired production, in such a way that society's vulnerable classes have faced many problems. He added: To stop the pressures on the vulnerable classes caused by growth under the plan through inflation without adjusting the plan's 8-percent growth rate, which is a basic rate, special attention must be given to establishing more effective parameters to control the problems in society. On the one hand we must make efforts to build national resolve, using the abilities of all the sincere, believing and specialist forces and emphasizing the valuable guidance of the exalted leader in his New Year's message concerning the work ethic and social order in the building of our Islamic nation. Continuing, the speaker said: The current issues in the Muslim world illustrate the truth that world imperialism, in clinging to humanitarian issues such as human rights, constantly seeks to weaken independent and Islamic nations, and it will give up dominating these nations only if they assert their own authority. Sadiqi then discussed the crimes of the Serbs in Gorazde. He said: This damaged city is falling before the eyes of the people of the world under the harshest methods such as attacks on the lives and property of the people, and this illustrates the claim that there seems to be no longer any sign of human beings and humanity in the heart of so-called civilization, and that the human rights of the international organizations is merely a weapon to silence the cries of the freedom-seeking nations. He issued a memo to the newspapers, especially some local newspapers. He said: In view of the emergence of nationalist issues in the world and the processes arising from it, especially in the nations neighboring us, they must exercise special awareness. Instead of dealing with spiritual and cultural issues, they are sowing discord among Muslims by reinforcing personal ethnic prejudice and indirectly promoting the ideas of undesirable elements, the supporters of the Hojjatiyehs and the Khalq-e Mosalman, and spreading lies. Sometimes this causes problems in the districts and municipalities. This trend is very dangerous, and I call upon the Ministry of Guidance to deal seriously with such cases. The deputy from Bonab thanked the government and the Majles for compiling and implementing the First Five-Year Plan. He said: A comparison of the parameters, problems, and approaches taken in various affairs at the beginning and at the end of the Five-Year Plan shows the nation's success and progress in various areas, so that the people of Bonab and Malekan are waiting for a visit from the president of the republic to open and put into operation several important and vital projects. Legislation International Air Agreement on Goods Traveling Between Iran and Greece The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the International Air Transportation and Shipping Agreement on Goods and Passengers Traveling Between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Greece (returned from the Council of Guardians), and this amendment was passed for the purpose of gaining the approval of the Guardian Council. Amendment: If the two parties to the agreement are unable to resolve differences under paragraphs 1 and 2 above, they may refer the dispute to a three-person arbitration court, adhering to the relevant laws and regulations. Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law The second item on the agenda was the report from the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Article 34 of the Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law, enacted 3/14/1354 [4 June 1975] and append several notes to it (returned from the Guardian Council), for which the above amendment was approved by the Majles. Amendment to Article 34: As of the date of this law's enactment, the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade is required within three years to [text missing] the northern forests and plains and treeless nationalized pastures, which were converted to orchards or irrigated farms or put to use for projects to produce livestock and aquatic animals and other nonagricultural projects by the end of the year 1365 [20 March 1987] after the approval of the Proposed Law on Procedures for Transferring and Revitalizing Lands in the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and without obtaining legal and religious authorization to take possession... Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals Performing Compulsory Service The third item on the agenda was the report on the first consultation of the Defense Affairs Commission concerning the Bill To Amend the Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals Performing Compulsory Service, the general form of which was approved by the deputies. It is worth mentioning that in the amendment to this law the phrase "National Technical and Professional Education Organization" was added to the aforementioned law approved 7/25/1369 [17 October 1990]. Authorization Ministry of Defense to Form Development and Service Companies The next item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Defense Commission concerning the Bill Authorizing the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics To Form Development and Service Companies, which was approved. Article 1 states: The Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics is authorized, provided it retains its combat capability and defense readiness, to form development and service companies after approval from the Armed Forces General Staff. Urgent Motion Prohibiting Use of Western Names The next item on the agenda was the Prohibition on Employing Western Names, Titles and Expressions, presented as an urgent motion. Discussing the motion's urgent status, 'Ali Yusefpur said: This motion was presented following the emphasis from the exalted leader on using Persian words and also following the publication of the thoughts of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him) in this regard. Unfortunately in the last few years on the streets of Tehran foreign names have been appearing in abundance on public streets, in newspapers, and in stores. Even on signs, the Western words are big but the Persian words are small. Should an Islamic nation, which is the center of the Islamic revolution and should be setting an example, really be intoxicating its students with words in the Latin alphabet? Already the words blouse, shirt, and others are being printed in the stores as foreign words. Isn't this selling oneself? Why should some parks be named with foreign names? Unfortunately one of the officials sent a New Year's card to the deputies offering the greetings in Latin characters. The greeting is so alienated that the official uses the foreign term for Majles deputy. Therefore, to prevent the use of these terms, we presented this bill to the Majles as an urgent motion. After talks by opponents and supporters, the bill's urgent status was put to a vote, was not approved, and was rejected. Motion on Regulations for Foreign Vehicles Likewise, the proposed Law on Regulations for Foreign Vehicles was presented by the deputies as an urgent motion, and its urgent status was approved by the deputies. One of the signatories to this motion said in a speech: Since the nations who have signed the treaty on trucks have set special regulations, we must also set regulations in this regard. The regulations must not be onesided. In those countries trucks operate in limited numbers, but the trucks native to the country operate with cheap fuel, without difficulty and without limitations. He also noted: We are wasting 50 million tumans per day in this regard.
