On these blessed days, we are reliving the memory of the 15 Sha'ban uprising, which reflected our heroic Iraqi people's deep association with great Islam and their readiness to make any sacrifice for its sake. The uprising also reflected the extent of injustice and persecution practiced by Saddam's criminal regime against this zealous people, and the rejection of this regime by the Iraqi people of all their sects, nationalities, and social groups. [passage omitted] On this blessed anniversary, we call on our Iraqi people to perpetuate the confrontation against the ruling tyranny in Baghdad. We call on them to be vigilant of the plots being hatched against our beloved Iraq by its enemies, both Saddam's gang and the covetous forces that are trying to find a foothold in Iraq to practice their sabotage mission on behalf of the arrogant forces that seek to serve their own interests. On this anniversary, we also remind the world and all virtuous forces that the Iraqi people are experiencing a major plight at the hands of Saddam's regime, and are being subjected to plots of physical liquidation, terrorism, and confiscation of public and individual freedoms. We call on the world and its virtuous forces to make continuous efforts to force the ruling regime in Baghdad to stop its criminal schemes from being implemented in the Iraqi cities in the north, south, center, and in the marshlands in particular. The regime is engaged in operations of pursuits, killing, economic blockade, continuous dry-up efforts, and annihilation of all features of human life. We call on the world and the virtuous forces to abandon their silence over the Saddam regime's genocide against the Iraqi people everywhere. We appeal to the Security Council, the United Nations, and their humanitarian organizations to play their legal role regarding the crimes and tragedies of Iraq. O sons of the Armed Forces; O Iraqi officers and soldiers: The sons of your Iraqi people everywhere have unleashed their outcry in the face of the criminal tyrant, expressing their rejection of him. They have paid with their lives and pure blood for this outcry. They wanted to rid themselves of the tyrant and its regime and establish a system that ensures their freedom, independence, dignity, might, and honor. You belong to this steadfast, brave, mujahid people who seek salvation. This people calls on you to be the strong and striking force to topple this criminal tyrant, who has violated dignities and sanctities, destroyed the country, ruined all its resources, and forced humiliation, death, displacement, and disgrace on the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi people warn you against being used by Saddam to realize his personal whims of despotism, crime, and corruption. O honorable officers and soldiers: The current situation provides the best chance for the Army and the Iraqi people to join forces and wage the battle against tyranny, crime, corruption, humiliation, and slavery, a battle for Iraq's independence and freedom, which Saddam is relinquishing--after having destroyed everything--to preserve his power.
