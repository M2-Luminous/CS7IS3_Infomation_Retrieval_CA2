We demand that the ejidos, the small properties, the Constitution, and the law be respected, said Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga, president of the National Confederation of Cattlemen [CNG]. Octovio Albores Cruz, state leader of the National Peasant Confederation [CNC], reported that the Chiapas government will form an investigative commission on squatting. The CNC will participate in this commission to see that the presidential resolutions are based on documents and appropriately carried out. Albores Cruz maintained that the union he chairs does not support squatting. Nevertheless, he warned that once all the appeals run out and if there is no reply to the peasants' demands, "I will not be ashamed to say: Let them squat." Peasants from the San Cristobal de las Casas region are demanding compensation for nationalized lands, small properties, and agriculture colonies of 27 ejidos of Cintalapa Municipality. During a special session of the CNG National Assembly to support the Chiapas cattle ranchers, Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga urged the ranchers to remain calm, although he insisted that the sector has been accused of being Satanic, which is unjust. All the cattle ranchers of Chiapas and Mexico are working people, he noted. Gonzalez Quiroga said in a annoyed tone: "We have respected the institutions; we have not taken up arms; we are not accusing anyone; we do not have white guards [guardias blancas]. We have tractors, plow, and a willingness to work. We will continue to act within the institutions because we believe that matters should be solved correctly." In Gonzalez Quiroga's opinion, the Chiapas conflict is a priority and a cause of concern for all Mexicans. He also expressed his desire for a true peace process. He added, however, that once the peace process has concluded, the CNG take up its problem once again. He was then asked: "When will the cattle ranchers' good sense prevail?" I cannot answer for each and every one of them. The call is for calm and for the problem to be solved. The government is willing to solve the problem. We have faith and trust in President Carlos Salinas. Meanwhile, Alberto Marin Toache, president of the Regional Cattle Ranchers Union of Northern Chiapas, said that so long as squatting -- an attack on private property -- continues, "there will not be peace." Marin Toache said: "Signing a document does not achieve peace, particularly because we do not have faith that the signing of a document with the Zapatists will produce a lasting peace or that the document is valid." To sign something firm, the cattlemen's leader insisted, all those involved must participate, because the unknown, the hooded, and the masked can retract tomorrow.
