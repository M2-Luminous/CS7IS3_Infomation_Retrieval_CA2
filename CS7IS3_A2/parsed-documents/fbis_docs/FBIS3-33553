What are your main points? [Rodriguez] MNS' government platform contains general and specific objectives. Five of our general objectives are the following: the elimination of poverty as an essential factor; simultaneous sustained development and social development; the broadening of the business sector; the modernization of the state; and a change of the nation's economy toward a solidarity economy. A solidarity economy is one that seeks a better distribution of the nation's economic surplus. Arena's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] "Achilles heel" is the thesis of monetarism it has implemented. The ripple effect theory has not been produced simultaneously with economic growth. A social economy market is not the most adequate label for the current model. [Reporter] According to your proposal, what is missing in the current model? [Rodriguez] There is a lack of openness in the market, and the tendency is not toward fair competition. There are monopolies and oligopolies that influence important products in El Salvador. We could mention, for example, fertilizers, which have a bearing on all the basic grains. There are companies that have imported shiploads of fertilizers. The decisions of such a powerful group of speculators has an influence on prices. We will not discuss progress, rather, extreme liberalism, which has put the businessmen who for many years supported the economy in a difficult situation. A market economy encourages equal conditions and openness. The state should regulate and orientate. [Reporter] What does it mean the state should be the economic regulator without intervening in the market? [Rodriguez] For example, by not exporting beans. What happened last year? Since Antonio Cabrales, agriculture and livestock minister, talked about a record harvest of cereals, speculators have decided to export beans to Nicaragua and Honduras, leaving our people hungry. We do not think the state should intervene in certain matters but should in the food supply and strategic industries. [Reporter] Would you, for example, fix prices for strategic products? [Rodriguez] No. I would not, but I would prohibit the export of basic grains until the local market is guaranteed, and I would promote their production. I would support the small producers with credits, low interest rates so they can produce more. In that case, the law of the market would work, because there would be a surplus. [Reporter] What is the difference between what you are proposing for the state and what the PDC [Christian Democratic party] has, for example? [Rodriguez] We would have the control and organization to enforce regulation, but we would not take over the role of the private sector. The PDC has intervened in the economy and substituted the private sector. This was an error, as it generated corruption. Neither did we believe in liberalism as applied by the government, where anything goes. We believe the market economy strategy should be preserved, but social responsibility should be included. This is solidarism's proposal based on its two pillars, active participation and social responsibility in the nation's problems. [Reporter] What measure would you apply, if these have a name, to make social development effective? [Rodriguez] We are not going to entitle these measures, rather, criteria. In the government's strategy the ripple effect thesis is upheld. Its theory is to have investment there must be savings--it is axiomatic--and to have savings there must be a concentration of wealth. What have they done? They have promoted the large companies so they can concentrate wealth, save, and from there generate investments. The truth is investment generated from the concentration of wealth in a few sectors does not translate into broad benefits. We want to broaden the base of the private sector. We are talking about the poor in the marketplace, the shoemaker, the small businessmen who do not have access to credit. We want to promote them to strengthen the local market and to integrate them into an export economy similar to the Taiwanese model, where the family business has been essential in the export process. [Reporter] What do these views mean specifically? Tax reforms? A change in the interest rate? Subsidies with international aid? [Rodriguez] The assistant World Bank director visited us two months ago and informed us the IMF and the World Bank and other international organizations have given priority to supporting programs to eradicate poverty in developing countries. These institutions pressured the countries of Latin America during the 1980's to make structural changes so they could improve their economies, and they then realized this caused an enormous level of poverty. The UN Development Program points to the imbalance: Twenty percent of the world's population earns 82 percent of the world's income, and conversely 80 percent of the population earns 18 percent of the world's income. This tells us of the errors that even institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF have made in their policies. We hope to raise the national tax rate from 9 to 11 percent. We believe the value-added tax must be reformed. Everything that hurts the basic family basket and medicines must be eliminated. There should be a tax on luxury items, namely, jewelry, expensive clothes, and a stiffer tax on nonessential items, such as luxury cars. We plan to revise the tax law chiefly on income and family goods to make the wealthier pay more. We also have international loans that have been negotiated lately. We know those resources will be effective. It is a matter of time. An important element we are considering is austerity in public administration. We plan to lower the fiscal deficit with austerity. There is no reason for the government to promote costly publicity campaigns such as the current one. We will lower the Armed Forces budget. Why spend on television programs? Every night, they pay for a program on all channels. That money could be eliminated from the budget to lower the deficit. We are going to dispense with armored vehicles for public officials and lower traveling expenses. We are even going to review the president's confidential expenditures. There is no reason for them to be confidential, but we must lower them to begin with. A Treasury Ministry union has told us some months ago the president withdrew 22 million colones in one day. For what? We have a major resource abroad sending us large amounts of foreign exchange. We do not think those resources should be oriented toward the purchase of houses, as that is consumption. We must create an entity that steers those resources toward productive investments. In addition, we are proposing a reform in the foreign service. The southeastern Asian countries will encounter problems entering the United States. With an investment program brought before companies from Taiwan, Singapore, etc., we could become the entry point into the United States, making use of the advantages we still have under the General Preference System, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and what remained of the Initiative for the Americas. There is also the possibility of strengthening the integration of the isthmus, given figures indicate El Salvador's level of commerce with the region has registered a big increase. [Reporter] The National Solidarity Movement did not complete the registration of candidates in all municipalities; yet you said the party's position is good. On what do you base your optimism? [Rodriguez] We believe we are fighting for a second or third position nationwide. We were planning to run in 120 municipalities but have entered 80 races for a lack of resources. We are running excellent candidates, however. We believe we can win in 40 percent of those 80 municipalities. If we are in fourth place, according to the polls, we will win a minimum of 12 deputies. At the presidential level we are making a major effort to maintain a higher profile. We think we are winning great support. In addition, everywhere we go we have found the support of the people from the churches, the Catholic and Evangelical Churches. We have candidates who belong to the Elim Church, Mormons, winners who will win in major centers. We have put forth the best we could without compromising the party. We trust in the people's sensible nature.
