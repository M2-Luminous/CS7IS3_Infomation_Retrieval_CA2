The aim of the conference was to map out the basic elements of economic partnership between the two groups of countries, with a view to contributing to their permanent economic growth. Our collaborator Jozef Hubel, Slovak Television correspondent in Warsaw, asked Minister of Economy Peter Magvasi a few questions on this occasion: [Hubel] What conclusions can be drawn from the conference for Slovakia? [Magvasi] The main conclusion is that Slovakia is going in the right direction and that ours is among the most rapidly transforming economies within the framework of the postcommunist countries. We could therefore become very interesting as a link between the East and the West. [Hubel] We will evidently not make do without foreign investment. [Magvasi] Direct foreign investment in the reforming countries should reach the sum of $200 billion by the year 2000, and the private sector should generate 70 percent of their gross national product. The first prerequisite of influx of investment resources is the political stability of each country. Everything else is a question of the quality, conscientiousness, and systemic approach of people, people in both the state administration and the entrepreneurial sphere. A good atmosphere for that is being created in our country. [Hubel] But we are unlikely to catch up with the economically advanced countries by means of foreign capital alone. More than that is needed. [Magvasi] An outstretched arm is too little. We must ourselves look for ways of catching up with the advanced world. Countries relying more on their own resources have progressed further than those relying on help from the outside. If the appropriate environment is not established, outside help is only a single, unrepeated action and has no permanent effect. [Hubel] You have had several bilateral meetings while in Warsaw. How would you characterize the present Polish-Slovak economic relations? [Magvasi] They can on no account be assessed positively. The two countries have a far bigger potential than is indicated by the bilateral trade turnover. This is the consequence of a certain process, which we no longer have to analyze, however. Now we have to focus on opening better corridors for mutual trade. A contribution to this should be made by the signing of several bilateral agreements during Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to Bratislava, which is now under preparation. Until then, we should sort out some problems, including, for example, the settlement of the Polish debt toward Slovakia. In view of its industrial potential, Poland could be a far more significant partner for Slovakia than some other countries with which we have rich trade relations today.
