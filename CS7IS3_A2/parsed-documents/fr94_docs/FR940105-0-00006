FR940105-0-00006 FR940105-0-00002 Four commenters recommended that the random testing rate be reduced to less than 50 percent. The rates they recommended varied from 5 percent to 25 percent. Their central argument was that the random testing rate can be lowered substantially without threatening the effectiveness of the program. The very low rates of drug and alcohol positive tests that have been recorded by the nuclear industry during the first two years of FFD program operations are the basis for their recommendation. One licensee stated that most chronic drug users probably have been eliminated and currently there is not a serious drug or alcohol abuse problem in the industry. This commenter and NUMARC also cited the GAO study that found that the percentage of positives does not vary significantly among Federal agency drug testing programs, regardless of what random rate is used. Another licensee emphasized that behavioral observation, not random testing, is the most potent tool in detecting drug abuse. Another commenter recommended that the NRC consider further reductions because the effectiveness of other program elements makes a random rate of even 50 percent unnecessarily high. Significant cost savings was given as the most compelling reason to reduce the random rate below 50 percent. One licensee estimated the industry would save up to $30 million annually without degradation of the overall program. NRC Response As stated in the response to Comment 1 above, positive random testing results are not, by themselves, the only indicator of the FFD program's effectiveness in detecting substance abuse. The NRC does not have sufficient information about the many variables that could affect testing results to be able to determine that a lower random testing rate would maintain an acceptable level of program effectiveness. Therefore, the Commission believes that the industry's relatively low numbers of drug and alcohol positive random test results should not be used as the sole justification for lowering the random testing rate below 50 percent. While behavorial observation and for-cause testing are valuable program elements, there still must be a strong random testing program that provides an adequate level of detection and deterrence. The Commission continues to believe that it must choose a conservative and prudent random testing rate that maximizes both detection and deterrence of substance abuse while minimizing the monetary and social costs of such testing. The Commission believes that a 50-percent random testing rate will strike the proper balance between the dictates of public health and safety, the financial needs of licensees, and the privacy and other interests of workers subject to the testing requirement. Given the substantial unknowns currently associated with the true detection and deterrence effectiveness of alternative random testing rates as applied to the particular conditions of the nuclear power industry workforce, the Commission believes that it cannot establish a random testing rate lower than 50 percent for any segment of the industry at this time. It should also be noted that relatively low positive test rates do not necessarily indicate that there is not a drug and alcohol abuse problem, as some commenters asserted. First, some users have become adept at avoiding detection, and the use of increasingly effective subversion techniques may be one reason why random testing results are decreasing. Second, while it may be that most of the chronic drug users who were in the industry when the program started have been detected or have left, there can be expected to be a continuing level of intermittent illegal drug use and alcohol abuse among industry employees; such use is difficult to detect. The Commission concludes that the low positive random test results do not indicate that there has ceased to be a drug and alcohol abuse problem and that further reduction in the random testing rate would not be appropriate at this time. In response to the commenters' reference to the GAO's observation that the percentage of positives does not vary significantly among Federal agency drug testing programs, the NRC notes that the GAO's objective in that report was to identify potential cost savings in Federal employee drug testing programs. Its objective did not include determination of the relative deterrent values of alternative random testing rates. In accomplishing its objective, the GAO properly concentrated on only the costs associated with Federal employee drug testing. It did not perform an indepth analysis of the several variables that influence testing results nor of the very complex relationship between those variables and the deterrence value of testing. Such variables would include the inclination for drug or alcohol abuse among the employees in the various industries in which the Federal testing programs operate, the extent to which the strength and effectiveness of other, non-testing program elements, such as drug awareness training, may affect testing results, and the relative stringency of sanctions imposed by the various Federal agencies following positive test results. Because the GAO's objective was to address the cost rather than the deterrence effectiveness of testing, the NRC does not consider the commenter's reference to the GAO's observation to be a persuasive argument for reduced random testing rates.
