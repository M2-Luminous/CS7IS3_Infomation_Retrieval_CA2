The resumption of the framework talks has created a situation that gives a "ray of hope" for the future of Prime Minister Hata, who is facing difficulty in handling the political situation with his minority government, (according to a close aide to the prime minister). The prime minister intends to use the resumption of the framework talks as a good opportunity to keep "his besieged minority government" floating by breaking a deadlock over Japan-U.S. economic relations prior to the summit (Naples Summit) of major industrialized nations scheduled for July. With the issue of continuing tax cuts still remaining unsettled between Japan and the United States, the prime minister aims to "normalize" Japan-U.S. relations by cutting the income tax prior to raising the consumption tax rate and then use the normalized Japan-U.S. relations as a lever to retake the leadership in handling the political situation. Nevertheless, it would be difficult for the prime minister to use those steps as a means to neutralize the opposition Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] strategy to vote the Hata government out of power. The prime minister is likely to be plagued by "double tortures," which means his struggle to keep his minority government in place and to deal with a no-confidence vote against his government. The prime minister watched with strained attention progress in Japan-U.S. vice ministerial talks on reopening the stalled Japan-U.S. framework talks that began in Washington on 19 May. On the morning of 23 May, the prime minister called bureau chiefs in charge of the framework talks in the Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the International Trade and Industry Ministry into the prime minister's official residence to instruct them to do everything they could to get the stalled framework talks resumed. The prime minister appears to have been considerably wary of sluggish progress in informal consultations between the two countries on resuming the stalled talks. Asked by reporters to comment on progress in the informal consultations, the prime minister has always reacted cautiously to the request, saying: "I do not like to comment on it because the informal consultations are now in a delicate stage." For the prime minister, whether the stalled Japan-U.S. framework talks are resumed or not is a crucial issue that "determines the fate of his government." As a minority government, the Hata government is being forced to handle the difficult political situation with the prospect that a no-confidence motion against it will be introduced to the Diet after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet. At this time, if the Hata government fails to have the stalled framework talks resumed, it would further worsen Japan-U.S. relations, the improvement of which is the most important matter on the Hata government's domestic agenda. If Japan-U.S. relations worsen, the Hata government would be placed in a very difficult position in dealing with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and it would be in a "state of complete impasse" in handling its domestic and foreign policies. The prime minister is literally "surrounded by foes on all fronts." Officials close to the prime minister are increasingly apprehensive about the Hata government, saying: "A situation may be created where the Hata government runs for its life." There is a possibility that the latest decision by Japan and the United States to reopen the stalled talks has made it possible for the Hata government to avert that worst scenario and given the government a momentum to strengthen its cohesive force (says a senior ruling party member). Many officials in the prime minister's official residence believe that "the resumption of the stalled framework talks has opened bright prospects for the Hata government, whose future has been uncertain." Nevertheless, no prospects are seen for resolving the "issue of taking measures to open the Japanese market and cutting taxes", which are seen as one of the hurdles to normalizing Japan-U.S. relations. Meanwhile, the LDP is reacting coolly to the resumption of the framework talks, saying: "The Hata government has only narrowly averted the worst situation that could trigger a trade war between Japan and the United States." The LDP is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata government to the Diet after the 1994 budget bill is passed, arguing that "the Hata government does not deserve to be given any high marks for resuming the stalled framework talks." Commenting on the prospect of resuming the stalled framework talks on the morning of 24 May, a government source close to the prime minister said: "Mr. Hosokawa resigned as prime minister that way. It might be better that he resigned that way because government officials at the time felt a sense of crisis over the future of the Japan-U.S. framework talks."
