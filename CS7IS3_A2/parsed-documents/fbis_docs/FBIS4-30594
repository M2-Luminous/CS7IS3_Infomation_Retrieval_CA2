Already the sixth largest producer in the world, the latecomer pursues fifth place before the close of the present century in its aggressive "X-5 Project," mapped out by the Kim Yong-sam administration with an eye to putting further vigor into the auto field, locomotive of Korea's exports. Individual companies, especially Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Daewoo Motor, have their own visions of a brighter future, pooling their wisdom and energy for a life-and-death battle on one hand and cashing in on government policy on the other. "Korea is one of several countries that has jumped into the highly sophisticated technology- and capital-intensive sector since World War II but is the only country that has now succeeded there," Cho Kwan-hyon, executive vice chairman of the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association [KAMA], said in an interview at his office yesterday. The 58-year-old Cho was recently elected vice president of the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA), a Paris-based federation of 28 national organizations, all representative of world auto producers and importers. "My election is primarily attributable to the strong position of Korea's auto industry on the global scene. I think as an OICA vice president, I can in turn promote the stature of our industry one rung on the ladder to world leadership," a beaming Cho viewed. He will head the organization, established in 1919 and granted United Nations Consultative Status as early as 1956, along with one president and two other vice presidents for the coming two years. His accession to the post is an honor, the first to date for a developing country. His predecessors have been all from just a handful of auto powers including the United States, Germany, France, Italy and Japan. He said he would devote himself to articulating the voices of Korean and Asian automakers in the organization and consolidating their roles in the development of the world automobile and its industry, being faithful to OICA's general purposes. Actually, OICA aims at ensuring permanent link between its members, undertaking, at their request, studies on any question of mutual interest, collecting and circulating any useful information for the benefit of member associations and their respective members and representing the auto industry in intergovernmental and international bodies. The OICA vice president particularly plans to help Korea join three committees--the Technical Committee, Industrial and Economic Policy Committee and Exhibition Committee. KAMA got its OICA membership quite belatedly, in 1991, at his initiative but has yet to be admitted to the specialized panels. He seeks the organization's expertise on the setup of a massive domestic motor show, scheduled for May next year in Seoul, as the first full-scale show of its kind. KAMA, in close cooperation with member auto producers, started preparing it last year. "During the one-week display," Cho said, "We will demonstrate the technology and service which our industry has accumulated over the last decades. Based on the experience, KAMA will hold an international motor show in the spring or fall of 1997 though it will chart out details for the scheme after the local event. He painted a very rosy picture for the domestic auto industry in the present and future as well, foreseeing that it would produce an estimated 5 million units including overseas output in the year 2000 and stand only next to the United States, Japan, Germany and France. "We will engage in a neck-and-neck race with France then." "The situation remains favorable. First of all, the home market is stable. It is only here that auto sales swell by 10 percent or more annually. Korean automakers will be able to make another jump- start by making the most of the local market over the three or four years. "Korean-built cars have unchallenged price competitiveness. Given extensive investment in the research and development and subsequent improvement in quality and styling, they will pose a threat to century-old world top-notch brands," he reasoned. Domestic producers are success-oriented and full of confidence. For one thing, he noted, Hyundai is going ahead with its "Global Top 10 Project" designed to produce 2 million units by 2000, equal to the current output of Volkswagen and even more than that of Mitsubishi or Mazda. Kia and Daewoo are benchmarking Hyundai's "can-do spirit and ambitious push." Cho complained about the administration's "hasty" concession to the U.S. pressure to lower the tariff on imported vehicles. "The administration's hasty slash of the tariff to 8 percent is much lower than the internationally-acknowledged rate of 10 percent. The European Union, for instance, levies a 10 percent tariff on foreign cars and we have to give European cars preferential treatment here," he stressed.
