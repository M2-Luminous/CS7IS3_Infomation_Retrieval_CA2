Vasilyev: "Ruinous Price Discrepancies"] [Text] Each one of us is a consumer. Naturally we become very upset when faced with the unpleasant fact of increased prices for goods, especially for food products. There are many factors that contribute to the growth in market prices. One of the important ones is increased procurement prices for agricultural products. But do enterprises themselves benefit from them? The growth in procurement prices only partially covers expenditures by villagers needed to obtain industrial goods. Let us look at data recently prepared by the price policy administration of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture. Here is how procurement prices for agricultural products increased in terms of 1986 prices after so-called price liberalization. In 1992 they increased by a factor of 18, and in 1993 -- by a factor of almost 150. Now let us look at how wholesale prices for industrial goods have changed. During these years they increased by factors of 44 and 495 respectively. It is not difficult to see that the pace of growth of prices for industrial products is considerably higher than for agricultural, and this difference is increasing. Procurement prices should be increased at least threefold in order to give villagers the opportunity to buy material-technical products in the necessary quantities. But at present no one is moving in this direction. To act in this manner means to overstock store shelves with food products in the face of their obvious shortage. The problem comes up against the low solvency of the population. Despite the difficult economic situation within industry as well, its enterprises nevertheless find themselves in an advantageous position as compared to agricultural enterprises. Their products can "await" a buyer until better times. But many agricultural products are subject to rapid deterioration. This is why it is not wise, and even wasteful, to establish very high prices for them. Today specialists suggest various ways to eliminate the negative consequences of price disparities for industrial and agricultural products. Some feel that supplementary expenditures by villagers related to non-equivalent exchange between the city and the village should be covered by adequate government subsidies. Others propose the introduction of guaranteed (protective) prices that will provide peasants with a minimum income needed for simple reproduction. But the amounts of subsidies remain small and are allocated with great delays, and protective prices remain good intentions. In actuality, the problem does not lie in the selection of a form for providing financial support for villagers. It is important to provide a type of aid that will protect them from inflation and enable them to manage efficiently and profitably. It is this kind of considerable support that the developed countries of Western countries give to their farmers, and this experience is what our people like to cite more and more often.
