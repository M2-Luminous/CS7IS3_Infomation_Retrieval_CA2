These should include low wages for simple work, wage cuts, and changes in social and labor market policy. A resolution by the DIHT Executive Committee, entitled "Policy for More Employment," which was published in Bonn on Thursday [17 March], says: "In order to control the reduction of employment, the parties to the wage contracts must also facilitate wage cuts, which make it possible to continue employment, even in the case of low utilization of production capacities." The partners to the wage negotiations should agree on lower wages than so far for simple work. They must take into account that after reunification, labor "is now available in comparatively larger amounts than capital." This is an important cause of unemployment, especially in eastern Germany. Therefore, east German wages must be adjusted to the west German level more slowly than in the past. DIHT calls on the politicians to lower social security contributions. Performances by unemployment and pension insurance arising from reunification should be financed by the state. Active labor market policy must be accessible for more unemployed by reducing the expenditure for the individual. Furthermore, DIHT demands that reprivatized companies in eastern Germany should be exempt from high severance pay in case of lay-offs. They should be treated like newly founded companies, which are not obligated to implement social plans during the first four years.
