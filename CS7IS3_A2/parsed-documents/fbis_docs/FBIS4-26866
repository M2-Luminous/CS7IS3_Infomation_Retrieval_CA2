Participating in this operation were, on the Russian side, 180 officers and soldiers from the Russian Pacific fleet, and a large-to-medium sized landing fleet; and on the U.S. side, 250 Marines and a number of warships, including helicopter carriers and landing ships. The U.S. and Russian navies' joining forces with each other no doubt has drawn the world's attention. The U.S.-Russian joint military exercises were a simulated joint operation conducted by the two navies in order to carry out joint disaster relief missions in cases of natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, that might take place somewhere in the world. For this reason, both sides deployed landing ships, helicopters, and amphibious tanks to conduct the military exercises. The landing site was the Keleierke [0344 7191 1422 0344] Peninsula, 50 km to the south of Vladivostok. Both U.S. and Russian Marines carried out antidisaster and personnel-rescue exercises. This joint military maneuver was carried out according to some provisions of the U.S.-Russian memorandum on military cooperation which was signed last September. Although the central task of this military maneuver was confined to disaster-fighting missions, it was, after all, a joint military operation run by the two military superpowers, an event that would have been absolutely unimaginable in the past. The Two Superpowers Each Have Their Own Purposes in Military Cooperation Russia has been facing numerous economic difficulties following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but it remains a world-class military superpower. To be sure, this military maneuver was focused on joint disaster-fighting operations, but it still created an impression to the world that the two military superpowers are intending to join forces to dominate the world or to intervene in regional affairs when necessary. Russia itself does hope to work together with the United States and have a say in world affairs, as the United States does. Referring to the Korean nuclear issue, the United States recently pledged to press the Security Council to impose economic sanctions. In response to this, Russia reproached the United States for failure to consult it beforehand, and therefore it expressed discontent with the United States and voiced objection to the U.S. action. Russia's purpose is to fight for a say in world affairs which is equal to that enjoyed by the United States. Following the end of the Cold War, the world situation has been developing in a diversified manner. As far as diplomacy is concerned, Clinton has frequently flaunted his "strength," but the U.S. strength is not equal to its ambition. Either its hard-line diplomacy or tactic of using military force is ineffective in many cases -- in the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war, the Somali rebellion, the Rwanda civil war, the Haiti coups d'etat, and the Korean nuclear issue, for instance. The United States has been facing criticism, both at home and abroad, throughout the process of military intervention in Somali, from the deployment of U.S. troops to the pullout from the country. Being busy dealing with the economic crisis, today's Russia is much less influential than the Soviet Union of the past. As civil war burst out in the former Yugoslavia, the West repeatedly urged Russia to play a leading part in pressuring the militarily aggressive Serbs, but so far the West's appeals have been to no avail. The United States and Russia Are To Jointly Explore Space Technology Both military superpowers are experiencing a decline in their control over and influence in the world. Both sides wish to cooperate and support each other to seek a greater say in world affairs. On 21 June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev announced that Russia and the United States would jointly propose to the Security Council a bill on easing the nuclear crisis on the Korea Peninsula. This bill consists of a proposal to call an international conference and a scheme of stage-by-stage sanctions against Korea. The only new point in this bill lies in that it is a "U.S.-Russian cooperation project." The United States and Russia also have decided to step up scientific and technological cooperation in the areas of space exploration and environmental protection. As scheduled, Russian Premier Chernomyrdin, who will be on a visit to the United States, will attend an accord-signing ceremony on 23 June, by which the United States will join the space development plan to be run on Russia's Mir space station. "U.S.-Russian cooperation" may be extended to other fields in the future. It can be beneficial to both sides, and it also can be used, when necessary, to demonstrate to the world the intention of the United States and Russia to dominate the world, both militarily and politically.
