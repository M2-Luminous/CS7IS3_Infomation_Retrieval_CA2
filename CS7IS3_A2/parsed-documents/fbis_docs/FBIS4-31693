After our association with the European Union [EU], our membership of the Council of Europe, and our "enhanced" status in the Western European Union [WEU], Bulgaria's relations with NATO within the framework of the Partnership for Peace Initiative acquires particular importance, Dr. Zhelev said. Bulgaria has already signed the outline agreement and has committed itself to the process of seeking a higher degree of security, called security by all for all. Dr. Zhelev outlined the most important features of the initiative: The equality of the parties in their initial positions does not exclude, but presupposes a differentiation, close in time, between the Eastern European states according to their abilities to share responsibilities and fit into the NATO structures and mechanisms; the North Atlantic Alliance aims to internally reorganize and adapt itself to become a common system of security; within this system, the United States retains its participation in building European security, and the role of the WEU will be enhanced; and, lastly, the Partnership initiative in no way aims to isolate Russia, nor does it intend to favor Russia. Dr. Zhelev noted that for a number of years Bulgaria has been making immense efforts to change the nature of interstate relations in our region, directing them into a new channel; toward good-neighborliness, cooperation, stable development, the opening of borders, and real integration into the rest of Europe, due to which the ideas of the Partnership for Peace are in harmony with our own national interests. The president sees grounds for this in the following factors. First, now the Balkans are no longer split into blocs or divided along ideological lines; quite the reverse, the Balkan countries, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] included, accept the initiative. In this way we can avert the greatest danger for the region, namely the appearance of alliances -- "Orthodox or Pan-Slavic axes," an "Islamic crescent," and other configurations -- that in past history were the precursors of Balkan wars and disasters. Second, Bulgaria is surrounded by neighbors that are militarily superior to it in both absolute and relative terms, producing a tendency for the imbalance to become greater. It is precisely the PFP Initiative that will help to fill the "vacuum" in the sphere of regional balances. Bulgaria is also interested in mutually acceptable levels of the individual components of the military balance, in transparency, and in the application of the Treaty on Limiting Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, but measures in relation to the Balkans cannot be delayed; action is needed now, before it is too late! After speaking about the possibilities offered by the initiative to the Eastern European countries regarding access to Western markets, Dr. Zhelev urged Bulgarian companies, banks, and institutions to utilize these opportunities in the most rational manner, including in the struggle of the police and the investigation organs against organized crime, narcotics trafficking, and smuggling, by relying on partnership and professional cooperation within the framework of NATO. The president devoted special attention to the effect that the Partnership initiative will have on the reform of the Bulgarian Army, military science, and the country's defense potential. First, the Defense Ministry and the army command would gain indisputable benefit from the relevant NATO documentation -- in juridical matters, standardization, material and equipment supplies, communications, and management coordination. In the future, this cooperation may also extend to the fields of military production and the control of and trade in special products. Bulgaria sees possibilities for cooperating with NATO in training specialized units for missions under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE. The training of the officer corps also offers broad scope for cooperation, such as in special training courses at NATO centers and military schools, cooperation in training exercises, command staff exercises, and many national field and naval maneuvers. It is no accident that the plan of the Defense Ministry includes the "Breeze '94" naval exercise, with the participation of naval units from the U.S. 6th Fleet, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine, and Romania, and with observers also invited from Georgia. Bulgaria's armed forces are going through a difficult and demanding stage of profound reform, in both essence and scope, the aim of which is to maintain in peacetime a small, but high-quality army. Close cooperation with NATO is a precondition for reform to succeed and for the Bulgarian officers corps and all the military to make a worthy contribution to the democratic civic society. The president's speech was listened to with great interest by the capacity audience, which included representatives of parliament and the government and state institutions; ambassadors and military attaches; Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff; representatives of the Defense Ministry and senior officers of the armed forces; eminent Bulgarian intellectuals; and members of the Atlantic Club.
