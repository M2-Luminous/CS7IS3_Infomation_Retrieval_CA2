FR940627-0-00111 FR940627-0-00019 I. Introduction Over 2,300 fuels and 4,800 fuel additives were registered by EPA as of March 1994 and, to some degree, each of them produces emissions which may contribute to potentially harmful air pollution. The primary purpose of today's rule is to establish registration requirements which will provide information for identifying and evaluating the potential adverse effects of designated F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of related regulatory actions in the future as specified in section 211 of the CAA. Previous actions have implemented CAA sections 211(a) and 211(b)(1), which govern the general registration of F/FAs, as well as CAA section 211(f). Today's rule amends 40 CFR part 79 by adding regulatory provisions requiring the testing of F/FAs as a requirement for registration, as stipulated in section 211(b)(2) and section 211(e) of the CAA. In addressing these additional statutory provisions, this rule focuses on the identification and evaluation of potential adverse health effects associated with F/FA evaporative and combustion emissions. The required health effects evaluation is organized in a tiered structure, and includes emission characterization, literature search, and biological testing requirements. Although this testing framework focuses on the evaluation of health effects, F/FA manufacturers are also required to perform data searches to obtain information on the potential welfare effects of F/FA emissions. In addition, EPA will continue to use existing procedures under CAA section 211(f) for the evaluation of potential effects of F/FAs on ECS performance. The ultimate use of the registration information to be submitted in compliance with this rule is to guide EPA in potential future regulatory actions under CAA section 211(c). Section 211(c) provides authority for the possible control or prohibition of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission products cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Evidence of adverse effects of F/FA emissions on ECS performance, obtained under CAA section 211(f) or from other sources, could also be used by EPA to support such regulatory decisions. II. Background A. Legal Authority and Statutory History The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 U.S.C. section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive and prohibits manufacturers of designated fuels or additives from selling such products unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance with CAA section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic registration requirements, as stipulated by CAA section 211(b)(1), that included: commercial identifying information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition. Section 211(b)(2) of the CAA also gives EPA discretionary authority to establish additional registration requirements. According to this section, EPA ``may also require the manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive to conduct tests to determine potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive (including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions and determine their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on the public health and welfare. The statute further stipulates that testing for health effects is to be conducted according to procedures and protocols established by the Administrator, and that test results will not be considered confidential. Once the manufacturer has completed registration requirements and has given assurances that the Agency will be notified of future changes in that information, CAA section 211(b)(3) directs the Administrator to register the fuel or fuel additive. EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require testing of F/FAs under CAA section 211(b)(2) as part of the general registration regulations issued in 1975. However, in the CAA Amendments of 1977 (PL 95&hyph;95, August 7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) mandatory and contained additional provisions requiring the implementation of the regulations within one year of enactment of the CAA Amendments. In an effort to fulfill this requirement, EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in 1978 (see 43 FR 38607, August 29, 1978; Docket ORD&hyph;78&hyph;01). However, the rulemaking process did not go forward during the next ten years and the rule was not finalized. Nevertheless, this action remained on EPA's regulatory agenda and a development plan for the rulemaking was created in 1988. In 1989, a citizens group brought a lawsuit [ Thomas v. Browner, C.A. No. 89&hyph;6269 (D. Oreg. 1989)] challenging EPA's failure to promulgate F/FA testing regulations within the one- year deadline stipulated in CAA section 211(e). EPA entered into a Consent Decree in settlement of this lawsuit which, together with subsequent modifications, established the rulemaking schedule. Accordingly, a new ANPRM was published on August 7, 1990 (55 FR 32218) and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Public hearings as well as periods for written commentary followed both of these publications. On February 24, 1994, EPA published a Notice of Reopening of Comment Period (59 FR 8886) requesting public comment on several compliance-related and technical issues that needed clarification and/or reconsideration. Today's action culminates the rulemaking process by promulgating F/FA registration requirements under CAA sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e).
