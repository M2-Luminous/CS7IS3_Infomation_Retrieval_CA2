FR940817-2-00077 FR940817-2-00043 d. Bayesian Analyses. Another approach to deriving a substitute for a conventional LOAEL or NOAEL, which bears some resemblance to the BMD approach just described, is known as the Bayesian approach (see Appendix A). In essence, the Bayesian approach yields a distribution of concentrations (rather than a point estimate) associated with a specified effect. Some features of the BMD approach are common to the Bayesian approach: a mathematical model must be fit to the data, an effect level must be selected, and a confidence bound on the estimated concentration associated with a given effect level must be calculated (although the calculation procedures are different). If these choices are consistent with those for the BMD approach, the results are quite similar. By the Bayesian analysis, for a 10% increase in abnormal eye-hand coordination scores, the lower 90% credible set limit (roughly equivalent to the quantal BMDL 95% confidence limit 59 based on the estimated median concentration obtained with the quantal linear model is 73 μg/m3. Adjusting this value to a human equivalent concentration (HEC) and treating the result (26 μg/m3) as if it were a LOAEL(HEC), one may divide by a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations, and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL) and obtain an RfC estimate of 0.09 μg/m3. Similarly, the 5% effect level yields an RfC estimate of 0.1 μg/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100. Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian approach yields candidate RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1 μg/m3, essentially identical to the results of the benchmark analysis (Figure 1). 59 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it lends itself well to using continuous as well as dichotomous data. Although Roels et al. (1992) did not provide individual continuous data (i.e., actual raw scores instead of designations of normal/abnormal) on the performance of the workers in their study, they did report mean differences and standard deviations. With this information, it is possible to estimate the concentration at which certain effect levels would occur based on the Bayesian posterior distribution. For example, a 10% increase in the proportion of subjects with abnormal scores would be associated with a median concentration of 112 μg/m3, which has a lower 90% credible set limit of 90 μg/m3. Adjusting the latter value as if it were a LOAEL(HEC) yields a concentration of 32 μg/m3 and an RfC estimate value of 0.1 μg/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations, and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Note that these calculations based on continuous data essentially approximate the quantal BMD and Bayesian calculations for a 10% effect level based on dichotomous data (see Figure 1). Similar calculations for the actually observed difference (i.e., 13%) between the Mn-exposed and control workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study yield an RfC estimate of 0.2 μg/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 300 (including a factor of 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Calculating the concentration associated with the difference between the exposed and control mean values that just achieves statistical significance (a 4% difference in this case) also results in a candidate RfC value of 0.2 μg/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100 (eliminating the minimal LOAEL factor of 3). Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian analyses of continuous data yield candidate RfC estimates of 0.1 to 0.2 μg/m3. e. Summary of RfC Estimates. Figure 1 displays the current, verified RfC along with over 100 possible Mn RfC estimates based on various exposure measures, models, effects measures, and uncertainty factors. Not all of these RfC estimates are equally plausible or worthy of consideration in assessing the potential health risks associated with Mn inhalation exposure due to MMT usage. As discussed above, some combinations of the three exposure measures and six mathematical models fit one another better than other combinations. Based primarily on considerations of cumulative dose toxicity, statistical goodness-of-fit, and parsimony, ACRD and the quantal linear model appear to achieve the best results in this respect. Given the similarities of the benchmark and Bayesian analytic results using ACRD and the quantal linear model, little distinction can be made between the two analytic approaches in the present application. As for the results obtained for different effect levels, using a severity uncertainty factor of 3 with a 10% effect level (for either benchmark or Bayesian analyses) is essentially equivalent to using a severity UF of 1 with a 5% effect level. Note that the terms LOAEL and NOAEL do not actually correspond to the results for 10% and 5% effect levels, and therefore neither is preferable to the other in the sense that a NOAEL is preferable to a LOAEL in deriving an RfC. Therefore, benchmark and Bayesian results for 10% and 5% effect levels (using ACRD with the quantal linear model) are regarded as equally worthy of consideration here. These particular analyses yield Mn RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1 μg/m3. In general, continuous response data are preferred to dichotomized data, primarily because they provide more information and avoid the basically arbitrary division of effect measurements into categories (e.g., normal versus abnormal). The Bayesian analysis based on mean differences between exposed and control groups offers some of the advantages of using continuous data, in that the reported means and standard deviations (from Roels et al., 1992) provide a basis for estimating the distribution of continuous response measures. However, this use of continuous data is not immune to certain common problems, such as the issue of statistical power associated with studies of limited size, for the approaches calculating observed or just-statistically significant differences. Also, whereas the dichotomous data analyses yield more precision in estimating the effective concentration associated with a somewhat imprecise response variable, the continuous data analyses offer the opposite trade off (i.e., more precision in the response variable but less in the exposure estimate). Nevertheless, the continuous data analyses appear to merit consideration as well as the analyses based on dichotomous data. By the Bayesian analyses of continuous data, Mn RfC estimates of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 μg/m3 are obtained.
