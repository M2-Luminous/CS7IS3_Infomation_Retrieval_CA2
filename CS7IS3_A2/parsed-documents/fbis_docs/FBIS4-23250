Answering questions from newsmen in his office today on the outcome of the visit, Chief Ani denied claims that Nigeria allowed Cameroon to seize the initiative from her, in embarking on extensive diplomatic campaign to win support for its claim over the peninsula. He said that Cameroon's claim which is hinged on the Anglo-German Treaty of March 11, the only treaty which allegedly ceded the peninsula to her, could not stand because the said treaty was never ratified by the British Parliament. Chief Ani showed newsmen a photocopy of the Hansard of the British Parliament of July 1913, which showed that the treaty was never ratified, as debate on it was stalled because of a protest by the Obong of Calabar who sent a delegation to Britain during a debate on the issue. He reminded Cameroon that Nigeria once fought a civil war and could have no problem raising an army of 1 million men, adding, "but we want all forces of destruction to be turned into forces the peaceful resolution of the border dispute with our Cameroonian bothers." The minister said that Nigeria was ready to co-operate and work together with Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon for the exploitation of the resources available in the Gulf of Guinea. "Let us sit down as brothers and look at all the documents available to both sides on the Bakassi issue and on the basis of this, determine who actually owns the disputed territory," he said, adding if after then we are unable to agree we can take the matter to the OAU. Chief Ani said that Nigeria was ready to assist France to extricate itself out of the mess it (France) has found herself as a result of her direct involvement in the dispute on the side of Cameroon. He however warned that if France decided to remain intransigent and uncooperative, we reserve the right to take whatever step we deem fit to protect our interests.
