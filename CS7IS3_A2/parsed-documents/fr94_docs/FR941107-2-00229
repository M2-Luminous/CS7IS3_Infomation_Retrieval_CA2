Examples of such illnesses include: (1)␣Measles (2)␣Varicella (including disseminated zoster) (3)␣Tuberculosis Droplet Precautions In addition to Standard Precautions, use Droplet Precautions for patients known or suspected to have serious illnesses transmitted by large particle droplets. Examples of such illnesses include: (1)␣Invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, including meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and sepsis (2)␣Invasive Neisseria meningitidis disease, including meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis (3)␣Invasive multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae disease, including meningitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media (4)␣Other serious bacterial respiratory infections spread by droplet transmission, including: (a)␣Diphtheria (pharyngeal) (b)␣Mycoplasma pneumonia (c)␣Pertussis (d)␣Pneumonic plague (e)␣Streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, or scarlet fever in infants and young children (5) Serious viral infections spread by droplet transmission, including: (a)␣Adenovirus§ (b)␣Influenza (c)␣Mumps (d)␣Parvovirus B19 (e)␣Rubella Contact Precautions In addition to Standard Precautions, use Contact Precautions for patients known or suspected to have serious illnesses easily transmitted by direct patient contact or by contact with items in the patient's environment. Examples of such illnesses include: (1) Gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, or wound infections or colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria judged by the infection control program, based on current state, regional, or national recommendations, to be of special clinical and epidemiologic significance (2) Enteric infections with a low infectious dose or prolonged environmental survival, including: (a)␣ Clostridium difficile (b)␣For diapered or incontinent patients: enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella, hepatitis A, or rotavirus (3) Respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or enteroviral infections in infants and young children (4) Skin infections that are highly contagious or that may occur on dry skin, including: (a)␣Diphtheria (cutaneous) (b)␣Herpes simplex virus (neonatal or mucocutaneous) (c)␣Impetigo (d)␣Major (noncontained) abscesses, cellulitis, or decubiti (e)␣Pediculosis (f)␣Scabies (g)␣Staphylococcal furunculosis in infants and young children (h)␣Staphylococcal scaled skin syndrome (i)␣Zoster (disseminated or in the immunocompromised host) (5) Viral/hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (6) Viral hemorrhagic fevers (Lassa fever or Marburg virus) *See Appendix A for a complete listing of infections requiring precautions, including appropriate footnotes. Certain infections require more than one type of precaution. §See CDC Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities.23
