In order to successfully implement the SNPC resolution and the renovation, the political report reviews prominent achievements, weaknesses, and shortcomings; presents general conclusions on opportunities and dangers; provides guidance on the directions for national construction in the new developing period; outlines some major lines and measures; and further concretizes the socialist direction. I. Achievements and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Dangers 1. The political report presents three prominent achievements: -- The great achievement of primary significance is the fact that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The following are its major manifestations: Many stagnant and degrading fields have been overcome. The economic development rates have been fairly good and stable in the last three years. Inflation was limited to 5.2 percent in 1993. Economic relations have been broadened in a diversified and multilateral manner and annual export volume has increased about 20 percent. The economy began to have some internal savings. The multisectoral economic structure has been forming. The market- oriented mechanism under the state management in the socialist direction has become an operational structure for the national economy. The settlement of social issues and the implementation of social policies have been given more attention. People's lives in many cities and rural areas have been improved. -- The second important achievement is that political stability has been maintained and consolidated. The party role has been strengthened. State management efficiency has been further upgraded. Democracy has broadened and it has scored significant developing steps in line with the construction of the law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people. National defense and security have been safeguarded. The people's confidence in the party, the state, and renovation has been increased. The public movements in the economic and social fields have obtained some developing steps. -- The third achievement is that foreign relations have been broadened and our national reputation and position were enhanced, thus creating favorable international conditions for national construction and protection. All three aforementioned achievements are very important and inter-related. The mention of economic achievement first is reasonable and suitable to our renovation line, which places economic renovation first and considers it a central task. The great economic achievements contributed to overcome the socioeconomic crisis in a very important step, stabilized our politics, broadened our external relations, and safeguarded our national defense and security. 2. Shortcomings and newly arising problems: -- The economy still carries the characteristics of a backward agricultural economy with low productivity, quality, and efficiency. The industry is small with poor infrastructure. The ability to control inflation is not strong. The state-run economy and collective economy are slow in renovating and consolidating. And the market mechanism is in its preliminary stage and carrying many spontaneous elements. -- The fields of culture and society have recorded some achievements, but there are a lot of pressing problems which remain unsolved: unemployment, social injustice, education, culture, arts, health care, and corruption and smuggling. -- Political stability has been maintained, but complicated factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party and state organs have not been clean and strong. Some party members have become depraved politically and morally and loosened their vigilance and commitment in our chosen path. They remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints and sabotage activities by our enemies. Many party cadres and party members are still sluggish when it comes to self-education. They do not try to improve their character and understanding. Political stability is not totally stable, social order and safety are not safeguarded. 3. What are the opportunities and advantages? The national conference unanimously agreed on fundamental advantages: -- Our party has a correct line. The party is united and unanimous. Our people are industrious, intelligent, and patriotic. They are bravery, resolute, and confident in the party leadership. Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the people's revolutionary undertaking. -- The achievements of the renovation mainly shown in the three aforementioned achievements are creating new stature and strength for us. -- The development of the science technology revolution and the trend to broaden cooperation and development relations in the world and in the region are providing us with more important resources. The current opportunities are from advantages, internal achievements, and external conditions but they are mainly created by our people. They do not come by themselves. We have to grasp opportunities to move the country forward.
