The sites have confirmed to the Department that they will expand the targeted areas if it is necessary (for purposes of sufficient sample size) to attract more families to the demonstration. MTO Demonstration Agencies There are 14 local agencies playing administrative roles in the MTO demonstration; they are listed in Exhibit B.2. Of the 14, 10 will be reporting entities and are the potential respondents for these data collection instruments: the Participant Tracking Forms, the Participant Counseling Log (optional), the Program Cost Forms, and the Landlord Outreach Log. More specifically, the Participant Counseling Log and Landlord Outreach Log will only be used by the NPOs; the other instruments will be completed by both types of agency. Note that 4 of the 9 nonprofits shown in the exhibit are subcontractors to other nonprofits; for purposes of discussing respondent burden, in Part A13 above, it was indicated that data collection responsibilities lay with the prime nonprofit in each site.
