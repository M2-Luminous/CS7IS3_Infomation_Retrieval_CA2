How to Create Equilibrium in Vladivostok"] [Text] Vladivostok -- Many will remember the scandal that erupted over the former mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov. Our dialogue with the new mayor, Konstantin Borisovich Tolstoshein, began with an assessment of this situation. [Bratchikova] Tell me, did it not bother you that people would be doubly prejudiced when assessing your every step? Indeed the psychological background, to be frank, is very complex and the rumor mill tends to compare, to lay it on thick, to look for mercenary intentions.... [Tolstoshein] I am 42. I have managed in my time to work in various leading posts, so I was not particularly seeking power. I also know there is still plenty of life left in my batteries. Everyone got tired of the endless political wrangling a long time ago. I said as much to my staff when I arrived in city hall: If you want to engage in politics, join parties or movements; what is required of you here is action. What are you missing? Independence? Initiative? Please, take what you want, I'm not going to stop you. But first of all we have to establish equilibrium in the city. We agreed on that. Things were particularly disgraceful for our veterans and those who had fought in Afghanistan. Practically all the stores in the city had been privatized, but they had simply forgotten about these people, struck them off the list. Justice had to be restored. Ten or so extra retail outlets have been opened for their personal use and we want to win back through the courts the stores that were bought by fraudulent means.... Remember last winter -- the city nearly froze to death due to the lack of coal and petroleum products. The city managers, however, were shouting from the housetops: There is enough fuel... To prevent a repetition of this we embarked on preparations for next winter before the arrival of spring. [Bratchikova] So the economy began to recover swiftly... [Tolstoshein] Of course, you cannot solve everything in just over a month. But there are areas where we must not delay. For example, the fight against crime. We can increase the staffs of law-enforcement organs, give them more funds, and buy the latest technology and equipment. We began by giving guarantees that housing would be provided for everyone who needed it. Not only command personnel, but warrant officers and petty officers. The idea is not to recruit new people and teach them ways of combatting the mafia, but to keep those who have proved their worth, prevent them from going off in pursuit of "big bucks," and provide their families with the basics at least. [Bratchikova] How do you view the willingness of foreign countries -- neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region -- to give us humanitarian, economic, and other aid? Are we that poor and feeble? [Tolstoshein] I believe we have not yet been able properly to take advantage of the fact that Vladivistok has become an open port. Open to cooperation, to business partnership. Five consulates -- it must mean something! You don't even need to go to the countries they represent, since much can be agreed upon on the spot. You just have to effect a radical, 180-degree change in your attitude toward foreign economic activity -- I discussed this recently with the heads of leading enterprises in the city. There are things we can teach foreigners and we have our fair share of natural resources -- timber, fish, minerals. But we have a lot to learn from them, for example, construction organization, entrepreneurial methods, and business skills. For example, I am about to go to South Korea, where we will discuss the details of the joint construction of a regional business center in Vladivostok. They are providing the finance. We are providing a small plot of land in the city. Not forever, but on a 50-year lease. In a year's time we will have at our disposal a splendid, fully equipped modern center, which will help us organize small and medium-size business in the kray in a whole new way. [Bratchikova] There was a big agricultural fair in Vladivostok recently. At it people were able to buy at rock-bottom prices food, agricultural equipment for work on subsidiary plots, and much else. Is this a once-only event or do you intend to continue to revive these fine, but forgotten traditions in the city? [Tolstoshein] By means of the fair you are talking about we were not only doing battle with the middlemen, we were also demonstrating that the Maritime Kray countryside is not impoverished, that it is possible, indeed essential to work with it on mutually advantageous terms. We will continue to develop this kind of open trade in squares. In the next few days we will be holding a fish fair, where we will be offering citizens fresh fish and other absolutely fresh seafood they have been longing for... So there are many plans, and I hope they will be implemented.
