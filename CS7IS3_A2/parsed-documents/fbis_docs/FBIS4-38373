This was stated at a news conference in Beijing today by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, on the second day of his visit to the PRC. The prime minister said that the visit by the Chinese leader should take place in September. It was proposed that on his way to Moscow, Jiang Zemin should visit one of Russia's regions, most probably one in the Far East. We regard the forthcoming meeting of the leaders of the two states as very important, Chernomyrdin stated. He added that the conversation that he had had today with Jiang Zemin had been rich in content and very interesting. What we have done represents great progress in the development of our relations, he stressed, summing up the results of the two days of his visit to the PRC. The head of the Russian Government noted the "smooth development" of links between the two countries and stressed that the main stratum of Russian-Chinese relations has not yet been reached and the sides are only now approaching it. Chernomyrdin pointed out that the reduction in the volume of bilateral trade in the first quarter of this year was a temporary phenomenon caused by objective as well as subjective factors. However, there are no grounds for saying that anything serious has occurred and the situation will be put right before the end of the year. Comparing the progress of economic reform in China and Russia, the chairman of the Russian Government noted that it was similar in many respects. Any differences were explained by different potential and different conditions. The PRC is pursuing socialist economic reforms, while we are carrying out economic reforms that have a social thrust, he said. The reforms in China began earlier and there was no shock therapy. In Russia, however, the situation is different. We began with shock therapy. It could not be done any other way. That much is clear, the prime minister stressed. He believes that in future there will be more similarities than differences in the implementation of reform in Russia and China. Referring to China's place in Russian foreign policy, Chernomyrdin noted that relations between Russia and the PRC influence the entire situation in the Asian-Pacific region. I do not think that any issues in the Asian-Pacific region could be discussed or resolved without the participation of these two states, he added. He said that China's growing weight in Asia and its' ties with the states of Central Asia did not worry Russia at all.
