MacArthur] [Text] The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) is currently breeding a large number of tsetseflies for a biological control programme to check tsetsefly infestation in the country. The commission, at the moment, has more than 10,000 adult females, a number of males and over 23,000 pupae in its laboratories which are being used to reproduce males for the project. Dr. (Mrs.) Delphina Aba Ababie-Gomez, Head of the Department of Animal Sciences at the GAEC, who made this known to the GRAPHIC explained that under the programme, an irradiation facility -- a Cobalt 60 Gamma source -- which is being installed at the commission will be used to sterilise the insects, particularly the males. Sufficient numbers of the sterile males, she said, will then be released in critically infested areas to overwhelm the population of the insects in the wild. When the females in the wild mate with the sterile males, no offsprings will be produced, resulting in reduction in the tsetsefly population. The biological control programme, the sterile insect technology is being undertaken by the commission in collaboration with the Veterinary Services Division of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture at Pong Tamale and the Animal Research Institute of the Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). It is being supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency based in Vienna, Austria. Dr. Adabie-Gomez said when the tsetsefly population is reduced, it will lead to a reduction in the incidence of trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which affects man and animals in the country. She further explained that a reduction in the population of the insect in critically infested areas would enable the country to reclaim the land for human settlement, agriculture and other socio-economic purposes. She disclosed that some lands in the oncho-free areas of the Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions are not being fully utilised at the moment because of tsetsefly infestation. Parts of Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern and Volta regions are also endemic, she added. Dr. Adabie-Gomez hinted that a limited number of sterile females will be released for dynamic population studies in three sites in the White Volta and Nabogo River basins of the Northern Region from April to July next year. The releases will be done monthly. The release of the sterile adult males, she said, will begin around August next year during the rainy season in the Northern Region.
