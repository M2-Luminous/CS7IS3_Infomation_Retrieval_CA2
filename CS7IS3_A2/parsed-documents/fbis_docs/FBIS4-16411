Chikvaidze said it was slow progress even though nothing had been lost and hope remained for breaking the logjam in Georgian-Abkhazian relations. Chikvaidze said Georgia and other countries could share many thoughts on the draft convention on the rights of ethnic minorities. Expert teams would have to work much before the convention could be signed, he said. On Thursday the Commonwealth's Council of Foreign Ministers decided the document was not yet ready for signing. Chikvaidze stressed that Georgia wanted more integration with the Commonwealth of Independent States and would be working to achieve this. Integration was essential primarily from the point of view of economics. Georgia would try to keep its policies for Russia and other Commonwealth republics balanced with a view to promote good relations between the Georgians and Russians and other peoples. Chikvaidze felt economic cooperation between Georgia and Russia would expand. Expanded cooperation and subsequent economic growth could well lead to the exchange of Georgian coupons for Russian rubles, said Chikvaidze and cited the example of Belarus.
