The day before, the investigation presented formal charges in the final wording to the accused and his attorney, and made available to them four volumes of the criminal investigation. Fishkov is currently being charged under three articles: 172-a--"Negligence;" 88-1--"Illegal foreign currency operations;" and the recently introduced 170-1--"Abuse of official position." Let us recall that Aleksandr Fishkov, who was responsible for conducting voucher auctions in the Property Fund, was arrested on 7 October of last year during an interrogation at the GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs] administration for combating economic crimes. The cause for initiating criminal proceedings was the discovery that the fund was short 13,500 privatization vouchers. Property fund employees in positions of responsibility were unable to explain how such a quantity of vouchers had disappeared from the fund; whether they had been canceled or not; and, generally, whether these vouchers had physically existed or had only been recorded in documents. Soon after Fishkov's arrest, however, privatization vouchers and this official's activities in the fund quickly ceased being the main subject of his interrogations. Most of all, law enforcement organs were interested in a dacha in Repino settlement, purchased with Fishkov's parents' money. The prosecution insists that Aleksandr Fishkov paid for the dacha in cash in foreign currency and hence violated existing legislation. The Oktyabrskiy Rayon People's Court twice declined the defense attorney's petition to change the measure to secure the appearance of the accused to a pledge not to leave town--in October last year and January this year. In both instances the court cited as the main argument for its ruling the presence in the charges of the "grave" Article 88 and Fishkov's high position before his arrest. Since the completion of the preliminary investigation is the time to summarize the initial results, one cannot fail to note the investigation time frame, which set a record by current standards. These days not every criminal case involving petty theft can be squeezed into four months. As to sensational cases--of which there have been quite a few lately--they drag on, as a rule, for more than a year. The "grave" Article 88 permitted them to extend the investigation in Fishkov's case for up to a year and a half. Moreover, even the city procurator could authorize a six-month investigation term, without having to go Moscow for permission. Nevertheless, the investigator asked for only four months, got it with no problem, and--completed it on time. The official explanation for such unprecedented vigor is obvious: The investigator chooses the time frame at his discretion. Keeping in mind, however, that the accused languishes in jail, it is in the interests of operative services, as a rule, to drag it out. The "client" is right there; you can work with him at an unhurried pace. The longer he stays there, the worse his psychological state of mind and the greater the chance of obtaining new interesting information from him. The only explanation of the "Fishkov phenomenon" worth looking at is in the area of political considerations. The criminal case against Fishkov occurred at the time of another round of radical changes in the disposition of forces on the political scene. What was topical four months ago may possibly produce completely the reverse effect today, or lose significance altogether. Before the October armed clash the opposing forces actively looked for compromising materials on each other. Suffice it to recall the Yakubovskiy theme that was a permanent fixture in newspapers. The special services turned to Fishkov, too--already under arrest--in search of this kind of compromising material. They were interested, among other things, in one of the most active people on Chubays' team--Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of State Property. Another discovery that came out of the "Fishkov case" was the fact that the office and home telephones of the property fund's top officials had been wiretapped. Authorization issued by the supervising procurator is dated March of last year. Fishkov was among the persons whose telephones had been tapped. There was, for instance, a recording of Fishkov's conversation with Aleksandr Kokh, former deputy chairman of the committee for the administration of city property. In response to Fishkov's justified argument that the property fund was not prepared to conduct privatization auctions and his proposal not to rush it, the interlocutor assures him that everything would be fine and insists on keeping up the pace of privatization. Several weeks later Fishkov would be sitting in a preliminary investigative detention facility on charges of negligence. An important circumstance that draws one's attention is that if we agree with the prosecution's position, Fishkov's "criminal actions" began at the earliest in the summer of last year. In particular, the payment in foreign currency for the dacha in Repino--assuming it did indeed take place--happened in June, and the loss of the vouchers--in September. At the same time, the special services had by then been authorized several months earlier to listen in to property fund employees' telephone conversations. Let us point out that they have to present sufficient cause in order to have wiretaps authorized. In other words, if a certain person is under suspicion and this suspicion has grounds, the procurator has the right to authorize covert surveillance, including wiretaps. It is not known what kind of sufficient cause the special services had with respect to the property fund almost a year ago. Wiretaps on Fishkov's telephones also brings up at least two more questions. If we assume that the disappearance of the vouchers from the property fund was a result of someone's machinations, a regular wiretap on telephone conversations should easily have produced an answer as to where and how the privatization vouchers had disappeared. However, to our best knowledge, the investigation does not have an answer to this question. In addition, according to the investigation's version, the transfer of foreign currency as payment for the dacha was done in Fishkov's office at the property fund. The subject of transferring such a large amount of money would inevitably have cropped up in private conversations. However, wiretap materials do not confirm this fact in any way, and the entire case against Fishkov under Article 88--"foreign currency dealings"--is built only on the testimony of the other participant in the deal--the seller of the dacha. In an article entitled "The Roulette Wheel Stopped on Black" (NEVSKOYE VREMYA 8 December of last year) on the subject of the "Fishkov case" we looked in great detail into the circumstances related to the charges against Fishkov on "foreign currency dealings." The first item that raised questions then was why the charge of violating foreign currency operations had been brought only against Fishkov, since the law envisages the responsibility of both participants in a foreign currency deal. Moreover, the investigation has in its possession a document showing that Mr. K.--the dacha seller--was loaning foreign currency out with interest, that is, not only conducting foreign currency deals but also making a profit from them. No charges have been brought against Mr. K., however; moreover, he was not even asked to sign a pledge not to leave town. At that time we advanced the hypothesis that Mr. K., who was planning to move permanently to America, would definitely leave Russia without waiting for Fishkov trial. Two weeks later, in December of last year, the main witness in the Fishkov case, Mr. K., indeed moved to America permanently, and there is practically no chance of getting him to appear at the upcoming trial. Most likely the court will not hear the first-hand testimony of this man and will have to make a ruling on this part of the charges exclusively on the basis of the preliminary investigation materials.
