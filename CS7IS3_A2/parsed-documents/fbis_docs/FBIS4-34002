Menem, addressing the heads of state and government who are attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, also defended his state reform policy as a means of fostering development. The Argentine president delivered his message after calling for a 10-minute recess that was granted by host President Cesar Gaviria, despite the delays that are piling up on the summit's agenda. "The economic deterioration process will be irreversible if policies are not guided by a democratic government," Menem underscored in an apparent response to the previous message by Cuban leader Fidel Castro. After explaining that "it is not my intention to meddle in the affairs of other countries," Menem said that "politics, the art of the possible, and socially projected economics, should not be contemplated separately because they complement each other." The "profound" state reform that was set in motion in Argentina "has not only strengthened the state's role but has been an efficient weapon in combating corruption," he said. Menem said that each of the large Argentine Government institutions that were turned over to national and foreign private investment "were true monuments to corruption." Carlos Menem pointed out that he will ask the Ibero-American heads of state and government to "join him in a campaign to defend life." "For me, life begins at the moment of conception, but we will discuss that at our work meetings," concluded Menem, who wants the summit to speak out against abortion.
