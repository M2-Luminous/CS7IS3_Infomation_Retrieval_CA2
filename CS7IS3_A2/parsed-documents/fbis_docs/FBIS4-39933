Conference with Leaders of Organs of Representative Power of Components of Russian Federation Held in Federation Council"] [Text] The main areas of cooperation between the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly and the components of the Russian Federation in such areas as economic reform, the strengthening of federalism, and the elaboration of nationalities policy and a new regional strategy were discussed at the conference. Participating in the conference were Vladimir Shumeyko, Ivan Rybkin, leaders of committees and commissions of the Federation Council and the State Duma, vice premiers of the government, ministers, representatives of the president's staff and the Central Electoral Commission, leaders of all-Russian and interregional unions and associations, and scientists. Following the discussion and the adoption of the final document, the Coordinating Council for Cooperation Between the Chambers of the Federal Assembly and Organs of Representative Power of the Components of the Russian Federation was elected. Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out at the conference that the process of political stabilization is growing in Russia and is based on the Constitution, the strengthening of the organs of representative power, and the Treaty on Civil Peace and Accord signed by the country's main political forces. At the same time, Shumeyko emphasized, two extremes can be ruinous to Russia: Both overestimation of the significance of the regions' autonomy and underestimation of the role of the center. "The actual political decision that can be made today," the chairman of the Federation Council emphasized, "is the adoption of the budget." It is his firm conviction that the budget must determine policy in the state. Vladimir Shumeyko once again advocated increasing expenditure on the Army and the military-industrial complex.
