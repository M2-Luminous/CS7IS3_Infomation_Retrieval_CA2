"But we have to know what the facts are, and we will be attempting to determine that," Clinton told NBC program "Today". Former President Jimmy Carter said in Washington yesterday he thought that the crisis with the DPRK is over and there are "no unanswered questions" following his talks with DPRK leaders on how to resolve the nuclear crisis. "If North Korea wishes to talk and is willing to freeze their nuclear program," Clinton said, "then that would be a step forward." "Now we have to verify that. So that's the question," Clinton stressed. In answering a question, Clinton said that "I think what we have to do is to look to the present and the future and say we will evaluate words in terms of actions." Clinton believed that the United States has the capacity, if the international inspectors and the monitoring equipment are going to be left in the DPRK, to evaluate whether the DPRK's nuclear program has been frozen.
