It was organized by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters. This time the assistance is intended for a Russian community of dukhobortsy [a religious sect which opposed the Orthodox Church] which settled in the south of Georgia more than 150 years ago. To carry out agricultural work, they will be supplied with 200 tons of gasoline and diesel fuel carried on 50 trucks. In the opinion of the First Deputy Ministry for Emergencies Yuriy Vorobyev, this action must raise the morale of all of our countrymen who find themselves in difficult economic conditions outside the borders of Russia.
