This achievement is a major advance for domestic fiber optic sensor utilitarian testing technology. The system's main performance indicators match those of advanced foreign-made early-90s products, and the indicator for temperature stability exceeds that for comparable foreign-made early-90s products. The prototype system, built at the 1987 request of the Shanghai Electric Machine Plant and completed by UESTC in October 1991, was used in a successful experimental test of vibration at the ends of the stator windings in the 300 mW and 125 mW turbogenerators at the Shanghai plant, and passed technical appraisal at that time. The YM1000 system, a digitized, modular, ``smart'' second-generation system developed upon the prototype, has been used in a successful vibration test of the stator winding ends in the 12 mW turbogenerator at the Eastern Electric Machine Plant and in measurement tests done at the China Institute of Testing and Metrology.
