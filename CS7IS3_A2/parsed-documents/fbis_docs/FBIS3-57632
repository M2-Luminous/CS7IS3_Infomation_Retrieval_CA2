In his interview to INTERFAX, Sergeyev, who is accompanying the Russian prime minister on his visit to Italy visit, described the quote which was published in the Italian newspaper as a rather annoying misunderstanding. Such methods can play into the hands of those who are not happy about Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin working together on forming a government capable of continuing the course of reforms, the head of the Russian government press service noted.
