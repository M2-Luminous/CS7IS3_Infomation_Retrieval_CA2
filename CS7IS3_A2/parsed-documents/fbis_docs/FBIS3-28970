Former Ambassador Howard Dee told reporters in Malacanang that he will consult with peace advocates to explore avenues to save the talks from collapsing. But he asked the warring factions in the communist underground to stop dragging government officials into their conflict. "We cannot talk on the basis of an environment where we are being threatened with physical harm, not the panel itself but government officials, institutions that they have threatened," Dee said. "So when they (communist rebels) are ready, they can always come to tell us that they want to talk. It takes two to tango. You cannot force them to come to us," he said. [passage omitted]
