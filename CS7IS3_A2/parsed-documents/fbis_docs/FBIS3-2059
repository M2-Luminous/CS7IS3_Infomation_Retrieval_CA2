From his deeds, people may feel the soaring aspiration of a son of the Chinese people who is determined to serve his nation and the brilliant dedicated spirit of a Communist Party member. At the ordinary work post of loading and unloading ships, Bao Qifan loved his job and became an expert in this trade. He successfully added modern additions to this time-honored trade. While making contributions to the development of modern science and technology, he also successfully developed himself and realized the sublimation of his life value. The practice of making painstaking efforts in difficult conditions to do a pioneering job fostered his profound love toward his great motherland and his fellow workers, aroused his soaring aspirations for reinvigorating China, and strengthened his consciousness of giving play to the vanguard exemplary role of a Communist Party member. He not only faithfully performed his duties at his work post but also strove to make selfless contributions. He maintained and carried forward Lei Feng's spirit. The great era of reform and opening creates an extremely good opportunity for the regeneration and reinvigoration of their nation, and also for Chinese people to display their talent and ability in serving their motherland. The times call for the appearance of a new generation of people with a lofty ideal, moral integrity, good education, and a sense of discipline, who will cherish, grasp, and properly use this opportunity, who will master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and who will make new achievements in conscientiously practicing the party's basic line and building material and spiritual civilization. Bao Qifan is precisely an outstanding representative of such a new generation of people. He represents the spirit of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and he conscientiously resists money fetishism, hedonism, and extreme egoism. His noble character should be introduced to and emulated by the whole nation. To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his lofty ideal and firm belief in communism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "In the past, we continued to work and struggle in extremely difficult conditions a number of decades, and we relied on the firm belief of uniting the people and encouraging them to fight for their own interests. Without such belief, we shall have no rallying force and shall have nothing." Making the people better off and the country strong and realizing communism is the objective and historical mission of the CPC, and is also the mental pillar for the Chinese people to exert themselves to overcome difficulties and strive for a better live. Bao Qifan could stand the test of the difficulties in acquiring knowledge and could resist the enticement of material lust. He firmly adhered to a correct course in his life, because he never gave up the lofty ideal and belief, and gained mental strength from such ideals and beliefs, thus advancing in the forefront of the reform tide and marching into the palace of modern science and technology step by step and making great contributions to the nation and the people. To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his master spirit of setting great score by the state and collective interests. Bao Qifan could make unusual contributions at his work post, maintain a worker's determination when facing good offers, and use the grab buckets he invented to recover wealth of several million yuan for the Shanghai Harbor but not to reap even one cent for himself, precisely because he has the strong sense of responsibility. This is a powerful counter to the behavior of seeking private gain at the expense of public and state interests appearing in society. To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his pioneering spirit of making progress, seeking knowledge, and participating in reform. To realize socialist modernization in our country, we must not let the extremely good opportunity slip, and should study hard and work in a down-to-earth manner. We should make unceasing efforts to make progress. Young people and intellectuals with lofty aspirations should model thenmselves on Bao Qifan, and strive to acquire real knowledge and abilities and to render meritorious service. They should take this as a mission given by the times. To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his selfless spirit. Making selfless contribution is the character of Communist Party members, and is also an admirable value in any society. Advocating and carrying forward such a dedicated spirit is our party's responsibility and also its advantage. Bao Qifan faithfully honored the pledge he made when joining the party and cherished the morality of a party member. He did not claim credit for himself, always cared about the masses, and safeguarded the image of a Communist Party member. All Communist Party members should behave like him and conscientiously take the dedicated spirit as the orientation of social values. Thus, in the conditions of a market economy, there will not only be attractive competition but also the warmth of making selfless contributions in our society; the economy will become vigorous and interpersonal relations will become warm. Bao Qifan is a model appearing in the period of reform and opening. We should emulate and give publicity to his deeds and spirit, and should, like him, make our youth relish the course of creation and make our lives sublime in the course of dedication!
