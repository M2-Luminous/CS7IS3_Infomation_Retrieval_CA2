Addressing a reception in the Great Hall of the People, Hu, on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, extended Spring Festival greetings to retired officials throughout the country. Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee, said that 1994 is a year "crucial" to the success of China's reform, opening up and modernization drive. To accomplish this year's reforms and economic construction tasks, it is imperative to follow the party's ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and the party's work line of relying on the masses, Hu told the 2,000 in attendance. The reception was sponsored jointly by the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Hu, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party Central Committee, said that by relying on and forging close ties with the people, and mobilizing all positive factors in society, "we will certainly be able to surmount all difficulties on our road forward." The leader praised retired officials for their historic contributions toward victory in the new democratic revolution, the establishment of the socialist system, the development of socialism, and the promotion of reform, opening up, modernization and China's prosperity. He also called on them to continue supporting various undertakings of the reform and construction and helping younger officials to assume positions of greater responsibility. According to Hu, China now has more than seven million retired party and government officials. Party committees and government bodies at all levels must strengthen their leadership of work among these officials, he noted. He pledged to establish and perfect a social insurance system for retired officials in the course of instituting new reform measures. He also stressed the importance of taking proper measures to help these officials overcome the difficulties in their livelihood, so that they will be able to enjoy their later years.
