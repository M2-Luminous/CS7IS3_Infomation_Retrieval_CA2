Jasray, made a speech about the course of realization of the government programme for 1994. In his speech, he outlined in few words the socioeconomic situation in the country. As he said, wintering and breeding of cattle are going on relatively well, and if such a state of things remains further, so in the current year in the country 8.2 million heads of young cattle can be raised. At the same time, there are difficulties in carrying out the spring field works in consequence of the fact that agricultural technical fleet is not ready for sowing, and financial situation in agricultural units remains complicated. In industry the volume of production of goods has dropped by 1.6 percent, compared with the same period of the last year. Increased is production of 16 kinds of goods out of 60 main kinds of goods, including production of concentrated copper has increased by 75 percent, concentrated copper has increased by 75 percent, concentrated molybdenum by 2 times, lime and fluorspar by 11-28 percent, leather and knitted wear by 66-70 percent, and carpets and cashmere articles by 5-5.6 percent. The main problems producers are facing now, as the prime minister said, are lack of financial means, absence of a market for sale of finished articles, misfirings in electric energy supply, and the fact that reconstructions are not finished. As the prime minister said, cases of breakdown and damages at electric power stations, misfirings in electric energy supply, which have become frequent, are connected with irresponsibility of definite persons. In connection with this, the prime minister announced that officials who are guilty of creation of such a situation should bear the responsibility for this. External trade turnover in the first two months of the current year, said P. Jasray, has reached 52.2 million U.S. dollars, having a positive balance worth 24 million U.S. dollars. In the same period the state budget incomes have constituted 8.9 billion tugriks, when expenses constituted 11.9 billion tugriks. Thus, the budget expense volume turned out to be by 2 billion tugriks lower than the planned level. But, said the prime minister, because of the lack of means we failed to realize financing worth 3.7 billion tugriks. The centralized state budget losses constituted 1.5 billion tugriks. According to the data of Mongol Bank, by 1 March, the volume of outbank money turnover constituted 8.5 billion tugriks. In the last months, said the prime minister, a tendency for reduction of increase of prices and inflation for their stabilization is to be observed. Market is being provided with goods normally. As the prime minister said, since the beginning of the current year a tendency for reduction of the national currency rate is appearing. But this fluctuation should be considered as a normal thing for a market economy. Mongol Bank has sufficient currency reserves for carrying out intervention to market in case of need. Summing up this part of his speech, the government head appraised the present economic situation as positive. In his view, market relations are extending, relative stability on the main macro- showings is being marked. [sentence as received] In the second part of his speech, the Mongolian premier spoke about the main directions of socioeconomic policy of the government for the current year.

Among them there are restoration of national industrial potential with assistance of mechanisms of the state market regulation, priority development of infrastructure, light and oil industries, private sector of economy, and food supply of the population.
