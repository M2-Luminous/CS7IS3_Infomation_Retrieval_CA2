But "the government is still not clear on how to accomplish that." "If it were not for last year's strikes, the government or parliament would not have to raise taxes," Minister Kolodko said during a meeting with regional press journalists. "Those who decide to be on strike must know that they do it at the cost of those who work hard at the very same time." The new chief of finance is eager to see a comprehensive tax law and banking law: "We must continue to send messages to business people that it pays to invest and that they will have to overcome fewer unnecessary problems in the future," Kolodko said yesterday. He also announced that there are no plans to raise the rates of indirect taxes (VAT [value-added tax], the excise tax, and customs duties). But he wants to have a situation where more companies than now would pay taxes, with all types of breaks and waivers being documented exclusively with VAT receipts. This would limit the economic "gray area." Minister Kolodko also anounced that monies for 20,000 job openings in the customs police will be found in the near future, and "then we will get real serious on that." Tax obligations due from enterprises will be collected with more efficiency: "We will act much the same way as the mighty ones from the London or Paris Club act with relation to Poland." Minister Kolodko intends to change the principles of the zloty's devaluation "sooner rather than later"--the dollar will get more expensive at a slower rate (the monthly rate right now is 1.6 percent). According to Kolodko, this would reduce the inflation rate. Minister Kolodko does not plan to make any amendments to this year's budget, despite the fact that revenue is higher by a few trillion zlotys [Z] compared with initial plans, because he fears that "there may occur a reversal of the situation." Kolodko believes that, in three years' time, he will manage to foster a significant reduction in the budget deficit--that is, to a level of about 2 percent of the GDP. This year's Budget Law provides that the budget deficit will be Z83 trillion, which is about 4.1 percent of the GDP. Kolodko also portrays himself as "a fervent enthusiast of privatization." But he expressed criticism of privatization policies conducted by recent governments because "enterprises were sold too cheaply and, because of that, the state budget was losing 5 percent of the GDP per year."
