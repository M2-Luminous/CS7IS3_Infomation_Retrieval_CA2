IF Note: More than 95 percent of Moldovans voted in favor of the country's statehood and sovereignty in the Sunday poll as compared to a mere 2 percent who were against. 2.6 percent of ballot papers were invalidated. 1.8 Mn people or 75.1 percent of those eligible to vote were involved in the poll to answer a single question: "Do you agree that Moldova should develop as an independent, integral and indivisible state within the borders that existed on June 23, 1990 (the day it proclaimed independence from Moscow) and pursuing neutral policies, maintaining cooperation with all other countries and guaranteeing its citizens equal rights in keeping with international law". Leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [ADP] Aurel Tolmatskiy believes the poll results create a solid basis for the new parliament's activity. In an interview with Interfax, he said "the need to consult the nation on key issues of the republic's development so as to put an end to the manipulation of public opinion is long overdue". Tolmatsky said the poll results were an indication that most people were supportive of the policy aimed at consolidating the republic's statehood, independence and integrity. He stressed that this was completely in line with the position taken by his party which won 55 out of 104 seats in the new parliament in last month's election, while the Sunday poll reaffirmed support to ADP policies. On Snegur's suggestion on giving the poll the status of a referendum, Tolmatskiy said the new legislature might well adopt such a resolution. However, he said that this in itself was less important than learning the real mood on the ground so as to get on with the work in hand by leaning upon the nation's support.
