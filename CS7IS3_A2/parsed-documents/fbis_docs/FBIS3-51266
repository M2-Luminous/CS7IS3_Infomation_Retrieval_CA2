"National" newscast was the first to arrive at the scene. Here is a report by J.J. Pinilla. [Pinilla] The attack took place at 0805 [1305 GMT], when Minister Rudolf Hommes was on his usual trip from his home to his office in midtown Santa Fe de Bogota. One policeman was wounded. The charge, consisting of over 10 kg of ammonal, was placed at the base of a lamppost on 26th Street and 5th Avenue and detonated by remote control. Following the explosion, the minister's driver continued on for another block despite the fact that one of the car's tires was flat. They stopped at the Santa Monica Hotel, where Hommes Rodriguez left the vehicle and was taken to his office in another vehicle.

[Reporter] How did you react when the bomb exploded? [Molano] I put on the brakes because the lamppost fell on top of the bus. That is all I saw. Smoke filled the bus. [end recording] [Pinilla] The severity of the attack was lessened thanks to the skill of the minister's driver, who never stopped the vehicle despite the explosion.
