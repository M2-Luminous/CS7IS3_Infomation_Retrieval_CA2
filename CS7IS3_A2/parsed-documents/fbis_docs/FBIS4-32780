Bermudez' article, titled "March Over Ashes," refers to the so-called Doomsday Project, a product of the Cold War that still exists. The project allocates $8 billion to protect the lives of high-ranking U.S. leaders in case of a nuclear conflict that would practically eliminate all traces of life in the world. The plan involves large columns of armored vehicles crossing U.S. territory to avoid Soviet nuclear warheads, establishing communications via satellite, and being the only survivors on Earth, ruling the world that would reportedly remain, it adds. The plan also includes the creation of several hundred special operations commandos to protect the aforementioned columns, "which would march with their valuable cargo of leaders and `daddy's boys' over the ashes of the very same people who had made such a miracle possible with their ingenuous contributions," it adds. Later, the article says that, despite the supposed end of the Cold War, most of this fictitious and diabolical structure still prevails, although THE NEW YORK TIMES said it has been canceled. Bermudez said this should become a reality so the resources can be used to mitigate the hardships that paradoxically are still on the rise in the richest country of the world -- where unemployment, social abandonment, vice, and mendicancy increase along with economic growth.
