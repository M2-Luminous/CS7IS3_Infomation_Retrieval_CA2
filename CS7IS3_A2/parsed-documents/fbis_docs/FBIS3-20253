Yesterday the Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to inform him that Movahed is not welcome in Norway because of activities that are incompatible with his diplomatic status. "The expulsion has nothing to do with the Nygaard [Salman Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, recent target of a murder attempt] affair. I cannot comment on what lies behind this reaction," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said. Hans Olav Ostgaard, the head of the surveillance police, had only this to say: "The surveillance police does not comment on matters like this." Yesterday no one at the Iranian Embassy in Oslo was willing to comment to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA. As far as Ingvar Havnen is aware this is the first time that an Iranian diplomat has been expelled from Norway. It is true that there have been diplomatic difficulties between Norway and Iran in the past, but these have never gotten as far as expulsion. Havnen said that he sees no reason for Iran to expel Norwegian diplomats at the embassy in Tehran by way of reprisal.
