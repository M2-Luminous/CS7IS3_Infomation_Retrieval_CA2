FR941219-2-00109 FR941219-2-00067 Mr. Heine is the majority shareholder of Frankenmuth, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Frankenmuth manufactures beer and ale both under its own labels as well as under private labels. 2. The Trustees request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Loan to Frankenmuth under the terms and conditions described herein. Frankenmuth proposes to use the loan proceeds towards purchasing the Property which will be used for Frankenmuth's administrative offices. 3. The Loan will be in a principal amount of $84,667. The applicant states that at no time will the amount of the Loan represent more than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. The Loan will be secured by a first deed of trust on the Property, which consists of a 1,250 square foot improved commercial building and the underlying land. The Property is located at 435 South Main Street, Frankenmuth, Michigan. The deed of trust will be duly recorded in Saginaw County to reflect the Plan's security interest in the Property. In addition, Frankenmuth will insure the Property against casualty loss and designate the Plan as the loss payee of such insurance. 4. The Loan will have a ten-year term and will be evidenced by a promissory note (the Note). The Note will require Frankenmuth to make monthly payments of principal and interest which will be fully amortized over the ten-year term. Interest will accrue on the Loan at 11.5 percent per annum. The Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, fees or other expenses in connection with the Loan. As a condition of the proposed exemption, the terms and conditions of the Loan must be at least as favorable to the Plan as those which the Plan could obtain in dealing at arm's length with an unrelated party. In this regard, NBD Bank, N.A. (NBD), an unrelated entity in Troy, Michigan, states in a letter, dated September 22, 1994, that NBD would make a secured loan of $84,667 for an initial term of five years with a fifteen-year amortization schedule allowing for a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year. At the end of the first five years, NBD would approve a new five-year note with a ten-year amortization schedule. At the end of the tenth year, NBD would then approve a five-year note with a five-year amortization schedule. Interest would accrue within a range of 9.25 percent to 11.5 percent per annum, fixed or floating. In addition, NBD states that it would charge Frankenmuth a loan fee of one percent or $846. Accordingly, the applicants represent that Frankenmuth will pay a loan fee of $846 to the Plan at the inception of the Loan. 5. The Property was appraised by Lewis H. Weiss of Weiss Appraisal Service (Weiss), an appraisal firm located in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Mr. Weiss is a licensed real estate appraiser in Michigan and has ten years of experience appraising all types of property. Mr. Weiss represents that both he and Weiss are independent of, and unrelated to, Frankenmuth and the Trustees. Mr. Weiss placed a fair market value of $127,000 as of August 23, 1994. Mr. Weiss utilized the market data approach of valuation by using comparable sales of commercial buildings located on the same street as the Property. 6. The Trustees state that the terms of the Loan compare favorably with the terms of similar transactions between untreated parties and would be a better than arm's length transaction as evidenced by the terms offered by NBD (see Item # 5 above). The Trustees represent, that from the Plan's perspective, the terms of the Loan are better than the terms offered by NBD because the Loan allows the Plan to receive higher monthly payments at an interest rate of 11.5 percent over a ten- year period rather than at a fixed or floating rate between 9.25 and 11.5 percent over a fifteen-year period. The Trustees represent that they believe that the Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio. The Trustees further represent that they will monitor the Loan throughout its entire duration and will take any appropriate action necessary to protect the interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, including a foreclosure on the Property in the event of default. The Trustees will monitor the Property to ensure that the Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 150 percent of the Loan at all times.
