No new law is necessary to allow the Temelin's completion. The plant's construction continues as scheduled, Dlouhy said. Frantisek Benda, the Czech Minister for the Environment, said in early April that Temelin could not be made operational before a so- called "nuclear law" was adopted. He added at the time that unless such a law were passed, he would not give his go-ahead for Temelin's operation. The Ministry for Trade and Industry is responsible for work on a bill on peaceful use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation that should thoroughly integrate regulations in the sector. The present legislation is adequate, Dlouhy said. A nuclear law will come to be needed mainly when the Czech Republic has two nuclear power plants (in Temelin and Dukovany, South Moravia) producing 40 percent of the Czech power output. The government has unanimously agreed on Temelin's completion. The plant's repercussions on the environment were discussed at the time when planning permission was issued and again after 1989, Dlouhy said, adding that changes in the plant's project which came out of the discussions would increase the plant's safety and lessen its impact on the environment.
