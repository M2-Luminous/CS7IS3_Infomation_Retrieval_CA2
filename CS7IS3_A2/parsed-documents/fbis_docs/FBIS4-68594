FBIS4-68594 "jpusr051___94036" FBIS-USR-94-051 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 21 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Sergey Glazyev Assesses Draft Agreement on Civic Accord Sergey Glazyev Assesses Draft Agreement on Civic Accord 944E0764A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 21 Apr 94 pp 1, 4 944E0764A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma: "Formula of Accord Under Crisis Conditions"] [Text] The movement toward national accord, which began with the adoption by the State Duma of the Memorandum on Accord and with the president's initiative for the preparation of an Agreement on the Achievement of Civic Accord in Russia, which was later supported by leaders of the constructive opposition, in the last few weeks has become stuck in bureaucratic measures, has been emasculated in numerous assessments by unscrupulous interpreters, and, as a result, has been drowning in waves of mutual distrust. The draft agreement on the achievement of civic peace proposed by the working group for discussion does not have a concrete content in the economic part and threatens to transform the most important process of achievement of public accord on the key direction in the domestic and foreign policy of the state into a regular formal measure capable only of discrediting the idea of the establishment of civic peace in Russia achieved by society through suffering. Unfortunately, the proposals by the plenipotentiary delegation of the State Duma to conduct negotiations on the concretization of the draft agreement were ignored. Serious work was replaced by the initiative of several enthusiasts, who did not possess the necessary powers to organize the coordination of the positions of the parties on key directions in socioeconomic policy. As a result, the text of the agreement could not be filled with a concrete content. Yet extracting the country from the growing socioeconomic disaster is the central element in public accord, for the sake of which the parties agree to combine efforts, curbing their own ambitions and claims. The document submitted for public discussion differs in this fundamentally from the Moncloa Pact widely used as a historical guideline, which resembles much more a program for concrete anticrisis actions than a political declaration. It is worth quoting here the first lines of the preliminary agreements adopted on 9 October 1977, with which the package of documents known to us as the Moncloa Pact opens: "1. In the Moncloa Palace on 8 and 9 October representatives of various parties, which have their deputies in the parliament, conducted a meeting with the president and government members for the purpose of examining the first point on the agenda: the program for improving and reforming the economy. There was a wide discussion of the aims, means, and measures envisaged by this program. At the same time, representatives of political parties set forth both the differences existing among them and points of contact. "2. The assessment of the economic situation, which those present defined as difficult owing to the time coincidence of various crises, became the first matter, where mutual understanding was achieved. In the opinion of the participants in the conference, the unanimity of views on this matter should serve as the basis for the adoption of measures, which under conditions of the market economy are needed to improve and reform economic activity for the purpose of overcoming the crisis and lending a new impetus to the economy. "3. Another matter, on which accord was achieved, consisted in the need to uniformly distribute the burden of the crisis among various social groups, as well as in the demand for efficient democratization of the political and economic system as the condition necessary for the acceptance of reform by all of society. "4. All the political parties that participated in the conference expressed their agreement with the government about the need to adopt a number of primarily short-term measures in the area of monetary circulation, finances, and employment, which would make it possible to stabilize Spain's economy in basic indicators within 2 years..." In Russia's present situation it is also possible to coordinate the aims of socioeconomic policy and to develop a program of measures for their realization, which would receive the support of the most influential political forces--if there were a desire. There is already the first serious result--basic directions in domestic and foreign policy proposed by the president in the message to the Federal Assembly received the support of the State Duma. Of course, their concretization in the program of measures requires serious and difficult work. Therefore, the question is: Who will perform this work? Two months ago in the recommendations of parliamentary hearings "On the Economic Situation in the Country and Legislative Support for Anticrisis Policy and Economic Reform" it was proposed that within a 3-week period the government develop a plan of measures to overcome the economic crisis. A month ago the president's message "On Strengthening the Russian State" was approved by the decree of the State Duma, which suggested that in the shortest period the government develop a plan of measures to overcome the socioeconomic crisis in the country. Several events, which simplified this task, occurred simultaneously: the adoption by the State Duma of the Memorandum on Accord and the president's initiative in the signing of the Agreement on the Achievement of Civic Accord. The work of "round tables" on the concretization of basic directions in domestic and foreign policy began. However, the program for anticrisis measures did not and does not exist. Moreover, the draft of the federal budget was drawn up as though there were neither elections on 12 December nor the president's message setting a new course in economic policy. In particular, in the priorities of structural policy indicated in the president's message the draft of the 1994 federal budget provides financing for only two ones--the fuel and energy complex (which accounts for more than one-half of the expenditures provided in the budget and in extrabudgetary funds for the financing of the national economy and attraction of foreign credits) and, to a much lesser degree, the agro-industrial complex. State support is hardly provided for the conversion of the defense industry, which is needed not only for the retention of work places and production capacities in science-intensive industry, but is also the condition necessary for a successful modernization of the country's entire production apparatus and for the renewal of economic growth. Budget appropriations are not allocated in a sufficient volume for the realization of federal goal-oriented programs, which should ensure the initiation of progressive structural changes in the economy. Science and education, which determine our development in the future, are doomed to further degradation. On the basis of an analysis of draft budget indicators and according to the results of parliamentary hearings "On Structural and Scientific-Technical Policy in 1994-1995 and Until the Year 2000" the Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma drew a conclusion on noncorrespondence of the structure of planned budget expenditures to the priorities of structural policy formulated in the president's message to the Federal Assembly. The same also concerns another key point of the president's message--inadmissibility of a decline in basic social indicators. Basic social guarantees are not ensured materially or organizationally. The draft budget envisages neither an active policy of assistance for the unemployed, nor an efficient protection of mother and child, nor the maintenance of an acceptable level of education and public health services. For the third year we are moving in the vicious circle of declining reproduction. The process of destruction of the country's production potential expanding around the interconnection--reduction in production--decline in budget revenues--reduction in budget expenditures, primarily for purposes of development--further decline in production--and so forth has gained strength. The policy--pursued at the same time--of passive adaptation to the economic slump oriented toward the balancing of the budget deficit and the accomplishment of the ideological task of destroying the state sector of the economy only aggravates the situation. In order to get out of the formed vicious circle of declining reproduction and policy of passive adaptation, it is necessary to change over to active purposeful actions according to sufficiently obvious directions in overcoming the crisis. 1. Introduction of order in the system of state finances. It is impossible to implement any intelligent policy under conditions when the state is the biggest nonpayer and unreliable economic partner. The practice of an arbitrary sequestration of state expenditures, which provokes the deepening of the nonpayment crisis, strengthening of the chaos in the economy, and destruction of the social sphere, must be eliminated. Of course, this will demand a sharp rise in the responsibility and quality of work by the staff of appropriate state departments and its personnel reinforcement. Measures to improve the reliability of the revenue part of the budget must be adopted simultaneously. These measures include not only the strengthening of tax discipline and the abolition of illegal privileges concerning taxation and foreign economic activity, but also an increase in the reliability of the planning of budget expenditures, improvement in the efficiency of budget expenditures, regulation of the money and credit sphere, and activation of nontax sources of state revenues. Among the latter the most significant reserves are contained in the use of rent payments from the exploitation of natural resources, in the attraction of revenues from the use and privatization of state property, and in the regulation of credit emission. Revenues from the servicing of credits previously issued by the state and their repayment are highly substantial and at present uncontrolled. The vast profit from the 1992-1993 credit emission is spread between privileged bank and trade structures and stimulates production activity only to a negligible degree. 2. The introduction of order in the system of management of state property. The uncontrolled use of state property, while the state experiences an acute shortage of funds and is forced to lower expenditures on the financing of urgent social needs, is a paradoxical fact. Nevertheless, the profit from an efficient use of state property is not even included in the sources of federal budget revenues and revenues from the privatization of state property form a negligibly small amount, which is hundreds of times smaller than the value of privatized property. The need to establish a system of management of state property, which is generally accepted in all countries with a market economy, a system providing for responsibility for its efficient use, can hardly evoke doubts in any sensible person, irrespective of his political orientation. The mismanagement of state property and the lack of clear responsibility on the part of officials managing it are some of the basic sources of corruption and chaos in the economy. Nevertheless, the extremely ideologized and absurd policy of a spontaneous, almost free, distribution of state property continues. It gives rise to numerous offenses and does not promote an increase in production efficiency. 3. The most rapid transition from the present ideologized model of privatization to a pragmatic one. Privatization should lead to an increase in production efficiency and bring income to the treasury. For this state property should be sold to those that are capable of giving the highest price and are able to ensure an inflow of capital, long-term profitable development of enterprises, and preservation and increase of work places. Appropriate methods of privatization are well known in world practice and are used in all countries except ours. 4. Combination of bank capital with industrial one. As a result of the insufficiently considered price liberalization, chaotic reorganization of the banking system, and "voucher" privatization, a serious barrier arose between financial and production sectors of the economy. A paradoxical situation was created, where with the most acute shortage of financing of production enterprises and catastrophical reduction in investments in the economy there is a vast amount of free money taken abroad, circulating in speculative operations, and even reserved in the Central Bank. In order to overcome this barrier, it is necessary to pursue an active policy of integration of banking and production capital in the form of various financial and industrial groups and of stimulation of production investments--both through tax privileges and through direct state participation in the form of share crediting and the granting of guarantees for private investments in priority directions. 5. Reforming of the tax system, which must become simpler, more reliable, and more efficient. The statement about the need to lower the tax burden and to exempt income assigned for purposes of production development from taxation has become a platitude. The possibility of doing this, compensating for the reduction in budget revenues by an increase in proceeds from rent payments and the use of state property, is also obvious. In reality, however, everything occurs the other way round--rent income and income from the use of state property are appropriated by privileged commercial structures and the relentlessly decreasing tax proceeds are compensated by the introduction of new quasi-tax payments and intensification of the tax burden. 6. Active structural, industrial, and scientific and technical policy of stimulation of the growth of promising industries and of modernization and reorganization of enterprises with worn-out and obsolete equipment. Under our conditions of deep-seated structural disproportions, which are caused by the technological multistructural nature of the economy and the orientation of its science-intensive sector toward the production of military equipment, the adaptation of enterprises to the requirements of the market economy and consumer demand is impossible without the attraction of serious investments and the development of a long-term strategy. Neither occurs by itself as a result of the action of forces of market self-organization. Without an appropriate state policy of support for the adaptation of science-intensive sectors of industry to the demands of the market economy its rapid destruction and deindustrialization of the national economy are inevitable. In fact, this process is already gaining strength--a sharp reduction in state and consumer demand in the absence of an active investment policy today has led to a rapid increase in costs and to a reduction in the competitiveness of science-intensive industries. The repeated reduction in state purchases is aggravated by the decline in the production of civilian products, which, in turn, causes an even bigger rise in the costs of products and a further intensification of the decline in production. Today the decline in production in science-intensive sectors of industry greatly exceeds 50 percent and continues to grow, passing into the phase of an irreversible destruction of the country's scientific and industrial potential. If existing tendencies remain, by the end of the year it is possible to expect an irrevocable loss of hundreds of promising, new technologies, break-up of labor collectives, and physical destruction of many advanced technologies and production capacities. 7. Concentration of social expenditures on direct support for very needy population groups and investments in "human capital"--training and education of the rising generation, retraining of dismissed personnel, and settlement of migrants with a simultaneous reforming of the system of pension and medical security on the basis of individual and collective insurance. The presently implemented economic policy evolves in the opposite direction: Ever fewer funds are being invested in "human capital" with a rise in the relative share of unproductive expenditures on the financing of the current consumption of the nonworking population. The continuation of such a policy under conditions of the decreasing revenue base of the budget and increase in the share of the unemployed population will signify an increase in taxation on labor expenditures with the lowering of the quality and productivity of labor and, ultimately, the most rapid further reduction in the competitiveness of the domestic economy. 8. Debureaucratization of the state regulation of the economy. It must be ensured through strict observance of stable legislation setting the rules of economic relations and access to resources, not by administrative-distributive methods. Bureaucratic obstacles to the access of new firms to the market must be eliminated maximally and favorable conditions for the establishment and development of new enterprises in various fields of activity must be created. These conditions must include an access to sources of capital, to free production capacities, to sales markets, to the transport and information infrastructure, and to the necessary natural resources. For now all this fully depends on the will of state bodies of executive power, which are more engaged in extortion and the planting of administrative arbitrariness than in the creation of conditions for the development of entrepreneurship and competition. 9. Subordination of the regulation of foreign economic activity to the interests of development of domestic production. The set of tools is well known here--currency control, stimulation of the domestic export of goods of a high degree of processing, protection of the domestic market against the threats of unscrupulous foreign competition by means of measures of tariff and nontariff regulation, stimulation of advanced structures by means of a corresponding differentiation of customs tariff, and so forth. Today the steps taken in this area are obviously insufficient and not thought through. To this day currency control has not begun to operate, customs tariff is formulated under the strong effect of political market factors, and the interests of the national industry are not reflected in the foreign economic policy being implemented. Only some directions in economic policy, the obvious need for which does not evoke doubts among the overwhelming part of political forces, are enumerated above. The purposeful implementation of these directions can ensure a rapid positive breakthrough in the development of the economic situation and receive extensive political support. A corresponding program of measures could fill the socioeconomic section of the agreement on the achievement of civil accord in Russia with a concrete content, also forming the basic subject of the agreement, for the sake of which the contracting parties would agree to a voluntary limitation of political activity. Unfortunately, hardly any active steps in any of the directions enumerated above are being taken. The economic policy being realized proceeds from the thesis that the crisis will be overcome by itself, as soon as inflation is brought down to a sufficiently low level. In order to bring inflation down, it is considered sufficient to minimize the budget deficit and credit emission. And then, perhaps, something will turn up. The hopelessness of such a policy is clearly demonstrated by the practical experience of the last 2 years. In fact, it serves as a justification for the inactivity of the government, which prefers passive adaptation to the political situation instead of an active anticrisis policy, finding activities connected with the endless division of the dwindling budget pie, allocation of credit emission, and distribution of state property quite comforting and attractive. In fact, helplessness, inactivity, and embezzlement of state property hide behind the pseudoliberal rhetoric. Today it is quite evident that, without the strengthening of state responsibility for all directions in economic policy, it will not be possible to overcome the decline in production or the galloping inflation. The suppression of the latter is possible only as a result of the implementation of the directions in economic policy enumerated above with the observance of obvious limitations on the growth of credit emission and the amount of the budget deficit. Conversely, as experience shows, keeping the latter within acceptable limits is impossible without an active economic policy in the many directions partially enumerated above. The suppression of inflation and macroeconomic stabilization can become only the result of an active structural, institutional, investment, social, and other components of economic policy, not the prerequisite, as advocates of the theory "everything is formed by itself" believe. Today as never before during the postwar history the country needs a responsible and competent government capable of pursuing an active and purposeful policy in national interests and leaning on the wide support of the public. The coincidence of the basic directions in domestic and foreign policy with program propositions of the constructive opposition proclaimed by the president makes it possible to form a wide coalition of political forces in the support of a sound economic policy and of the government realizing it. It is vitally important to realize this possibility, filling the agreement on civil accord in Russia, which is being prepared, with a concrete economic content.
