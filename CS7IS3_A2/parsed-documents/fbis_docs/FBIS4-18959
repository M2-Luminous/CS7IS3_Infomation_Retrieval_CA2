The main message from the central executive was also the extraordinary: The battle to win the referendum takes precedence over everything else. The planned program of preparations for the 1995 local elections will be postponed to leave enough room for the EU struggle, and money need be no obstacle. The Center Party leadership told the press yesterday that its successes in the elections last year has given the party the finances which make it possible to invest millions of kroner in the campaign against EU membership. "We will do our bit, and we have some resources. But we also know from the last EC battle that it was the broad alliance across the great divides which ensured a `no' majority. In the same way we must allow `No to the EU' to coordinate the fight this time too so that the resources of all organizations and parties are used in the best way possible," Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein said. She dismissed a question about whether this is an indication that she does not want to be the "no" queen. "We are not the ones using such titles, but there can be no doubt that there is teamwork both among us and in other organizations combined with a cross-political grass-roots involvement which will guarantee victory," she said. There is little reason to expect the Center Party to slip into the shadows, even if it does become clear that it will be "No to the EU" which will coordinate the campaign against membership. The party has plans to advertise posts so that it will be able to improve its EU competence, and leaflets will be produced. The Center Party will make its contribution through its part of what the party calls popular education and facts about the EU and the results achieved in the negotiations. Yesterday the central executive also set up its own strategy committee which will evaluate the EU battle more or less day by day. The committee consists of the party leader, the two deputy chairmen, and the party secretary in addition to the Storting group's political and administrative leaders and the Center Party's members of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee. Of the eight members of the strategy committee only two are not at the Storting every day. Nevertheless the party leadership is stressing that the real work against EU membership must take place at grass-roots level.
