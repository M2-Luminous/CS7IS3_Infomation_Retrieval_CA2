Wang Ke, head of the discipline inspection group sent to the Supreme People's Procuratorate by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, gave an account at the meeting of anticorruption work within procuratorial organs. Wang Ke said that last year, a total of 12,934 leading cadres at or above the department level of the procuratorial system across the country took part in democratic life meetings which discussed honesty and self-discipline. This accounted for 99 percent of leading cadres who should have attended such meetings. Viewed from the results of self-examination, most leading cadres have strengthened their sense of honesty and self- discipline and carried out self-examination and self-correction in accordance with the five stipulations. Wang Ke said that procuratorates at all levels handled cases of violation of discipline, regarding this work as an important task in anticorruption within procuratorial organs. Last year, 568 personnel who had broken laws and violated discipline were put on record for investigation and prosecution, accounting for 3.3 per mill of the total number of procuratorial personnel across the country. Of this number, 159 were punished for violating party discipline, 343 for violating administrative discipline, and 87 were investigated and affixed with criminal responsibility. These included: The case of Chen Zhiwen, former chief procurator of the Changping County Procuratorate in Beijing Municipality, who accepted bribes amounting to nearly 20,000 yuan and the case of Cui Xingguo, former deputy chief procurator of theinunchun City Procuratorate of Jilin Province, who embezzled $4,000 from fines and money which had been confiscated. At the same time, various localities also strictly stopped and corrected the unhealthy practices of indiscriminately collecting fees and imposing fines. According to incomplete statistics, the procuratorial system sorted out 24 items of fees being indiscriminately collected and fines indiscriminately imposed, involving over 16.29 million yuan. Over 7.63 million yuan was returned to those who had paid and over 1.17 million yuan was handed over to the state. By the end of last year, 15 provinces (regions and municipalities) had returned over 70 percent of such fees and fines to the payers. Wang Ke said that since the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued the "Notice Reaffirming Prohibition on Procuratorates Overstepping Power or Violating Laws in Handling Cases" for the second time last year, various localities have solemnly handled this kind of case. Hebei Province, in cooperation with the provincial discipline inspection commission, carried out investigation and dealt with a discipline violation case in which the Zhuozhou City Procuratorate meddled in 25 economic disputes and kept 490,000 yuan in the course of demanding payment of debts. The procuratorate has returned 277,000 yuan from fees which it collected unlawfully. Zhang Weimin, chief procurator, and Tian Fang, deputy chief procurator of the procuratorate have been dismissed. Talking about the major anticorruption tasks within procuratorial organs this year, Wang Ke urged that all procuratorial personnel should, centering closely round the new demands of three items of work put forward by the central authorities, in accordance with the unified planning of local party committees, and in light of their own actual situation, carry out thorough-going, sustained, and more effective anticorruption work within procuratorial organs and strive to make achievements in education, self-discipline, handling cases, and improving rules and regulations.
