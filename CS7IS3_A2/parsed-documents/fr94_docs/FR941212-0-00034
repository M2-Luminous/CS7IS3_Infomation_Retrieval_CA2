FR941212-0-00034 FR941212-0-00014 In light of appeals court precedent supporting the methodology employed in calculating the FMC's indirect costs, and because of the attention given to include only those expenses that are relevant to our indirect cost calculations, the Japan Conferences' arguments are rejected. JCG also states that a tariff filing fee may act as a disincentive to taking independent action by conference members, and further, that it could lead carriers and conferences to delay tariff filing at the expense of clarity. The Japan Conferences recommend that the Commission calculate a flat per-tariff or per-carrier/conference fee that would not have, they contend, a disabling effect on the independent action process or commodity-based tariffs. Similarly, JCG urges the Commission to consider establishing a fixed annual fee for each tariff filed to avoid repeat billings and collections and to reduce both Commission and conference/carrier administrative time and costs. JCG contends that a flat fee would also create a certainty for filers from the standpoint of knowing the annual fees that will be paid for tariff filing activities. Administrative costs may decline if the Commission implements a flat annual fee for tariff filing. A flat annual fee for tariff filing, therefore, has some appeal. Further study would be required, however, to determine the level of a cost-based fee. Also, adoption of a flat fee is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Lykes argues that the Commission should reserve a certain percentage of any user fees assessed for system enhancement in the future, thereby addressing a certain lack of flexibility in the current system. According to Lykes, these enhanced capabilities should include simultaneous multiple tariff access, better definition and capabilities for inland table construction and utilization, and inclusion of transport mode in through single factor rate filings. Whatever its merit otherwise, Lykes' suggestion is irreconcilable with the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25, which instruct that user fee collections not be used to offset costs of activities that are not related to the specific service the Commission is performing for an identifiable recipient. The Japan Conferences comment that ATFI contractor costs should be pro-rated between filing and retrieval expenses, otherwise the Commission will be charging twice for the same service. As explained in the NPR, only that portion of the ATFI system cost allocated to filers was included in the proposed filing fee. Because there is no double billing of contractor costs, the Japan Conferences' concerns are unfounded. Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. (``Hanjin'') contends that the proposed fees constitute a tax on international trade because such fees fail to consider international comity, that is, other countries do not require such filings and fees. Hanjin argues that the Commission should not impose burdensome fees in the United States, where no such fees are assessed by foreign governments on carriers operating there. Contrary to Hanjin's assertions, the proposed tariff filing fee is not a tax. The fee is designed to recover the full cost to the Commission of performing a service that provides tariff filers with a special benefit, as mandated by OMB Circular A&hyph;25. In Federal Power Commission v. New England Power Co., 415 U.S. 345, 351 (1974), the Court held that the assessment of specific charges to specific individuals or companies was ``within the boundaries of the `fee' system and away from the domain of `taxes'.'' The Tampa Port Authority urges that public entities, like itself, be exempted from tariff filing fees because they are exempted from the Commission's subscription fees. Exempting port authorities from paying subscription fees is a courtesy provided by the Commission, since port authorities typically request Commission issuances for informational purposes. However, tariff filing provides a specific benefit to members of the shipping public, including port authorities, similar to that gained by private entities. No distinction would appear to exist between the status of public and private tariff filers to justify the exemption of port authorities from filing fees. To address other matters raised concerning tariff and ET filings, the Commission clarifies that: (1) The tariff and ET filing fee will apply even if the filing or ET is subsequently rejected; (2) billing for ETs will be based on a set of terms for an individual service contract rather than on each term in the set, e.g., a filer of a service contract who files a set of ten essential terms for that contract will be billed a total of $1.65, not $16.50; (3) billing for tariff filing will be done according to a filer's logon identification number; and (4) to the extent possible, the Commission intends to bill filers on a monthly basis. Agreement Filing Fees Several commenters contend that they should not be required to pay the full cost of agreement filing because of the broad public benefit associated with such filings, but do not elaborate on the nature and extent of this public benefit. They also state that the proposed agreement filing fees will discourage regular compliance and encourage withholding important changes until such time as several changes can be filed in a single amendment. As stated in the NPR, the processing of agreements benefits the filing parties because of the concomitant antitrust immunity conferred by the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. app. ยง801 et seq., and the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. ยง1701 et seq. Agreements enable joint ratemaking or cost-cutting measures to accrue to the benefit of the signatory parties. The sales revenues or cost savings, or both, can add up to millions of dollars for one carrier, let alone several carriers. While carrier savings may eventually benefit the public, that benefit is incidental to the private benefits enjoyed by the parties to agreements filed under the Shipping Acts. Concerns that the proposed filing fee will have a dampening effect on filing agreements, or amendments thereto, are speculative at best and do not weigh against imposing the proposed filing fee.
