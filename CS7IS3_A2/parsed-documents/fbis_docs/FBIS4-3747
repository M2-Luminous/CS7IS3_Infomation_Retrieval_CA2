Comrade Qiao Shi inspected Sichuan 13-18 April accompanied successively by Comrades Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan provincial party committee; Governor Xiao Yang; Yang Xizong, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee; and Song Baorui, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. Qiao Shi inspected large and medium state-owned enterprises and village and town enterprises, and heard work reports from the Sichuan provincial party committee and the Chengdu city party committee. Because this is an important year for the deepening of reform in our country, Qiao Shi paid close attention to progress in implementing reform measures and specific problems in practical work. He said: Since the last quarter of 1993, we have been adopting more and stronger reform measures to meet the urgent need of our situation -- the need to push forward the socialist modernization drive. We should seize international and domestic opportunities that are very favorable to our country's construction as we conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and unswervingly implement reform measures which we have adopted, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Everyone has noticed that these reform measures have played an important role, reaped initial successes, and received a good response internationally and domestically. Of course, a country as big as ours will definitely face some problems when it carries out extensive, in-depth reform. We should be sober-minded and calm when facing these problems. Problems which can be solved quickly should be solved as soon as possible; problems which cannot be solved at once should be solved gradually following active efforts to create the necessary conditions. Qiao Shi pointed out: We should earnestly strengthen party leadership in the course of implementing reform measures. Leaders and cadres at all levels should be honest and observe self- discipline, oppose corruption, and work diligently in the interests of the people. They should improve their work style and do solid work. They should reach out to the grass roots and masses, conduct detailed investigation and study, be adept at discerning public sentiment, show concern about the people's work and well-being, lead the masses in overcoming difficulties and problems, and push forward all undertakings. On enterprise reform, particularly that which concerns large and medium state-owned enterprises, Qiao Shi said emphatically: Enterprises must be market-oriented. They must invigorate their operational mechanisms, improve product quality and economic efficiency, and sharpen their competitiveness. They should absorb new technologies from abroad and from other places in the country to effectively upgrade their technologies. We should create a favorable environment for enterprise reform and development. We should reduce enterprises' burdens through the gradual establishment of a social security system, so as to facilitate efforts to attract investments and skilled personnel. Qiao Shi said emphatically: We should continue to strengthen our leadership in agricultural and rural work, and solve, in a practical manner, problems that have cropped up during agricultural development. We should gradually increase the comparative returns accruing to peasants from growing grain, increase peasants' incomes, and ensure steady growth in the production of grain, cotton, and edible oils. At the same time, we should also strive to diversify economic undertakings in line with the concept of agricultural diversification. A large country like ours which has a large population has to resort to macroeconomic regulation and control to achieve long-term and steady agricultural development. Our vast rural areas will be more prosperous and developed if we actively develop village and town enterprises and work hard to strengthen the construction of small cities and towns on this basis. On the issue of utilizing surplus rural labor, Qiao Shi said: Besides exporting labor services and developing village and town enterprises, we should use a variety of methods to construct infrastructural facilities, such as repairing roads and water conservancy facilities, so that more surplus workers can play their roles. Qiao Shi showed great interest in poverty relief work. He said: The central authorities have decided to suitably grant more preferential treatment to the central and western regions in their policy to aid the poor, and this decision will be implemented. Concerning the work of the people's congresses, Qiao Shi said: The more we deepen the reform and open up wider to the outside world, the more it is necessary for us to strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system. We should fully enhance the functions of people's congresses at all levels and strengthen the construction of grass-roots people's congresses in particular. People's congress deputies enjoy the whole society's support and attract its attention when they exercise their power in accordance with the law. Local people's congresses should earnestly sum up and gradually spread the good experiences they gained while carrying out legislative and supervisory work. During his inspection, Qiao Shi visited the Sichuan provincial museum and other cultural establishments. He said: In the course of socialist modernization, we should draw on what is good in foreign cultures and carry forward and promote our country's splendid national culture; we should create a new and more splendid culture on this basis. Qiao Shi said: Sichuan has its own superiorities, as well as qualities unmatched by other localities. It has made gratifying achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization in recent years. I believe under the leadership of its provincial party committee and government and through the industrious and innovative work of its vast number of cadres and people, Sichuan will make even greater progress in all its undertakings.
