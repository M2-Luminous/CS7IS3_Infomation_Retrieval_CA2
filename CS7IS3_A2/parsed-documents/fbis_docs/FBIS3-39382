On the president's side, it is being said that "a sort of tacit agreement" has been reached to avoid conflicts, Madrinha notes. On the other hand, a Cavaco aide is cited as pointing out, with regard to Soares's new attitude, that "his words do not always match his deeds." While there are indications that cohabitation is going well and that "institutional peace is now a fact," no predictions are made on whether this is a "short-term truce" or whether it will be a "lasting peace" in light of the fact that both sides have recognized the impossibility of hurting each other with impunity. According to Madrinha, one ought to keep in mind, as a motive for the appeasement, that polls repeatedly revealed the Portuguese people's dislike for confrontations at the highest level. Soares, who is "inexorably marching toward the autumn of his active political life," must now take care of his place in history, a fact he knows well, Madrinha remarks. The president may have decided that tranquil cohabitation will ensure him a "glorious exit" from the political scene, he concludes.
