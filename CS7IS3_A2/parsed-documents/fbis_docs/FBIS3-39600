Chancellor Vranitzky described the task of the experts as follows: [Vranitzky] The main job of the experts delegation is to explain in Washington that we believe that the coal power stations that contaminate the environment in the Czech Republic can be replaced by methods other than the construction of nuclear power plants. As is known, we have developed numerous concepts in this respect and have presented them to the Czechs. We were also prepared to offer financing and other forms of industrial cooperation. It will also be important to point out in Washington that the Temelin nuclear power plant would not correspond to U.S. environmental standards. It is not yet clear whether our experts will be able to attend the hearing in Congress. However, this is not the most important thing. The most important thing for our experts is to talk with the advisers and the scientific staff of the congressmen and with the advisers and officials of the Exim bank during their stay, and to explain Austria's position there. These are the plans as far as the trip of the delegation to the United States is concerned. Referring to the discussion in Austria that has been going on for several days, I would like to state the following: The discussion is mainly characterized by domestic aspects. There have been massive attacks and exaggerated demands -- above all, by Greens deputies. It seems obvious to me that the Greens have realized that a topic on which they may have liked to focus has been taken up by the government, that the government has adopted a clear position on the issue. This is the way I interpret things. Other similar statements can probably also be considered domestic politicking. [Reporter] Does the fact that an Austrian bank mainly owned by the state has issued option bonds for stocks of a company that builds Temelin not make the mission in the United States more difficult? [Vranitzky] A report from sources close to the Austrian People's Party brought up this matter. I can only state the following: According to information provided by the general manager of the Bank Austria, the bank was not involved in financing the Temelin power plant. It was invited by Citibank last year to participate in the large-scale international financing of the project, but declined to do so. As we all know, it has transpired that a subsidiary of Bank Austria offered option bonds. I have been assured that the management has in the meantime stopped this. The lie was spread that the manager of the Bank Austria, Randa, briefed me for weeks about Bank Austria's financial projects in connection with Temelin. This is simply a lie -- in two respects. First, the bank did not finance the Temelin power plant, and -- second -- this means that it was not possible to brief me on anything. I do not hold any position in this bank. Thus, this also belongs to the realm of domestic politicking, as mentioned earlier.
