Nad; UDC 538.915] [Abstract] The fundamental physical properties of two low-dimensional structures are studied: quasi-one-dimensional conductors and Langmuir-Blodgett films. These are new materials that are promising for use in nanoelectronics and molecular electronic s. A new condensed state is formed in quasi-one-dimensional conductors: a charge density wave. The energy spectrum of one-p article and collective excitations in this state are determined. The properties of the mechanisms of electric conductivity and dielectric permittivity of quasi-one-dimensional conductors are studied in a wide range of temperatures and electric fields. Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films are manufactured and studied. The films are made of a mixture of amphophilous donor and acceptor molecules. The optimal composition of the mixture is determined from the point of view of conductivity and film stru cture. The conductivity activation energy is found, as well as the Hall mobility and type of current carrier. A sharp reversible change in film resistance is observed during heating, which is caused by reversible changes in the structure. Mechanisms of film conductivity are discussed on the basis of the results. Figures 23; table 1; references 68: 16 Russian, 52 Western.
