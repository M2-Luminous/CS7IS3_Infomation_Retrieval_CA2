FBIS4-47959 "drafr089_a_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Reports Refugees Returning From Tanzania RPF Reports Refugees Returning From Tanzania EA0805204094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 1805 GMT 8 May 94 EA0805204094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Text] Since the beginning of May, Rwandans who had taken refuge in Tanzania have been returning to their country. Already 500 of them have been recorded arriving from Tanzania, and their number is increasing daily. Today at around 1100, more than 50 people crossed the border to return to the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]-controlled zone. They indicated that others were on their way home. All these returning refugees say they had fled the massacres in Rwanda. They said that living conditions in Tanzania were not good, due notably to a lack of food. This flow of Rwandan refugees returning home to the RPF-controlled zone from Tanzania might intensify over the next few days. Indeed, some of them are afraid that they might again face the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias], who are reportedly still occupying their houses, but they should know that, in the RPF-controlled zone, returnees are enjoying security. It would certainly be better for those who have already returned to their properties to reassure the others who are still afraid of the Interahamwe. The RPF will also launch an appeal for them to return to their country and properties, an appeal which is valid as their security is guaranteed in the RPF-controlled prefecture.
