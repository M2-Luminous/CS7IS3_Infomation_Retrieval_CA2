FR941013-2-00106 FR941013-2-00078 D. Market Impact The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Israeli Index options, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, on the Amex will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because at least 85% of the numerical value of the Index and at least 80% of the components of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options listing standards, and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act, the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 7,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. The Commission believes that settling expiring Israeli Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index. 19 Lastly, the Commission believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with liquid markets and efficient executions. 19 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992). The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice there in the Federal Register . The Commission believes that the Amex's doubling of the size of the Index divisor in order to reduce the value of the Index in half is consistent with the purposes of the Act. A lower Index should make the Index options more affordable and available to individual investors, thereby resulting in improved efficiency or liquidity in the execution of these Index options. Furthermore, the Commission believes the Amex's extension of its trading hours in the Index options by five minutes is non-substantive and does not raise any new or unique regulatory issues. Both the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. and Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. currently trade a form of Index options on an Israeli Index and their trading hours extend until 4:15 p.m. The Amex's change simply brings the three Exchange's into conformity. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. III. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 3. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;18 and should be submitted by November 3, 1994. It therefore is ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 20 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;18) is approved, as amended. 20 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
