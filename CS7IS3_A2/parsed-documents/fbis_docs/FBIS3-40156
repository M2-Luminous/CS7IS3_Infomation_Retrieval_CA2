The proportion of those who were generally satisfied with the speech exceeded the proportion of dissatisfied. [passage omitted] One-third of those interviewed felt that the Patten's speech should be helpful to the Sino-British talks later, and only one-fifth of the sample felt that it would not help these talks later. Three-tenths of those interviewed considered that Britain had made some concessions under pressure from the PRC, but there was also one-quarter of the sample who did not feel that concessions had been made. One of the major concession Britain can make would be reducing the number of persons elected on a functionally differentiated basis. Close to four-tenths of the respondents felt that Patten should not make such a concession, but there was also one-quarter who felt that he should so concede. As for Patten's insistence that there should be objective criteria for the through train issue, more than one-half of those interviewed expressed concurrence. But, with regard to the fact that Patten did not spell out his political reform proposals in this policy speech, a majority of those interviewed were indifferent, and only around one-third of the sample expressed dissatisfaction over this point. The following are the responses to the questions by the Hong Kong residents interviewed in the sample. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
