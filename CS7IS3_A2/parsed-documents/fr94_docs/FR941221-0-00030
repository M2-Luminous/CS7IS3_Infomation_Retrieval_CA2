FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christopher D. Hess at (913) 551&hyph;7213. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Beginning with its initial submission in 1972, the state of Iowa has operated a federally approved SIP that has implemented the various requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act) and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). During the past two decades, numerous revisions and updates have been made to the SIP in response to new Federal requirements. On May 5, 1994, the state of Iowa requested an SIP revision under the authority and signature of the Governor's designee, Larry J. Wilson, Director, Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). This submission has been deemed complete in accordance with the criteria specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The state has provided evidence of the lawful adoption of regulations, public notice, and public hearing requirements. Rule Revisions for the SIP The state has adopted a total of five revisions in two actions by the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC). In the first action, effective January 12, 1994, the state amends its rules in paragraph 23.2(3)g with respect to training fires. In the state's previous rule, fires set for training fire-fighting employees required notification of the director at least one week prior to the event. The state has determined that it desires to make this requirement for notification consistent with the requirements in 40 CFR 61.145, as amended through March 5, 1992. The Federal requirement specifies 10 days' notification which the state now adopts. In the second action, effective April 20, 1994, the state amended four rules now submitted as revisions to the SIP.
