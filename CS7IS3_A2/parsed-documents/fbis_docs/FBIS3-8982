Beside Marjan Podobnik, who spoke in the name of the proposers of the extraordinary session, Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari, National Bank of Slovenia Governor Dr. France Arhar, and Janko Dezelak from the Agency for Rehabilitation of Banks, have spoken so far. Let us take is a step at a time: Marjan Podobnik said that it is imperative to identify all forms of incurring debts to find out what we are obliged to pay and what not. Podobnik expressed belief that our negotiations do not observe the provisions of the Constitutional Law, that is to say, they only observe it partially, while they neglect the division of assets, that is to say, the property of former Yugoslavia. Here he demanded: [Podobnik] To establish the identity of each credit separately, namely, who incurred what credit, who spent it for what purpose, and who is the true debtor. [Veselinovic] In the continuation, he, among other things, criticized the government for not sending an original contract about reprogramming debts from the end of the eighties to the deputies. Podobnik also said that he was not opposed to the model of financial rehabilitation of banks, but objected to fictitious debts and their doubling. He also said that a foreign auditing house has audited the Ljubljana Bank, however, with a remark that it could not carry out the audit in compliance with international standards. [passage omitted] Regarding Podobnik's question about the actual height of the public debt first, Finance Minister Gaspari, in an expose that followed, said that the well-known estimate [6.5 billion German marks] is based on the data available by the end of 1993. Regarding the trade in debts, that is to say, the early purchase of debts, he said that the legislation in old Yugoslavia at that time allowed this and that this is a legitimate practice internationally, however, the creditors are not interested in this trade. The key issue for them is who has taken out the debt. Gaspari said that the government is not opposed to Podobnik's proposal for the revision of the credit agreements that led to the public debt. Regarding the share of the entire old Yugoslav debt that Slovenia should repay to the commercial banks, Gaspari said that the good 16 percent that we managed to agree in the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund is an example to all other debtors, because: [Gaspari] The decision of the International Monetary Fund that became a law in Slovenia is the first international action that recognized Slovenia as a successor to the former Yugoslavia. How? Simply, because Slovenia in that document split the share of the former Yugoslavia in the active and passive part of the balance sheet of the International Monetary Fund. That is why it was such an important precedent. Slovenia is also using it now, as it has also been approved by the Badinter Commission, which is not a negligible institution within the Geneva talks. [Veselinovic] [Passage omitted] According to Gaspari, the views of the proposers of the session resemble the views of the negotiators from the rest of the former Yugoslavia. Namely, there is no guarantee that we will manage to get a better position in the succession negotiations than we enjoy now that we have decided to break free completely from the finance system of the former Yugoslavia. Governor France Arhar, too, said that this decision was without an alternative: [Arhar] What is the alternative to the negotiations with the creditors? The alternative to the negotiations with the creditors is negotiations with the debtors. [Veselinov] Those of you who oppose the negotiations, Arhar concluded, should bear in mind that according to the credit agreements everything but mines and defense systems qualifies for confiscation. Janko Dezelak, in the name of the Agency for the Rehabilitation of Banks, said that incrimination of the state-assumed debts of weak companies is an expression of the lack of knowledge about these problems. A debate of the deputies, which will be partially closed to the public, is envisaged to take place after the expose by Janez Kopac. The parliament is currently in recess. [end recording]
