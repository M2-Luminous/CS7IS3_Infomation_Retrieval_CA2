Will Those Decisionmakers Now Come Forward"] [Text] The Center Party's Paavo Vayrynen has once again on his own initiative forcefully entered the Finnish internal policy debate. Vayrynen's diverging opinions concerning results Finland achieved in negotiations with the European Union [EU] has caused confusion not only within the Center Party troops but also among other political groupings. The most sensational politician of the spring of 1994 steadfastly holds his ground: He demands that those people who accepted the negotiation agreement have to answer to the Finnish people why Finland gave up its most important goals towards the end of the negotiations. In Vayrynen's opinion the culprits placed the timetable ahead of the end results, causing immeasurable damage. He denies the assertions that he is looking for political gain for himself. The recent polemics in the papers, in his opinion, once again is a sign that the atmosphere is getting more intolerant towards diverging opinions. "Who decided that Finland had to go along with the agreement on the EU membership, even though the goals had not been reached?" That is what parliamentarian Vayrynen is asking. "Feeling? Good!" Vayrynen exclaims. He is smiling happily, he is telling the truth: He is in his own element, and that includes suffering. The familiar, calm voice is telling the story we have heard before: Vayrynen has come to a turning point once again. He is being treated harshly, the vultures are circling above, attacking him mercilessly. Reporters who do not understand Vayrynen are at it again, and they do not refrain from using underhanded means. "When I think about how I have been treated after the presidential elections, I get the feeling there is no room for me in this country. No matter what I do, it is always wrong." Vayrynen does not see himself as the poor little boy who landed at the bottom of the ditch, and who everyone doubts will ever get up and out of there, although it is generally known, too, that he has come out of terrible situations over and over again. "In the presidential elections I did very well, and everything that I have done since then has been just right." No Stand on EU Vayrynen points out that he has not taken a stand on the EU membership as yet. He will have to do it together with the others in the event that his proposal to postpone it will not be accepted. "Later on our negotiation position would be much stronger, because our economy is getting better. We would not need to get support for the transition period, and consequently we would get more permanent support from the EU, thus improving our competitive position. We could also accept somewhat smaller regional policy support since that does not provide as great a national gain as the fact that the competitive situation will be leveled out on the food industry markets." He believes firmly that the EU would want to have Finland as a member even later on, even if we would put on the brakes rights now. We are a very good member, if we join. "Even if the EU would agree to conditions that are more beneficial to us, we still would bring our additional contributions to the EU." Vayrynen wants to deny the claim that there are only two alternatives: yes or no. He believes that even if the no votes would win, the membership could be taken up again for negotiations sooner or later. Who Did It? Vayrynen was himself foreign minister at the time when the decision was made to apply for the EU membership, and he is still of the opinion that it was the right decision. "The mistake was made in February-March, when Finland decided to conclude the agreement with poor conditions. They did not hang on to the negotiation goals that had been set. If they had continued to negotiate, certainly a few additional concessions could have been gained. Now they were in a hurry to make this decision because of the EU parliamentary elections," Vayrynen criticizes. "It would be interesting to know how they made this decision. Who did it and what were the grounds on the basis of which this course of action was regarded as wise? That is something we do not know," Vayrynen says. He points out there are rumors going around about this issue, however, he is not going to repeat them. "I would consider it only right, however, that those who made the decision should also give their justification for the matter, after all, now the Finns will be tied to the decision." [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] If you were president, would you talk about the matter now the same way? [Vayrynen] No. If I had been president, Finland would not have concluded the agreement under these conditions. [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] So are you now referring to the incumbent president? It is my understanding that several persons went along with this, apparently both the previous and the current president, the prime minister, and the chief negotiators, at least this circle. I do not know if larger groups were involved. Democratic principles would require that they tell how this conclusive decision was made. [Vayrynen] It has been my experience that when important decisions are made it is prudent to assess ahead of time under what conditions the agreement will be accepted and the negotiations will then be continued until satisfactory conditions will be reached, otherwise the agreement will not be concluded. During the last weeks of the EU negotiations there was a decisive change. All of a sudden we were ready to join when the timetable became more important than the content. Emotional Problems In Vayrynen's opinion, the agreement that was reached is poor with regard to content and its schedule impossible. The most fundamental weakness of the content, according to Vayrynen, is the fact that the agricultural support system for northern Finland that had been set as a goal was not reached. When the EU territory will make a transition to the free trade of agricultural products, the competitive premises of Finnish farms will be poor. And furthermore, the EU has a common agricultural policy that favors areas with better conditions than Finland's. "And the thought that the Finnish taxpayers would then salvage what we lost with this agreement is ludicrous in my opinion. It just is not possible to pay so much support that we could guarantee the future of our own food industry." The alternative is not cheap, either, for the taxpayer. "It depends on how you calculate it. Right now we have the opportunity to take advantage of the border protection in order to protect our own food production, therefore we need less support from the taxpayers to maintain our own agriculture. But if we join the EU, then we can only use the taxpayers' money. The decisions are made somewhere else, and the Finnish taxpayer is allowed to support the mighty masters of Germany, France, and Denmark. ``If we open our eyes and take a good look, this decision forebodes very gloomy prospects for the future with regard to the rural areas, agriculture, food industry, and thus the whole national economy,'' Vayrynen claims. The Finnish discussion of the EU membership has been rather irrational, in Vayrynen's opinion. He is asking how the reporter intends to translate a strange word for the readers. Then he clarifies it himself, "So it is a question of image and emotions!" He admits that as a member Finland would be permitted to participate in making decisions on matters that it already has agreed to within the framework of the European Economic Area (EEA), pointing out that actually this is the only significant issue on a general level that favors the membership. With regard to the food processing industry, the justification is inadequate in his opinion: The membership would be tantamount to changing from our own independent agricultural policy to the supranational decisionmaking within the EU. "We have no reason to anticipate that the strongest producing countries would treat us any better as members than when we negotiated about the conditions." As a Member of Parliament In Vayrynen's opinion many people even want to be deceived in this EU matter. "They do not want to hear the unpleasant truth, but try to convince themselves, instead, that they will manage somehow. It is difficult to stick to your own opinion under the pressures from the public opinion," he notes. "And then there are people like this reckless Vayrynen who is not afraid to tell how the things really are, and of course he is pelted with stones. I intend to continue, nevertheless." Vayrynen rejects the suggestion that on the basis of his taking this position he is trying to drive his party into opposition while all the others are very prominently expressing their support for the EU. As a matter of fact he sees the matter in a totally different light: In order to gain needed majority for the membership in the parliament, the government also will have to have forces that enjoy the confidence of the doubters. When asked, Vayrynen assures that after 24 years of experience he holds high respect for the duties of the Finnish members of parliament, and he believes that it is possible to make a difference even without official positions. The only problem such a supercharged person like Vayrynen has is that there is not enough to do; even before he had to kill time by writing books. Next moment, however, he begins to ponder about the "conditions involving a regular member of the parliament" as follows: "When you do not have any specific important position of trust, you need to address the issues in a stronger fashion if you want your voice to be heard. On the other hand, you are free to express stronger opinions when you do not need to take into consideration the limitations of the position. ``I felt it was my duty to make sacrifices so as to be able to initiate proper debate. If I had thought about my own interests, I would have just gone along with the others. But I am not an image politician. I follow my own way. At times it is awfully difficult, when everyone is beating me up, sometimes I am standing in pouring rain, sometimes I am pelted with rocks. But my conscience is clear. I am confident that the issues will be understood in a wider context when the dust has settled.''
