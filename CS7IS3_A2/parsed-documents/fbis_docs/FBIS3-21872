The statistics have not yet been processed by the Ministries of Health and Justice. According to their statistics, in 1991 the police figures for deaths were increased from 114 to 116 and a year later from 146 to 187. Last year the number of reports to the police on the basis of the Drug Law soared by almost 40 percent: While in 1992 7,805 persons were reported to the police, in 1993 the number exploded to 10,915. The development in Salzburg was particularly dramatic (plus 88 percent), Tirol (plus 76 percent), and Vienna (plus 59.8 percent). Slight declines were noted only in Carinthia and Burgenland.
