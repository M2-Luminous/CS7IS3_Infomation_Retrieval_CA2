September 1992 -- Defense Minister Staliyski meets Macedonian Defense Minister Professor Vlado Popovski in Skopje. The talks are fruitful, the Macedonian side proposes intensification of contacts. October 1992 -- The Macedonian defense minister visits Bulgaria at Staliyski's invitation and has talks with Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, President Zhelev, and the military leadership of the Defense Ministry. An agreement is reached on signing a framework accord on exchanging groups of experts and training Macedonian officers at the Georgi Rakovski Military Academy. Minister Popovski announces that the Macedonian Army is armed only with weapons of the former Yugoslav territorial defense troops. In connection with certain concocted accusations by the leadership of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] regarding a deal with Bulgarian weapons for Macedonia, he says that not a single Bulgarian rifle sling has been imported to Macedonia. November 1992 -- Bulgarian-Macedonian relations deteriorate after General Brigo Asparukhov's absurd statement about an "arms deal," and about the "pro-Serbian" attitude of the Macedonian Government. The Macedonian side notes that the accusations and violations of the embargo have hurt Bulgaria's image. Nevertheless, the Macedonian military proposes the formation of an expert commission on cooperation in the training of cadres, rear services, and communications equipment. December 1992 -- The Macedonian military proposes an exchange of information. Already in its first days the new cabinet supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] imposes an embargo on contacts with Macedonia's military representatives. In an absurd interview, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov proposes the insane idea of a so-called Alliance of the Danubian States, while Bulgaria's policy toward Macedonia is reduced to the definition "sentiments." The defense minister's idea on the "Danubian Alliance" has been implemented to the extent that today the Sofia-Ankara-Athens isosceles triangle has become an equilateral triangle.... On the other hand, the systematic betrayal of national interests through totally ignoring Macedonia as a partner in military contacts, continues. An absurd situation is reached when the Macedonian deputy minister of defense is received by the deputy chairman of a department in our Defense Ministry, and the meeting takes place in the Defense Ministry's cafeteria!? Despite the humiliation, the Macedonian deputy minister accepts the meeting and proposes cooperation, to which the Bulgarian side reacts with silence.... The attempts of highranking Macedonian military figures to establish contacts with Bulgarian colleagues are met with obvious slights. At the same time the Defense Ministry establishes official contacts with Albanian Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, Greek General Staff Chief Dhimitrios Skarvelis, and his Turkish counterpart, Gures. The Bulgarian military signs agreements with Greece and Turkey on additional measures on strengthening confidence and security. Macedonia becomes a UN member in April 1993. The Macedonian minister officially declares that his Bulgarian colleague Aleksandrov has refused already on two occasions to meet with him, but despite this he is prepared to visit Bulgaria. Minister Popovski again declares that Bulgaria is an exceptionally important factor in Macedonia's national security. Encountering the iron wall of Bulgarian military silence, a Macedonian delegation makes an official visit to Turkey in November 1993 and signs a cooperation agreement. In a joint declaration with the Turkish defense minister it is pointed out that in the case of a Serbian military aggression Turkey will interfere and guarantee Macedonia's national security. The Bulgarian side reacts with dead silence. Two dark figures stand behind the Defense Ministry civilian and military leadership's unconstructive policy -- Lieutenant General Stoyan Andreev, until recently adviser to the president on national security issues, and intelligence chief Brigo Asparukhov. The two puppets' strings are again pulled by a distant northeastern capital, states a well-informed source. Someone is again selling our national interests and ideals elsewhere.
