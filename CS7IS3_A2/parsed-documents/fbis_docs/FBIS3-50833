[Havana Radio Progreso in Spanish at 1200 GMT on 7 January, in a similar report, adds: "Robaina announced: `We are obliged to go through Switzerland, so we have to take advantage of that'. There too, meetings at the Foreign Ministry are planned... "The Cuban foreign minister mentioned the existence of new prospects for the political and economic ties between our country and Europe. As to the conflict in the state of Chiapas, he said he hoped the Mexicans would be able to find the best solution. Lastly, Robaina said that Cuba's situation is very difficult, but that we are not in a dead-end alley. Although 1994 will not be greatly different from 1993, the spiral will begin moving upwards."]
