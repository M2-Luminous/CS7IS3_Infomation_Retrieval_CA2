This view will determine the Turkmen delegation's attitude towards all items on the agenda of the upcoming CIS summit in Moscow, Niyazov told the Republic's government last night. In today's exclusive interview with TASS, the Turkmen president detailed his approach to the problem of CIS functioning, ruling out the possibility of any sub-national ruling body. "I am strongly convinced that any alliance of states is possible only on a voluntary basis, with economic autonomy of member-countries preserved," Niyazov noted. "However, this cannot happen overnight but calls for a certain period of time which is not to be speeded up by various utopian conceptions," he emphasised. The Turkmen leader believes that some advance movement towards a new model of the Commonwealth does exist, irrespective of the will of all sorts of politicians who "invent new slogans instead of going ahead with a laborious negotiating process." Recently, in particular at the latest CIS summit in Ashgabat, decisions of great importance were made, which are to give a concrete shape to the alliance and to pave the way for further advance movement, Niyazov stressed. Collective decisionmaking and implementation of these decisions is "alpha and omega of the CIS," according to the Turkmen president. For further development of the CIS as a new international community, member-states should gradually and patiently move towards civilized relations and to search for variants acceptable to everybody.
