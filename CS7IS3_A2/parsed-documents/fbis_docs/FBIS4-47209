The "No. 2" in Kazakhstan had not had a chance to disappear into political oblivion (the position of ambassador in the capital of a Far East "dragon" is in this case tantamount to political death) before many people began to ask: What induced the No. 1 to take this step? There are several possible answers, in my view. First possibility. Nurkadilov had as of late begun all too manifestly to compromise the president, being in terms of status his governor general in the country's principal city. It is sufficient to recall if only his actions during the fall-winter "offensive" against Soviet power. At that time the mayor (he is a member of parliament) himself placed calls to his deputy corps colleagues, offering them key positions in the ministerial-departmental vertical line in exchange for a statement that they were relinquishing their authority voluntarily. Many members of parliament received notice of the need to visit Office No. such and such in the city administration (and some of these many people hastily took up the "invitation"). And in the course of the election campaign to the new parliament the municipal "head" lobbied quite openly for "his" candidates for the people's elect (there was talk even of the existence of a kind of "mini-official slate" of 13 "Nurkadilovite" candidates (nameplates with a majority of the names of this slate now adorn the doors of the parliamentary candidates). It is perfectly natural that the talk about this, which percolated into the public (murder will out!), led to the appearance of numerous myths and stories from the life of the "No. 2." There was even talk about his undoubted influence on the No. 1 or the people closest to him and of some documents compromising these people in some way or other. Recalling the folk wisdom concerning fire and smoke, it may be surmised that some individual fragments of these apocrypha could be not far from the truth. On the whole, however, it was hard, observing the ex-mayor's public activity, to escape the feeling of some deliberate "self-publicity": Everyone says that this cannot be done, but I say it can. And I not only say but also do. We need recall if only Z.K.'s initially celebrated appearance on Almaty television of this spring or the business of the cancellation of benefits for retirees and the handicapped (subsequently restored by the president). Then a conference was promptly held in the capital's rayon administrations (in some, at least), which summarized proceedings roughly as follows: The president has restored the benefits--this is his business--we will operate in the old way. This "policy" of the mayor's could not, naturally, have failed to have caused perfectly understandable irritation in the "house upstairs." And the status quo was restored by the method traditional since CPSU times--"...in connection with his transfer to other work." This possibility would seem the most plausible, but there is another. So, second possibility. Nurkadilov's removal was connected with the concealed antagonism of some "interest groups" that has surfaced "in public" from time to time (the assassination of Igor Milgramm, the "chief builder" of Almaty, or the scandal surrounding the activity of the capital's meat-packing plant). There are as yet few direct arguments in support of this possibility (based on actual facts), but it should not, in my opinion, be discounted entirely. Third possibility. Nurkadilov was removed to assuage the capital's patriots agitated by the resumed talk (at the prompting of the president himself) of the pending switch of the "crown" to Akmola. In this case the logic of the replacement of the mayor is exceptionally simple: Since this is being done, an attempt will be made, consequently, to "sweep" from Almaty with a "new" broom the old mafia, after which it would still be perfectly suitable for the role of first city of the country. Otherwise opponents of the transfer (which, according to the most modest estimates, would cost no less than $10 billion) could kick up a fuss via the press and "arouse" the assertiveness of the capital's average inhabitant. Which, with regard to the 1996 presidential elections (until which, incidentally, there remains not as much time as it might seem), is clearly not a part of the plans of Nursultan Nazarbayev.... And, finally, the fourth possibility. The ex-mayor of Almaty paid with his position for insufficient concern for the inhabitants of Almaty, that is, the inadequate operation of transport, the growth of crime, the filthy streets, environmental problems, and so on and so forth. This possibility would seem unlikely, though. For, according to the "sound" tradition that has evolved here, for a failure to discharge his direct official obligations an official is moved to a somewhat higher chair. In Mr. Nurkadilov's case this could be, at a minimum, the office of vice premier. But, in the opinion of people in the know, the formulation "in connection with his transfer to other work" does not leave the former "No. 2" with any hopes of political "resuscitation." [Ustyugov] The position of head of a megalopolis where all the leading structures--from state through mafia--are concentrated is always fraught with a certain scandal potential. The new appointment to the office of mayor testifies that not simply the "president's man" but a person from outside--experienced and at the same time neutral and totally uninvolved in the clamorous showdowns of the capital of recent times--has come to power in the capital. Shalbay Kulmakhanov was state counselor for housing construction for just seven months. Prior to this he was chief of the Aktyubinsk Oblast Administration, and before this, chairman of the North Kazakhstan Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. It is impossible in seven months, of course, to seriously change anything in such a crisis-ridden sphere today as housing construction. So the personnel shuffle undertaken by the president last November--the transfer of Kulmakhanov to Almaty--appears to have been, rather, an interim step undertaken with a view to the long term. What determined this choice by the head of state? The calculation, probably, that the new mayor would not make many of the mistakes made by his predecessor. Zamanbek Kalabayevich had clearly detached himself from the government team, which, as the president intends, should be united. Sharply worded utterances about a cabinet failing to supply the city with petroleum products, pursuing a worthless tax, price, and budget policy, and bearing, from the viewpoint of the capital's authorities, "full responsibility to the people for the present situation" were being heard continually from the capital's city hall. It was obvious that Nurkadilov's "team" was playing its own game, the outcome of which was to many observers unclear. In this context Kulmakhanov's appointment looks first and foremost like the restoration of the "team principle." The new mayor will, most likely, act more cautiously, without noisy effects and public accusations against the government and the Supreme Court of Arbitration. Not a political "star" laying claim to a leading role in the state but an experienced manager, whose main task is to transfer the work of city hall from a scandal-populist to a constructive channel, is coming to the capital. Not the easiest of tasks inasmuch as the personnel changes will not spell more money for the city's coffers.
