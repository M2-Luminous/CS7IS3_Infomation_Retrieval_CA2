"We believe that the crisis in Yemen can be resolved through peaceful means," velayati Said. On Iran's support for Bosnian Muslims, he said that despite some claims, Iran has not dispatched forces to interfere in Bosnian affairs directly.

Answering a question on the export of the revolution, Velayati said that Iran was against the so called forcible export of the revolution, calling the allegation that Iran is using force to promote its revolution as "the fabrication of the western propaganda machine."
