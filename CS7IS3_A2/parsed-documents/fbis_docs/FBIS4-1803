Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on army building in a new era and in accordance with CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's proposed general requirements that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily, and that they must have a fine work style, maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support, at the end of 1993, the GSPLD again amended the "Program of Developing Military Grass-Roots Units [jun dui ji ceng jian she gang yao 6511 7130 1015 1461 1696 6080 4854 6008]." With CMC approval, the "program" has been publicized and promulgated in all military units on a trial basis. The "program" urged the whole army: to activate the enthusiasm and creativity of officers and men in grass-roots units and to launch campaigns to promote advanced companies and soldiers through competition. The activities should improve and advance the grass-roots units' inspirational mechanisms and should serve as an important measure for enhancing grass-roots units' development. The GSPLD urged: While carrying out the activities, military units should aim at development, maintain consistency, pay attention to attaining realistic results, and stress expeditiously accomplishing tasks and enhancing development in an all-around manner. The evaluation of advanced companies and soldiers should be combined with the assessment of their overall work performance at year-end. When choosing an advanced company, grass-roots units should conduct self-assessment in accordance with the requirements on grass-roots units' development and submit and register their assessments with a unit at higher level. To be chosen as an outstanding soldier, service members should aim to become soldiers who have ideals, moral integrity, good educational backgrounds, and discipline and should emulate Lei Feng. The outstanding soldier requirements include: maintain high political and ideological standards, have outstanding military skills, assert a strict work style and discipline, and have a good record of well-accomplished missions. The approving unit will present an advanced company with a meritorious certificate that has been uniformly designed by the General Political Department. For an outstanding soldier, the approving unit will send to his family a happy-tidings bulletin also uniformly designed by the General Political Department, and will record the event in his personal file. The approving unit will publish a circular to commend an advanced company and will award an outstanding soldier according to the "Discipline Stipulations [ji lu tiao ling 4764 1774 2742 0109]." When electing squad leaders and special task force members, promoting soldiers to be cadres, and allotting candidates for admission examinations to academies and colleges, military units should consider outstanding soldiers. The GSPLD urged: The broad masses of officers and men at grass-roots units should join in the "campaigns that promote advanced companies and soldiers through competition" so as to advance the grass-roots units' development to a higher level.
