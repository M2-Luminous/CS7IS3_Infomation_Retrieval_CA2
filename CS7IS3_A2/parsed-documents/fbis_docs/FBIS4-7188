We will now have a news conference with Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda. [Kanda] I am Atsushi Kanda, and I was just appointed director general of the Defense Agency. The situation facing Japan is tough. With the end of the Cold War, an era of disarmament has begun. In particular, the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons was taken up at a session of the UN Security Council, and the Security Council is about to decide on various measures. Japan should deal properly with the issue, taking the tough situation into account. In the future, I will work hard toward Japan's defense buildup. I would like to solicit your cooperation. [Unidentified correspondent] Under the present interpretation of the Constitution, [words indistinct] cannot be acknowledged. In its party convention, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] has decided such a constitutional interpretation was incorrect. What is your opinion? [Kanda] The people have a variety of views regarding the Constitution. As for the DSP, it has never made such a decision. I think it is appropriate to deal with things within the scope of the Constitution for the time being. [Unidentified correspondent] It is said that since the Hata cabinet is a minority coalition government, it will last approximately two months. What is your opinion? [Kanda] It may not necessarily become a stable administration. However, I will do my best to enable this cabinet to become a full-fledged administration and to respond to the people's expectations. I intend to work hard to successfully fulfill my duties. [Unidentified correspondent] Viewing the Hata cabinet, it consists mainly of Komeito members and others who were formerly affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party. [Kanda] DSP Chairman Ouchi is a member of the Hata cabinet. The important things are what measures the coalition cabinet undertakes and how it makes the people understand what it does. Therefore, I do not care who participates in the Hata cabinet. As for myself, I intend to work hard to carry out my duties.
