Many people, however, were taken by surprise. The announcement was made by the high council of the General Bank Superintendency, which disclosed that since 25 January the eight banks in question had been receiving funds from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]. The banks in question are Banco Maracaibo, Banco La Guaira, Banco Metropolitano, Banco Construction, Banco Barinas, Banco Amazonas, and Sociedad Financiera Fideca. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, a member of the General Bank Superintendency's high council, after reading the official communique, told reporters that the guaranteed 400 million bolivares [as heard] per depositor, which totals over 350 billion bolivares, will be paid with approved bonds worth 400 billion bolivares. The fact of the case is that, according to Sosa Rodriguez, the decision marks a new phase within the process of stabilizing and strengthening the national financial system. Sosa said that reports by the General Bank Superintendency and Fogade prove that assets and operations at the eight banks have deteriorated. [Begin Sosa Rodriguez recording] The measure is the result of a General Bank Superintendency decision and the reports issued by Fogade and the Central Bank. The basic reason--which is easy to understand--is that Fogade provided quite ample funding to those banks and the time came when these institutions could not back up Fogade's funds with assets. Consequently, Fogade could no longer continue funding them. [end recording] Meanwhile, the announcement of the interventions was not well received by the business sector, which believes they will foster distrust and concern regarding the economy, especially since the authorities have not disclosed the steps followed in an intervention. This was confirmed by Jorge Serrano, first vice president of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]. [Begin Serrano recording] Many businessmen have checking accounts at those banks and will find their operations restricted. Fedecamaras has been receiving calls since midmorning from businessmen asking what to do. The government should disclose this information to the country as soon as possible; if possible within a few hours. [end recording] To conclude, the intervention will not affect the extensions granted by the General Bank Superintendency to the eight banks in question to restore the capital lost by former shareholders. The extension will expire on 29 June and the Superintendency will decide how long the eight banks will remain closed.
