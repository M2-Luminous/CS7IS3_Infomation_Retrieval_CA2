The new large-scale nuclear war drill projected by the United States and the South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the whole nation which desire peace on the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification, and it is a dangerous action to carry the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. The analyst says: The open announcement of the plan of a provocative war gamble against the North by the South Korean puppets together with outside forces clearly indicates that they do not want a solution to the peace problem on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but seek to attain their aim of aggression with "strength". The talk about "gap" is a poor excuse invented by them to justify the adventurous war racket against the North. With nothing can the United States and the Kim Yong-sam group justify the Ulchi Focus Lens joint military exercises which would gravely threaten our nation and endanger peace in Asia and the rest of the world. Our people who love peace do not want war but are never afraid of it and can never tolerate the aggressors provoking us. The United States and the South Korean puppets must cancel the plan of an adventurous war gamble, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by their provocative play with fire.
