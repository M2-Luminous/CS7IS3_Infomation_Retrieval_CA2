(c) *␣*␣* (1) Interim financing. When the amount of the loan exceeds $50,000, the applicant may obtain interim financing from commercial or public sources for the construction period if it can be obtained at reasonable interest rates, fees, and terms, and in the best financial interests of the Government. Interim financing will be obtained to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of FmHA funds. The interim lender must be authorized to operate in the State in which the project will be located and must have an established record of providing financing to entities other than FmHA-financed projects. Since the interim lender is responsible for inspecting construction along with FmHA, the borrowing entity (including any of its identity of interest entities) cannot provide interim financing to its own project. Interim financing will be used subject to the following: * * * * * (viii) Because interest rates can fluctuate between the time construction estimates are finalized and completion of construction, any excess funds remaining from interim financing will be returned on the FmHA loan. Also, interim funds remaining because of early completion of construction will be returned. The leftover interest may be used for certain other eligible loan purposes critical to the completion of the project which were unknown to the applicant and contractor at the time the loan was approved, provided prior National Office concurrence is obtained. * * * * * §1944.236 [Amended] 20.

A subsequent loan to develop additional units must be rated and ranked in accordance with the priority point system contained in §1944.231 of this subpart. Other subsequent loan requests do not have to compete for funding under the priority point system. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (2) If the initial investment and 2 percent O and M amounts are sufficient to cover only the initial FmHA loan, the applicant/borrower must provide the additional respective amounts to cover the subsequent loan.
