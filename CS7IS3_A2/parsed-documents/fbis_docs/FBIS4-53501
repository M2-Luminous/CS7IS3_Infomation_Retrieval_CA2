You suggested the creation of a confederation. Do you think that remains a realistic proposition today? [Kim] More than ever. When the generals were in power, they paid no attention to the notion of a confederation, as they envisioned reunification as a mere takeover. This is the wrong solution, for two reasons: First of all, there is the German example; second, such a solution is rife with dangers. It would give Pyongyang good reason to build nuclear weapons. Furthermore, China would never accept it. Beijing has vital interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Geographically, these two countries share a border over 1,000-km long. In addition, North Korea provides China with access to the Yellow Sea as well as protection for Manchuria and the new industrial areas in Northeast China. Should we pursue such hegemonic ends, I am convinced that China would intervene directly in North Korea and would provide military support to Pyongyang if necessary. We must remember that, in the early 1950's, China entered the Korean war to protect North Korea, which represented vital geostrategic interests for Beijing. The United States took no account of China's warnings. Moreover, the German example convinces us to proceed gradually. In my hypothesis of a confederation of the two Republics, the first step would entail maintaining two independent governments for defense, foreign affairs, and domestic affairs. The confederation would have one joint body made up of delegates from the North and the South, it would be in charge of promoting trade and cooperation, and through restored mutual trust, pave the way for the ultimate establishment of a federal state, within 10 years or more. At first North Korea was favorable to a direct shift to a federation, then its leaders, including Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, stated they were ready to discuss my proposal. [Pons] What do you think the Pyongyang regime is trying to achieve through its strategy of a nuclear threat? [Kim] Kim Il-song's objective is not to possess atomic weapons but to normalize relations with the United States and the rest of the international community. He uses the "nuclear threat" as just another asset in negotiations. Let's face it, even with one or a few bombs, what can he do? North Korea's economic situation is terrible. If he does not secure some external aid, economic problems will ultimately topple the regime. Currently, North Korea's GDP amounts to one-tenth of South Korea's. Tomorrow, it will fall to one-fifteenth or one-twentieth. Should North Korea initiate a military conflict, it could probably destroy part of South Korea, but it could never win. I believe there is a logic to Kim Il-song's attitude and that he would not choose a suicidal course of action. He is looking for an honorable way out. The DPRK changed its view on reunification three times in the last 50 years: Until 1953, Pyongyang attempted to turn the South into a Communist stronghold through military means. It failed. Afterward, and until the collapse of the USSR, North Korea's preferred tactic was subversion. This was a failure as well. From 1991, North Korea made an about-face, agreeing to simultaneous entry of both Koreas in the United Nations (which it had rejected for 40 years). Furthermore, since 1973 when Pak Chong-hi pushed for cross-recognition of the two Koreas (both by the United States on the one hand and China and the USSR on the other hand), Pyongyang has asked Washington to normalize relations. In practice, only Seoul has benefitted from this recognition so far, by establishing relations with Russia and China. On the other hand, no Western country has done the same with Pyongyang. North Korea can only feel isolated, or even betrayed, since it has gained nothing in exchange for the de facto recognition of South Korea as part of the 1991 North-South agreement. As far as I am concerned, I can see changes in the position of North Korea's leaders (a case in point being the statements made by Kim Il-song on China's successful reformist policy in September 1993), and I think that we must help them transform North Korea, rather than backing them against a wall. I believe in persuasion rather than force: The Cold War did not change the USSR while detente gradually led to the internal collapse of the system. The same goes for Vietnam: France and the United States failed. Another example is Cuba. As for China, change began when Richard Nixon recognized Beijing. Today, I believe that China is no longer a threat to the rest of the world. These lessons from history should make us approach the problem of North Korea in a more realistic and flexible manner, so that the country may start changing. [Pons] How do you explain the current crisis? [Kim] On the surface, there is confrontation. However, I think that what is at stake is clear. North Korea is ready to give up its nuclear program as soon as it is allowed to normalize relations with the United States. On the other hand, Washington wants North Korea to give up its nuclear program so that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty can be extended more easily in 1995. [Pons] Is not this the very "deal" the Americans and North Koreans have been haggling over for months? [Kim] I believe that mutual stakes and benefits have not been identified clearly enough. In other words, the solution can only be a political one. However, the United States has only pursued an objective of a technical nature: inspection of nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency. [passage omitted]
