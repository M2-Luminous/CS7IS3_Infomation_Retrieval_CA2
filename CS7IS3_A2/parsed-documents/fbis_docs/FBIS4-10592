Far from considering such reports as negative expressions, I consider them to be positive, because the people have high expectations and want to see the implementation of a number of actions that are in line with our proposal for a new style of government and a moral revolution for everyone. People know that this new course of action will soon be established and want to participate. We have encouraged this process through the establishment of a great national consensus on which we are working intensively. A government that establishes a new style also generates a new style of response. No longer is there in Honduras a government that subjugates and paralyzes the people. It is now trying to establish power... [pauses] the role of co-protagonist in [words indistinct]. This is essential (?under the circumstances). We anticipated this in our messages of 27 January and 7 March. In them were clearly established the [word indistinct]. My next lengthy speech will be on 8 May, although on that day I must travel to Costa Rica for the new president's inauguration. That speech could be delivered a day early or a day late. In that speech, marking 100 days in office, we will advance in our efforts to keep our people informed. We maintain an impartial position as we try to fulfill state duties. The people gave us a very clear mandate: to attack the problem of corruption in all its forms. This government is committed to establishing the bases for tackling this major problem. It is neither easy nor feasible in only 60 days to change situations that have been present on national territory or in the mentality of many of its protagonists. Among such reports there was news of a plot against the president of the Republic. This was analyzed in various forms, but the truth is that the people have detected that persons involved in very deplorable activities have tried to carry out this kind of attack on Honduran democracy. And lately, there was the news of a coup d'etat. I understand that those charges are based on reports from human rights organizations that wish to prevent in Honduras acts that are so negative and so outrageous, not only to the nation's dignity but also to constitutional rule and to the strength of democratic institutions. I am ready for your questions. I wish to reaffirm my intention to maintain the best of relations with the media. I will do whatever it takes to contribute to this with utmost frankness and to promote greater rapprochement. I want the common man in Honduras to benefit from correct information and information that is not distorted in order to ensure that the people are well informed. This is a requirement for all free men. [Reina] I want to take this opportunity to thank General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir for his statements, which I think are very timely and very correct. We must analyze their extraordinarily positive nature, because they reaffirmed support for civilian power and for the great strength of democratic institutions. I believe the Armed Forces will play a new role as an institution within democracy to contribute in order to the country's development, to fight corruption, and to improve the general situation of our compatriots. This new role reflects a new mentality, which is totally contrary to the ideas of making attempts against the people's sovereignty by threatening state institutions. I am now ready to answer your questions. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] criticisms against government. First there were reports of a plot and now of a coup d'etat. As president of the Republic do you think there could be a coup d'etat in Honduras? Also, what is the situation with regard to the plot, since the suspect was released? [Reina] I look at both situations in a positive way. With regard to the plot, we will have to publish a white paper so that the people can have all the [two-minute break in reception] the Armed Forces. We are now getting used to this new style. These rumors alert the people, so they can defend their institutions and prevent any intention that could exist in the minds of anyone, meaning anyone who is against the moral revolution. After 8 May, when we will have names and specific cases, you will see those reactions intensify. They will try to seek things. What for example? Many Liberal Party members are impatient because their hopes of getting a job with the government -- which were fully justified -- have not been fulfilled. If 1 million Liberals vote for the Liberal Party, not all of them can get a job with the government. Good citizens understand this, are patient, and above all, they want this to be a good government in order to have the opportunity to stay in power. In that sense, all good Liberals know of our desire and intention to satisfy their needs. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Reina] The IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] is an economic organization. It analyzes the country, and, however, the country is run by the Executive Branch. All they do is give ideas as to what they believe could or should be done. I am not going to go into a detailed discussion of the Armed Forces economic activities. We have referred to that before. However, it is not the IDB which leads this country. It is the Executive Branch and the other branches of the state, within the realm of their duties, which run the country and it is with them that we should discuss all the details of this situation. When they hear the news, those who oppose the government want to interpret it negatively. We have had to take specific actions. There was talk that no actions were taken. We did so in order not to affect the large majority as was been done in the past. Instead, we sought solutions to that bad tradition which many do not want mentioned. However, after two months [in office], we do have to talk about the way we received the country. It is our obligation. It is not an excuse, it is a reality and measures have been taken. But I do not accept the charges that when there were invasions it meant that there was anarchy. Actions were taken to dislodge the land invaders, and then there is talk about brutality in the methods used. This is a true picture of ill faith. This is not correct because we are acting very correctly. Some of the values of this government have not yet been perceived by the majority. One of them is the honesty with which we handle the government. It will yield its fruits, but it is a matter of having patience to consolidate the great values of democracy. [Reporter] Recently there has been much criticism of your government. Labor, peasant, and private sectors [words indistinct] of your own party, what do you think is the reason for this criticism? Do you think that your government has lost popularity or credibility? [Reina] Popularity is a value I appreciate, but if your president is going to act based on keeping or losing his popularity, then he could make big mistakes. Criticism comes from sectors that do not want this government to move ahead with its theory of a moral revolution. When the presidential designate said that some of the measures could cause disappointment, that was interpreted as if the government lost its credibility. But that is not true. As long as the people trust that the moral revolution is on and that it will give the people all their rights, the people's trust will constitute the government's main source of support. There will always be criticism. Some will be right. However, what we do not want is for misinterpretation of facts to prevail. For example, the story that someone can tell, from such a long distance, that the United Nations wants a coup d'etat in Honduras.... [pauses] this is where I call for your understanding and help. How can it be that a human rights organization, an organization to defend man, could perceive that the government is threatened? The organization reported it. That is a defense. Just as Costa Rica's solidarity is a defense, Costa Rica has proven its solidarity in a thousand ways and so has President Gaviria. He expressed his solidarity as the new OAS secretary general. I also received a very flattering note from U.S. President Bill Clinton. These are facts that show that Honduras' image is an excellent one in the eyes of all democrats on this continent and the world. [Reporter] When we talk with the people, including the leaders of the Liberal Party, everyone agrees that the population is dissatisfied. The vice president of congress told us just yesterday that you should fulfill your campaign promises, because there is enormous doubt among the people, which could polarize the country. That could end up who knows where. I would like you to expand on this a little, because the voice of the people is saying that your campaign promises are not being fulfilled and there is discontent. [Reina] I am glad you asked me that. I am going to fulfill all of my campaign promises. I am not going to miss any of them. If, by the end of my four years, I have to say that I was unable to accomplish something I had promised, I will do so honestly. But what were my campaign promises? We must constantly remind everyone. My main promise was to promote a moral revolution in Honduras. It would not be true to say I have failed to meet that one. I promised to select the best Hondurans to lead the Executive Branch. I fulfilled it. I promised to restore justice in Honduras. The Supreme Court of Justice is a guarantee for juridical security. I cannot change these promises, and I am going to keep them. I have not said that the media in general misinterpret the facts. I have said that sometimes, under certain circumstances, the media have published an interpretation of the facts that differs from my analysis. An example is the UN issue, and another example is the plot to assassinate me. This is not the first time, either. Once, during the campaign, the media said I had passed away, and when I reappeared they said I invented the report myself. The same is happening now with this thing about a plot. It is all an effort to hurt me or harm me, because everything is subject to interpretation. I am not the kind that hides cards up his sleeve or contradicts himself. I stand by my principles. I have not failed to fulfill any of my promises. I hardly made any promises. What did I promise to do? I promised to throw all the thieves in jail. How can anyone expect all of the thieves to be shaven and groomed and in jail after just two months? I promised to carry out a moral revolution; not hold discretionary funds; be thorough in overseeing the people's money. If you speak to any member of the PLH [Liberal Party of Honduras] who has not managed to fulfill his legitimate aspirations, he is not going to be very happy. He will say that he struggled for so long and is still living poorly. That is perfectly understandable, but that does not make that PLH member an enemy of the government. He is a citizen who has the absolute right to demand understanding and claim his share of well-being from the government. This is not a loss of credibility. It is impatience to see the government's objectives fulfilled. I will be in continuous contact with the media. I have the greatest appreciation for all of you. Our state of underdevelopment leads us into somewhat uncomfortable situations. When I arrived at the Copn Sula Hotel [as received] in San Pedro Sula the other day, I encountered 50 reporters all hurrying to get the scoop -- which was very logical -- and they almost smothered a woman who was just there to deliver an envelope. She is a very respectable lady, and she almost collapsed. Situations such as this are sometimes misinterpreted. I would ask you not to promote such misinterpretations, but to try and achieve an open and frank flow of communication. I am an honest and open man, and I have nothing to hide from the media or from anyone. I hereby submit each event of my public and my private life to tour consideration. I have not contradicted myself on this matter either. I have not failed to keep any of my promises. I have not yet had enough time or space to fulfill everything I promised. These are all a matter of principles: to promote a moral revolution; to fight corruption; to tell the truth; and to guard the public funds. These promises, you can believe me, I have kept. [Unidentified speaker] Lourdes Janet Bonilla. [Bonilla] [Words indistinct] government institutions and this hinders the country's socioeconomic development. He has said that medium- and long-term measures will have to be adopted immediately to prevent an imbalance in the country's economy. What can you tell us about that? [Reina] There are some tremendous contradictions. They are demanding measures that could damage the economy of a people who are facing a very difficult situation. I made a promise to defend the poor in Honduras, and they are the majority, and I am doing all that I can to keep that promise. The organizations at times can be very cold, but I have to admit they can help us. This will be proven when we show that the public funds are being handled properly. The organizations become upset when they see that the aid they are providing does not reach those it was intended to help. I believe that even the charges made in New York will work for the good of the government. No one makes charges for something to happen; they make charges to ensure that things do not happen. Honduras has a new image. Everyone knows, and everyone has admitted, that Honduras' image suffered during the Cold War. Today, Honduras' image has regained prestige. It has a legitimate government and authorities who want to work for the good of the people. [Unidentified speaker] According to the press secretary of the Office of the President this will be the last question. Let us hear what the president has to say. Basically, he is analyzing his government and the international image his government been able to project. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Merchant Marines to the military, that Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise] be privatized, and that the draft be abolished. Do you believe that this would hinder the relations between the government and the Armed Forces? What do you think your government should do in light of the verbal confrontations between the Honduran private sector and the Armed Forces? [Reina] The steps you have mentioned are logical steps and there is no reason why they should create problems between the military and the civilians. The talks in Brussels will be open talks. The highest scientific, technical, and ethical international authorities will attend the talks. There will be nothing hidden. We are going to accept the ruling. Now, regarding the other two issues, the Merchant Marine and the draft: the Executive Branch has drafted a bill on the military draft and it is going to be submitted to the Legislative Branch. We have taken our time on this to ensure that the draft bill has been done properly. We do not have to improvise because improvisation only leads to problems. The draft bill will be submitted to the National Congress sometime next week. The Merchant Marine issue is being studied, and I am pleased to tell you that the Armed Forces has not defied me on this. Regarding the confrontation between private enterprise and the Armed Forces, it is all a matter of the new times in which we are living. We are undergoing a period of economic changes. We have seen that the institutions that (?protect) their employees social security rights and retirement have money, and we must put that money to good use. This creates competition for the private sector. However, a balance must be kept. As long as the Armed Forces refrain from using their military power for economic pressure, I believe they are in their right to do what they think is correct. What would be serious would be for the Armed Forces to abuse their power to compete. That is the balance my government has established, and the soldiers I have talked to agree fully with me. [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Reina] What everyone has is the goodwill to help our people overcome their problems. [Unidentified speaker] This is Voz de Honduras broadcasting from the Presidential Palace. We are bringing to you a news conference by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Another question is being asked about internal politics. The Honduran president met with Liberal Party deputies who strongly criticized the government and government operations. [Reporter] How do you react to this? [Words indistinct] [Reina] I will tell you frankly. I do not think I will go there at this time. I have talked with them, and the ministers have been instructed to listen to them and tend to them as best as possible. Should any such request be made, I would discuss it with them because the ministers are willing to cooperate. What they cannot do, however, is give jobs to all active members recommended by all the deputies, mayors, and leaders. I think the education minister is excellent; she is doing a very good job in a tremendously difficult ministry. If the minister does not have a good team to control the various agencies, the ministry can get out of hand. This is why I hereby reaffirm my support for her. This I have already done, both orally and in writing, so everyone knows that the president of the Republic backs up his ministers. [Announcer] This is the news conference held by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina at the Presidential Palace press room. He is now leaving for sports activities. [Reporter] The Honduran president discussed his campaign pledges. One was missing. He did not mention military service as one of the pledges that will be fulfilled, Mr. President. [Reina] I have said I will present the bill to the National Congress next week. The implementation depends on congressional approval. I have no authority to approve it, but I can defend it in Congress.
