He added that, during the next phase, there will be further development of the previous exploratory studies that will focus on some minerals such as gold. Initial exploratory studies have shown evidence of the existence of some 800 gold deposit areas in Saudi Arabia. Concluding studies concerning two other projects are also expected to be completed soon. The first of these is the project dealing with the exploitation of aluminum bauxite, the initial costs of which are estimated at about $45 million and the production capacity of which would be in excess of 100 million tons. The second project deals with the exploitation of zinc, along the lines of [other such] projects recently submitted for approval. He said that the initial geological survey studies have indicated the existence of some rare minerals, and that studies dealing with these minerals would require specialized exploratory operations in order to show evidence of the existence of mineral ores in a form that can be beneficially exploited. The General Directorate for Mineral Resources has already put out 11 publications dealing with the minerals that have been discovered in Saudi territory, some of which have already been exploited and some of which soon will be exploited commercially. These publications contain complete information concerning mineral ore reserves--where they are located, their uses, the nations that produce them, and their prices on the international market. The Saudi Directorate for Mineral Resources started putting out these publications in March of 1989. It started with magnesite (MgCO3), then continued with kaolin, gold, phosphate, limestone, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), copper, chiseled and decorative stones, zinc, glass sand, silica sand (SiO2), and gypsum. Recently the directorate published a complete atlas dealing with industrial minerals in Saudi territory and distributed it to both Saudi and foreign companies interested in mining projects. Saudi Arabia's objective in doing this is to encourage the private sector (domestic) to embark on large-scale mining investments, and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is taking part in the furnishing of economic feasibility studies for many of the projects that are being submitted for approval for commercial exploitation. Iron and Phosphate Projects According to Saudi officials, there is a trend toward completing the base of the mining industry and achieving more development in Saudi Arabia during the coming years by means of various mining projects. According to Dahlawi, two iron and phosphate projects were recently submitted for approval after economic feasibility studies concerning them were completed. Companies that will bid for the iron project will first study the feasibility studies undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources which present investors with a number of options. The first of these involves the construction of a plant for the production of iron balls on the Red Sea coast, with a production capacity of up to 2.2 million tons, and which will cost $550 million. The second option involves the construction of a plant for producing 4 million tons, which would cost $750 million. The third option would involve the construction of a plant to produce 3 million tons that would cost $600 million. He pointed out that the economic feasibility studies undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources have already determined which markets will take the final mineral ore product, which would be extracted and used in direct reduction plants that would utilize the latest modern technology available in the world both in the Arab world and in the nations of East Asia. It is a known fact that Saudi Arabia currently imports more than 4 million tons of iron from Sweden, Brazil, and some other countries, the total value of which is between $50 and $52 per ton. Dahlawi, during the interview, brought up the subject of the talks that were held between the Directorate of Mineral Resources and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) and said that the latter is prepared to offer loans to investors for the mining industry projects currently being submitted for approval. He went on to say: "Everything having to do with the loans will be the subject of a detailed discussion between the Fund bank [SIDF] and the company that undertakes the project." As we know, SIDF participates in almost all industrial projects in Saudi Arabia whose total value is at least SR400 million. Dahlawi expects a good response on the part of some international firms to join with Saudi partners in investing in the exploitation of iron, especially in view of the existence of markets for the sale of the final product. He said that Wadi al-Sawawin's production of iron meets the requirements of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations combined and saves about 60 percent of the import bill for iron ore for Saudi Arabia alone.
