The caravan of journalists was received by some 150 inhabitants in downtown Guadalupe de Tepeyac, a village in Chiapas State in southeastern Mexico. Local resident Manuel Jimenez Santis said that residents are hopeful that hostilities will end. The EZLN accepted Camacho Solis' proposal to create two "free zones" or neutral areas in San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac and on 2 February ordered its followers to withdraw from both areas. The peace commissioner's proposal stipulates that once the two "free zones" are created, the International Red Cross will begin humanitarian aid and support operations for the civilian population in these two places. Jimenez Santis said that several dozen Lacandona jungle inhabitants have transferred their sick for medical attention in response to the announced arrival within the next few hours of International Red Cross members. Jimenez Santis summoned Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, to come and learn the communities' most urgent needs. "We peasants have no land, no work, we have no good food, housing, education, or health care. What we want now is peace," Jimenez Sanits said. NOTIMEX toured several communities and was able to verify that food and medicines had become scarce, while here in Guadalupe Tepeyac, where about 160 [as published] inhabitants live, the Solidarity Hospital was unharmed by the conflict. The Mexican Government and the EZLN have maintained a cease-fire since 12 January following armed clashes that began on 1 January and left, according to official reports, about 100 persons dead. Maria Gomez Hernandez, a housewife, said milk, sugar, rice, flour, oil, and other basic staples are urgently needed. She requested that Camacho Solis visit the area to work within the peace process in communities isolated by the conflict. Possibilities increased this weekend for the first direct talks between the EZLN and the peace commissioner. "The dialogue may start," Camacho Solis said when announcing last night that both sides agreed on the discussion agenda after the EZLN proposed on Friday to include the topic of "national political life" without seeking agreements on this point. In a message broadcast from San Cristobal de las Casas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City, Camacho Solis said that the contents for the direct dialogue "is the agenda on which we have mutually agreed."
