Savisaar said that Asso Kommer, the former chief of the Laanemaa Voluntary Infantry Company who is kept in detention, also has the right to turn to the court, since the State Court authorized the Defense Police to tap his phone during the so-called Pullapaa crisis last summer. The State Court's Constitutionality Board ruled Wednesday to declare null and void the government decrees and the articles of the law on amending the police law, which regulated the procedure of applying special surveillance methods including phone tapping and letter checks. Centrist MP Andra Veidemann, a member of a commission looking into the activity of the Defense Police, told BNS at the press conference that "the commission was familiarized with the mechanism of phone-tapping and given information on the number of times special surveillance methods were applied over the last six months." Veidemann stated that the commission was not given the concrete materials on which the Defense Police based its applications to the State Court. She also said that the parliamentary Legality Commission is drafting a surveillance law under which all Estonian citizens have the right to inquire once a year of the Defense Police and the Criminal Police whether their phones have been tapped and why. The draft law gives the police the right not to reply to such inquiries, she said.
