In Oleksy's words, Poland is against any security concept that does not take account of Russia's interests. A policy of isolating Moscow is irrational. At the same time the Sejm speaker emphasized that Poland wants NATO membership, in which it sees a basis for strategic security. Duma Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in his turn thinks that the NATO PFP plan pushes the European CSCE security system into the background. In theory, Yushenkov noted, all European countries should have equal rights in building collective security.
