Would Be Detrimental"] [Text] 1) The complicated moves that occurred up to the birth of the Hata government were unavoidable in the process toward realignment of political circles. There is also a view which takes it in a cynical manner, but the benefit of such things as the point that it forced change upon the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also great. 2) Concern has also emerged as to whether, with politics in tumult, it will be possible to overcome difficulties at home and abroad, but there are some problems which it is better not to rush in a clumsy manner. It is important to choose which are really urgent problems. 3) Apart from deciding on the budget and electoral redistricting on the domestic front, and Japan-U.S. relations in foreign affairs, rushing things could be detrimental. What is required of politicians is "skill in setting priorities." Realignment of Political Circles Brings Change for the SDPJ On the 25th Tsutomu Hata was designated prime minister, but there were considerable complications. Even in just what was reported by the media, there were the complicated moves of Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], and the uproar over LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] strongman Michio Watanabe leaving his party. Even beyond that, there appeared to be all sorts of maneuvering beneath the surface. There were both criticism and encouragement depending on the standpoint of the writer, but, overall, there was a strong cynicism that "politics is murky" any way. Last year's atmosphere, which welcomed talk of reform in a somewhat uncritical manner, no longer exists. However, these kinds of moves surrounding the reins of government are essential to politics, and it is unavoidable that they become complicated, particularly when, as now, it changes to multiparty government. That cannot be avoided for the present, nor is there anything wrong with it. If one views it over a slightly longer term, it is the process by which the forces which split into multiple parties will be brought together. That became certain because the electoral system was reformed, and a single-seat constituency system was introduced. Because, insofar as only one Diet member will be elected, it will be impossible to win if forces are scattered. That necessity for uniting was also an important factor in the process of political reform and became virtually dominant after the various political reform bills passed. The moves toward a new-new party, a united parliamentary group, as well as Sakigake's reaction against them, were things which involved the question of the form in which political circles would be realigned and reflect the necessity, in terms of political dynamics, that all must unite. Second, the building of an alliance by small parties in order to form a government is, then, also the process by which their policies are adjusted to reached agreement. Each force has a different view, but they must compromise because of the necessity of forming a government, and for that reason, it also works out that they can find points in common. The effect of that is particularly great in the case of Japan because it forces change upon the SDPJ. The SDPJ has, itself, rejected forming a government by advocating policies which are utterly impossible to put into practice such as in security treaty, fiscal, and economic policies. But in that case, there is no future for Japanese politics. We must have the SDPJ change, and in fact, since last summer the SDPJ has changed, bit by bit. Of course this process will not go easily and will probably take considerable time. Even when there existed the unifying force of political reform, it was very difficult for the coalition government to operate. In the Uruguay Round, the SDPJ was unable to clearly change its former policy concerning what to do about liberalization of rice imports. It opposed partial importing of rice, but it temporized in such a way that the coalition government did not split. But that can also be called a real change, and it turned out that way in good measure because of concern that if the coalition government broke up, a combination of different forces could form, which also included the LDP. On the whole, the wall between governing and opposition parties has ceased to be as clear as it was a decade ago. What showed this vividly is that in the course of passing the political reform bills; some SDPJ members of the upper house carried through with dogmatic opposition and aborted the bills. But the political reform bills did not die because of that. The coalition governing parties compromised greatly with the LDP bills and by that means passed political reform. This shows that it became possible to cooperate across the governing party-opposition party wall on individual problems, even if a party does not go so far as to join the government. Thus, the nature of the Japanese political game changed in a number of senses. Of course, the political situation will change in a bewildering manner because of that, and scheming will also become more intense. Persons who read only articles which report political moves in a cynical manner may dislike that. But there can be no realignment of political circles or such without that process. There Are Very Few Urgent Problems A more direct concern is the question of whether, with politics in great tumult, Japan will be able to overcome present difficulties at home and abroad. This view was also heard between the time of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation and agreement on Prime Minister Hata. But there is no use discussing like that, but the existence of pressing problems can turn out to be a unifying force. There are many things which are called pressing problems but are actually not that urgent. There are also things which are better not to rush in a clumsy way. Therefore, in considering politics in the future, the central problem is to select which are truly urgent problems and to consider the response to them. First, as a problem which must not be dealt with hastily, there is the question of cooperation in elections because hurrying the creation of that system for next few months would result only in a reverse effect. Next, as problems which should be dealt with speedily, there is the budget, of course, and one can probably list deciding on electoral redistricting. Without electoral redistricting amounts to the basic rules of the political game not being determined, as it were, so it would be impossible to have an election even if one were necessary. For the next election to be held using the system of medium-size districts because preparations for the new system were not made in time, even though the political reform bills passed, would be a big problem from the aspect of fairness. But aside from these two problems, there are no tasks of domestic politics which are truly pressing. Certainly the prolonged recession is a problem, but there are no effective policies by the kind of measures that can be adopted right away. It is not my intention to advocate a lack of policy, but I think that after the injections of stimulant which have already been administered, there is nothing to do but leave it to the natural course of the economy. Reform of the tax system and relaxation of regulations are certainly necessary, but are they really urgent necessities? It appears that, in order to carry those out, one would have to present the future image of Japan's economy in its entirety, and that, conversely, the harm would be greater in the case of rushing. Then, what about tasks in foreign relations? Suspicion of North Korean development of nuclear weapons is doubtless a grave problem, and for its part Japan must make clear a firm resolve to not overlook illegal action by North Korea's and must indicate a posture of participating in international efforts to solve it. If such things as not carrying out the duties accompanying membership in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (accepting inspections) while participating in the treaty, and secretly developing nuclear weapons are given tacit permission, the nuclear nonproliferation system will become shaky. But, when it comes to exactly what kind of measures for that purpose are possible and desirable, the situation is unclear. One wonders that it might be a hasty conclusion to think that a crisis will develop on and around the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, as to the response to a crisis, nothing can be done but to decide, with wisdom and resolve, after the crisis has become real. Regardless of who holds responsibility at that time, the fate of the nation depends on whether he will make the correct judgement, and whether public opinion will approve it. Debate and mental preparation are necessary, but it is not too wise to plan the response to a crisis beforehand. The Urgent Diplomatic Task Is To Improve Japan-U.S. Relations Of the things that should be addressed, Japan-U.S. relations are more serious. And in regard to that point, I, too, am uneasy over whether things will go well with the current political setup. But that is not to say that we should hurry with a solution for economic friction because it was impossible to agree on at the February [1994] summit. That would be possible, but it would be the wrong way to solve it. The Japan-U.S. negotiations broke down because Japan rejected the "numerical targets" which the United States advocated, but even if we had them call it "objective criteria of progress" instead, it would be every bit as difficult for Japan to accept. Generally speaking, the view of "emphasizing results" determines the rules of trade as something among multiple countries and regulates them by that, but it violates the basic General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) principle of not regulating by quantity. But, for various reasons, the United States will probably repeat the same kind of demand, and it will be difficult for Japan to accept it. In general, international opinion also opposes it, and even within the United States there are different views which cannot be ignored. Therefore, to compromise easily would affect Japan's reputation. The current situation is that, overall, the United States is in the midst of groping for a post-Cold War policy, and in the course of that it sometimes makes erroneous statements. Its human-rights diplomacy toward China and being a stickler on trade problems in Japan-U.S. relations are examples of that. Thus, the solution in Japan-U.S. relations must include "no." But neither a world order nor an Asia-Pacific bloc is conceivable without the United States. This is particularly true for Japan, which is very fragile. Therefore, when Japan says "no," many more times than it says that, it must propose "let's do it this way." Before that, there are many things which Japan must do in order to resolve the imbalance in Japan-U.S. economic relations. Relaxation of regulations is the most important of these, and that can be done by Japan's judgement. This kind of combination of "no," and "yes," and "proposals" is really difficult. But it must be done. Politics is said to be "the art of the possible" because there are any number of things which one should do, and which it would be better to do, but few of them are possible. Politicians must choose things which must by all means be done at a certain point in time. At that time it is vital to not simply hurry, but to watch for a good chance to act. That is particularly true in situations where many parties stand side by side. It was good that they worked out a compromise on policy though they spent time, but the situation is not so simple that agreement can be gained by that. Therefore, skill in setting priorities is required.
