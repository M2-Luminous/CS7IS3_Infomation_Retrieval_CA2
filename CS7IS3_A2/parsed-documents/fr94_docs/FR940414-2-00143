FR940414-2-00143 FR940414-2-00084 Through this document, Customs amends the current guidelines so that when a party fails to hold the merchandise for examination or fails to transfer the merchandise to another place upon instruction from Customs obtained before the merchandise was released, the claim will be cancelled upon the following terms: (1) If either the bond principal or surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by Customs to be restricted or prohibited; (2) If neither the bond principal nor surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties, taxes and fees that would have been due plus an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by Customs to be restricted or prohibited; (3) If the merchandise not held for examination was suspected of being restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal files an entry summary, pays estimated duties, taxes and fees and the merchandise was deemed admissible with that entry summary, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000; (4) If the merchandise not held for examination was suspected of being restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal does not file an entry summary or pay estimated duties or provide a showing that the merchandise was deemed admissible, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties, taxes and fees plus an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less than $250; and (5) If the violation is determined to be intentional in nature, no relief will be afforded. For a violation which involves the failure to keep any Customs seal or cording intact until the merchandise is examined, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $500 if there is no evidence to indicate the merchandise in the sealed or corded shipment was the subject of tampering. If there is evidence of tampering, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the value of any missing merchandise. Finally, an additional sentence shall be added to the guidelines to indicate that when the term ``value'' is used in any provision of these guidelines it means value as determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a and not domestic value. The new Section XI of the bond cancellation standards relating to CES operators will employ the same guidelines as those described in the changes to Section X with regard to violations involving failure to keep merchandise safe or deliver that merchandise to the CES. The text of the guidelines, as modified, is set forth below. Dated: April 12, 1994. Samuel H. Banks, Acting Commissioner of Customs.
