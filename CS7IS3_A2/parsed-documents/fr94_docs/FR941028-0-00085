FR941028-0-00085 FR941028-0-00009 Also, in the comparable provision of the proposed rule, the rule language referred to the evidentiary standards applicable to the review of ownership or control links ``to a person cited in a violation notice.'' The final rule has been changed to reflect that these standards will be applicable to the review of an ownership or control link, without regard to whether such relationship involves a link to an outstanding violation. The rationale for such a change has been explained previously in this preamble in the discussion of a similar change made in paragraph (a)(1) of this final rule section. As in the proposed rule, where there is a link to a violation, these evidentiary standards will apply to the review of the status of a violation. Paragraph (c)(1) of final §773.25, requires a challenger of an ownership or control link to prove at least one of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final §773.25, a challenger can demonstrate that the facts relied upon by the responsible agency to prove ownership or control under the definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist. The final regulation differs from the comparable provision of the proposed regulation in that while the final regulation refers to 30 CFR 773.5, it does not specifically cite particular paragraphs of 30 CFR 773.5 defining presumed and deemed relationships of ownership or control. On June 28, 1993, OSM proposed rules which, if adopted, would modify the organization of regulatory language in 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, 58 Fed. Reg. 34652 (June 28, 1993). By changing the language in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final §773.25 to delete references to the current paragraph organization of 30 CFR 773.5, OSM retains the flexibility to adopt or reject its rule proposal of June 28, 1993, without having to further modify final §773.25. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of final §773.25 provides that a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control can prove that the person subject to the presumption does not and did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The final rule deletes a reference contained in the proposed rule to the paragraph (d) of the proposed rule which provided the required proof for the rebuttal of ownership or control presumptions. As indicated above, that portion of the proposed rule has been withdrawn. Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final §773.25 provides that a challenger can prove that the violation covered by a violation notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The final rule provides that a person challenging the status of a violation under §773.24 will not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited unless such challenge is made by a permittee within the context of §§773.20&hyph;773.21 of this part. As indicated previously, the proposed rule did not explicitly allow challenge of the existence of the violation by a permittee within the context of improvident permit issuance. The proposed rule also did not include the words ``at the time it was cited'' with respect to the concept ``existence of the violation.'' The final rule has provided such clarification. Also, references to proposed §773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. In addition, while no further substantive change has been made to the text of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final §773.25, some editing has been done to clarify the parallel construction of the regulatory text.
