According to international law, the introduction of the sanctions was illegitimate and contrary to the humanitarian law, discrediting the United Nations, Radoje Kontic told domestic and foreign journalists from 22 countries, who participated in the international conference on a new world order and mass communications in Budva, Montenegro, from May 20-22. Ever increasing announcements on unilateral lifting of the U.N. sanctions by Yugoslavia's neighbouring countries and traditional economic partners, which suffer great blockade-induced losses, also discredit the world organization, Kontic said. The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH). Kontic said that Yugoslav government accepted and appreciated every peace initiative which equally treated all three sides in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and those settlements which respected interests of all the three warring peoples. Efforts towards achieving a permanent ceasefire and signing a peace agreement would have to include lifting or, at least, easing the sanctions against Yugoslavia, because this is also part of the peace process, Kontic said. Kontic conveyed Yugoslavia's stand towards a political settlement of crisis in relations between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), which envisages a cessation of hostilities, gradual strengthening of broken economic and other ties between the warring sides, and, in the end, a political settlement of their mutual relations. The Croatian side, due to a split within Croatia's ruling party and its other internal problems, has lately showed signs of impatience and nervousness, Kontic said and warned about unacceptable setting of conditions and prejudiced peace settlements imposed by Croatia. Speaking about the Yugoslav programme of economic revival of the country, Kontic assessed it to be in many aspects unique in the world, because it is the first time that the economy is being reinvigorated under the conditions of rigid sanctions and in isolation from favourable affects by the world market. The Yugoslav Federation, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, is for the open market economy. Yugoslavia will pursue an independent foreign policy in the next period and will link it neither to NATO, nor to any other military alliance, Kontic answered a journalist's question. In explaining the status of Yugoslavia in the Nonaligned Movement, Kontic said that Yugoslavia was still a member of the movement and that it had so far been invited to all meetings. He stressed that after Indonesia had begun to chair the movement, Yugoslavia was not invited to the ministerial conference being held in Cairo. Indonesia has openly sided with the Bosnian Moslems and against the Serbs in the civil war in Bosnia. The Egyptian foreign minister in Cairo tried to accuse Yugoslavia of being involved in the Bosnian conflict and to expel it from the movement which was cofounded by Yugoslavia.
