Such is the volume of gas cut down by the Russian joint stock company "Gazprom" due to late payments. Mikalay Macharnyuk, general director of the Belarusian state enterprise for transportation and supply of gas "Beltransgaz," told BELINFORM that this [reduction] was announced in a telegram. The telegram also warned against a full cut of supplies because the Republic has not paid about 50 billion Russian rubles for fuel. All possible measures to repay debts are now being adopted. In connection with this, the Council of Ministers held a session which discussed ways out of the crisis. One of the ways is, first of all, the urgent payoff of debts by direct consumers of the blue fuel -- industrial enterprises. This question must also be worked out by the National Bank.
