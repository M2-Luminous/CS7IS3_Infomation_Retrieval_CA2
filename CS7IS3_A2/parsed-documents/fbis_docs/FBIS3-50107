Explaining what that means during the "Hallmark of Time" program, Krajisnik said: "We bind ourselves not to take any military action--not even to respond to provocations, although that is very difficult--until 10 February. The world should see once again who is for war and who is for peace." "We suggest that all front lines be frozen, all military activities halted, and relations be normalized. We are ready--which is yet another sacrifice on our part--to discuss all issues, including those that are completely clear and do not cause any problems for us. This is because it is very important to restore peace and, by lifting the sanctions, to return to life as it was before the war, although the victims cannot be brought to life," Krajisnik said.
