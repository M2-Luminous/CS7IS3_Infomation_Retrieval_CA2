Gen. Cedras' statement badly conceals the fact that the Haitian Armed Forces would not be able to offer strong resistance, although it could later tenaciously harass the occupation force, military experts in Port-au-Prince have said. They think it is feared, for example, that the hardline core of the Army might organize an urban guerrilla group to carry out terrorist attacks. The regular troops, 5,300 soldiers and 1,600 policemen, and even the 925 officers come from mostly low-income or poor social classes. The Army has a deputy commander, Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval, and a chief of staff, Brigadier Gen. Philippe Biamby. The High Command is mainly made up of officers of the Class of 1973 of the Military Academy, whose top student was Gen. Cedras, who is 44 years old. This graduation class was the academy's first since being closed by President Francois Duvalier (Papa Doc, in power between 1957- 1971) for fear of military coups. Duvalier thought the officers of his time were subject to too much U.S. influence. On the field, the leaders of the troops are officers of the Class of 1981, to which Lieutenant Colonel Joseph-Michel Francois, 35, Port-au-Prince chief of police, belongs. The Armored Corps, which is the best armored unit, played a key role during recent coup d'etats, including the one on 30 September 1991 against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This unit, which has 26 officers and about 300 men, is stationed in Frere (southern Port-au-Prince) and is equipped with six light armored vehicles (V150 Cadillac) with 20-mm and 90-mm guns and machine guns. Recoilless 75-mm guns and 12.7-mm machine guns mounted on jeeps are also part of their arsenal. The Air Force (another 300 men) has three Italian Siai-marchetti turbo propulsion training planes, a half dozen Cessna planes equipped with rockets, and a few Sikorsky helicopters. The Navy (300 men) has a dozen U.S. made patrol launches equipped with 20-mm guns or 12.7-mm machine guns, but only six are fully operational. The light arms are mostly Galil assault rifles and Uzi submachine guns (Israeli), Brazilian Taurus pistols, and Fal Belgian assault rifles. There is also a small number of U.S.-made M-1, M-16, and M- 18 rifles. Some 3,250 soldiers are stationed in Port-au-Prince, and 250-500 men are in each department. There are also Army and police aides and paramilitary groups, which diplomatic sources estimate to number 30,000. Salaries range from 1,000 gourdes ($333) for a private to 4,000 gourdes ($1,333) for a high-ranking officer.
