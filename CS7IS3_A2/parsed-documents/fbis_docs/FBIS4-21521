Over a hundred separate research projects are to be funded, covering areas ranging from low energy building design, and constructional use of low grade timber, such as forest thinnings, to the integration of virtual reality with standard industry software packages. Announcing the Programme, Mr. Baldry Said: "We have two key priorities for this year. The first is to ensure that the research we are carrying out is what the industry needs and wants. The best way to do this is through collaboration with our industry partners. We will be consulting them on whether the work undertaken for us by the Building Research Establishment meets requirements; and we will be increasing to five million pounds the proportion of research expenditure devoted to projects funded jointly with industry. "So that we can extend joint projects even further in 1995/6, we will be improving our guidance for prospective future partners on the opportunities for collaborative research. "Our second priority is to ensure that industry makes the most of research results. We will be looking very carefully at the way the research is taken up and exploited. "On top of our own research programme, we are working with the construction industry to develop a research strategy for the whole industry that will provide a cohesive programme across all areas. Our aim is to maximise the impact that research and innovation has on the industry's efficiency and competitiveness." Notes For Editors The following are examples of work to be funded as part of the 1994/95 collaborative research programme: -- a project with the Richard Rogers Partnership which will aim to assist the design of advanced low energy buildings across Europe through workshops, exhibitions and publication of a report aimed at design practitioners; - projects with the Centre for Window and Cladding Technology focusing on the use of advanced glazing materials; thermally improved frames; fixings for natural stone; and the performance of glazing gaskets; -- a LINK initiative involving DOE [Department of Energy] and the Science and Engineering Research Council [SERC] aimed at improving construction quality and productivity through a greater integration of design and construction. Academics and industry representatives will work together towards the application of more innovative design and construction technologies including greater use of IT tools. DOE and SERC will contribute 2.5 million pounds each towards this initiative over a six year period; -- a project with the University of Salford and the Advanced Robotic Research Laboratory aimed at producing a low cost tool which will integrate virtual reality functionality with standard industry software packages to improve the presentation of new designs for professionals and clients; -- a project with the Tavistock Institute and contracting organisations within the industry to improve the approach to procurement, management of materials supply contracts and subcontracting in general. The objective is to shift the emphasis from securing minimum price on materials and services contracts to a partnership approach between the different organisations involved in design and construction thus achieving better value for money and quality in the final building; -- preparation with the Building Services Research and Information Association of a guide for building services companies on the opportunities in the Chinese and CIS markets. This follows similar studies of market opportunities in Europe and the aim is to encourage British companies to exploit these two potential markets areas; -- a study with Ceram Building Technology on new approaches to masonry cavity walling taking into account the need for better levels of thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption and thereby CO2 emissions. The study will look particularly at the prevention of rain penetration, ensuring that wall thicknesses are economic but effective and that improved levels of insulation can be achieved in a practical, buildable way; -- the production with the Construction Industry Research and Information Association of a series of guidance notes which outline the key environmental impacts of a number of common building and construction elements and systems. The aim is to assist designers at the preliminary design stages of a project and once a basic solution has been selected, to provide valuable information for specifiers and material and product manufacturers; -- a three year project with Hooke Forest Construction Ltd to develop ways of maximising the use in construction of low grade timber materials, such as forest thinnings, through new skills, technologies, products and markets. The aim would be to reduce the UK's dependence on timber imports and provide forest conservation; -- a project with Billington Osborne-Moss Engineering Ltd (BOMEL) which seeks to benchmark the productivity of the UK construction industry. The project will develop a detailed methodology for the measurement of productivity and look to transfer the productivity levels achieved on successful construction sites to others across the country; -- an extension of the Building Research Establishment's BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method) programme to schools. BREEAM has been highly successful in alerting developers, designers and others to the contribution they can make to reducing the environmental impact of their buildings. It has so far been based around the assessment of the environmental impact of new build offices and the subsequent award of a certificate to those reaching the required standard. The objective would be to extend coverage of the scheme to existing school buildings and to produce an associated educational pack for teachers and pupils thereby raising public awareness of these issues. Research funded by the DOE will continue to support its statutory responsibilities for Building Regulations and also help improve the efficiency of the construction processes and thereby the quality, performance and reliability of buildings.
