FR941125-1-00042 FR941125-1-00008 E:GRAPHICSep25NO94.004 Where: t 0.975 = t-value (see table 1&hyph;5). 8.4␣Error. Calculate the error (i.e., calibration error, zero drift, and CD), Er, as follows: E:GRAPHICSEP25NO94.005 Table 1&hyph;5._ T - Values 1n a 1 t 0.975 2 12.706 3 4.303 4 3.182 5 2.776 6 2.571 7 2.447 8 2.365 9 2.306 10 2.262 11 2.228 12 2.201 13 2.179 14 2.160 15 2.145 16 2.131 a The values in this table are already corrected for n-1 degrees of freedom. Use n equal to the number of individual values. 8.5␣Conversion of Opacity Values for Monitor Pathlength to Emission Outlet Pathlength. When the monitor pathlength is different from the emission outlet pathlength, use either of the following equations to convert from one basis to the other (this conversion may be automatically calculated by the monitoring system): E:GRAPHICSEP25NO94.006 E:GRAPHICSEP25NO94.007 Where: Op 1 = Opacity of the effluent based upon L 1 . Op 2 = Opacity of the effluent based upon L 2 . L 1 = Monitor pathlength. L 2 = Emission outlet pathlength. OD 1 = Optical density of the effluent based upon L 1 . OD 2 = Optical density of the effluent based upon L 2 . 8.6␣Mean Response Wavelength. Calculate the mean of the effective spectral response curve from the individual responses, g i , at the wavelength values, L i , as follows: E:GRAPHICSEP25NO94.008 Where: L i = The wavelength at which the response g i is calculated at 20 nm intervals. g i = The value of the response at L i . 9.
