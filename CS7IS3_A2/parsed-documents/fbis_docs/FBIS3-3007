"I believe the visit will play a very important role for further development of the Sino-Japanese relations and cooperation in economic fields," he said. During the visit, China and Japan will formally sign an agreement on cooperation between the two governments in strengthening environmental protection, Qian said. On the relations between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and between China and the Republic of Korea, Qian said, "our stand remains unchanged." He said that Premier Li Peng has made it clear in his government work report that China has further strengthened its good-neighborly relations with the surrounding countries and the friendship between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has grown. China has steadily expanded its mutually beneficial cooperation relations with Japan, Russia and the Republic of Korea, Qian said.
