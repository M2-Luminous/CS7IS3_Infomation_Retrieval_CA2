PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio termed as timely and welcome the initiative, which will settle the situation in southern Chiapas State, adding "everything done to attain peace in the region is welcome." PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said everything that leads to the achievement of peace and justice must be supported by all Mexicans, adding that if the amnesty is the only option that guarantees peace, "I support the government's decision." Fernandez de Cevallos said events in Chiapas do not endanger the conditions for holding elections this year; quite the contrary--they prove the people's clamor for a fair and democratic electoral process. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD candidate, said the proposed amnesty for the armed people in Chiapas represents a step toward creating conditions that allow a settlement and understanding on the conflict. Cardenas--who termed as positive the fact that the government has decreed a ceasefire and is willing to decree an amnesty--stated his confidence solutions will soon be found to the state's problems. The PRD candidate considered it urgently necessary to grant Indian representatives access to positions in which decisions are adopted to solve the conflict. Cardenas demanded the replacement of acting Chiapas Governor Elmar Setzer with another who has the Indian communities' support and recognition.
