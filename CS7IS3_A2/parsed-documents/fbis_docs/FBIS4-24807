The spare parts and components which are stacked up in ordinary plants are not found there. One person operates several machines. Inspectors and repairmen go to and fro on the spot ready to solve problems right away. Plaques giving production instructions in the workshop are written tidily..... This is what they have become since adopting an improved production method. In recent years, in order to give priority to improving economic returns in the course of modernizing enterprise, the Number One Auto Group has enhanced its competitiveness in the market, boldly reformed its traditional method of flow mass production, and gradually and thoroughly introduced an improved method of production. The improved production method is a unique one created by Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation in the 30 years since the 1950's and is considered another revolution in management following the "mass production method" created in the United States in the early 1920's. Its goal is to continuously reduce costs and waste and achieve zero stocks, product variety, and the maximization of economic returns with the fewest inputs. Today, economically developed countries around the world, especially in the auto industry, are learning and promoting this production method. Number One Automobile began to adopt the improved production method in the company itself in 1992. First, they chose five special plants, nine workshops, and three production lines with different technological status, processing methods, and pace of production for experimentation. After adopting the improved production method for one year, the jack shaft plant doubled its originally planned production, increasing its labor productivity by nearly 100 percent. In the first year of pursuing the improved production method, Changchun's gear plant found its output value had increased by 44 percent, labor productivity by 37 percent, and per capita profits by 25 percent over the previous year. After obtaining experience, the company, trying to make a breakthrough in production management, reformed its traditional mass production method: They achieved "one-flow" production by changing the original phased-push process to a successive one-phase process, thus greatly reducing stocks between processes, reducing the amount of circulating funds used, improving processing quality, and greatly reducing waste. They succeeded in reducing the number of production workers and achieved full capacity by having one person operate several machines rather than one machine as in the past, thus greatly improving production efficiency. They changed the original large-scale production with a small number of batches to small-scale production with a large number of batches, thus facilitating the organization of varied production, saving warehouse space, and reducing rotating workloads. They changed the original delivery of stocks to just-in-time delivery, thus smoothing production and maintaining orderly on-site production. By adopting improved production, Number One Automobile has already obtained preliminary results and its economic returns have obviously improved. In 1993, its sales income increased by 45 percent over the previous year and profits and income increased by 53 percent, and many of its economic and technological indicators reached historic highs. Moreover, this improved production method has also been integrated with reform of the labor, wage distribution, and social security systems. Staff numbers have been reduced and have shown negative growth, and the enterprise has become "slim." A hot wave of "building a factory with improved production" has now surged in Number One Automobile, where leaders pay close attention to improving methods, staff and workers emphasize improved methods, and everyone stresses work improvement.
