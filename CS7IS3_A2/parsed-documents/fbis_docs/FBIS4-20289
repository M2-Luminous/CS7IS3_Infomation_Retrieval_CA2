Imset] [Text] Ankara--A division has struck the Turkish media on how to treat the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and whether to allow its supporters to freely express their views on television and in the press. Many journalists and commentators who claim to be secularists have launched a campaign to suppress reporting on the RP and to block Islamic activists from expressing their opinions in their newspapers and on their programs. Those who argue that the RP, as a political party, has the right to express itself and that it is the duty of journalists to insure impartial reporting are rapidly becoming a minority in Turkey's confused, state-subsidized yet bankrupt and ignorant press world. Meanwhile, fear is growing among the more responsible and objective newsmen that the concerted reaction against the RP could strengthen the radical Islamists within this party and weaken the stance of the currently-dominant reformists and moderates. Concern has increased over the past week that attempts at pulling the Welfare into the system and make it part of the establishment rather than being against it may fail in the view of a systematic attack on this party. Reports from within the RP are that the media's reaction to this party which is influencing mainly urban-based masses is leading increasingly to a frustration which radical groups are skillfully exploiting. The first disagreements on this issue have surfaced since Tuesday [26 April] with SABAH columnist Mehmet Ali Birand on Monday night interviewing the Welfare Party's (RP) acting group chairman, Sevket Kazan, on television. Kazan, who lashed out at the media for blasting at his party, disclosed during Birand's popular 32nd Day program that certain circles identifying themselves as "secularists" were sending threatening letters both to his party and to other individuals. The politician also showed some of the letters bearing pictures of modern and secular Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and promising on behalf of the "secularists" to "fight to the last drop of our blood." "They are the ones who have declared war on us," Kazan complained, referring to criticism of RP Chairman Necmettin Erbakan's earlier remarks that the Welfare would come to power and "60 million will decide on whether this transition will be a peaceful one or a bloody one." This remark, scissored out of a lengthy speech Erbakan made to his party's Parliament group, was a reference to threats targeting the party, Kazan explained. As Birand rightfully expressed on Wednesday, the Welfare Party phenomena has become a test for democracy in Turkey both for this party and the country altogether. But for allowing Kazan to speak in his program and for letting an Islamic activist woman argue her views, Birand has fallen under attack, like several other of his colleagues in the Turkish press, for giving the Welfare the opportunity to propagate. In clear defiance of the Press Code of Professional Ethics which has been approved of by all major newspapers, Birand has been blasted by his own colleagues over the past two days. On Tuesday, respected and widely popular columnist Hincal Uluc, who writes on the same page as Birand, lashed out at the latter for allowing "Shariah (Islamic order) supporters" to appear on television one after another and stressed that "Shariah and democracy are two separate things which cannot go together." "Now tell me Mehmet Ali," he asked. "Why should such an easy propaganda opportunity be given on the country's most widely watched television channel to people who can freely establish their own radios, television, newspapers and magazines?" Birand's staunch rival Emin Colasan of HURRIYET, a journalist who often expresses the views of Turkey's hard-liners in his column and who recently boasted of being a "Mehmetchik (soldier) journalist," joined in the criticism the following day. Quoting Uluc in his own column titled something like "make a good profit Mehmet Ali" and using idioms to belittle Birand's program staff, Colasan said this journalist had done wrong by allowing Muslim politicians to appear on the television and for failing to give Kazan a hard time. Earlier, Colasan had referred to Birand as among the "ignorant, sold out" circles with bad intentions. "They are spoiling and pumping up the Refah and Shariah supporters," he said in a similar accusative commentary on Friday. It is evident by now that a concerted campaign is underway to tackle with the Refah victory and everyone who gives them the opportunity to express their views, including objective journalists, are being accused of anything short of treason. "What kind of democratic mentality is this?" asked one columnist during the week. "You will allow a party you like to be elected, but when a party you dislike is elected, you say this cannot be." Reaction to Welfare throughout Turkey's larger cities appears also to be serving the government and other power circles in this secular country. Secular reaction, gradually taking the form of an anti-Islamic trend, is clearly boosting public support to the military in a time Turkey is advancing towards a new economic and political crisis. On Wednesday, HURRIYET reported that the Office of the Chief of Staff had ordered all officers and petty officers to wear badges of Ataturk symbolizing their belief in his principals. Last week, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller reportedly told U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington that if her economic package or government failed, the Welfare would be coming to Turkey. The concerted effort turning the spotlights on the Welfare Party is clearly serving both government and military circles in Turkey for now. But the threat is that it is increasingly forcing the Welfare to move out of the system, isolating its reformist and moderate elements and increasing the weight of radical activists within the party. Some observers believe the policy adopted towards Refah is now similar to that launched against the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) earlier this year, aimed perhaps at pushing this party out of the system as well and forcing it into a radicalization.
