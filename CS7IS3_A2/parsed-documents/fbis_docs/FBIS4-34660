According to an official, the six-month deadlock was broken after an agreement was reached on the discussion of the capital goods issue, the most sensitive point of the negotiations, and after Brazil raised a "very flexible" proposal on informatics. Nevertheless, these optimistic prospects were partially shadowed by an announcement made by former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the candidate with the best chances of winning the upcoming elections in his country. Sanguinetti announced that, if he regains power, he would ask that the common tariff system be postponed for four years. The Economy Ministry hopes that an agreement can be announced during the presidential summit slated for 14 and 15 July in Buenos Aires. The current differences concerning capital goods are extremely pronounced, as Argentina has scrapped tariffs on all equipment, irrespective of origin, while Brazil protects its manufacturers by levying customs duties going as high as 35 percent. During the negotiations, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's team proposed a 12-percent compromise, but the Brazilians are intent on 16 percent. One negotiator reported that "a good settlement might be to establish a 14 percent tariff as a goal to be achieved within a longer period of time, let us say 2006." The countries would then later have to work out an agreement on informatics and telecommunications. Applying the criterion of compensation between the two leading partners did the trick in reconciling their differences. A diplomat recalled that "when Argentina reduced the tariff on the import of equipment to zero, the Brazilians lost the advantage they had with the preferential tariff. Cavallo then promised to `indemnify' the injured party. Brazil has now liberalized the purchase of meat, and the Argentine producers are now the injured party." Argentine Commerce and Investment Secretary Carlos Sanchez discussed the future incorporation of Chile into Mercosur with his colleagues from Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay: Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch; Finance Under Secretary Juan Ignacio Garcia Peluffo; and Integration Vice Minister Ruben Fadlala respectively. Some 30 officials from the four countries also participated in this meeting. An Argentine official said: "If next month, the presidents announce the coming into force of a free trade zone (trade liberalization between the four partners) and a customs union (including a common external tariff) as of 1 January 1995, we will then have the rest of the year to negotiate with the other Latin American Integration Association member countries. Another two key subjects discussed at the meeting included the system of origin of goods (the way to prevent smuggling due to the difference in tariffs, which will persist in several sectors for more than a decade), and the duty-free zones. Commenting on his position on Mercosur, which is supported by the Chamber of Industry of Uruguay, Sanguinetti said "we have to be realistic and postpone this transition stage for another four years," as the four member countries "are not in a position to reach agreement on a common external tariff at present."
