FR940527-1-00122 FR940527-1-00014 a. Updating the FY 1982 and FY 1987 Hospital-Specific Rates for FY 1995. We are proposing to increase the hospital-specific rates by 1.4 percent (the hospital market basket percentage increase minus 2.2 percentage points) for sole community hospitals located in all areas in FY 1995. Section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;66, provides that the update factor applicable to the hospital-specific rates for sole community hospitals equals the update factor provided under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, which, for FY 1995, is the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points. Prior to FY 1994, the update to the hospital specific rates was applied according to a hospital's cost reporting period. However, beginning with FY 1994, the update to the hospital specific rate is applied on a Federal fiscal year basis under amended section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii). Section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii) required us to apply the FY 1994 update taking into account the portion of the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during FY 1993 that occurred during FY 1994. In our September 1, 1993 final rule with comment (58 FR 46308), we described a methodology for calculating a ``deemed FY 1993'' update which affected payment rates in FY 1994. Based on public comments, we have revised our interpretion of section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii) and decided to prorate the FY 1994 applicable update based on the number of months after the end of a hospital's cost reporting period that occurred in FY 1994. This revision was outlined in a separate final rule. b. Calculation of Hospital-Specific Rate. For sole community hospitals, the applicable FY 1995 hospital-specific rate would be calculated by multiplying a hospital's hospital-specific rate for the preceding fiscal year by the applicable update factor (that is, 2.4 percent), which equals the average update for all prospective system hospitals. In addition, the hospital-specific rate would be adjusted by the budget neutrality adjustment factor (that is, .997647) as discussed in section II.A.4.b. of this addendum. This resulting rate would be used in determining under which rate a sole community hospital is paid for its discharges beginning on or after October 1, 1994, based on the formula set forth above. 3. General Formula for Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for Hospitals Located in Puerto Rico Beginning On or After October 1, 1994 and Before October 1, 1995 a. Puerto Rico Rate. The Puerto Rico prospective payment rate is determined as follows: Step 1_Select the appropriate adjusted average standardized amount considering the large urban or other designation of the hospital (see Table 1c, section V of the addendum). Step 2_Multiply the labor-related portion of the standardized amount by the appropriate wage index (see Tables 4a and 4b, section V of the addendum). Step 3_Add the amount from Step 2 and the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount. Step 4_Multiply the result in Step 3 by 75 percent. Step 5_Multiply the amount from Step 4 by the appropriate DRG relative weight (see Table 5, section V of the addendum). b. National Rate. The national prospective payment rate is determined as follows: Step 1_Multiply the labor-related portion of the national average standardized amount (see Table 1c, section V of the addendum) by the appropriate wage index. Step 2_Add the amount from Step 1 and the nonlabor-related portion of the national average standardized amount. Step 3_Multiply the result in Step 2 by 25 percent. Step 4_Multiply the amount from Step 3 by the appropriate DRG relative weight (see Table 5, section V of the addendum). The sum of the Puerto Rico rate and the national rate computed above equals the prospective payment for a given discharge for a hospital located in Puerto Rico.
