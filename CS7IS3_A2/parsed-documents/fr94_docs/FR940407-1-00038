FR940407-1-00038 FR940407-1-00012 A. Legal Rationale Two landmark Supreme Court cases defined the legal principles underlying rate of return regulation and provided the notion of a fair rate of return. The two cases, Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 262 U.S. 679 (1923) and Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Company, 320 U.S. 391 (1944), established that investors in companies subject to rate regulation must be allowed an opportunity to earn returns sufficient to attract capital and comparable to those they would expect from investments in other firms for incurring the same amount of risk, and that revenues must not only cover operating expenses, but capital costs as well. B. Economic Rationale The economic rationale for setting the allowable rate of return of a regulated enterprise equal to its cost of capital is that the regulated firm's customers will thereby pay the lowest cost for service in the long run. 4 For example, if a regulator sets the allowable rate of return above the cost of capital, the firm's stockholders will realize earnings in excess of those they could earn on alternative investments of comparable risk. Such excess earnings are paid for by the firm's customers in the form of prices higher than those that they would otherwise be required to pay. If, on the other hand, a regulator sets the allowable rate of return below the cost of capital, stockholders will realize earnings less than they could on alternative investments of comparable risk. In the short run, the firm's customers may benefit because they pay prices lower than those they would otherwise be required to pay. In the long run, however, the firm's stockholders will be unwilling to continue to invest their funds, and the firm will, therefore, lack the requisite financial capital for maintaining and augmenting the firm's physical plant and equipment. Customers, in turn, will be supplied with a lesser quantity and/or quality of service. 4 Setting the allowable rate of return equal to the cost of capital also ensures that society's supply of capital is used most productively. Because capital markets are considered to be highly competitive, the cost of new capital is an accurate gauge of that capital's value in alternative uses. When the allowable rate of return is greater than the cost of capital, investors will supply too much capital to a regulated firm, thereby diverting capital from alternative investments where it could be more productive. Conversely, when the allowable rate of return is less than the cost of capital, investors will supply too little capital to a regulated firm, thereby allocating funds to less productive investments. Such a misallocation of resources represents a welfare loss for society as a whole. C. Methodologies The Commission uses a version of the Comparable Earnings Test (``CET'') to determine the reasonableness of rates of return. The carrier's projected rate of return ((net income after taxes + interest expense)/rate base 5 ) is compared with the rate of return on total capital earned by U.S. manufacturing firms over an extended period of time_the benchmark rate of return. Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the benchmark for current trends in rates of return, the cost of money and relative risk. 5 Rate base is a carrier's investment in Commission-regulated activities. It consists of investments in vessels less accumulated depreciation, other property and equipment less accumulated depreciation, and working capital.
