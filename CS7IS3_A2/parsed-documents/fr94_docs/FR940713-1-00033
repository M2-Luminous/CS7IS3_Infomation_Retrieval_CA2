FR940713-1-00033 FR940713-1-00002 The Potential of Mandatory Requirements To Reduce the Frequency and Severity of the Risk of Injury The information considered by the Commission indicates that the potential of mandatory requirements to reduce risks of strangulation death and injury associated with crib toys is limited. A 1987 analysis of strangulation injuries associated with crib toys identified three hazard patterns involved in 32 fatalities. In seven of these fatalities, an article worn by the child, such as a bib or a necklace, caught on a protrusion of a crib toy (24). After publication of the ANPR, the Commission undertook additional work to identify characteristics of hazardous protrusions. However, the Commission has not been able to develop an objective test to distinguish those protrusions which present a strangulation hazard from those which do not (21, 25). Another hazard pattern identified in the 1987 analysis was that of postural strangulation. In six of the fatalities described in that analysis, the child's head and neck were suspended over a horizontal cord. All but one of these cases involved crib gyms. The 1987 analysis recommended that the horizontal member of a crib gym should consist of a rigid structure rather than a cord, and that the design of a crib gym should not allow installation of the product below the height of the top rails of the crib sides (24). These recommendations were intended to eliminate the risk of postural strangulation associated with a crib gym left in a crib occupied by a child who is able to push up on his or her hands and knees (typically, a child older than five months of age). However, after consideration of more recently developed information, the Commission is concerned that a design requirement for a rigid horizontal member on a crib gym could create other risks of injury to a child who is able to push up on his or her hands and knees. If one end of a crib gym with a rigid horizontal member became detached from the side of the crib and rested on the crib mattress, the crib gym might provide a means by which such a child could climb over the side rail of the crib (21). Additionally, if a crib gym with a rigid horizontal member were installed near the end panel of a crib, another risk of strangulation injury might result if that placement created an opening which would be large enough to allow a child's head to enter, but which would be too small for the head to exit if turned to another orientation (21). The third hazard pattern discussed in the 1987 analysis of strangulation incidents associated with crib toys resulted when a child's neck became entangled in one or more strings or cords of a crib toy. Four of the fatalities discussed in that analysis resulted when a child's neck became entangled in two or more cords attached to a stuffed toy animal (24). A comment on the ANPR from an association of toy manufacturers observed that stuffed animal toys with attached suspension cords are prohibited by the voluntary toy safety standard, and that such toys have not been manufactured for several years (8). Two other fatalities discussed in the 1987 analysis resulted when a child's neck became entangled in a single vertical cord which extended from a crib toy (24). To address that risk of strangulation, the 1987 analysis recommended that the length of any vertical string attached to a crib toy should not exceed six inches. However, the comment from the association of toy manufacturers states that no report of any fatality resulting from entanglement in a single vertical cord extending from a crib toy has been received since 1986 when the voluntary toy safety standard was revised to restrict the length of such cords to less than 12 inches.
