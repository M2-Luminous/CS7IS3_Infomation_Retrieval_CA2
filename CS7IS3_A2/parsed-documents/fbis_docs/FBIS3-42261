The conclusions of the Cypriot security services' investigation on this matter have been recently conveyed to Jerusalem. The Cypriot authorities have recently taken action to foil the Iranian plans. Among other actions, they prohibited the entry of several Iranian citizens to the island. According to Jerusalem, Israel "monitors" the developments and is in close contact with the Cypriot authorities. The investigation conducted by the Cypriot security services showed that Iranians have recently purchased houses in Cyprus. In addition, lively traffic has been noticed between the two countries. A probe revealed that a plan to make Cyprus a terror base was behind these phenomena.
