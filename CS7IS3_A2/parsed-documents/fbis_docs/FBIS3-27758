The ROK Defense Ministry thinks that this would contribute to beefing up the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK. At the same time, it assumes a prudent attitude toward this issue. The Defense Ministry is trying to minimize the importance of the report and says: "This plan is being carried out on a normal basis as part of the U.S. plan to modernize its forces in the ROK." It says that the deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK was decided at the 23d ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting in October of 1991. Patriot missiles won a good reputation by intercepting Iraqi Scuds during the January 1991 Gulf war. After the war, the United States persistently asked the ROK to buy them. However, it decided to deploy them in the U.S. Forces in the ROK when the ROK concluded that they are not suitable to our geographical conditions. The Defense Ministry anticipates Patriot missiles would be used to intercept MiG's in times of war because they are ground-to-air missiles and are capable of intercepting aircraft, even though the primary purpose of their deployment would be to intercept North Korean Nodong No. 1 missiles. Military officials predict that they will be the latest generation of Patriot missiles whose capabilities to find targets and range have improved significantly and are capable of correctly intercepting and completely destroying enemy missiles' warheads in midair to minimize damage on the ground. However, some military experts say the missiles may not prove efficient in the ROK because the battlefield depth is a mere 40 km, the warning time for a North Korean attack is short, the missile's hit rate is a mere 50 to 60 percent, and because it is not appropriate to use the missiles in a populous area. They also say that 36 Patriot launchers are not enough to contain enemy air strikes because North Korea is expected to fly aircraft over 2,000 times a day in wartime. They also say the deployment of Patriot missiles is important in mitigating people's uneasiness over Nodong No. 1 missiles. Military officials concerned also say replacing the Cobra helicopter unit with two Apache helicopter divisions is part of the 1989 ROK-U.S. joint defense capability improvement plan. Apache attack helicopters annihilated Iraqi tank units during the Gulf war. The helicopters are armed with devices to automatically identify and pursue targets, with night firing devices, and (Hydra) 70-mm rockets. The two-seater Apache flies at 270 km an hour and weighs 9,525 kg. The Defense Ministry says the deployment of aircraft carriers on the Korean peninsula is related to the decision made at the 1993 ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting to transfer the wartime operational command over the 7th U.S. Fleet to the commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command: In an emergency, aircraft carriers would be rapidly deployed to the Korean peninsula as part of the rapid deterrence forces concept. It is expected that the 7th Fleet's ultramodern aircraft carrier Carl Vinson (91,400 tonnes) and conventional aircraft carrier Independence (86,000 tonnes) would be deployed. The Defense Ministry considers these U.S. deployment plans to be a carrot-and-stick strategy for its nuclear negotiations with North Korea because these plans were mapped out long ago and because there is nothing worrisome about North Korea's current military situation.
