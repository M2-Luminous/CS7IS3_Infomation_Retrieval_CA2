Jiang made the call at a meeting today with the ASEAN Interparliamentary Organization (AIPO) delegation headed by Jose C. de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. Much potential is yet to be tapped in expanding economic cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, Jiang said, adding that there is already a sound base for mutual beneficial cooperation and the prospect for further cooperation is bright. While extending a welcome to the AIPO delegation, Jiang said the speaker and all the parliamentarians in the delegation are old friends of the National People's Congress (NPC) and of the Chinese people as well. The delegation members have for many years done a lot of useful work in enhancing ASEAN-China relations and promoting exchanges between AIPO and the NPC. The friendly exchanges between China and the ASEAN countries and the friendship between the peoples date back a long time, Jiang said. At the moment, he noted, their friendly cooperation is deepening continuously, with fruitful results in political, economic and scientific and cultural fields. Congratulating China for its magnificent achievements in economic development over the past years, De Venecia said China has become a "significant force" of stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. He hoped to expand contacts and exchanges with the NPC so as to effect a better mutual understanding. Present at the meeting were Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, and Shi Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee.
