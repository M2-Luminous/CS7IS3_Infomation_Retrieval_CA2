French warships have taken on board 150 people -- mainly women and children -- and taken them from Aden to the port of Djibouti, together with staffers of other foreign embassies. From there they will be brought to Moscow in the near future by a special flight organized by the Ministry for Emergency Situations. In all, some 950 Russians are in Yemen on official business. They are diplomats, civilian and military specialists, and representatives of Aeroflot and of commercial organizations. The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has informed us that at the first stage the objective is to evacuate all Russian personnel from the southern part of Yemen, where events have become most alarming. The situation is somewhat calmer around Sanaa, the northern capital of this Arab state of 9 million inhabitants. In the event of a further exacerbation of the conflict, urgent measures will be taken to ensure the safety of all Russian citizens. [passage omitted]
