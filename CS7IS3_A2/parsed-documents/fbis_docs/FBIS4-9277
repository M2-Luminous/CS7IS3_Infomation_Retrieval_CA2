If you cross 50 percent of the distance and you feel tired, do not return, continue swimming, because to finish the swim means less effort than to return. I have the feeling that Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Rabin made the most efforts and as Churchill said, we are at the beginning of the end. We are glad to be here in Bucharest. There is something about this town that makes Arabs and Israelis understand each other better here than in other places. [applause] There is a precedent to this event. You know that this flirtation of ours started in Bucharest when former [Egyptian] President Sadat and President Begin [title as heard] had started negotiations and as a result of it peace with Egypt was achieved, which is very dear to our hearts and which was very highly regarded by the rest of the world. [applause] I believe that in the same way, the fact that the chairman of the PLO, who represents the Palestinian people, and I are here and we are meeting, is not a simple coincidence. The conflict has lasted for 100 years. The Jewish people and the Palestinian people, two peoples that were born in the Middle East, are meeting in hopes of reviving themselves. Unfortunately, instead of holding a favorable meeting and achieving an understanding, there was a bitter conflict, and not only there. The Palestinians are part of the Arab world and the Israelis are part of the Jewish world, and they meet on a small stretch of land where the conflict has become increasingly dangerous and terrible. We felt that our history is much more important than geography in order to solve problems. The conflict has continued and many young Arab people lost their lives. Many young Israelis lost their lives. Women and children were killed and their houses were destroyed. It is not easy, within the middle of this history of hatred, suspicion, and dissatisfaction and among all the manifestations of extremism, weapons, arms, and guns, to try to rearrange the situation and reach a new understanding. If I may speak as a Jew, four months ago we signed an accord with the Vatican, with the Catholic world. This is an important diplomatic event that takes place once in 2000 years, but it happened indeed and the pope said that all of us -- Muslims, Jews, and Christians -- are Abraham's children. I told the pope that I believe that we are indeed Abraham's children but the journey that we have made cost us so much, my God, and I pray to the Lord, we do not want to create an accident in this journey. It is our wish to achieve a similar understanding with the Arab world. As you know, democracy is not only the right to be equal. Democracy is also the right to be different. We can be different and live in peace and understanding. I know how difficult it was for Chairman 'Arafat to make this historic decision, while surrounded by this hatred and distrust in his leadership with so many demands. [words indistinct] a period in which the grand mufti of Jerusalem refused to offer his hand. I believe that for Chairman 'Arafat it was equally as difficult to offer his hand as it was for us. And now we are trying something that one or two years ago seemed completely impossible. Allow me to make a remark in connection with the nature of the accord. What makes it so difficult are not only complications, the geographic layout, and national feelings and the interference of so many forces. What makes it so difficult is to draw permanent lines because we cannot establish a map under the current conditions. We are also talking about Europe now. The idea of sovereignty was introduced by the big thinkers of the world in the 17th century and since then all of them wanted clear borders, strong armies, strong customs barriers and each of them wanted to live in his own nest, separated from the rest of the world. Sovereignty justified walls, sovereignty justified armies and conflicts. But now we are trying to make things differently, following the example of the end of the Cold War. It is a unique step in diplomatic experience to try to establish new relations even before having permanent borders. The big attempt on the part of the PLO and Israel is to be able to say: We agree, we do not have a permanent map yet, but we have a permanent goal, namely we have decided to start off on a journey from conflict to peace. But first of all, we agreed to start off together and create a new situation. The difficulties in our negotiations have two parts: When Mr. 'Arafat is negotiating with us, we make difficulties for him, and when we negotiate with him, he makes other difficulties for us. But each party makes things look different. If each side had to negotiate with its own people there would be no problem. And they say, why do you make concessions, why are you so weak, why do you give in? And then again we have the third difficulty, and this difficulty lies in the fact that there is no precedent. We cannot go to a book, open it, consult it, and see how we can conclude peace between a movement that is called the PLO and a country that is called Israel, without deciding right away on sovereignty and borders. We want to achieve something new and promising and I believe it is both a moral and political decision. The Jewish people have never dominated another nation for 2000 years. We do not wish in our lifetime to dominate the lives of the Palestinian people. This is against our moral principles. [applause]. Second, what the new age requires from us is to be separate from national viewpoints and to cooperate from an economic viewpoint. You can see what is happening in the Balkans, in Yugoslavia, and you know that in politics it is exactly like in your own kitchen. You can break eggs and make an omelet. But from an omelet you can no longer make a whole egg. Each politician has to be very careful not to make an omelet from each situation and create a situation in which nobody can live freely according to his wishes. On the other hand, let us cooperate from an economic point of view. As Chairman 'Arafat said, let us build an economic Benelux while each of us will follow his own path as people and nation. Thus we want not only to permit the Palestinian people to live in dignity, but to lead their own lives, choose their own leaders, and appoint their own judges and police. It is not our wish to be leaders, judges, and police officers of the Palestinian people. They have to lead their lives alone. But from an economic viewpoint, we wish to build a new Middle East. How should we do this? You know, the war has its own cost and the peace has its own price. The cost of the war for Europeans, for those in the Balkans, for the Russians is huge. In the Middle East in the past 10 years the countries of the Middle East have spent $1 trillion to purchase weapons, that is, $1,000 billion. There is no Marshall plan that could offer so much money and if we could reduce this [words indistinct].
