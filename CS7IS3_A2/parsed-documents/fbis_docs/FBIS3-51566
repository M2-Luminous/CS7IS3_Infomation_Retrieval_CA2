The Electoral Tribunal magistrates' decision is intended to deprive our organizations of the right to participate in the upcoming elections and thus put us in a disadvantageous position compared to other political groups. Being the active organizations we are and based on our legal status as political parties involved in their organization process, instead of refraining from action, we are issuing an appeal to all our supporters, urging them to double their efforts, defend our principles, and actively participate in the presidential campaign of Professor Ruben Carles and his slate, to which we offer our total support. We will thus support the Panamanian people's hope for a true change. (signed) Dr. Arrigo Guardia (signed) Professor Noris de Correa
