The 51-vehicle convoy carrying 168 UN peackeepers entered the enclave around 0115 (2315 GMT), said UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Yvon Desjardins. The British company will reinforce some 500 UN troops already controlling the NATO exclusion zone and ceasefire around the hard- hit enclave. It left Sarajevo Saturday but was stopped at a Serb checkpoint in Rogatica, only 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of the Bosnian capital by Serbs objecting to what they said was excess weapons and cameras. UNPROFOR said Wednesday in Sarajevo it had been forced to bow to Serb demands to remove some of the ammunition and cameras from the convoy.
