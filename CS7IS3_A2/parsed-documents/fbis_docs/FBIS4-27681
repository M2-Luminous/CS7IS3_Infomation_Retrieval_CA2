The conference was attended by a large number of correspondents from the foreign and local mass media and by the press attaches of a number of foreign embassies in Vietnam. In reply to a question raised by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the schedule and timing for Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to the Russian Federation, and another question posed by a REUTERS correspondent on what republics the prime minister will visit and on the subjects to be discussed during the visit, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: At the invitation of the prime ministers of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will visit these countries in the near future. These countries used to have age-old traditional relations with Vietnam. But following some eventful changes, the relations between Vietnam and these countries have not lived up to their potential. Now that these countries and Vietnam wish to develop their friendly and cooperative relations, a number of agreements on cooperation have been signed and various bilateral and international issues have also been discussed between Vietnam and each of these countries. This will be the first visit by the Vietnamese prime minister to these countries. A NIKKEI correspondent asked: According to an ITAR-TASS dispatch, Senior General Doan Khue will visit the DPRK on 16 June. Is this news accurate? The Vietnamese spokesperson said: Senior General Doan Khue, Vietnamese defense minister, will visit the DPRK in the near future at the invitation of the DPRK defense minister. This visit is designed to strengthen the relations between the armed forces and peoples of the two countries. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also made public a number of important diplomatic activities relating to Vietnam and many other countries in the world.
