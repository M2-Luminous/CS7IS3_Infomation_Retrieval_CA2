Meeting with the deputies from Fujian, Qiao Shi said: With the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, Fujian is at the forefront of reform and opening up. The discussion of giving Xiamen legislative power is part of the NPC agenda. Fujian's development has been quite fast since the adoption of the policy of reform and opening up, especially in recent years. While the fast growth can be attributed to the policy, it can also be attributed to the hard work of people in Fujian. Fujian not only has made substantial headway in opening up to the outside world, but also in developing relations with overseas Chinese and countrymen in Taiwan, and you have also attached importance to intensifying material and spiritual construction in the province. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that Fujian will achieve even greater success under the leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial government. On assisting the poor, Qiao Shi said: Fujian is a historical revolutionary bastion. Fifteen months after the Jinggangshan resolutionary base [in Jiangxi] was established, Chairman Mao came down from the mountain and visited western Fujian. In helping the poverty-stricken areas, the central government has been giving preferential treatment to central and western China and has given Fujian the assignment of supporting western Fujian and other poverty-stricken areas in the province. It is hoped that Fujian, while promoting coastal areas' economic development, will also work with determination to build up western Fuijian and other historical and mountainous areas in accordance with the central government's requirement that areas which have become affluent first should help impoverished areas achieve prosperity. Historical areas are unlikely to improve without outside assistance. The central government has deliberately given Fujian this assignment so that aid-the-poor programs will be successful nationwide. The central government will have problems if it has to shoulder all the aid-the-poor programs alone. I hope you will make a success of this project. While meeting the deputies from Xinjiang, Qiao Shi said: Xinjiang is the largest and strategically important region in western China. In recent years Xinjiang has made substantial progress in promoting industrial and other developments as well as in promoting agricultural production and animal husbandry. Of course, Xinjiang's economic development still lags behind that in coastal areas for historical reasons. From now on, Xinjiang must think of some ways to develop itself in various fields. Xinjiang, a region where minority nationalities live in compact communities, has been quite successful in promoting national solidarity. I hope Xinjiang will continue to strengthen and consolidate the solidarity among people of all nationalities and build up Xinjiang on this basis. Commenting on relations with neighboring countries, Qiao Shi said: Xinjiang is a neighbor of Central Asian countries. We should develop friendly, equal, and mutually beneficial cooperation with them on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. While this is very important for maintaining national stability and creating a good international environment for modernization, it is also helpful for strengthening the solidarity among people of all nationalities and for safeguarding national unity. In this regard, people of all nationalities in Xinjiang have a very important mission to accomplish. Qiao Shi said: Xinjiang also has relatively rich natural resources. In addition to coal, it also has considerable oil reserves and other natural resources. Of course, Xinjiang also has its developmental problems, but these problems can be gradually resolved during the course of reform. Qiao Shi said: "I wholeheartedly hope people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will unite more closely, work together in carrying out the task of building Xinjiang, and build Xinjiang into an even better place." Qiao Shi also hoped the current NPC session would further unite people in Xinjiang, boost their morale, and encourage them to do an even better job in all areas. The NPC deputies from Fujian and Xinjiang pledged that they certainly will expedite economic construction and national solidarity according to the plan drawn up by the party central committee.
