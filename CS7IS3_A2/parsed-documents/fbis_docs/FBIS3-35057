Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance from their Lord. [Koranic verse] The General Committee of the GPC announces the death of brother 'Abd-al-Hamid Ahmad Mahmud al-Sarfi and Mahdi Muhammad Subayh, members of the GPC and two of its leading cadres in the Bani-al-Harith District, (?Sa'dah) Governorate. The two were killed in a criminal assassination attempt carried out by a professional group belonging to one of the political organizations that adopt violence as a means to deal with those who differ with them. The incident took place the day before yesterday. We in the GPC denounce and condemn this incident and all acts of terrorism and ask the security agencies to promptly arrest the killers, put them on trial, and give them a just punishment. The security agencies should also uncover the motives of those behind the plot. We also take this opportunity to reassert to our people our absolute faith and full commitment to national principles and state that we will be the first to champion those principles, for which the two martyred died. The GPC urges all its members, supporters, and sons of the great Yemeni people to be vigilant and foil any feverish attempts that seek to undermine Yemeni national gains and the achievements of the Yemeni people. We share with the GPC branch in the Bani-al-Harith and its supporters, members, the families of the martyrs, and the sons of the Bani-al-Harith, the sorrow of this loss. We also beseech God to have mercy on the two and place them in paradise, along with martyrs and righteous people, and to grant their families patience and solace. To God we are and unto Him we shall return. May the eyes of the cowardly remain sleepless. Issued by the General Committee of the GPC on 17 February 1994. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. To the righteous soul will be said: O thou soul: In complete rest and satisfaction, come back thou to thy Lord, well pleased thyself and well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou, then, among My devotees. Ye, enter thou My heaven. [Koranic verse]
