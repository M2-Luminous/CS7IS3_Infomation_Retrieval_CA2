This safety zone is necessary to control spectator craft and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during the event. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation will be effective from 12 p.m. until 6 p.m. on August 6, 1994 and again on August 7, 1994 encompassing the same times. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore, Custom House, 40 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202&hyph;4022, (410) 962&hyph;2651. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The application to hold this event was not submitted until June 1, 1994 to Coast Guard Group Baltimore and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Background and Purpose The Kent Narrows Racing Association filed an application with Coast Guard Group Baltimore requesting Coast Guard assistance to control spectator craft during the Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races. Due to the possible hazards associated with this event, the Coast Guard has determined that a safety zone is necessary to ensure the safety of spectators and participants. Discussion of Regulations The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone on Kirwan Creek just off of Hog Island for the Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races. The Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races will feature groups of high performance hydroplane's racing around a set course near the mouth of Kirwan Creek at speeds in excess of 130 miles per hour. This safety zone will encompass all waters of Kirwan Creek that lie 200 yards on all sides of a line that connects the following points: 38 degrees 57 minutes 56 seconds north, 076 degrees 14 minutes 58 seconds west to 38 degrees 57 minutes 36 seconds north, 076 degrees 15 minutes 24 seconds west. Since the mouth of Kirwan Creek will not be completely closed down during this event, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted. Spectator vessels that wish to watch the race may anchor outside of the safety zone, but they may not anchor in or block a navigable channel. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, project officer for the Captain of the Port, Baltimore, Maryland and Lieutenant Commander Christoper A. Abel, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Small Entities Do to the location of this safety zone the Coast Guard expects the impact of this rule to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
