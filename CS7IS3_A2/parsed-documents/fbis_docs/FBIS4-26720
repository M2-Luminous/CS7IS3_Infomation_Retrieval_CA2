Over the past eight years the area of land leased in Guangdong has amounted to 31,000 ha, bringing the province a total income of 28 billion yuan. The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and provincial government have issued more than 30 regulations concerning land and real estate business. In addition, a number of land evaluation services and consultancy services have been set up. The Provincial Land Management Bureau last year set up a provincial land evaluation service center which has now trained more than 150 land evaluators. Also last year Guangdong curbed the expansion of the land market. The province curbed the expansion of some development zones and real estate projects. In the first five months of this year the total area for construction in Guangdong amounted to about 6,700 ha, a decrease of 43 percent compared to the same period of last year. The land involved in real estate business totalled about 140 ha, a decline of 60 percent compared to the same period of last year. By the end of May some 21 cities and prefectures, and 75 counties had begun to allocate land resources through the market. Meanwhile, Guangdong has started to experiment in market-oriented land services in the allocation of non-farm land in rural areas, so as to expand the market mechanism from the state land sector to the collective land sector in the rural areas.
