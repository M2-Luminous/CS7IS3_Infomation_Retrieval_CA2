In his regular Sunday radio programme "Talks in Lany," Havel was reacting to a complaint lodged recently with the Constitutional Court by a Czech citizen of German origin living in Liberec, North Bohemia. In it he complained against a verdict reached by the Usti nad Labem Regional Court in 1945, whereby the property of his forebears was confiscated and alleged that the confiscation was unlawful and in breach of his basic rights. He made an appeal for the repeal of decrees Nos. 5, 12, 33 and 108. Decree No. 108 laid down the confiscation of property from Germans and Hungarians. Decrees Nos. 5, 12 and 33 ordered that Germans and Hungarians be dispossessed of agricultural property and stripped of state citizenship. Turning to the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy at the beginning of June, Havel regretted that he could not decorate Czech veterans with state distinctions just as the other heads of state. There has been no law on orders and distinctions since the creation of the independent Czech Republic on January 1, 1993. Havel said it seemed in the Czech Republic as if the veterans' experience was recalled only by the veterans themselves. He stressed that it was just thanks to the Czechoslovak units abroad that the Czech Republic was perceived in the West "as a country having a democratic tradition which was capable of putting up resistance to the mounting evil." Havel invited the veterans of the Czechoslovak Army living abroad to come for the celebrations of the end of World War Two next year.
