Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, one of the six cabinet members from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which opposes the new tax, told reporters Hosokawa said he is "ready to modify my decision to introduce the tax if the leaders of coalition partners approve of such change in their meeting." Hosokawa told fellow Diet members of the Japan New Party that the SDP was "indispensable" for the coalition, adding, "if the ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am not concerned about saving face." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference the Hosokawa administration is ready to modify the details of the new indirect tax, tentatively called a national welfare tax. The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready "to correct the wrong" if it helps defend the unity of the coalition and alleviate public dislike of the new tax proposal. The premier instructed the leaders of the coalition partners to band together for a meeting on Thursday afternoon to work out a consensus over the issue prior to the announcement of the government's expected 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, coalition officials said. Hosokawa reportedly plans to cite the package in his summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 to alleviate U.S. criticism of what the U.S. sees as Japan's insufficient efforts to rekindle its stagnant consumer spending and whittle down its trade surplus. Igarashi made the remarks after he and other five ministers from the SDP called on Hosokawa at the premier's official residence to demand a change in the new tax plan. It was not immediately known whether Hosokawa was ready to comply with the SDP's chief demand to insert into the text of the new tax bill wording that would obligate the government to spend all the fresh revenue from the new tax on welfare. Under Japan's revenue structure, the government can set up an independent account inside the state budget -- apart from its general account -- for accepting and disbursing fresh revenues from a new tax, if it wants to spend all the revenues from the new tax for a specific purpose. Hosokawa's remark came a few hours after the SDP leadership decided to stick to its demand urging the coalition to amend the tax plan and threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet unless the demand is met. The SDP criticized the welfare tax as a ploy to persuade the public to accept a virtual tax increase by merely changing the name of the consumption tax. The new 7 percent tax, whose mechanism is almost identical to that of the current 3 percent consumption tax, is to be imposed on most goods and services. In a news conference in the early hours of Thursday, Hosokawa said the government decided to impose the new tax to offset a revenue shortfall from planned income tax cuts and finance the cost of increased welfare spending due to the rapidly graying society. He said the government wants to introduce the new tax to offset a revenue shortfall stemming from the income tax cut of 6 trillion yen, starting from April 1, 1997. The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after the then LDP administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita introduced the tax. Since joining the seven-party coalition, the SDP has been forced to accept compromises over key issues such as the opening of Japan's rice market last year and political reform in January. The SDP said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan. The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on political reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono during last-ditch talks, for fear that the SDP's opposition might bring about collapse of the coalition government.
