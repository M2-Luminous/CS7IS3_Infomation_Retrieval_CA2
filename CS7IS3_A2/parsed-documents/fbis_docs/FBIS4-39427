FBIS4-39427 "drsov110_a_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Meeting Proposed To Prevent Violations Meeting Proposed To Prevent Violations LD0806141194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1329 GMT 8 Jun 94 LD0806141194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The incident involving an American Lockheed C-130 that violated the Russian air space on Tuesday and was forced to land by Russian Air Defence in Adler near Sochi is being studied in Washington where all the necessary information was sent. This was reported to Interfax on Wednesday by a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. In his opinion, Americans should be given time to study the circumstances. After that it would be logical to hold a meeting of high-ranking experts from Russia and the U.S. to prevent such incidents in the future, Karasin said. As Interfax reported, the American plane was flying from Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi. No requests were made for its flight across Russian territory. On Tuesday evening the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin sent a note to the American ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering. He hoped that the American side would apply disciplinary measures to those responsible. Meanwhile, the main air traffic control center of Georgia has told Interfax that it is in no way responsible for the incident involving the American plane as it is does not belong to Georgia.
