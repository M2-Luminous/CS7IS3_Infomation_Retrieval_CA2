Results-93 Recession had somewhat slowed down, yet continued in every sphere of the economy. As a rule, Russian statistics are correlated on economic indicators not with some basic level, but with the corresponding month or period of the previous year. Given this approach, the scope of the recession is being sort of "toned down", whereas the relative constancy of economic indicators from month to month creates the illusion of production being stabilized. In fact, however, this constancy merely testifies to the stabilization of the rates of recession, not the stabilization of output. This becomes obvious if the most important economic indicators of recent years are compared with the corresponding figures of 1990. Although between 1990 and 1993 recession in all of Russia's main spheres of production was somewhat less than in the other CIS countries, it was rather significant on the whole: during this period industrial output declined by more than two-fifths and the sphere of services -- by one-third. Moreover, despite the avalanche-like recession in 1991 and 1992, for the third year running the reduction of the GDP and the volumes of industrial output in Russia has been expressed in a two-digit figure. The slowing down of the rates of production decline, however, testifies, we believe, not so much to the signs of coming stabilization as to the depletion of the "potential" of recession as a result of the ongoing "shrinkage" of the initial basis. In other words, the reduction of the volumes of production in itself predetermines a slowing down of the rates of recession, which by no means amounts to an indicator of its early discontinuation with the subsequent change of the vectors of movement. Forecasts-94 The rates of recession will slow down, but the fall of production will continue. This is conditioned by the steady lowering of the share of gross investments in Russia's GDP. According to preliminary estimates, in 1993 it comprised a mere 12-13%. The uncompensated removal of production capacities is acquiring a frontal character, that is to say, not only obsolete capacities are being removed, but even the possibilities are being undermined for the future growth of production in sectors which determine the economy's structure the greatest. This structure in itself is becoming increasingly bulky and inert to the processes of renewal. From 1991 to 1993 the specific share of the fuel and energy sector increased from 11.3 to 25.4% and that of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy -- from 11.2 to 18.6%, whereas the specific position of machine building ad metal working lowered from 25 to 20.5% and that of the light and food industry -- from 32.2 to 17.7%. Moreover, the mechanism of sanitizing enterprises and carrying out bankruptcies, which is one of the most effective means of improving the economy, has still not been put in operation. On the other hand, the possibilities of halting the decline of investment activities in 1994 will be rigidly restricted due to the failure of the budgetary policy in 1993. A hole in the budget to the tune of five trillion rubles which "unexpectedly" appeared in the fourth quarter of 1993 determines the further reduction of budgetary investments (estimated in permanent prices) until at least the middle of 1994. However, if the high rates of inflation have been kept alive, the uncentralized investments of enterprises and private structure will continue to remain at a low level. As a result, in annual terms gross investments will diminish by another 10% in 1994. It is highly probable that in 1994 the list of recession-gripped production units will increase in virtue of a decline in demand and its reorientation to similar but more competitive imported products. This primarily concerns the output of cars and color TV sets, the production of which somewhat increased in 1993. A similar situation already existed with the production of VCRs whose production increased by 40% in 1992 but fell by 38% in 1993. As a result, the process of redirecting defense industry enterprises to expanding the production of sophisticated consumer goods may scale down, whereas conversion as a whole in the next few years will not be able to become one of the sources for boosting industrial output. True, some growth in housing construction (up by 5%) makes it possible to hope that the volumes of the production of several building materials (bricks, glass, linoleum, bathroom-and-lavatory equipment) will either be preserved or register a very insignificant decline. On the whole, industrial output may lower by about 10-12% in 1994. The dynamics of agricultural production will be affected by the reduction in 1993 of the areas under winter crops which comprised roughly 20% in comparison with the previous year. All other conditions being equal, this may entail a fall of grain production in 1994 within the limits of 6-8%. In cattle-breeding a stabilization of production may be expected in 1994 in connection with a rise in the productivity of agricultural animals. Much, however, will depend on the level of grain production. If its lowering reaches 10%, it will hardly be possible to even hope for the maintaining of 1993 volumes. The lowering in the main sphere of material production may have the result that in 1994 the GDP will be reduced by 7-9% whereas inflation will hardly be lowered to the promised 3-5% by the close of the year. In the transitional-type economy the monetary means of management may temporarily dampen but not vanquish inflation. However paradoxical, but the task of combating inflation with purely credit-monetary means is doomed to produce face-lifting and short-lived effect. The point is that in a monopolized economy the monetarist policy in itself initiates stagflationist phenomena. Thus, the monopoly positions of enterprises easily make it possible to translate the increase of the interest rate into a growth of prices. Enterprises respond to the compression of the money mass primarily with reducing the volumes of output, not by lowering prices. Moreover, the steadily lowering supply is becoming one of the permanent factors keeping the prices up. As a result, inflation acquires an increasingly inert character inasmuch as all the economic agents learn to indexate prices (overtly or covertly). All of this necessitates taking a rather sceptical look at the government's promises to lower the rates of inflation to 3% a month by December 1994. In principle it is possible only to bring it down temporarily to this level. But this does not mean at all that already in the next month inflation will not again jump to a two-digit figure or that there will be no avalanche-like stoppage of production. In other words, pinning hopes exclusively or mainly on the credit-monetary levers of regulation given the weakness of structural-institutional changes may have the result that inflation will acquire a "jumping" character. And it is as yet far from obvious which of the evils is the greatest for the economy: the high but slowly lowering rates of inflation or the rates of inflation which are quickly changing in the course of a short period of time. Judging by the government's statement on the economic policy in late 1993 and in 1994, the latter variant is highly probable in the year that has just begun. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia and CIS: Annual Rates of Reducing the GDP, Industrial and Agricultu-| |ral Production in 1990-1993 (In Average Annual Prices of 1993, in %) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Russia |Remaining CIS Cou-|CIS As a Whole | | | |ntries | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |GDP | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |-18.2 |-20.0 |-19.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |-20.6 |-21.0 |-20.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |-12.4 |-16.0 |-13.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial Production | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |-18.2 |-20.0 |-19.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |-20.0 |-21.0 |-20.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993* |-16.3 |-18.0 |-17.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agricultural Production | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |-9.4 |-12.0 |-10.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |-20.5 |-21.0 |-20.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993* |-1.1 |-9.0 |-4.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |These data have been calculated by SovEcon analyst Boris Bolotin. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* Preliminary data | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
