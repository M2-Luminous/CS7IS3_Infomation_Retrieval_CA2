Domestic enterprises will actively proceed with civilian-level industrial cooperative projects with the five subcommittees of the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee, which will be organized on the occasion of President Kim's China visit for the automobile, electronic, aviation, electronic exchanger (TDX), and nuclear energy fields. They are now holding consultations with China on specific problems in promoting those projects by dispatching joint delegations or management-level personnel to China. In particular, our government is consulting with domestic business circles over nominating a head company in each field to improve efficiency in promoting economic cooperation with China through a unified channel for each sector. The government is considering nominating Daewoo Motors as the head company in the automobile field, the Korea Electric Power Corporation in the nuclear energy field, Kumsong Dacom in the electric exchanger field, and Samsung Electronics in the electronic field, which includes high-definition television. Samsong Aviation Company and Korean Air are competing with each other for the leadership in the aviation field. The government, however, is struggling because business circles oppose the policy of nominating head companies and insist on liberal competition. Daewoo Motors and China's Changchun No. 1 Motor Company agreed to invest jointly $1.5 billion in building a joint-venture plant capable of producing 300,000 automobile parts and 150,000 completed automobiles a year and they are now proceeding with this project. Hyundai Motors is also planning to invest individually to manufacture ordinary automobiles. China has requested that the Korea Electric Power Corporation provide technological support and investment for its nuclear power facilities. It has already dispatched a technological support team to maintain the No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear power plants in Guangdong, China. It has been learned that China has promised our business circles that it will consider adopting ROK electric exchangers as a standard system in building the national communication network in the future. Kumsong Dacom and Samsung Electronics are now expanding their investments in this field in China. The ROK Government plans to promote cooperation with China by organizing a consortium with an ROK head company and the aviation industries of China, a company designated for the consortium by the Chinese side. In the meantime, Samsung Aviation Company, Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Halla Heavy Industries, and Seil Heavy Industries are independently promoting joint projects with Chinese companies.
