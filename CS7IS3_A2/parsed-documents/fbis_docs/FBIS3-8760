The Polish party also insisted on signing a commercial protocol for this year; however, it seems that these were all futile efforts. Moscow does not want to agree to the settlement mechanism proposed by Pawlak, which links Poland's purchases of strategic raw materials to the imports of our goods. In this situation, Warsaw's initiative is especially noteworthy: It insists on specifying a catalogue of the issues that have not been settled yet and of problems that impede the development of economic cooperation. Similar protocols of dissimilarities have already been drawn up more than once. This time, however, the approximate date of their settlement should be fixed, and people responsible for that should be selected. Some people believe that this is the main goal of Prime Minister Pawlak's journey to Moscow. As one of the high-ranking Polish diplomats put it, if this is pulled off, we will be able to consider the entire visit a success. It is worth adding that Polish-Russian economic relations are now in a deep crisis, which to a considerable degree is also related to the noticeable chilling of the political climate. For a year and a half, if we do not take into account the talks between both presidents, both states practically have not maintained any contacts. Most of the problems that impede cooperation and an exchange of goods and services have not even been touched. As a consequence, the Polish-Russian trade turnover again started to plummet more quickly. After a period of relative stabilization in 1992 (at the level of 50 percent of the turnover in 1990), the turnover in 1993 decreased by another 39 percent. The decrease in exports of agricultural-industrial goods to the Russian market (by 62.5 percent) is especially seen as very alarming. The main reason for this state of affairs is said to be the crisis of the Russian economy as well as drastic anti-import measures taken by Moscow. This is true. On the other hand, however, quite important is also the lack of any concrete decisions concerning indebtedness (as a result of which many Polish companies are simply afraid of conducting trade with Russia), let alone the fact that there are no instruments in place for supporting exports. There is even no bank that would handle trade with the East. By leaving for Moscow with his own concept of a "partnership for development," Prime Minister Pawlak would like to unblock the Polish-Russian economic relations and deal with, as he put it, "the building of practical foundations of cooperation." According to the Polish prime minister, all of the great ideas have already been announced, and now it is high time for practical activities aimed at implementing them. The prime minister believes that it is possible to separate the economy from politics. * * * "Right now the problem is not that we should sign further agreements because we have already signed many agreements, treaties, and declarations with Russia: We should see to it that our mutual relations are transferred to the level of activities, especially economic activities," Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said yesterday before leaving for Moscow. The prime minister confirmed that, in Russia, he will discuss the "zero option"--that is, the proposal that the debts of both sides be annulled. "During the meeting in Moscow, the problem of gas and oil supplies from Russia will also be discussed," Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol said in the Polish Radio Third Program. --by J.H.
