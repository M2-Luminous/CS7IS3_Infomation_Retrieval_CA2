That mandatory training shall include, at a minimum, the following core topic areas: contracting authority; procurement integrity; contract modifications; surveillance plans; contracting for inherently governmental functions, personal services, and NASA policy on the acquisition of services; the Service Contract Act; the Anti-Deficiency Act; contract financial management; the ``Changes'' clause; the ``Disputes'' clause; the ``Inspection'' clause; Government property and policy procedures; and the ``Limitation of Funds'' and ``Limitation of Cost'' clauses. Procurement Officers are responsible for assuring that the course(s) utilized by their installation address the mandatory core topics in sufficient detail for the purpose of COTR training. (g) The contracting officer shall verify that the COTR has received the mandatory training before signing the NASA Form 1634. Contracting officers shall terminate COTR delegations of COTRs who have not met the above training requirements by April 1, 1995. If, however, an urgent need arises for the appointment of a COTR and no trained and otherwise qualified individual is available, then the Procurement Officer may make a temporary COTR appointment not to exceed six months, which may not be extended by more than six months. Temporary appointments must be so identified and clearly reflect the appointment expiration date. No technical direction may be issued by a COTR serving under a temporary appointment. If a COTR serving under a temporary appointment believes that technical direction should be issued to the contractor, the COTR shall so advise the contracting officer and provide such assistance regarding the proposed direction as the contracting officer may require.
