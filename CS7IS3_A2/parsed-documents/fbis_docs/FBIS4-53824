Although they would only have to stay in jail for a month, the students immediately made it known they would appeal the verdict. In passing the sentences, the presiding judge of each group trial said the students together had been guilty of deliberately damaging the dignity, honor, and the good reputation of the president in a demonstration at the Parliament building on December 14. During the demonstration the students had put up banners, posters, shouted yells, and sung songs containing insults to the president, the judges said. The court, however, acquitted them from the prosecutor's accusation that they had also insulted the authorities and official bodies. Scores of students attending the trial shouted everytime the judges read out the verdicts. Nine students were held by the police for putting up posters Wednesday morning before the trial session began. During the session, some students held a "mock" trial accentuated by yells and patriotic songs. The action was joined by hundreds of students and proceeded peacefully and orderly. According to one of the students' lawyers, Frans Hendra Winata, the verdict was the lightest ever handed down in political cases of the category during the new order era. "Bonar Tigor and Nuku Suleiman were sentenced to years of imprisonment," Winata said referring to political cases settled in court just weeks before the students'.
