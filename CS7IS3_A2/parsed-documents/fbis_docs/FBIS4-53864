FBIS4-53864 "dreas100__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-100-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Veterans From MOF, Banks Aid Securities Firms Veterans From MOF, Banks Aid Securities Firms 942A0250A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0250A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Quasi-major securities firms undergoing restructuring have beefed up their management teams by appointing personnel who formerly worked for their main banks and the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. Kankaku Securities, which recorded huge losses from transactions representing financial manipulations to conceal unrealized losses, was extended financial aid totaling 70 billion yen in the form of a subordinate loan from Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and requested a loan for roughly 40 billion yen from three leading banks to establish a collateral deposit on a domestic convertible bond. In the area of human resources, it appointed Mr. Mitsuo Hamamoto as vice president, and a group of four other officials of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as officers of the securities firm. One former employee of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank will resign from Kankaku Securities as a managing director, but that will still leave Kankaku Securities with President Yoichiro Kato and four others, providing for strong bank influence over the securities firm. Yamatane Securities, which has been aided by managerial support from Sakura Bank, will appoint as chairman Takashi Yasuhara, an ex-MOF official and former vice president of the Agricultural-Forestry Industry Loan Corporation. He will collaborate with President Hidefumi Kubo, formerly of the MOF and Sakura Bank, in an effort to restore profits during this fiscal year after five years of deficits. At Okasan Securities, Kozo Tsukakoshi, Bank of Japan Kobe branch president, will become managing director; and Koichi Saku, main bank Japan Industrial Bank Machida branch president, will become a director. Although Okasan Securities is known for its independent management team composed of members of the founding family, President Seiichi Kato says, "I would like to see the newcomers make use of their experience and personal connections at the banks they come from and shore up weaknesses in the management of Okasan." There are signs that he has a desire to overcome difficulties by bringing in new blood from other industries in the face of increasing competition expected as a result of the establishment of banks' securities subsidiaries. Needless to say, appointment of officers from banks will not lead to an easy improvement in operating results. A prevalent comment is reflected in that of Cosmos Securities which says, "We have received introductions from our main banks, but it is difficult to translate such contacts into actual brokerage business." The respective securities firms are exerting efforts in the area of cost reductions, such as in the case of Cosmos Securities which in April reduced its mandatory retirement age for managerial positions from 57 to 55. It seems that the appropriate management philosophy is reflected in Yamatane Securities President Kubo's remarks, "It is of foremost importance that securities firms try to make a recovery based on their own initiative."
