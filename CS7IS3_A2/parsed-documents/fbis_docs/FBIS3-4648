"Since the February 19 the Khmer Rouge launched attacks against Anlong Veng, especially using artillery," Cambodian army General Chum Chheang said. "But our forces are still resisting the Khmer Rouge attacks." Heavy guerrilla shelling, however, forced government troops to make "tactical retreats" from certain parts of the base which stretches for several kilometers, he said. The guerrillas were also splitting up into small groups and attacking government troops "from everywhere", he said. The general, however, denied reports that the Khmer Rouge had re-captured all of Anlung Veng. "It's not true. Our troops are still in Anlung Veng, we just move tactically around the area," he said. A government minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged there was a major guerrillla assault against the base. "The situation is still confusing," he said. "But we are building up new fighting forces to kick the Khmer Rouge away completely from the area." Anlung Veng, which fell to the government February 5, was the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia. The guerrillas retreated rather than face the 3,000-strong government force in a conventional battle. But, operating in small units from the hills and jungle around the base, the guerrillas have continued to stage hit-and-run attacks on the government forces. Western military analysts said the government may be over-stretching its resources trying to maintain and supply large numbers of men in the remote and inhospitable area, and they warned that the conquerors could become targets for fast-moving teams of guerrillas. A high-ranking defence official, however, said the army was aware of the threat. "Anlung Veng may be a trap, so we have to prepare for everything," he said.
