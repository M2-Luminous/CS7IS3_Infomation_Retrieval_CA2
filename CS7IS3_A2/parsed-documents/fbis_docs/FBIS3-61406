But last week in Uzhgorod (Western Ukraine) delegations of the CIS countries held talks on the prospects of the creation of a common CIS patent and an interstate patent office. These events--extremely important ones for the development of the innovation process--were at the center of the conversation of DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor Krylov with Vladimir Belov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks. [Krylov] Vladimir Vladimirovich, first of all about the main parameters of the situation: How many applications for patents, useful models, and trademarks are people now submitting? [Belov] Last year yielded 34,000 applications for patents, this year we expect not less than 40,000. The decline has halted, and invention activity has gone up, though slowly for the present. From foreign firms 2,313 applications were received, 9,515 were received from the republics of the CIS. The breakdown of the granted patents of Russia is also noteworthy--legal persons receive about 60 percent, inventors themselves receive the remaining 40 percent. As a whole this approximately corresponds to world practice. As is known, the patent law of Russia introduced a deferred system of examination, but nearly half of the applicants do not use it--they submit a petition for the conducting of a full examination at the same time as the application for a patent. In world practice on the average not more than a fourth of the applications are submitted with such petitions. Here, I think, a certain inertia of the thinking of our patent experts and the lack of a habit for the deferment of the examination for the present are working. Many applications, incidentally, contain the request to speed up the publication of the patent and to give it earlier than the 18 months that are envisaged by the law. As a rule, this is connected with the patenting of an invention abroad and other requirements of its quickest commercialization--advertising, participation in exhibitions, and others. The number of applications for trademarks for several years now has been increasing steadily--in 1992, 29,000 of them were submitted, the annual increase came to 12.5 percent. Russian applicants submitted 17,000 applications, 4,000 were submitted from countries of the CIS, 12,000 were submitted from remote foreign countries. Incidentally, Ukraine yields on the order of 80 percent of the applications for trademarks and 60 percent of the applications for patents from nearby foreign countries. Is this not evidence of the close interweaving of our economies? In 1992, 2,730 applications for industrial designs were submitted, and the tendency for the protection of this important type of industrial property to decline thus far, unfortunately, has not been overcome. The legal protection of useful models was introduced with the coming into force of the new patent law--on 14 October 1992. On 1 September 1993 about 100 applications had been submitted. Apparently, applicants for the present are taking a close look, but I link precisely with useful models the hopes for the increase of invention activity. According to my predictions, in the future not less than half of the applications for new technical solutions will be received precisely for useful models. [Krylov] Do you foresee difficulties in the process of the examination of useful models and the consideration of disputes about the legitimacy of the granting or the violation of a patent for a useful model? For the procedure of the examination of a useful model, as is known, is at sight--they grant a patent ``at the risk'' of the applicant, without guarantees. [Belov] Indeed, conflicts and disputes about the validity of a patent for a useful model are possible. We do not forecast too many misunderstandings with regard to useful models. But nevertheless we are developing a procedure of their examination before taking them to court. That is, before the submission of an objection to the Appellate Chamber the interested parties will be able together with an expert to determine the conformity to the criteria of patentability of the granted patent for a useful model. But as a whole, as I have already said, we do not expect many such disputes--the term of the legal protection of a useful model is only five years, while the fees for them are lower than for patents for inventions. [Krylov] It may, perhaps, interest many people, why they established the patent fees in fixed amounts, when there is hyperinflation outside. After all, at the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate and so on today they take many fees and fines on the basis of the amount of the minimum wage. [Belov] The point is that the maximum term of effect of a patent is 20 years, while during this time the minimum wage will be revised so many times.... How is one to calculate the fee? On the basis of the minimum wage for the year of priority, or the granting of the patent, or the making of a specific payment? Moreover, several republics within the Russian Federation have their own minimum wage norms, which differ from federal norms. As a whole I believe that it is necessary to allow the applicant to work under the conditions of stable patent fees, in spite of the complete instability of the ruble. No one here ever calculated how much revenue patent fees can yield, to what extent they are capable of covering the work of the patent office.... Everything went to the state budget. Now the question of the division of patent fees is constantly arising during the discussion of the questions of the establishment of the Interstate Patent Office of the CIS. Armenia, for example, is demanding for itself 100 percent of the patent fees.... There is another urgent thing: The model of the patent convention of the CIS, which is being discussed today, differs from the European model or the model of the Agreement on International Patent Cooperation. The applicant, who submitted an application for a CIS patent during the first year, does not have the right to choose--he should pay the patent fees in all the countries that are parties to this agreement. In general talks on any patent problems of the CIS member countries proceed slowly and with difficulty. The main result of the meeting held in Uzhgorod was the fact that we arrived at a preliminary agreement--30 percent of the patent fees go to the budget of the Interstate Office, the rest goes to the member countries. The main problem today consists in the fact that all the partners to the talks without exception believe: Russia personally should advance all the expenses on the establishment of the Interstate Patent Office. They substantiate this by the inheriting by Russia from the USSR of the property of the former State Committee for Inventions and Discoveries. [Krylov] The fact that any property and financial talks of the CIS member countries proceed with extreme difficulty, is not surprising. But still is there a convergence of positions? What has changed in the positions of your colleagues from the young patent offices of the states of the CIS? [Belov] I would say that the period of patent euphoria has ended. They actually understood all the labor intensiveness and complexity of patent work. Today the complete lack in the patent offices of the CIS countries of any patent statistics is greatly complicating the work. And this is when there are still few applications and it is quite easy to count them.... We, incidentally, since 1992 have been putting out an annual report of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks, which has been completed in accordance with all international standards of patent statistics. For without clear knowledge of the patent situation in its own country any patent office simply cannot operate.
