The move comes shortly after a high-ranking MITI bureaucrat resigned following the trade minister's intervention in such a case. Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano said at a press conference that the ministry will exercise impartiality in personnel changes even for officials intending to enter politics. "We will strictly refrain from creating a new post for an official who plans to quit for elections, for example, so as not to cause suspicion of any special consideration on the assumption of transfer to the political world." Late last December, Masahisa Naito resigned as director general of the ministry's Industrial Policy Bureau following conflict with MITI Minister hiroshi kumagai. The minister had urged Naito to resign, saying he had shown favoritism in promoting a junior when Naito was director general at the minister's Secretariat. Naito contended at his last press conference that he could not understand nor accept Kumagai's reasons for demanding his resignation, saying, "the promotion in question followed MITI's conventional practice." Such promotions are regarded as boosting the curricula vitae of prospective political candidates.
