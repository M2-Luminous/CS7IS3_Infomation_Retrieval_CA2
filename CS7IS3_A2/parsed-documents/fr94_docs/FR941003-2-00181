FR941003-2-00181 FR941003-2-00064 2. Guardian Investor Services Corporation (``GISC'') serves as the distributor for all of the series and as investment adviser for all of the series except the International Fund. GISC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (``Guardian Life''). Guardian Life is a mutual life insurance company organized in the State of New York. 3. GISC provided the initial capital for the Trust in 1989. As of June 30, 1994, GISC owned 13.55% of the Government Fund and may be considered to control the Fund. In January 1993, Guardian Life provided the initial capital for the Bond Fund. As of June 30, 1994, Guardian Life owned 50.24% of the Bond Fund and may be considered to control the Fund. The investment objective of the Government Fund is to achieve a high level of current return through a combination of interest income and net capital gains consistent with prudent investment risk and security of principal. The investment objective of the Bond Fund is to secure a high level of current income and capital appreciation without undue risk to principal. 4. At a meeting held on June 23, 1994, the board of trustees of the Portfolio, including a majority of those trustees who are not ``interested persons'' as defined in the Act, approved an agreement and plan of reorganization the ``Plan''). Pursuant to the Plan, on the effective date of the transaction (the ``Closing Date''), the Government Fund will transfer all of its assets and liabilities to the Bond Fund in exchange for a number of shares of the Bond Fund having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net assets of the Government Fund exchanged. The Government Fund then will distribute such Bond Fund shares to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. Each Government Fund shareholder will have his or her Government Fund shares exchanged for the number of full and fractional shares of the Bond Fund which, when multiplied by the net asset value per share of Bond Fund, will have an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of that holder's shares in the Government Fund on the Closing Date. On July 29, 1994, the Portfolio registered the shares of the Bond Fund to be issued pursuant to the Plan with the SEC on Form N&hyph;14. 5. While the Bond Fund ordinarily imposes in initial sales charge in connection with the purchase of shares, the sales charge will not apply to shares of the Bond Fund acquired pursuant to the proposed reorganization. Neither Fund imposes a contingent deferred sales charge or other fee in connection with the redemption of shares. 6. In evaluating whether to adopt the Plan and recommend its approval by shareholders of the Government Fund, the board of trustees has considered the following factors, among others: (a) The potential benefits of the reorganization to shareholders; (b) the compatibility of investment objectives, policies, restrictions and investment holdings of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund; (c) the current total net assets of the two Funds and the current and historical expenses and performance of each Portfolio; (d) the terms and conditions of the proposed reorganization and whether it would result in dilution of any shareholder's interest; (e) the absence of any direct or indirect costs to be incurred by either Fund or the Portfolio; and (f) the tax-free nature of the reorganization. 7. The Portfolio will submit the proposed Plan to the shareholders of the Government Fund for their approval at a meeting called for that purpose on October 19, 1994. Shareholders of the Government Fund will receive a notice of the special meeting of shareholders and a proxy statement and prospectus containing all material disclosures, including a description of all material aspects of the proposed reorganization and a copy of the Plan. Consistent with the declaration of trust, a majority of the outstanding shares of the Government Fund must approve the reorganization. GISC will vote the shares it owns in the Government Fund in favor of the Plan and will pay all the costs of the reorganization. In addition to shareholders approval, the consummation of the reorganization is conditioned upon receipt from the SEC of the order requested herein. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered company, any security or other property. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of any other person is an affiliated person of that person. 2. Section 17(b) provides that the SEC may exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.
