The talks have dragged on for nearly five months now, but they have got bogged down in disputes over power-sharing between the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government and the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels. Now the two armies are battling for control of Cafunfo, a diamond rich town, 300 hundred miles east of the capital. Nicholas Jackson of REUTER news agency telexed this report from Luanda: State media and independent observers said today that fighting was intensifying around the rebel-held town of Cafunfo, which is at the heart of the Cuango valley diamond region. A diplomat in Luanda said that both sides were engaged in military actions and that government artillery was within range of Cafunfo, which was captured by UNITA early last year. The state daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, also reported that UNITA was stepping up its activity. The town would be a major prize for the government in the war against UNITA. Since the rebels captured the town, industry sources say as much as $200 million worth of diamonds have leaked out, providing the rebels with their main sources of funds. Diplomats said action on the ground seems to be taking precedence over UN-brokered peace talks in the Zambian capital Lusaka. One diplomat said that the talks were reaching a turning point. If there was no progress, the United Nations would have to suspend the process, letting the fighting take its course. The Lusaka talks have yielded agreements on military, legal and political issues, but the sides became bogged down on national reconciliation, in particular on power sharing between the government and UNITA and a role for UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi.
