ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule makes final a proposed rule published on May 30, 1991 which proposed to amend title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations to create a new part 9, that would provide for the enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, in programs or activities conducted by HUD. The rule at 24 CFR part 9 is distinguished from the rule at 24 CFR part 8, which applies to private, State or local programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from HUD. This final rule at 24 CFR part 9 establishes standards for what constitutes discrimination on the basis of mental or physical disabilities; provides definitions for ``individuals with disabilities'' and ``qualified individuals with disabilities''; establishes a complaint procedure for resolving allegations of discrimination; and also incorporates additional changes to reflect regulatory implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth Ryan, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, room 5214, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;5000, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2333 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (section 504), states in pertinent part that: No otherwise qualified individual with disabilities in the United States, *␣*␣* shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service. The head of each such agency shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulation shall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress, and such regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day after the date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees. (29 U.S.C. 794 (1978 amendment italicized)). On May 30, 1991 (56 FR 24604), HUD published a proposed rule that would amend title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations to create a new part 9, that would provide for the enforcement of section 504 as it applies to programs or activities conducted by HUD (i.e., HUD conducted programs or activities). The part 9 rule is distinguished from the rule at 24 CFR part 8, which applies to private, State or local programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from HUD (HUD assisted programs or activities). However, the substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the agency as set forth in the part 9 rule are adapted from, and are very similar to, those contained in the part 8 rule. (See 24 CFR part 8; see also 28 CFR part 41, which is the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ).) This general parallelism is in accord with the intent expressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in House floor debate, including its sponsor, U.S. Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government should have the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financial assistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124 Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) id. ; 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); id. at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).
