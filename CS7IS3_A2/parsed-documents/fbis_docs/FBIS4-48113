The presidents of the two unions, Mr. Dries Bruwer and Dr. Piet Gouws, say in a joint statement that irresponsible land demands by pressure groups such as the National Land Committee will deter investigators. They added that the new government would also not be able to provide jobs if the future of agriculture was not clear. Mr. Bruwer and Dr. Gouws were reacting to a warning by the land committee that people's expectations regarding land should not be pushed aside. The land committee pointed out that the new government could expect protest action if land reform did not get immediate attention.
