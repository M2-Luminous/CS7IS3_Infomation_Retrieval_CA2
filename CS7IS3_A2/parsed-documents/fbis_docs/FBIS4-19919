Asked what the situation would be if, for instance, UNPROFOR troops were attacked, Manfred Woerner told me the following this morning: [Begin Woerner recording] Well, it is clear that additional risks may be associated with this. However, the contrary could happen, too. The evidence of a strong determination and the use of more substantial military means could persuade the Bosnian Serbs to give up their policy of taking hostages. However, as I have said, I do not wish to speculate on this. What we can do is use our air force for their protection. This will happen, too. And then, do not forget, we cannot decide on such action by ourselves. We must do this in cooperation with the commanders of the UNPROFOR troops, the United Nations troops, who are the only ones who are down there on the ground. And they will certainly be interested in protecting their people. Therefore, only such strikes will be carried out in which the risk is limited, at least that is my assumption. You know there is something I do not understand. On the one hand, we are being accused of doing nothing, or not enough. When we do something they say: Do you not fear an escalation? First of all I do not believe that the measures as such will trigger an escalation of this kind. What they will achieve is that the price of the aggression, the price for attacking safe areas will become higher, considerably higher. And I can certainly imagine that the military leaders will ask themselves, at the latest after the first two, three missions, whether this is worth the risk. This is our chance. [end recording]
