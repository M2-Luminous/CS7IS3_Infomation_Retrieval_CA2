These remarks also reaffirm the stand of the U.S. Administration at the Security Council and its obstruction of the issuing of a mere statement condemning the ugly massacre perpetrated by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed the Zionist settler's killing of more than 40 worshipers and then themselves killed more than 50 more people. The statement noted that the peoples of the Islamic world are very angry about the U.S. Administration's stand, which flouts the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The statement said that the utter silence by the governments, kings, amirs, and presidents of the countries of the Islamic world has produced a bad and bitter response among the Arab and Islamic peoples. In its statement, the brotherhood demanded the Islamic nation condemn the U.S. stand on the Palestinian cause and show popular anger toward this stand, which is totally biased toward the Zionist enemy. The brotherhood said: We remind the U.S. Administration that its interests are linked to the peoples of the Islamic world, that it is impossible to continue the current situation, and that the clear neglect of the rights of Arabs and Muslims in Palestine, especially in holy Jerusalem, makes it obvious that the United States has lost its neutrality and the possibility for its mediation in solving the Palestinian issue. This is clearly evident in the current negotiations. And God hath full power and control over his affairs; but most among mankind know it not. [Koranic verse]
