Other CIS Republics in Line for Same Treatment"] [Text] Ashgabat -- "On 22 February we are cutting off gas supplies to Ukraine," Turkmen President S. Niyazov announced at an extraordinary session of the Cabinet of Ministers. "We acknowledge that this is an extreme measure which was not part of the government's plan; the government tried to settle the problem by all the channels available to it. But in the end Turkmenistan's compromise steps did not find due support from the Ukrainian side -- which is only to be regretted." Let me remind readers that a month ago, replying to a proposal by the leaders of the "Turkmengaz" corporation to shut off the valves on the gas pipeline in response to Ukraine's systematic refusal to pay for gas and its violations of the agreements it had signed, Saparmurad Niyazov stated: "I agree that as a result of late payments for gas supply by our CIS partners, the Turkmen economy is experiencing considerable hardship. But, however difficult things might be for us, we cannot fail to take account of far more serious problems in the states concerned, and we are therefore willing to compromise...." Today the treasury in Ashgabat is owed some $1.5 billion in debts from last year and this year. According to expert opinion, this is seriously undermining the state's balance of payments and the convertibility of the national currency. Take Ukraine, whose debts for Turkmen gas amounted to $700 million last year and grew by just over another $150 million during January and the first 20 days of February. On dozens of occasions the Turkmen side has warned, requested, and tried to cajole the Ukrainian leadership to settle up at least partially, if not in dollars then at least in commodities. The reply was as follows: If you shut off the valves on the gas pipeline, we will obtain our gas unilaterally from the "Russia-Europe" gas export pipeline, thus depriving you of foreign currency for export deliveries of fuel.... For some time now Turkmenistan's chronic debtors have included Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia; their negotiated limits expire any day now, and consequently gas supplies to these states could also be cut off. Partners' lack of obligingness and their failure to pay for gas are hitting the Turkmen economy hard, impacting first and foremost on people's welfare. Crazy prices for goods and food and an occasional lack of everyday staples, coupled with an inability on the government's part to double or triple the population's pay -- which it promised to do on several occasions last year -- are the consequences of the debt problems. Naturally, as R. Robinson, IMF permanent representative in Turkmenistan, stated, Turkmenistan will find a way out of the situation that has developed, but in order to do this it must not only work extremely hard in the budget, financial, and taxation spheres but also tighten its purse strings....
