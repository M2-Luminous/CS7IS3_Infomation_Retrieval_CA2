Some of these gaps are related to the subject of protecting the Palestinian people. What prevented this issue and others from being discussed in Oslo? ['Urayqat] I am surprised some local and Arab voices are trying to exploit this horrible massacre to project the weakness or impotence of the Palestinian leadership. I do not think this is the fault of the leadership. What is required is that all efforts should be pooled to besiege the terrorist Israeli action, not to blame the Palestinian leadership. Gaps in the Oslo agreement stem originally from the Madrid conference and the Israeli terms that were accepted prior to participation in the conference. The terms were very unfair to us, although we were the last to join the negotiations on the basis of the Madrid formula. Accordingly, the unfair terms in Madrid were reflected in the Oslo agreement, which revealed pretty obvious gaps, including the issues postponed to the final phase. Among them is the issue of settlements, which are considered time bombs that can explode anytime, anywhere, in the university, street, farm, or market. Naturally, agreement to postpone the settlements issue was something Palestinians accepted reluctantly, not willingly. The massacre proved what we said before: The issue of discussing the protection of Palestinians from settler attacks cannot be postponed. It has become clear that Israel cannot prevent the settlers' terrorist operations. We hope the world will realize no negotiations can lead to a successful conclusion of the peace process unless the issue of settlements is on the agenda. Once again, we warn against the current campaign that seeks to take revenge or disparage the Palestinian leadership. The newspapers are devoting 10 percent to the massacre and 90 percent to Palestinian rift. Concentrating on and deepening the Palestinian rift is not in our interest. We take pride in the fact that we are the only people in the region who can directly criticize the president. This does not exist in any other Arab state. I stress that efforts should be pooled toward providing protection of the Palestinian people and exposing Israeli terrorism after it has developed in an unprecedented manner. [Al-Masri] In the light of the Hebron massacre and based on what you said in your reply to the first question, is the Oslo formula still valid for negotiations, particularly after the criticism of this formula by a big power like Russia, which called for a new conference that would supersede the failed formula? ['Urayqat] The question to ask is if the peace process based on the Madrid formula is valid. This formula was based on the principle of land for peace. Thus far, Israel has not abided, even formally, by the principle of withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, with the exception of talk about withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Israeli practices on the ground indicate the continuation of settlement activity, intransigence, and terrorism. There is also Israel's failure to implement any international legitimacy resolutions. This largely overshadows the entire peace process. The question now is if the current peace process between the Arabs and Israel has any future. The matter is no longer connected with a Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The have endured the major burden of the peace process because they were in the forefront. The question now concerns all. It does not have to do only with Oslo, but the entire peace process on all the tracks. I think Israel's failure to abide by withdrawal raises serious questions about the feasibility of the peace process. [Al-Masri] How do you view the recent Russian initiative? ['Urayqat] It is very good. I am glad Russia has begun to get out of its seclusion and its complete subservience to the United States. When we began the Madrid conference there were two loud voices. A few months later, the Soviet Union collapsed and the United States was alone in the arena, drafting and deciding world policy. The Russian initiative signals the beginning of Russian disengagement from the United States. Russia has begun to realize that the peace process in its current form cannot succeed. Consequently, Russia has begun to demand a new mechanism. This is a good step that should be studied thoroughly and carefully. It should also be supported even if Israel and the United States reject it. [Al-Masri] But Russia is still politically dependent on the U.S. Administration. Some believe the Russian initiative is nothing but a tactical move made in agreement with the United States to put indirect pressure on Israel. This is because Russia's need for aid renders it unable to lay out a foreign policy that is independent of U.S. policy, at least under the current circumstances. How do you view that? ['Urayqat] In light of its economic and political problems, I cannot tell what Russia can or cannot do. However, no one should underestimate Russia's regional, continental, or international weight. Therefore, Russia's noncompliance with U.S. decisions is a step that must be encouraged and blessed by all Arabs. As for the U.S. stand on the Russian initiative, I believe decision makers at the U.S. State Department still think in accordance with the Likud's mentality. Clinton's objective is to emerge before public opinion with a procedural, formal solution aimed at saving Israel, not the peace process. It has been proved to us that the U.S. decision making circles are controlled by the Likud mentality. They are more Israeli than Israel itself. Therefore, the U.S. reservation about the Russian initiative raises doubts about the fate of the peace process. [Al-Masri] Palestinians had linked the resumption of the negotiations to the return of the Marj al-Zuhur deportees. We know what happened later. Afterward, Palestinians insisted on a certain position regarding the crossings issue. However, later, they approved the Cairo agreement. Will the same thing happen regarding the Hebron massacre? Or will the Palestinian leadership learn from its previous policies? ['Urayqat] We cannot judge this issue in isolation from the prevailing circumstances. If we want to deal with politics, we cannot raise the same slogans all the time. Politics is a continuous process through which the politician seeks to achieve the best of what can be achieved. But such attempts do not take place in isolation from the various parties's conflicting interests and the pressures that are being exercised. One day, we will disclose how the Palestinian delegation returned to the negotiations and the circumstances and pressures that are exercised against the delegation on all levels. The question is not that of making concessions or not. It really has to do with people's lives and security. If the peace process does not protect human lives, then what use does it have? Therefore, the Palestinian delegation cannot hold negotiations with Israel if there is no agreement on international protection for the Palestinians. [Al-Masri] The White House announced that it did not want Palestinian preconditions for the resumption of the negotiations and that it would exercise the veto at the UN Security Council if the PLO insists on its conditions. Does this mean that the PLO will return to the negotiations without preconditions? Or will it ignore the U.S. position? ['Urayqat] The U.S. position is totally biased toward Israel. The Palestinian leadership is coming under tremendous U.S., Israeli, and domestic pressure. I believe the time is not right for inciting inter-Palestinian differences. It is time for Palestinian agreement on the demand for international protection. The Palestinian leadership's impasse has been going on for years. It is taking various forms and dimensions. I hope attempts to strike at the unity of our people will be unsuccessful. I hope the Palestinian leadership will be able to circumvent this impasse. We are sure the Palestinian leadership is well aware that Palestinian demands are not conditions, but legitimate demands to ensure the success of the peace process. [Al-Masri] Do you think there is a possibility of Israel abandoning the protection of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, especially since Rabin's legal advisers counseled him not to make a hasty decision to evacuate the Hebron settlement because the court might reject the government's decision? ['Urayqat] The ball is now in Rabin's court. He must make the courageous decision. If they want peace, they cannot continue the settlements. It is either the settlements or the agreement. We call at the outset for dismantling the settlement in the heart of Hebron and the one in the heart of Nabulus, because they are elements of tension and pressure for the peace process. [Al-Masri] What issues were on the Washington talks agenda? Is it true they were confined to negotiations on election arrangements and forming the transitional council? ['Urayqat] The discussion was not confined to what you mentioned, but included several other geographic issues concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Oslo agreement covers less than 10 percent of the occupied territories. Therefore, the Oslo agreement is one of many required steps that would cover all the occupied territories. The Washington talks center on the other issues that have not been discussed. In addition to the issue of elections and the formation of the legislative council, we placed on the agenda issues such as the redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank and a review of military orders applied on the Palestinian side, and then the complete transfer of authority in the occupied territories. An agreement was reached on a discussion of these issues in Washington. However, the terrorist Israeli operation in Hebron cast a shadow on the negotiations. As a result, we suspended the talks. [Al-Masri] What use are the bilateral negotiation in Washington now when other negotiations are taking place under 'Arafat's leadership and supervision in Paris, Taba, Cairo, and other places? Don't you think the negotiations here have a formal nature, given that other secret talks have always been held behind the scene? ['Urayqat] We do not differentiate between the leadership inside the territory and the leadership outside. At the beginning of the negotiations there were unfair conditions, such as the postponement of the settlements issue, preventing the PLO from directly participating, and not allowing delegation members from Jerusalem. Now I am proud of the fact that there are no restrictions concerning membership in negotiations. The PLO is negotiating directly and is freely selecting the negotiating delegation. [Al-Masri] Why have the links with the Palestinian delegation to the bilateral been cut, given that they have political weight in the occupied territories and they participated in long rounds of negotiations during which they gained enough experience in talking to Israeli negotiators. Moreover, they know many details because they live in the occupied territory. ['Urayqat] The delegation is not an establishment or a permanent company. It is formed in accordance with missions. These members carried out definite tasks. Before the Hebron massacre we talked about reforming the Palestinian delegation for the bilateral peace talks. Many of these names are candidate members. I assure you that the question is not linked to individuals. Nobody is allowed to prefer his own political stands in accordance with his own place in the political formula. The delegation is composed of individuals tasked with a certain mission by the PLO central command. The command is capable of deciding their continuation or otherwise. [Al-Masri] Why the delay in forming the Palestinian establishments or naming their heads or officials? ['Urayqat] The United States leveled these accusations at us twice: once in a meeting with Christopher in Jerusalem and once in Amman. In fact, we formed establishments such as the economic council for construction and development and appointed its technical staff, which has been working for years. I don't know why, but whenever the Palestinian side attains the capability to work independently, we come under attack and criticism as though the specter of trusteeship never leaves us. [Al-Masri] The subject of elections raises an argument between proponents and opponents who are afraid that these elections will produce elements that have no links with the PLO and are probably opposed to the settlement. Other voices believe that it is important to protect the Palestinian community through democracy. How do you see this? ['Urayqat] Elections are one of the most important guarantees for the existence of the Palestinian people, but this democracy should be real and should not be a mere facade to satisfy the authority's objectives. I am pleased to say that the first decision signed by President 'Arafat after the Oslo agreement was the formation of a committee assigned to deal with elections and local government, and that he appointed me as the head of this committee. I believe that the time is ripe for elections because elections not only give legitimacy to the continuation of the new state regime, but also give it a power that protects the Palestinian people. I think that elections should be held as soon as possible. Some people, who have vindicative aims, may raise the pretext of instability. The strategic point of view says real democracy is one of the pillars for the continuation of the Palestinian people. [Al-Masri] What is the elections and local government committee doing to make these elections a reality? Are the elections you speak about local or legislative elections? ['Urayqat] The elections committee is comprised of brothers Faruq al-Sarraf, 'Ali al-Safarini, Rami 'Abd-al-Hadi, Muhammad 'Ishtayah, and Zahirah Kamal. This committee, which I chair, operates on several horizons, including the legal horizon, with the aim of attaining a unified law for municipal and council elections in the West Bank, and laying down the basic law for council elections and the electoral system. We have 480 population centers in 29 municipalities, 82 rural councils, and 26 camps, in addition to 347 population centers that do not have any councils. This situation has prevailed since the time of Ottoman rule, and this emphasizes the need for reorganizing the structural map of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The only three existing governorates cannot continue to work without setting up new governorates such as Tulkarm, Janin, Qalqilyah, and Bethlehem governorates. New municipalities should also be formed, and rural councils should be set up in some villages. This does not mean that development will be carried out from above, but rather should include all levels. Some 72 percent of the rural areas suffer from the absence of councils, and are run by mukhtars. This is a dangerous defect that should be tackled by setting up municipal or rural councils to carry out the required construction projects. In addition to this, the committee is working to carry out censuses, and cadres are being trained to run elections. The elections will be held on various levels; the national, legislative, local, municipal, and rural levels as well as other levels. [Al-Masri] Will the elections be delayed because the Palestinian side is not prepared yet, or will they be held on 13 July in accordance with Oslo agreement? ['Urayqat] The holding of elections is not a decision to be made by 'Arafat or Rabin alone, it is a process that has long procedures that should be taken into consideration. We need 150 voting centers and about 6,000 supervisors and trainers on supervision. There is a need for a UN committee that represents Europe, the cosponsors of peace talks, Canada, Australia, Japan, and China to observe elections. All this requires time, and now we are in late March. This means that it is impossible to hold elections on July, but we will do all we can to hold the elections as soon as possible.
