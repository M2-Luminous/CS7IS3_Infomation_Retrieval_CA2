"I think it's a wise decision," Mr De Klerk said on the CCV [Contemporary Community Values] programme Newsline. "That now, to my mind, prepares the table for further negotiations between us as a government and the PAC with regard to practical matters," he said. Mr De Klerk expressed the hope that the decision would be obeyed by cadres of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, the PAC's military wing. "I really do hope that they succeed in disciplining the APLA people to obey their policy decision and to fall in line and to also in practise stop with violent actions and planning violent deeds and making attacks."
