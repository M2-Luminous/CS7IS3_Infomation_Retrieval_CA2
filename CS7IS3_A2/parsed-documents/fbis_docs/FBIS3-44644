Some books on "legal tax evasion" also have been published. What a strange thing! How can "tax evasion" be "legal?" As a matter of fact, the so-called "legal tax evasion" is aimed at instructing tax evaders to pay less tax or no tax at all under the pretext of "legality." In the final analysis, it is aimed at instigating people to violate the law. In China, with the development of reform and opening up, the contradictions between tax evasion and the struggle against tax evasion are growing day by day. The phenomenon of tax evasion has appeared in both domestic and foreign-owned enterprises, but more frequently in the latter. Of course, this does not mean that all foreign-owned enterprises have evaded taxes. Many of them have been doing well in this respect, but quite a few of them have tried to evade taxes by all means in the links, such as signing contracts, providing funds, carrying out production and management, purchasing equipment and materials, and selling products. This is also a fact. The main method they have used is to transfer profit and let the enterprises suffer "losses." Checking their accounts, we find that the losses suffered by some foreign-owned enterprises in some areas are more than 50 percent of their investment. Ridiculously, very few such enterprises have closed down because of these losses. Some foreign- owned enterprises that are suffering "losses" have even continued to increase investment despite such losses. These abnormal phenomena merely show that their "losses" are not real and that what they are doing is precisely to evade taxes. By doing so, the "tax evaders" have earned greater profits, but the interests of the state have been harmed. To absorb foreign funds and implement a preferential tax policy toward foreign-owned enterprises is a policy we have adopted since reform and opening up. The purpose is to promote cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. If the enterprises play tricks and try to evade taxes at the expense of the public interest, further cooperation between the two sides certainly will be harmed. This is not only a practice to which we are opposed, but also a practice that is not tolerated under international law. Over the past few years, China's tax departments have studied the experience and practice of other countries in opposing tax evasion. Gradually, and in light of China's realities, they have worked out and perfected some laws, regulations, and methods, as well as a series of measures to fight tax evasion. It is necessary to run training classes on fighting tax evasion and to explain the relevant articles of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Tax Levy and Administration" to those who try to evade tax payments "legally" so they can remember that it is illegal to "evade tax payments legally." It is also necessary for the departments concerned to check those people who are instigating others to "legally" violate the law, to see what kind of people they are.
