However, the plan is overshadowed by disputes between some Asian countries and the United States over whether some policy preconditions should be linked to loan provisions. The United States also wants to see more money entEr social projects, such as anti-poverty programs, improvement of women's status, environment protection and family planning. This position was disputed by India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and China. These countries insist that loan provisions should not be linked with policy preconditions. Bank president Mitsuo Sato said the bank would try to help solve the dispute. The bank's board of governors will vote on May 22 on the capital boost plan. The meeting was attended by 225 delegates from the bank's 55 member nations. Economic reconstruction, approaches to economic expansion, and challenges facing Asian nations were the topics which dominated the discussions. A consensus at the gathering is that the Asian-Pacific region has made a large contribution to global economic recovery. The Asian countries realized an average rise of 7 percent in their gross domestic production (GDP) despite a world-wide recession in 1993. The meeting also called on member states to settle problems challenging economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region where unbalanced economic development, a shortage of capital, poverty, a deteriorating environment, and population pressure are serious obstacles to further growth. Some representatives have asked for lower interest on loans, an augmented capital flow, and greater help for those countries which are lagging behind. Zhou Shengqing, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, also attended the meeting.
