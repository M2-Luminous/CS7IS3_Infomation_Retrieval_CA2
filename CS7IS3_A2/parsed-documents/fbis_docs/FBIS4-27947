Reporters from the Chinese media and foreign reporters in China attended the news conference. DPRK Ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun made remarks at the news conference. Ambassador Chu said: The IAEA has recently issued information indicating that it would not take the issue with the discovery of a considerable amount of undeclared plutonium in Japan. This shows the unfairness and irresponsibility of the IAEA as it is. Pointing out that originally the foundation of the international organization's existence is based on its fairness, he concretely disclosed: Regarding nuclear the inspections of us, the IAEA has distorted the fact and submitted a wrong report to the UN Security Council. Based on it, the UN Security Council has adopted a so- called presidential statement, thus kicking up an improper commotion. Also, he stressed that this clearly shows the IAEA's unfairness. He pointed out: The agency's behavior of backing Japan's nuclear armament by looking on it with indifference, while taking the issue with our peaceful nuclear activity under the unjust pretext, thus submitting its inspections to political intentions [kigu sachalul chongchijok uidoe pokchong sikimyonso], is an act of gravely running counter to the spirit of the IAEA itself. Also, he stressed that the agency must revise its unjust position on the nuclear issue of Korea in conformity with its own mission. He appealed to reporters to correctly see the true color of the Japanese authorities' nuclear ambitions and to disclose and condemn them in the presence of the people throughout the world. At the same time, he also appealed to them to pay attention to the unfairness of the IAEA, which has conducted nuclear inspections from the insidious political angle. While answering reporters' questions, he stressed that it is the United States that has built the largest nuclear depot in the Far East by introducing nuclear weapons into South Korea, and that has aroused the suspicion of nuclear development in the DPRK, therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be only resolved by Korea-U.S. talks. Referring to the so-called sanctions talked by the United States and its followers, he stressed that as already declared by the DPRK Government, we will regard any steps to impose sanctions on us as a declaration of war. Also, he expressed the conviction that as they have straightly embarked upon the single road of victory with their own foot up to date by smashing all kinds of obstructive plots by the U.S. imperialists, our people -- in the future, too -- will be fully capable of defeating any sanction steps with a strong might in which they are single-heartedly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, and that they will continue consolidating and developing our country into a popular mass-centered socialist powerful country, thus upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il- song.
