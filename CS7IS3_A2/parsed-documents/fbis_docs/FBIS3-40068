It is forecast that the annual gross value of industrial output will increase by 20 percent or more, the annual scale of fixed asset investment could break 1 trillion yuan, increasing by 45 percent or more, and the retail price index will increase by about 13 percent. In the two months since the estimate, the tightness of funds could have been somewhat relieved, but it will be difficult for the materials market to exhibit significant change in supply and demand. Moreover, led by the anticipated decline in futures and long-term forward contract prices on several exchanges, the prices of production materials will essentially maintain a steady decline and the rise in the annual price index will be about 40 percent. The weak market trading situation will not show a significant change. It is estimated that annual steel production could increase by 15 percent, and with imports, total resources could break 100 million tons for the first time. Total annual materials sales for the whole society could reach 1.75 trillion yuan, a 30 percent increase. Within that materials system sales are forecast to be 630 billion yuan, an increase of about 35 percent. Next year the overall economy will have another rapid growth year, although the growth rate could be a little lower than this year. According to preliminary estimates, next year the scale of investments will increase by at least 20 percent. Next year the economic growth rate and the rate of inflation could both reach double digits. To maintain economic stability, the corresponding economic rebound cannot be delayed to the second quarter of next year. It is understood that in setting up the plan for next year the guiding thought is to achieve sustained rapid economic growth as much as possible. (II) According to the basic estimates given above, the combined index of production material prices is expected to continue to rise, but the increase could be smaller than this year. Preliminary calculations are for the combined index of prices influenced by upturning factors to rise by five percentage points next year. Adding new price rising factors, the rise in the combined index could exceed 10 percent. Certainly, the overall characteristic of next year's prices will not simply be rising or declining. Next year's production material prices fluctuations could very well exhibit a complicated and changeable situation, because next year the factors influencing price fluctuations will increase. Not only must we consider the domestic economy, we also must consider changes in the international market, and we must especially consider the implementation of several recent major reform measures. For example, reform of the Ministry of Finance tax revenue system, reform of the financial system, reform of the foreign exchange and foreign trade systems, and continuing adjustments (or freeing up) of the prices of energy, basic raw materials, and transportation could have a huge influence on the economy and the production materials market. So, structural change will be a pronounced characteristic of next year's materials market prices. Both the product mix and the regional structure could cause them to rise or fall. The characteristics of the market economy will be even more significant. In addition, next year the adjusted price of foreign exchange could tend to rise. Some experts believe that if China wants to accelerate the merging of the dual track foreign exchange system and lessen the impact of "reentry into the GATT," it should be accompanied with a continued devaluation of the renminbi. If the foreign exchange rate is merged next year and the foreign exchange quota system is eliminated, the price of foreign exchange could reach or exceed 9 yuan to the U.S. dollar. This would help the international balance of payments, but it also could promote domestic price rises. (III) Based on the above analysis of next year's macroeconomy, we have calculated the balance of supply and demand for principal materials. It can be simply described as follows: 1. There still will be a gap between supply and demand for steel and the market can be expected to rebound. Next year's steel demand is forecast to increase by 10 percent to 13 percent. As regards resources, domestic production could increase by 12 percent to 15 percent. With the use of some reserves, there still would be a rather large gap that will depend on imports. So, the steel market can be expected to rebound in the first half of next year. As regards product mix, the majority of the overstock is in wire rods and threaded steel. So, it is difficult to expect that the prices of construction use steel could return to this year's high levels. Production materials such as some plate and tubing materials, especially such heavily imported materials as cold-rolled silicon steel sheets, large diameter seamless tubes, and galvanized iron could again tend to be tight. Next year China will still need to import a rather large amount of steel. At the same time, it also will eliminate the licensing system for a group of materials including steel and there will be an increase in destabilizing factors on the steel market. 2. The prices of nonferrous metals could come out of the low valley. It is estimated that next year the world economy will tend to rebound and it could somewhat increase the demand for nonferrous metals, and the international price could come out of the valley. The domestic economy will maintain a rather high acceleration and the demand could continue to rise. The market price will stumble toward stability and then rebound to a certain extent. According to overall calculations, next year copper and aluminum will have to maintain imports no lower than this year to essentially balance domestic resource supply and demand. 3. The supply of coal can be assured and the market price will steadily rise. It is forecast that next year the demand will continue to steadily rise, increasing by 5 percent to 6 percent and reaching about 1.2 billion tons. Next year coal production can maintain about a 5 percent rate of increase, and with a rather high level of reserves, can essentially satisfy demand. But because of the effect of inadequate transportation and adjusted prices, the price of coal still will rise steadily. 4. The building materials market will rise steadily. Next year investment growth will remain a major factor moving the economy, and the building materials market continue to look favorable. It is estimated that next year national cement consumption will continue to increase, exports will remain steady with this year, and total demand will increase by approximately 14 percent. Generally, domestic production capacity can satisfy demand, but there is a pronounced contradiction in the product mix, and large cement and high grade cement could still be tight. The market for other building materials such as glass and ceramics for construction use and decorating materials also will gradually improve. 5. There is a rather large contradiction in lumber production and demand and the market tends to be tight. It is estimated that next year lumber demand will be largely the same as this year, but because domestic production also could decline, the balance of supply and demand will depend more and more on imported resources. If Western economies recover, the demand for lumber could increase, creating a tight international market, and the price could go higher. It appears that next year imports could continue to be reduced and the price tend to rise. 6. The chemical industry market is both sluggish and flourishing with product mix the principal contradiction. Next year with the national economy growing rather rapidly, the chemical industry market demand could rebound somewhat, but there is a rather large divergence among various types of products. The sales of plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), PVC resin, and ABS resin, and natural rubber can be expected to improve and prices will tend to rise. 7. Automobile market resources are adequate, but prices are rather greatly effected by policy. Since the third quarter, influenced by such policies as tight money and increased credit association controls, the flourishing automobile market suddenly cooled, dropping everywhere, and the prices of large and small vehicles generally declined. It is estimated that next year's automobile production could reach 1.5 million vehicles and with imports supply can be ensured. As regards the product mix, the market for heavy vehicles sold mainly to such key industries as the railroad, energy, and the basic raw materials industry will still be good. The small vehicle business could be in trouble compared to this year. As regards the price of automobiles, as it gradually merges with international market demand, for a period of time, the domestic price generally should steadily decline.
