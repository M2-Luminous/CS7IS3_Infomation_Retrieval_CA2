FR940930-0-00066 FR940930-0-00011 Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted, a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services. CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits Advisor (HBA). Congressional legislation caps premiums at a level equal to that of a comparable mid-range Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) program offered in the FEHBP. These premium rates were determined by category plan_either self or family and are not age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Quarterly premium rates for fiscal year 1995 will be: $410 for self and $891 for family. Following is a discussion of the comments we received regarding the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, and the action we are taking in response. 1. Quarterly Premium Rates Interim Final Rule. The interim final rule states that the Department has contracted with a private sector actuarial firm to help develop premium rates. Comment 1A. An organization has requested that the estimated rates be updated with the actual rates to be charged once they have been calculated. Response. The following will be the FY95 quarterly premium rates for the CHCBP. Self_$410; Family_$891. 2. Transitional Health Care Coverage Interim Final Rule. The interim final rule states the medical coverage for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) will be offered via the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Comment 2A. An organization of the military coalition has recommended that DoD offer transitional health benefits coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP), not CHAMPUS. Response. The Department requested the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consider granting CHCBP beneficiaries authority to select health care from their list of FEHBP programs or to make CHCBP an FEHBP program. OPM opposed this request. Additionally, the requirement to cover preexisting conditions for new enrollees would make FEHBP private insurers unlikely to enroll CHCBP beneficiaries. Therefore, standard CHAMPUS was considered the most feasible means of ensuring entitled care. On January 19, 1988, (53 FR 1343), the Department of Defense published a rule, ``Voluntary Private Health Insurance Conversion Program.'' This subject has been incorporated into 32 CFR part 199, section 199.20. Therefore, 32 CFR part 104 is removed. II. Rulemaking Procedures Executive Order 12866 requires certain regulatory assessments for any ``significant regulatory action,'' defined as one which would result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or have other substantial impacts. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires that each Federal agency prepare, and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation which would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is not a significant regulatory action under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and it would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule will impose additional information collection requirements on the public under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 USC 3501&hyph;3511), because beneficiaries will be required to enroll. OMB has granted conditional approval based on their intention of reviewing the Application Form upon its completion.
