FBIS4-4397 "dreas062_a_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Yonehara: Money Received From Hosokawa Backer Yonehara: Money Received From Hosokawa Backer OW3103040294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0332 GMT 31 Mar 94 OW3103040294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Kumamoto, March 31 KYODO -- The head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture has said he received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa when Hosokawa ran for the governorship on the LDP ticket. Kenshi Yonehara, head of the LDP's Kumamoto chapter, said in an interview that he does not know whether the money was part of the 100 million yen Hosokawa said he borrowed from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co. around that time. Yonehara said he received the money in December 1982 from a senior member of the chapter who had worked to put Hosokawa on the LDP ticket for the election in February the following year. Yonehara said the 1 million yen was handed over after the LDP approved Hosokawa as its official candidate in the race, reversing the initial decision to field then Gov. Issei Sawada as the party's candidate. Hosokawa won the election and served for two consecutive four-year terms until February 1991. Hosokawa has said that he borrowed the money in September 1982 to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home in the prefecture in western Japan, and repaid it by January 31, 1991. The premier has insisted there were no illegalities in the loan. The LDP, ousted from 38 years of unbroken rule last August by the coalition administration of Hosokawa, and the Japanese Communist Party have been holding up debate on the budget in the Diet by demanding Hosokawa submit detailed documents on the loan. The opposition has also demanded Hosokawa's former secretary testify before the Diet on the affair, which had stalled Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget for three weeks. Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct member of the Sagawa Kyubin group, was embroiled in a money scandal involving gangsters and political figures, including fallen LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax evasion last March.
