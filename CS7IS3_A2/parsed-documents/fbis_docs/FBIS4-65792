The matter must now be settled as soon as possible, he declared at a news conference yesterday afternoon. At the same time he reiterated that the new supplementary investigation must not be "a rushed and slovenly job." Yesterday, Carl Bildt was several times in contact with Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party). Their comments have been restrained in tone and well coordinated. But according to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, the Danish Government is extremely impatient that the go-ahead from Sweden is taking such a long time. Every time there is a new delay the Danish media show pictures of the places where hundreds of houses have already been demolished to make way for the bridge and interviews with unhappy former house owners. At the same time internal Danish criticism is growing. And Denmark, like Sweden, will hold elections in the fall. However, Center Party leader and Environment Minister Olof Johansson is happy and while on an election tour visiting a high school in Harnosand commented as follows on the court's pronouncement: "This is something of a victory for the Center Party," he said, speaking of a "rebuff for the consortium," a new round of consultations, and a possible decision as late as this fall, perhaps after the election. Carl Bildt responded by saying that the question of a new round of consultations has by no means been decided and that he dislikes Johansson's talk of victory. Johansson is confusing his roles, the prime minister hinted: "If he is approaching the issue in party political terms, this could bring him into conflict with his responsibility as the minister who must deal with the matter."
