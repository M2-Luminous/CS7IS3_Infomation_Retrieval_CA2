In an interview with the Cologne EXPRESS (Friday edition), the minister stated that he is aware of the defense minister's financial worries and concerns. Yet he added that, in the event of a further reduction of the Bundeswehr, the constitutional stipulation of equality in conscription would sooner or later become a problem. It must be determined what troop strength is needed for what purpose, and then the financial aspect must be discussed, and not the other way round, under the motto: "How much money do we have, and how many soldiers can we afford for that?" Ruehe stated in Bonn on Wednesday [2 February], that, in order to cut defense expenditure, the strength of the Bundeswehr should be reduced to 345,000 soldiers by the end of 1994 and not to 370,000, as originally planned.
