This was how the Russian Navy's press center commented on reports by the foreign mass media about Pacific Fleet vessels taking part "in wide-scale maneuvers in the region of the South Kurils." It is alleged that Russia's surface fleet, in conjunction with ground and border troops, is working on the task of seizing foreign territories there. It was explained to the ITAR-TASS correspondent at the Navy's main headquarters that the Red Banner Pacific Fleet is at present engaged in its usual training according to the schedule approved by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Seven of the fleet's warships are being used in the "Putina" operation aimed at protecting the nation's natural wealth, including in the region of the South Kurils. The fleet's participation in joint actions with border guards and the air force to protect the state border and to curb mass poaching which is detrimental to Russia has not been concealed. It was specifically reported in both the Russian and foreign mass media. In the view of specialists of the Navy's main headquarters, the situation in the Far East is rather difficult. However, in their words, it is not a case of our fleet being "aggressive," but rather of the rapidly changing situation. Pacific Fleet warships and forces of the Russian Border Troops are stepping up their efforts [to increase] the effectiveness of the "Putina" operation. This is not to the liking of those who in recent years have grown accustomed to making brazen use of marine resources which by rights belong exclusively to Russia. Naval seamen claim that this explains the appearance of material misinforming the world public.
