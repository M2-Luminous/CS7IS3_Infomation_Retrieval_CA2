A new §571.304, Standard No. 304; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container Integrity, is added to Part 571, to read as follows: §571.304 Standard No. 304; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container Integrity. S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the integrity of compressed natural gas (CNG), motor vehicle fuel containers. S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel leakage during and after motor vehicle crashes. S3. Application. This standard applies to containers designed to store CNG as motor fuel on-board any motor vehicle. S4. Definitions. Brazing means a group of welding processes wherein coalescence is produced by heating to a suitable temperature above 800 F and by using a nonferrous filler metal, having a melting point below that to the base metals. The filler metal is distributed between the closely fitted surfaces of the joint by capillary attraction. Burst pressure means the highest internal pressure reached in a CNG fuel container during a burst test at a temperature of 21 C (70 F). CNG fuel container means a container designed to store CNG as motor fuel on-board a motor vehicle. Fill pressure means the internal pressure of a CNG fuel container attained at the time of filling. Fill pressure varies according to the gas temperature in the container which is dependent on the charging parameters and the ambient conditions. Full wrapped means applying the reinforcement of a filament or resin system over the entire liner, including the domes. Hoop wrapped means winding of filament in a substantially circumferential pattern over the cylindrical portion of the liner so that the filament does not transmit any significant stresses in a direction parallel to the cylinder longitudinal axis. Hydrostatic pressure means the internal pressure to which a CNG fuel container is taken during testing set forth in S5.4.1. Liner means the inner gas tight container or gas cylinder to which the overwrap is applied. Service pressure means the internal settled pressure of a CNG fuel container at a uniform gas temperature of 21 C (70 F) and full gas content. It is the pressure for which the container has been constructed under normal conditions. Stress ratio means the stress in the fiber at minimum burst pressure divided by the stress in the fiber at service pressure. S5␣ Container and material requirements. S5.1␣Container designations.
