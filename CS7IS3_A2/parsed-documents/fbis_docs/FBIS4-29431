FBIS4-29431 "dreas117_d_94033" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea Ministry To Lower Minimum Loan Requirement Ministry To Lower Minimum Loan Requirement SK1506012494 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD in English 15 Jun 94 p 8 SK1506012494 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD English BFN [Text] The government will allow foreign banks operating in the nation to reduce the amount of money they are required to loan to small- and medium-sized companies, a top official of the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. Currently, foreign banks are required to lend 35 percent of an increase in their total lending to small- and medium-sized companies. Assistant Minister of Finance Sin Myong-ho said the government will allow them to allocate 10 percent of the loan increase for the purchase of bonds related to small- and medium-sized companies in the primary market. This action taken by the government will have the effect of reducing the ratio to 25 percent, Sin said at the Korea-U.S. Business Conference which ended yesterday. Referring to the North Korean nuclear issue, he said, it has had no serious effect on the South Korean economy. "Our economy has now attained a mature phase of development which will allow us to sustain our economic policies without real effect from the present nuclear issue," he said. He said South Korea's total foreign exchange holdings, which stand at #37 billion at the moment, are equivalent to the value of four months of current foreign exchange transactions. Should the South and North Korean confrontation over the nuclear issue be prolonged, however, South Korea would find it difficult to secure funds in foreign money and capital markets. The Ministry of Finance's internal report said Korea would have to pay higher rates of interest on its loans from abroad if the nuclear issue is not resolved at an early date. The report said the ministry will encourage domestic corporations and financial institutions to issue depositary certificates to secure funds abroad instead of bonds whose yields may fluctuate. Yields of the bonds issued by Korea corporations and financial institutions have recently climbed by one-sixteenth to one-eighth of a percentage point, the report said. In the face of rising interest rates, the report said, some domestic banks have delayed their plans to borrow money from abroad.
