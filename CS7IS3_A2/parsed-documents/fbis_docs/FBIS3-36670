The newspaper points out that under present conditions the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly "will hardly play the political role which was assigned to it by former speaker of the Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov. In the opinion of the newspaper, "The CIS Interparliamentary Assembly is most likely to transform from a high-aiming agency into yet another CIS show helping the new and old speakers to stay aware of their political significance". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages an article headlined "A Disintegration Process in Russia's Nuclear Power Industry Is Under Way". According to the newspaper, the fuel reserves at such major Russian nuclear power stations as the Smolensk and Leningrad ones will suffice for 11 and 14 days respectively. If nothing changes, electric power will be supplied to central Russia only for several hours a day, the newspaper cautions. "Last year, Russia's nuclear power stations, according to international organisations, operated more reliably than those of the United States and France," the writer of the article pointed out. "It was necessary, it would seem. To support our nuclear power industry. Instead, it has been subjected to large-scale experiments", with the necessary funds not being assigned, the author of the article writes, recalling that nuclear power stations supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and practically the entire south-western region of Russia. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan who dwelt on economic problems and migration processes. Nazarbayev remarked that he is worried at the outflow of ethnic Germans from the republic. "I understand the feelings of people who seek to return to their historical homeland, the more so as most of them had arrived in Kazakhstan not of their own will. But during talks with the leaders of Germany I always raise matters aimed at expanding the presence of German business in Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev said. Speaking about relations with Russia, Nazarbayev said the two countries are equally interested in meeting their commitments. Treaties on military cooperation and joint space projects are now in the works, he added. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an article about the course of investigation of the case involving participants in the October events of last year in Moscow. The investigation concerning former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, just as all the other arrested after the September-October crisis, is proceeding agonisingly slowly, the writer of the article maintains. "Virtually, the charge against Rutskoy is based on his only phrase urging people to seize the Moscow mayor's office and the Ostankino Television centre," the author of the article points out. The journalist believes that the proceedings are being dragged out while the election campaign promises by many a member of the State Duma about their intention to set up special parliamentary commissions to inquire into the case proved unfulfilled. "One can suppose that the 'Octobrists' case' will hardly be examined by a law-court this year. Upon playing its election- campaign role, the case is most likely to surface again only when the time will come for yet another election campaign," the journalist concludes. TRUD reports that last year Russian customs houses prevented the smuggling of valuables, worth about 110,000 million roubles, out of the country. "The customs services confiscated 4,000 art object and antiques, and more than 50,000 firearms," the newspaper said. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR), commenting on Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's tour of units of the Privolzhskiy military district, points out that such trips are prompted by the fact that "it is urgently necessary to check on the spot the possibility of implementing the new ideas inherent in the military doctrine". PRAVDA announces that President Boris Yeltsin will soon deliver a report to the Federal Assembly on the country's national security strategy. In this connection the newspaper runs one of the alternative projects drawn up by a group of independent experts. The project was prepared with an eye to a national doctrine in this respect. The drafters of the project believe that "preventing a civil war, strengthening state institutions, precluding a break-up of Russia, and overcoming the socio-economic crisis are the most acute problems facing the state in 1994".
