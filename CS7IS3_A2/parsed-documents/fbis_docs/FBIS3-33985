The vigilant people know that the enemies of the Islamic revolution have always been apprehensive about the Muslim nation's presence on the scene, especially during the Ten Days of Dawn, the symbol of the greatness and grandeur of Islam and the people of Iran. At various times, they have sought to neutralize or undermine this action. The incident at the mausoleum of the imam, may God be pleased with him, proved that during the festivities to mark the victory of the Islamic revolution, the powers of world arrogance and the enemies of the Islamic revolution intend to stage incidents to disrupt the popular activity. What we witnessed yesterday affirms the vigilance and alertness of the people, who, for the past 15 years, have maintained an active presence on the scene of the defense of the Islamic revolution and on the line of the late imam. The people's slogans following the random shooting at the sacred precincts of the [mausoleum of] the Islamic revolution's founder indicate that the plots of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic revolution are ineffective and constitute a declaration of allegiance to the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Everyone should know, at this critical time for the Islamic revolution and the country's construction, when the enemies' hopes are being turned into despondency, that only vigilance and alertness and knowledgeable action can steer the Islamic revolution toward its lofty goals. Everyone should know that the powers of world arrogance fear the Ten Days of Dawn and the celebration of the Day of God [Yawm- Allah] on 11 February. The 11 February marches have already perturbed the Islamic revolution's enemies. This year, as in previous years, the people will again display their unified presence at the 11 February marches and reaffirm their unwavering determination to safeguard the revolution's gains--to the chagrin of their enemies.
