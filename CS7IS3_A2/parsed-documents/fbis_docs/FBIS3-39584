He said that, in the 75-minute conversation, he had primarily described how the new moderately conservative political grouping had been created and what had been done to draw lists of candidates with a good chance of beating the progressives. Berlusconi also admitted that he had talked to Scalfaro about his brother Paolo's judicial problems thanks to allegations that he paid kickbacks to sell real estate. "I informed him of my assessment of the fact and the situation," said Berlusconi. Berlusconi also said that moderate conservatives such as the ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party and Pact for Italy would create "uncertainty" in the voters by claiming to stand for the bloc of moderate opinion known as the Centre in the old political system. "They are putting themselves in a position that is difficult to explain to the people," he said adding that they face defeat unless they say which side they are on. He also defended his electoral alliance with the Northern League and the extreme rightists of the Italian Social Movement. In other remarks, Berlusconi maintained his potential candidacy as prime minister.
