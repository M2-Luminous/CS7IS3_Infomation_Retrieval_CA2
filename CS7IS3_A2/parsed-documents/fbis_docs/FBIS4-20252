Tzou and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Paris, April 22 (CNA) -- France's Cogema [General Nuclear Materials Company] and the Taiwan Power Company [Taipower] are set to enter into a deal whereby Cogema will provide Taipower with the technologies it needs to manage and safely recycle Taiwan's stock of nuclear waste. While meeting with a Taiwan power company delegation, Cogema deputy managing director Bernard Lenail said recycling spent fuel discharged from nuclear power plants to produce usable fuel like uranium and plutonium has become a world trend, especially now that stocks of uranium have decreased substantially worldwide over the past decade. Lenail said Taipower cannot either economically or environmentally afford to keep storing waste from Taiwan's three nuclear power plants, which Taipower says has accumulated at an alarming pace since the first plant became operational in 1987. Nuclear fuel recycling is well established in France, Lenail said. More than 80 percent of the world's spent nuclear waste is reprocessed there. The Taipower mission visited an enriched uranium processing plant in Nimes in southern France and a major nuclear waste processing plant in Troyes in central France during its fact-finding trip. The mission members said they were impressed by the environmental "miracles" they saw in the vicinity of the nuclear plants, including fish and crocodile ponds using hot water dischargd from the plants, green fields, and herds of grazing cows. About 75 percent of France's energy comes from nuclear power plants, and 70 percent of the fuel consumed by Taipower's three nuclear power plants is supplied by France.
