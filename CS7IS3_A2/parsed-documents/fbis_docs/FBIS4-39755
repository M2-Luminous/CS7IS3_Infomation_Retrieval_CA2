This was said by Chairman of the Russian Anti-Monopoly Committee Leonid Bochin during the government meeting on Wednesday. The number of employees of a small business in the industry and construction was fixed at 200 people, in agriculture and other branches of production, wholesale trading, science and scientific services at 50, and in retail trading and the non-production sphere at 15. Natural persons engaged in entrepreneurial activity without obtaining the status of a legal person are also regarded as small businesses. Leonid Bochin said the state support of small businesses will take the form of a simplified procedure for registering and licencing their activity, support for their foreign economic activity, the organisation of training and retraining, as well as the provision of easy access to financial, material, technical and information resources. The new law stipulates that no state support will be extended to small businesses in which one or several legal persons hold shares of the authorised capital in excess of 25 percent. Annually at least 0.5 percent of the total spending from the federal, regional and local budgets will be alloted to support small businesses. Taxes will be levied on small businesses in the five first years of their activity, but some tax breaks are envisioned. The government approved the bill on the whole and decided to send it to the State Duma after putting final touches to it, taking into account critical remarks and proposals made during the discussion.
