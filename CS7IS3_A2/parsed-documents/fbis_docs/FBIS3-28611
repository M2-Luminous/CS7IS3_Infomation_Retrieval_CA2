"If the United States decides to make sanctions against us we can answer. These sanctions are pressure against us so we are prepared for war or peace," North Korean Counsellor to Beijing Choe Han-chun told journalists. North Korea has refused to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of facilities in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, suspected by Western countries of storing plutonium for making nuclear weapons. Washington and Seoul have warned Pyongyang that it would face concerted international action, most likely sanctions, if it fails to agree to inspections before February 21, when the IAEA convenes a board of governors' meeting. Choe said the hardline Stalinist state would agree to inspections only when "the United States is not trying to force us and make the circumstances to receive the inspection." However, he reiterated that his country would not open all its facilities to "irregular and ad hoc" inspections, as the IAEA is demanding. "To inspect all facilities means we give full scope inspection -- we did not promise this inspection to the United States. We promised only for guaranteeing the continuity of the safeguard," he said. Choe said the situation on the Korean peninsula would remain "dangerous and still strained" until the United States and South Korea called off planned Team Spirit military exercises. China -- which has veto power on the U.N. Security Council -- has opposed sanctions, cautioning that they could drive isolated North Korea to an unpredictable response and urging the United States to continue negotiations.
