Two morpho-functional types were established, based on the ultramicroscopic features of the macrophages and morphometric characteristics of these cells' organelles. The first type included macrophages with a pronounced lysosomal apparatus and a large number of phagosomes that contained a muscular dendrite. They were responsible for phagocytic functions and facilitated debridement of tissue disintegration products from the wound. The second (secretory) type included cells with a developed granular endoplasmic reticulum that could exert a regulatory influence on skeletal muscle reparative regeneration processes. Immunomodulators influenced the level of organelle development in both types of macrophages, which facilitated earlier initiation of regeneration processes and wound healing.
