The four-page paper sums up the agreements -- but primarily the disagreements -- pertaining to the border crossings problem. [passage omitted] The following are some of the points specified in the paper: -- The parties agree that anything that is decided with regard to the Allenby Bridge border crossing will also apply to the other border crossings. -- It is agreed that all the existing border crossings, including the crossings from Jordan and Egypt into Israel, as well as the crossings from the Green Line into the territories, will remain where they are to be used as border crossings in the future. -- The parties agree that the crossings will be manned by a policing force that will wear nonmilitary dress uniforms similar to those worn by the security inspectors at the Taba border crossing. -- Israel and the PLO -- each one individually -- want their own control at the border crossings and reject any attempt to entrust the crossings to a foreign element, such as the United Nations. This is where the agreements end and the disagreements begin: -- The PLO wishes to separate the crossings into the territories from the crossings into Israeli territory and to assume full control over the crossings into the territories. -- The PLO wishes to decide on its own and without Israeli dictates who will be allowed into the territories and how visitors passports will be stamped. -- Alternatively, if a joint border crossing is operated, the PLO wants its security inspector to be the first to receive each person reaching the crossing point and to determine whether that person may pass through. The PLO representative will have no authority over Israelis but will be the decisive authority in the case of foreign tourists. -- Flags: The PLO wants its flag to be flown at each border crossing. In the case of a joint border crossing, it will be flown next to the Israeli flag.
