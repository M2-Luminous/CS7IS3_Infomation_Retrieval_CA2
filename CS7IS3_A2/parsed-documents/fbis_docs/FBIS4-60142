The statement said: With the dawning of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and while the Muslims were celebrating the feast of sacrifice, official international and Zionist terrorism was chasing the Lebanese inside their villages and homes within the view and hearing of the world public and was committing against them acts of piracy and kidnapping. This proves the criminal nature of the Jews, who do not hesitate to commit the ugliest crimes, violate the most sacred values, kill women and children, and kidnap peaceful civilians. Today the Zionist entity committed a new crime added to its list of abominable crimes and aggressive acts, including the acts of kidnapping and piracy with which its history is replete. The statement added: This ugly crime is the clearest picture and the most eloquent expression of the official terrorism exercised by the Zionist entity backed by the global arrogant forces, above all the United States. The crime was committed after an official decision was issued by the enemy government, which pursues terrorism as a firm policy in dealing with the peoples of this region. This proves the criminal nature of the Zionist entity and the occupying Jews, who are supported by the global arrogant forces. The statement continued: This crime has proved that there is no place in Lebanon safe from the Zionist danger, which is threatening everyone. This means we must consider all of Lebanon as a confrontational area in which our people must maintain constant resistance against the Jewish threat.
