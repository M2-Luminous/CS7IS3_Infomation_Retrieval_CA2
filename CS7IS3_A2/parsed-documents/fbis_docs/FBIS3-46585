The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) urged financial institutions to quit their uniform management strategies and rather emphasize their differences. In the banking sector, follow-the-leader psychology has long been the norm. The Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said an income tax cut is necessary this year, while stabilizing the financial system en route to lifting Japan out of the slumbering economy. Analysts say such comments reflect concerns by the business community over Japan's financial system and may touch off debate about the possible injection of public funds to stabilize banking and securities systems. Keizai Doyukai called on business leaders to acknowledge the fact that Japan's economy has shifted to one that is led by domestic demand and from an export-led economy as seen in the era of high growth. The organization went on to say Japan will now have to face employment issues and the traditional lifelong employment system should be revised to improve labor efficiency.
