FBIS4-10580 "drlat072_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Peru Shining Path Campaigns To Visit Guzman Shining Path Campaigns To Visit Guzman PY1304223794 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 7 PY1304223794 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Text] Mexican attorney Jose Enrique Gonzalez Ruiz and U.S. attorneys Peter Erlinder and Leonard Weinglass have been hired by the Shining Path [SL] International Emergency Committee (CIE) for the Defense of Abimael Guzman's Life, which has appeared before the Inter-American Human Rights Committee (CIDH) to condemn the Peruvian Government for the way it is treating the Maoist leader. Colombian attorney Juan Jose Landinez, who travelled to Lima to support the SL efforts to get a group of legislators to visit Guzman Reinoso to check his health conditions, has joined the group of attorneys. A large group of SL members believes Guzman has either died or is in a regrettable psychological state because they do not believe he is the author of the letter addressed to President Alberto Fujimori, and less still the person who appears on the videos asking his supporters to uphold the peace accord. According to the latest "emergency bulletin" issued by the CIE, headquartered in London, so far five delegations of jurists and activists have arrived in Lima to ask the government and the Supreme Court of Military Justice to authorize a visit to Guzman. However, despite the government's opposition, the SL abroad continues its efforts: "Other attorneys are ready to travel to Lima to continue working until an authorization to visit Guzman is granted (and) donations specifically for this juridical project are welcome. The (Peruvian) Government will not be left in peace on the subject," according to CIE members headed by Abimael Guzman's in-laws. Moreover, a "Letter of Protest" that will be sent to President Fujimori has been circulated within U.S. intellectual and artistic circles. The letterhead reads: "I support the world demand that you end the abuse and isolation to which the president of the Peruvian Communist Party, Abimael Guzman, is subject." As if this were not enough, the CIE has sent a delegation to the Philippines and Japan headed by Yuri Kochiyama and Carolyn Hadfield. The SL is particularly interested in this visit to Japan because, in view of the fact that "Fujimori is of Japanese descent, the campaigns of slander and lies against Guzman and the peoples' war have been very spiteful in the Japanese media. Chauvinistically (sic), Fujimori has been adopted as a Japanese hero." But they also are concerned over the fact that "since Fujimori assumed the presidency, financial ties between Japan and Peru have increased. During their visit to Japan, the CIE representatives will disclose Japan's true role in Peru." The CIE, in its exhaustive effort, has got the Pakistani Human Rights Organization and the Kerala Communist Party of India [as published] to also start campaigns in Guzman's favor and to send letters of support to the CIDH. As part of the campaign, the SL international branch also is distributing a video in English entitled "You Must Tell the World," describing the war unleashed against Guzman and his supporters. The video includes clips of Guzman's address to the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate], actions perpetrated by terrorists who infiltrated the Raucana settlement, and interviews with attorneys Luis Arce Borja; Guzman's lawyer, Alfredo Crespo Baygrac; and the leader of the International Revolutionary Movement, MRI, Heriberto Ocasio, who was in Lima praising Guzman and his outrageous actions. The only obstacles the SL has found abroad was the Belgian Government's decision not to allow Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas to enter the country. Olaechea was supposed to attend an event on Peru in Brussels organized by the Belgian Anti-Imperialist League. Olaechea ended up sending a video recording of his address to the event in which, for a change, he asserts that the people's war will win despite everything. Is that all the Foreign Ministry was able to do? Is it aware of the Shining Path propaganda agents' presence in Japan?
