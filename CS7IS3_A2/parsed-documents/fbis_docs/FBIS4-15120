This was done because the Belarusian leadership believes that the commission has fulfilled its task. Speaking at a conference of law enforcement agency chiefs, Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, in particular, pointed out that the work of the commission had in fact been completed. However, Alyaksandr Lukashenka has a different opinion. Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Legislative Commission, voiced his concern in an interview with BELAPAN, saying that there can be attempts to stop financing the Anticorruption Commission, close its mouth, and hold activities. The only thing that the commission has so far managed to accomplish is Stanislaw Shushkevich's resignation from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman. The resignation was prompted by claims that Shushkevich had failed to pay several hundred rubles to the government's construction and repairs department.
