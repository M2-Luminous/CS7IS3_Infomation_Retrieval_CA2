Party and state leaders including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao attended today's meeting. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and state president delivered an important speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Premier Li Peng made a report on the situation in education. The current national conference is an important meeting being held by the CPC Central Committee and State Council under the new situation in which China is accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the modernization drive. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the main tasks of the conference are to implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further carry out the strategy of giving priority to the development of education; mobilize the whole party and entire society to seriously implement the "Outline of the Reform and Development of China's Education"; and struggle for realization of the goals of China's reform and the development of education in the 1990's. In his speech, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the leadership of party committees and governments at various levels and with the hard work of the broad masses of educational workers, China's education work has developed rapidly; educational reform has expanded gradually; and great achievements have been made in education. This has raised quality, cultivated a vast number of capable people, and made important contributions to national economic construction, scientific and technological progress, and social development. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Jiang expressed high respect for the broad masses of teachers and educational workers who have been working hard on the educational front, and to people of various circles in society who have shown concern for and supported education. Jiang Zemin said: The CPC Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have always attached importance to education, and have considered it a fundamental issue linked with the socialist modernization drive and the history and fate of socialism, when formulating an overall strategy for the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on education are the theoretical basis for our party in formulating principles and policies for education in the new period; and have provided us with a powerful ideological weapon and orientation for the reform and development of education. Comrades of the whole party, especially leading cadres at various levels, must conscientiously understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on education when they study his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Like Comrade Deng Xiaoping, they should attach importance to education from the high plane of strategy and promote the reform and development of education. Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In our country with a population of nearly 1.2 billion, and relatively inadequate resources and comparatively backward economic and cultural [wen hua 2429 0553] conditions, what must we rely on in realizing the grand goal of the socialist modernization drive? A decisive thing is to shift the focus of economic construction to the track of relying on scientific and technological progress, and of raising the quality of our laboring people. We must truly give priority to the development of education and place it in a strategic position; and strive to raise the level of ideology, ethics, science, and culture of the whole nation. This plan is of fundamental importance in achieving our country's modernization. Jiang Zemin asked leading cadres at various levels to fully understand the need to vigorously develop education, speed up the training of people for the socialist modernization drive, and raise the quality of ideology, ethics, science, and education. He said: This is a necessary requirement in implementing the party's basic line, and is also a necessary requirement for unswervingly adhering to the party's basic line for 100 years. Only when we promote education can we fundamentally strengthen our country's comprehensive strength, and win strategic initiative in the fierce world competition. Only when we raise one generation of successors after another with high ideals, moral integrity, a good general education, and a sense of discipline, who will dedicate themselves to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, can we guarantee a long period of stability. In the entire course of building socialist modernization, we must unswervingly and always adhere to the strategic policy of giving priority to the development of education. Jiang Zemin pointed out: In order to accelerate the reform and development of education, we must fully implement the "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education" formulated by the CPC Central Committee and State Council. This is not just important for various education departments but is also important for the whole party and entire society. Party committees and governments at various levels must effectively strengthen their leadership over education work, formulate specific measures for developing education in light of actual local conditions, be meticulous in making plans, and implement the measures and plans with unified arrangements. Touching on the issue of respecting teachers and attaching importance to education, Jiang Zemin said: The hope of revitalizing the nation lies in education and the hope of revitalizing education depends on teachers. Teachers are the engineers of the people's soul. A teachers' job is noble and hard, and they should be respected by the whole party and entire society. In showing respect for teachers and attaching importance to education, leading cadres at various levels must take the lead, especially senior leading cadres. We must seriously implement the "Teachers' Law," safeguard teachers' lawful rights and interests, raise their remuneration according to relations, and create necessary conditions for their working, studying, and living conditions. Jiang Zemin also pointed out that schools of different kinds at various levels should fully implement the party's policy on education, adhere to the socialist orientation in running schools, and strive to cultivate new people with "high ideas, moral integrity, a good general education and sense of discipline"; and enable them to develop morally, intellectually, and physically. In light of the new situation and problems emerging in the course of reform and construction, we should constantly strengthen and improve ideological and political work and ethical education in schools. Jiang said the whole society should show concern for and protect the healthy growth of students and join efforts to create a favorable environment for cultivating new people. Jiang Zemin especially mentioned the issue of integrating education with production and labor. He said: This issue has been clearly defined in the "Outline of Reform and Development of Education." It is an important component part of our education policy because the integration of education with production and labor is a basic measure in adhering to a socialist orientation in education. Jiang Zemin stressed: One of our basic national conditions is that we are developing education on a large scale under a situation in which the country is rather backward economically. Basing ourselves on this reality, we must deepen educational reform in order to make our educational structure and system conform to the needs of the development of a socialist market economy and all-around social progress. No matter what financial difficulties we face, we must be willing to invest in education in order to ensure success in the system of nine-year compulsory education, because this project will lay the foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation. The masses of educators in educational departments and schools should further emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, vigorously explore new ways to develop education and establish a new educational structure under socialist market economic conditions, and strive to build a socialist educational system with Chinese characteristics. In conclusion, Jiang Zemin stressed: It is a very glorious and arduous task to fulfill the grand objective of China's educational reform and development in the 1990's. Through our efforts over the past four decades, our educational undertaking has developed considerably, particularly in the past 15 years since the introduction of reform and opening up to the outside world. We have accumulated valuable experiences in educational reform, and a contingent of tens of millions of teachers has taken shape. All this has laid a sound foundation for educational reform and future development. The Central Committee believes that under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the Chinese nation's educational undertaking will surely continue to develop and prosper so long as we give strategic priority to developing education, seize opportunities, and thoroughly implement the "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education." In his report entitled: "Let Us Mobilize and Vigorously Implement the `Outline of the Reform and Development of Education,'" Li Peng affirmed China's educational achievements scored since the introduction of reform and opening up to the outside world. He said: At present, China's reform and opening up to the outside world and its socialist modernization drive have entered a new period of development. Fundamentally speaking, economic construction and social progress must rely on science, technology, and education. To meet the needs of establishing a socialist market economic structure and to take on the development opportunities and challenges in the 21st century, we must further deepen educational reform, accelerate educational development, raise the quality of the whole nation, and train cross-century personnel for realizing our strategic objective of economic and social development. This is an urgent task confronting us. Li Peng said: The "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education," promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and State Council, is a programmatic document for the development of education in China. To realize the development objectives set in the "Outline," we must concentrate on fulfilling the following tasks: First, efforts should be made to popularize nine-year compulsory education and to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. This forms the basic requirement for raising the quality of the whole nation and is also the most important measure for developing education in China in the days to come. This task is difficult to realize in the countryside, particularly in frontier areas, remote areas, and poor areas. Governments at all levels should help these areas enforce compulsory education. In the course of doing so, they should integrate agricultural science with education in light of local conditions and make this a fundamental measure for helping poor areas free themselves from poverty and become well-off. Second, vigorous efforts should be made to develop vocational and adult education. In accordance with the need for primary and intermediate specialized personnel and with the degree of popularization of basic education, efforts should be made to divert graduates of elementary and middle schools to vocational schools in a planned way. This is the sure way to accelerate the heightening of laborers' quality and to invigorate the economy. Third, efforts should be made to develop higher education by focusing on raising the quality of education and raising efficiency in running schools. Through reform, we should mainly rely on a new way of developing higher education to an appropriate scale with a reasonable structure and strive to achieve a marked improvement in quality and efficiency. Li Peng said: We must deepen educational reform in an all-around way to promote the development of education. The establishment of the socialist market economic structure has created an opportunity and motive force for educational reform and development, but at the same time it also calls for accelerating the pace of educational reform and the integration of education with economic development in order to gradually build a socialist educational system with Chinese characteristics. We should readjust the education structure by giving priority to raising the quality of laborers and to vigorously developing vocational education. It must be clearly understood that for a long period of time, an important and urgent task of education in China is to vigorously develop vocational education on the basis of popularizing nine-year compulsory education. This is a fundamental method of training a large number of applied personnel, a method which conforms to the national conditions in China. Li Peng said: It is necessary to reform the system of running schools by gradually establishing a system in which the government plays the central role in running them, and all walks of life pool their funds to expand education. Basic education, particularly compulsory education, should be run mainly by the government. At the same time, enterprises, institutions, and other social forces should be encouraged to run various types of schools. Vocational and adult education should be mainly undertaken by trades, enterprises, institutions, and social organizations under government management, or they may be undertaken jointly by social organizations and individual citizens with the government's support. In higher education, we will practice the system under which schools of higher learning will mainly be run by the government while all sectors of society will participate in joint efforts to expand such education. We should straighten out the relationship among the government, society, and schools in accordance with the characteristics of various levels and types of education, and establish a scientific management system. We should reform the enrollment system in schools of higher learning, senior secondary schools, secondary schools, as well as vocational schools above the secondary level; and also reform their tuition collection system and system of assigning jobs to graduates. We should carefully draw up a reform program, strengthen propaganda and ideological work, and properly handle the relationship between reform and stability. Li Peng pointed out: To develop education, we must expand the contingent of teachers, and increase teachers' pay and benefits. We should strive to run teachers' colleges well, encourage outstanding students to enroll in teachers' colleges, and also encourage graduates of such colleges to be happy in taking teaching as their profession. Efforts should be made to heighten teachers' ideological, professional, and teaching standards. In his report, Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to strengthen and improve moral education in schools and heighten their teaching quality. Faced with the new situation and new requirements, we must effectively improve party leadership, strengthen and improve moral education in schools, and strive to explore new ideas for improving moral education under the new situation so that the traditional virtues and glorious traditions of the Chinese nation will be carried forward by the younger generation in conjunction with the spirit of the times. Li Peng pointed out: Party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over educational work and strive to do solid work to expand education. He proposed specific measures and requirements on increasing investment in education, improving the system of raising educational funds through various channels, upgrading teachers' social status and wages, putting an end to the practice of not paying teachers on time, and strengthening education-related legislation. In conclusion, he called on party and government leaders at all levels to give strategic priority to developing education and to strive to fulfill the objectives and tasks set in the "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education."
