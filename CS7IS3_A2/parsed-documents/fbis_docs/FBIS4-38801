Counterintelligence To Busy Itself With Vetting Officials' Incomes"] [Text] The St. Petersburg directorate of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] held a press conference devoted to "National Security and Fighting Crime." In it, directorate chief Viktor Cherkasov revealed the contents of a closed discussion Boris Yeltsin had with FCS chiefs on 26 May. It was also intimated at the press conference that several draft laws have been prepared by the State Duma providing for a stronger control on officials' incomes, something that will be done by the FCS among other agencies. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, following an extensive report read out to the FCS staffers Boris Yeltsin held a discussion with chiefs of the service whose contents were not made public. Viktor Cherkasov briefly expounded its main points at yesterday's press conference. In his words, Boris Yeltsin assured the FCS chiefs that the large-scale reorganization of its subdivisions was basically over, while the investigation apparatus as well as special subdivisions to combat crime, which are not yet on its payroll, would revert to the FCS. All these things are envisioned in the draft of a new law "On The Organs of the Russian Federation Counterintelligence Service." According to Mr. Cherkasov, Boris Yeltsin explained to the counterintelligence service staff that from now on they will also have to work against the special services of the "near abroad" countries which have grown more active. The FCS is also supposed to supply the top organs of power of Russia with information on the current processes in the economy. On the basis of this information, the president promised "to take the most resolute actions in the sphere of governing the state." Aleksandr Aleksandrov, State Duma deputy elected in St. Petersburg and chairman of the Duma national security subcommittee, stated at the press conference that "interaction in matters of juridical policy" was finally achieved by the government and the president. Several draft laws developed by the subcommittee aim at improving the material status of officials while simultaneously at stepping up the fight against abuse of office and graft, for which purpose FCS officers may be pressed into service. The authors of the drafts think it necessary that all officials should be obliged to declare their incomes, while they should be from time to time "vetted as to being susceptible to taking bribes," something regarded as a provocation by opponents of these innovations. In connection with the president's proposals, some officers of the FCS directorate voiced to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent the fear that at this stage the objectives set cannot be reached effectively because the repeated reorganization of the service did not serve to retain its personnel. It is possible, for example, that not all former members of the FCS investigation apparatus would want to resume their former positions after receiving more attractive offers in other subdivisions of the counterintelligence service.
