FBIS4-60551 "drnes102_l_94015" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 ISRAEL Press Reaction to al-Dirani Kidnapping Press Reaction to al-Dirani Kidnapping TA2205120494 TA2205120494 BFN [Editorial report] All Israeli newspapers on 22 May carry commentaries on the 21 May IDF [Israel Defense Forces] operation in which Believers Resistance leader Mustafa al-Dirani was abducted. The commentaries applaud the army's operational capability and analyze the operation's goals, inherent message, expected upshot, and legitimacy. A commentary by Ze'ev Schiff on page A1 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew, entitled "Perfect Intelligence," says the action "should be evaluated by two criteria: operationally and with regard to the degree of risk and prospects of success. Operationally, this was undoubtedly an impressive and very 'clean' operation," "based on impeccable, commendable operational intelligence work." Comparing this operation to the abduction of Shaykh Karim 'Ubayd in 1989, Schiff concludes: "It now remains to be seen whether the premises that led to the operation will prove valid, and whether the abduction of al-Dirani will be more productive than that of 'Ubayd." A commentary in Daniyel Bloch's "Position" column on page 1 of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew, entitled "The IDF Reasserts Itself," says the operation's significance "goes beyond Ron Arad's fate. It transmits a clear message to Israel's immediate neighbors and to distant regions that the IDF has not lost its capability to initiate and carry out courageously and efficiently any unorthodox operations needed to safeguard the security of the state and of Israeli citizens, and to rescue Israeli soldiers and civilians wherever they are." Bloch notes that "the importance of this daring and sophisticated operation is even greater at this time," as it has proven that the harrowing tasks carried out by the army during the intifadah have not impaired its operational capability. Writing under the headline, "Kidnapping Will Undermine Hizballah Leaders' Sense of Security and Augment Syrian Involvement" on pages 1 and 4 of the same issue of DAVAR, Dan Avidan notes: "The significance of the al-Dirani kidnapping and transfer to Israel goes beyond the practical importance of his interrogation. This, because we can state even at this early stage that the kidnapping itself and its excellent execution have generated a sense of personal insecurity among Hizballah leaders at various levels." Avidan assumes that as a result, "Hizballah leaders may now change their stand" on the release of Ron Arad, although "no immediate positive results should be expected." In Avidan's opinion, "the Lebanese and Syrian Governments have also been affected by the commando operation. Lebanon has already loudly protested the Israeli assault on its sovereignty, but it will not do much beyond protesting vociferously. Syria, whose inability to foil the commando operation was a blow to its prestige," "will almost certainly encourage Hizballah to launch anti-IDF operations in the security zone and denounce the Israeli operation. "It can be safely assumed, however, that both the Syrians and the Lebanese will learn their lessons from the IDF commando operation; in addition, they too will prefer to end the Arad affair in order to avoid being humiliated in the future by this kind of IDF activity. Both countries -- particularly Syria -- will probably take behind- the-scenes action to convince the Iranians to release the navigator -- if the latter are indeed holding him." Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew carries three commentaries on the subject. A commentary by Aharon Klein on pages 1 and 2, entitled "Six Years Too Late," asserts that "the operation constitutes a certain contribution to Israel's deterrent power. It has refreshed the Hizballah leaders' memory about 'Israel's long arm' which can reach anywhere. The question is whether it was carried out in the right place. A second Lebanon operation of this kind, that can provide information about Ron Arad or bring him back home, is hardly likely in the coming year. Al-Dirani was kidnapped only six years too late. What is certain, however, is that national morale will soar for at least a few days." A commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari on page 3 of 'AL HAMISHMAR, entitled "Signal to Syria," links the operation to the peace process: "The kidnapping indicates a change in Israeli doctrine. Besides being an effort to obtain the release of Ron Arad and the MIA's, it was a signal to Syria." Since Syria failed to respond to diplomatic attempts to secure a "gesture toward Israel in a bid to improve the peace process atmosphere," "Syria will now have to make a different kind of gesture. "The political process with Syria is based on the Israeli willingness to acknowledge the Syrian role in Lebanon in return for Syrian endorsement of Jordan concluding its talks with Israel. Yet since Syria continues shackling Jordan, Israel is now signaling that it may revert to its original demand that Syrian troops pull out of Lebanon and that Syria resign its role there." The page-9 'AL HAMISHMAR editorial, entitled "Lesson for Terrorist Organizations," asserts: "The successful kidnapping of terrorist leader Mustafa al-Dirani should teach all the terror organizations that their hideaways are no guarantee of impunity." Noting that "the action was launched after all other options had been exhausted," the editorial says: "We must therefore congratulate the IDF for the successful operation, which was carried out without casualties or losses, and applaud the decisionmakers for taking the risks." The editorial adds that "unorthodox measures may and should be used against terror groups resorting to unorthodox methods, because there is no other way to deal with this kind of underground. "It is to be hoped that the international community will view this action not only with understanding, but also with empathy, because the object of this successful operation was to defend international law and to enforce it in these dark jungles, which are a stain on the face of the earth." Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay on page 7 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew, entitled "Why al-Dirani, Why Now," examines several aspects of the operation. Ben-Yishay argues that "al-Dirani is not an important Shiite leader," and "his value in the hostage bazaar may be even slighter than that of Shaykh 'Ubayd." He concludes, nevertheless, that "al-Dirani may be a valuable political and intelligence asset." Another question he poses: "Why did it take us so long to get to Mr. al-Dirani?" Ben-Yishay adds that the operation sought to achieve several goals, one of which was the need "to remind the dejected people of Zion of the IDF's prowess." Another "message was to the Palestinians: Beware! The IDF's arm reaches very far."
