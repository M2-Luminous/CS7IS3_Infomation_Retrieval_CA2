FR941025-0-00012 FR941025-0-00003 The OTS is adding a clarifying technical amendment restructuring section 545.81(d). This replacement language more clearly sets forth the requirements that apply when a federal savings association that owned a service corporation on November 30, 1992, wishes to have that service corporation deemed an operating subsidiary. Insider Transactions Pursuant to and in accordance with section 4(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act and section 106(b)(2)(H)(i) of the Bank Holding Company Amendments Act of 1970, 4 as revised by section 306(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), 5 the OTS is amending its regulation pertaining to insider transactions by incorporating by means of cross-reference subpart B of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O, 12 CFR Part 215, subpart B, as now or hereafter in effect. 4 12 U.S.C. 1972(2)(H)(i). 5 Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2359. Investments Section 563.96, which restricts the amount savings associations may invest in savings accounts and debt securities hedged with forward commitments according to a complex formula set forth in the rule, is being removed in light of the Federal Reserve Board's (FRB) final rule on interbank liabilities. 6 The FRB's final rule limits such investments to 25% of capital. Since the FRB rule applies to savings associations, section 563.96 is deleted as unnecessary. 6 57 FR 60086 (Dec. 18, 1992). Loan Documentation The OTS is amending its interim final loan documentation regulation to broaden eligibility to any institution that was assigned a CAMEL rating of 3 in its most recent report of examination and that has obtained written permission from its Regional Director to employ the exemption. Remote Service Units Section 545.141(d), which addresses privacy of account data concerning an RSU account, is deleted because the OTS believes that Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 CFR Part 205, which governs electronic funds transfers by all financial institutions, including savings associations, provides adequate protection for consumers' interests in this area. Second, the OTS is revising section 545.141(e) to reflect earlier revisions to 12 CFR Part 568, ``Minimum Security Devices.''
