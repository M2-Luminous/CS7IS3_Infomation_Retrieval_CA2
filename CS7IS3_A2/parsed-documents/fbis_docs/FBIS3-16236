The territorial administration head, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, said specialists of the neighbouring country will install two waste-processing facilities to treat water used in nuclear submarine reactor. Equipment of this kind has long been used in Japan and has proved a reliable tool in reducing radioactivity in waste to required level. The first technological line will be installed in the Zvezda factory which repairs nuclear submarines in the city Bolshoy Kamen. Another installation will be attached to the Pacific Fleet. Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who visited Vladivostok on Monday, promised assistance in handling the project.
