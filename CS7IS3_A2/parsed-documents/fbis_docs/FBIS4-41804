At a presidium meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council at 1130 GMT, presidium member Serhiy Nikulin demanded that Interior Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov be called out to establish order; however, Supreme Council Chairman Serhiy Tsekov went out himself to see those who had gathered near the entrance to the premises to assess the situation. At the same time Yuriy Meshkov made a speech to his supporters in which he noted: "Thanks to your support I was able to announce the possibility of reforms in Crimea. The richest people in the world have already promised to give material help in the near future in an amount that I am even afraid to say." Yuriy Meshkov also said that the results of his trip to Switzerland were very hopeful. Several European and Asian countries, in particular Hungary, Korea, and especially Iran have declared their intention to establish friendly relations with Crimea. After a stormy assessment of the situation, Serhiy Tsekov also left the rally which had decided that on 28 June the Supreme Council deputies would meet representatives of the community that support President Yuriy Meshkov of Crimea.
