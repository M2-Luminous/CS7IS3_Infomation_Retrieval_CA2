S. Zabalkanskiy, M. Ye. Levin; UDC 621.375] [Abstract] A method is proposed for studying nonlinear distortions in a circuit with complex nonlinearity. This method involves a transformation analysis of the spectrum of complex envelope of analytical signals on the complex equivalent characteristic of instantaneous values representing the nonlinearity. An algorithm for the spectrum transformation on a nonlinear element with specified amplitude and phase-amplitude characteristics and a program for its execution was developed.The algorithm includes the following operations: computation of the amplitude characteristics of the ``real'' A[.sup]c[/] and``imaginary'' A[.sub]s[/] signal transmission channels from specified amplitude and phase-amplitude characteristic; approximation of the A[.sup]c[/] and A[.sub]s[/]characteristic by odd exponential polynomials, etc. References: 9 Russian
