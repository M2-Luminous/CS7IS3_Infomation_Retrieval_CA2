He also said he will support a candidate who does not belong to his party, but who supports the Sandinist program. In his statements to La Primerisima radio station, Ortega hinted that he will not accept Sergio Ramirez as the FSLN's official candidate and confirmed he will support a candidate with no FSLN ties. Ortega and Ramirez are the leaders of two divergent currents that are vying for the leadership of the FSLN. The statements by the current FSLN secretary general tacitly rule out possible support for Ramirez if he decides to become his party's presidential candidate as he has publicly said. In his visit to the radio station, which shares his political views, Ortega pointed out he would like to be reelected secretary general, adding that it is unhealthy to have several candidates vying for this post. The FSLN leader said: "Several candidacies are unhealthy for a revolutionary party; it would be as though discord were being sown." Such a comment differs from the results of a poll of Sandinist followers conducted by the Nicaraguan Study Institute (IEN), which shows that a large number of FSLN members believes there should be two or more candidates for the post of secretary general. Henry Ruiz, who has more votes than Ortega to occupy this high leadership post, on 2 May agreed to vie for leadership of the FSLN, which is experiencing one of its worst crises just before its 20 May Special Congress. The IEN poll also reveals that the FSLN electorate represents only 23 percent of the population: 12 percent in the rural area and 8 percent from those who never attended school. [figures as published] In addition, the poll shows that a large number of Sandinists believes a dictatorship exists within the party.
