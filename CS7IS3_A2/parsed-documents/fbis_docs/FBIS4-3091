The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, will not give the green light for new funds at least in the first half of this year, said an official with the bank. He said the bank would probably approve one or two funds after July if financial conditions improve. But it is impossible to see a lot of new funds emerging this year," he said. The central bank has informed all provinces that no fund can be issued or listed without approval from the bank's head office. At present, about 200 funds involving 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) are applying for final approval from the central bank, which supervises and regulates the country's investment funds. The official said the funds were suspended to prevent too much capital being drained away from treasury bonds and savings deposits. China plans to issue 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) worth of bonds this year. Starting this year, bonds will be the government's sole method for paying off the national budget deficit--estimated at 60 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year. The country last year had planned to allot 3 billion yuan ($345 million) to investment funds. However, the shortage of capital forced authorities to postpone the quota plan to ensure enough financing for the country's key construction projects. But the suspension this year will not include foreign-related funds since they don't attract domestic capital, the official said. Many domestic institutions have co-operated with partners abroad to set up overseas-based funds to invest in energy, power and high-tech industries. The official said China this year will concentrate on standardizing existing investment funds to lay a firm foundation for future development. China's first investment fund was born in 1991. The country now has 50 funds involving 4.5 billion yuan ($517 million), but only four have been approved by the People's Bank of China. Many of the funds have violated the State's policy of strictly controlling investment in fixed assets, he said. In addition, some capital raised by the funds are used in filter-bank lending and speculation in real estate. The official said the central bank will try to steer these funds toward investing in treasury bonds. The official said the central bank is drafting regulations on the management of funds and expects to issue them in the first half of this year. Chinese scholars have been urging the State to develop investment funds as an important tool in stabilizing the stock market, since most engage in long-term investment instead of short-term speculation. The funds also offer punters a new form of investment and allow them to play the stock market more safely.
