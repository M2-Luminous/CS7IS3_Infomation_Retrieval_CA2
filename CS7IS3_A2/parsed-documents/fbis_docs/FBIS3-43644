"What he is saying is a serious threat to peace. The reason people are calling for the SAP in our areas is to try to bring peace and stability there," said northern Natal ANC Secretary Senzo Mchunu. The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] decided last month to request the SAP to immediately provide security to residents in four northern Natal areas where KwaZulu Police [KZP] had apparently been unable to quell violance. But Mr Buthelezi said in a statement on Tuesday that such a move, taken without the formal cooperation of, and in consultation with the KZP, would be regarded as an invasion. "The KwaZulu government will therefore not hold itself responsible for the consequences which may ensue should such an invasion take place in areas under the jurisdiction of the KZP. "And nor will the KwaZulu government be held accountable for anything that takes place outside formal arrangements and co-operation with the KwaZulu government," said Mr Buthelezi in a statement. In reaction, ANC southern Natal chairman Jeff Radebe said: "It is a declaration of war. He (Mr Buthelezi) knows that, even legally speaking, he is standing on shaky ground. "By law, the SAP is entitled to police anywhere in South Africa, including in self- governing territories." Mr Radebe's response followed a report submitted to the TEC by the SAP in Natal which stated that in terms of the Self-Governing Territories Constitution Act (No 21 of 1971) a legislative assembly had no power to make laws concerning SAP presence in KwaZulu. The SAP report provided clarity on its right to police KwaZulu where there have been constant claims of KZP bias and hit squads. Commenting on Mr Buthelezi's statement, Midlands ANC chairman Harry Gwala said no one, particularly the Zulu people, wanted confrontation. The KZP had no hope of succeeding in resisting SAP policing in KwaZulu, he said. Mr Buthelezi's statements came as the Transitional Executive Council was scheduled to discuss SAP deployment in KwaZulu. Mr Radebe and Mr Mchunu claimed the IFP president's statements "prove beyond doubt he is against stability and peace. We call on the TEC to ignore his statements".
