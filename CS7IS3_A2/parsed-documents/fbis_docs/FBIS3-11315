According to the Cesar police, Edilberto Duran Osorio, Edna Barbosa, Sandra Quintero, Hernando Rueda, Teresa Caselles Casadiego, Nancy del Rosario Herrera, Ramon Elias Chichilla, Yesid Augusto Rincon, Maria Carrascal, Jose del Carmen Porras, Obdulio Herrera, Freddy Antonio Leon, and Nixa Salome Sanchez were released yesterday morning. The officials had gone to coordinate the district elections in La Palestina, Puerto Nuevo, and El Hobo, Rio de Oro Municipality. In addition, reports by the police and the Departmental Office indicated that close to 3,400 citizens who had registered to vote in the rural areas of Rio de Oro, Aguachica, and San Diego were unable to due to pressure from the guerrillas. The Bolivar police stated yesterday morning that the ELN burned the tally sheets (approximately 1,000 ballots) in the Tache, San Jacinto de Achi, Bermudas, and Mejico District, Achi Municipality. The attack came when the voting officers of four villages were traveling on the Magdalena River to bring the ballot boxes to the municipality's capital city. The delinquents intercepted them and destroyed the ballot boxes, voting lists, and other documents. Colonel Hector Castro Cabrera, Bolivar police commander, said nobody voted in Pinones District (with a potential of 160 voters), Mompox Jurisdiction, and denied reports that San Pablo Mayor Manuel Rudas Ruedas had been kidnapped. The murder of voting officer Luis Arnulfo Campana Lloreda and the theft of two ballot boxes in Agua Sal District, Bagado Jurisdiction, shattered the calm surrounding the vote-counting process taking place in El Choco Department. The incidents occurred at about 1000 in the morning when the four members of a commission were walking toward Bagado carrying the ballot boxes containing 373 votes. According to an official report by the Choco police, an ELN group took the commission members by surprise and later killed Campana.
