It has therefore become necessary for certain measures to be taken including the beefing up of security along the border to stop any further incursions. Foreign Minister Ibrahima Sylla confirmed this to Mamadou Ba Diabate. [Begin Sylla recording] Guinea has taken very strong measures. Security at our borders has been greatly beefed up -- much more than before -- since the last incidents. Obviously, the National Defense Council has adopted other confidential defense measures that will be implemented if necessary. Of course, the humanitarian aspect must still be considered since we owe a humanitarian duty to the refugees there who are only asking for peace. However, it is necessary for all of us -- governors, refugees, and local authorities -- to work towards the same objective: that of calming the situation since the actual process of restoring peace in Liberia has started.
