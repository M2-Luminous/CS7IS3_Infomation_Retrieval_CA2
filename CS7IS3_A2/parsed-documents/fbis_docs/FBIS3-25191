South Africa's minerals belonged to the State and mining companies should lease the right to exploit these and pay consideration to the State, he told mineworkers on the last day of the National Union of Mineworkers' national congress in Pretoria. The people would own the mineral rights, with the State acting as a custodian, he said. This idea was first mooted by the ANC in its Reconstruction and Development Programme recently, and was met with widespread concern. The gold index plunged 98 points, to 2060, in one trading session, but recovered following Mandela's statement that the initial announcement was "unfortunate." He seems to have come full circle in response to changes in legislation which became effective this year. Mandela accused the Government of transferring ownership of mineral rights to mining houses once aware that a new order would replace them. "This was a conspiracy between mining houses and the NP [National Party]. But we will not allow that to happen. A democratic government will change every agreement between the NP and the mining houses." And the right to mine should not be exclusive to mining houses but should be extended to individuals, he added. In a wide-ranging speech, Mandela said an ANC government would honour the right of workers to unionise and strike. "It will be the first duty of an ANC government. The right to strike is a democratic right of workers through the country," he said. In a stinging attack on the NP, Mandela said the party did not have a conception of how to serve all South Africans. "They don't know what it is to serve everyone." Mandela paid tribute to the police, from the upper echelons to the Internal Stability Unit, especially in Natal. "We have men and women who are committed to the building of a new South Africa. Their problem is politicians who do dishonourable things."
