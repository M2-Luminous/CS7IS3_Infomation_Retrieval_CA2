But the "Greek compromise" on voting procedures which unblocked the process of enlargement, formally agreed by the 12 current and four new members on Wednesday, was not legally binding as Britain has claimed, Greek ambassador to Brussels Yannis Kranioditis said. The compromise formula, an annex to the main membership treaties, was only a political declaration, he said. [passage omitted] A date for signing the treaties, which should take place before the EU summit on June 24 and 25, will be set at the next meeting of foreign ministers, Kranioditis said. Wednesday's session also agreed on the number of deputies each new member would have in the European Parliament. Sweden is to have 22, Austria 21, Finland 16 and Norway 15 out of a total 639 deputies. In the expanded new Council of Ministers, Austria and Sweden will each have four votes and Norway and Finland three each, under rules which allocate seats according to population size. Hungary and Poland will officially present their applications for EU membership in Athens on April 1 and April 8 respectively, Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos added on Wednesday. Kranioditis said that after the EU expanded northwards and eastwards, Greece would like it to open the door to new members in the south, and the candidature of Cyprus and Malta was to be considered at the start of 1995.
