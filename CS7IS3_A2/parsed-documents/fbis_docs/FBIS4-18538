With their signatures, the representatives of 117 states will not only eliminate the danger of a new form of protectionism and of a trade war in the event of negotiations collapsing, but they will set in motion a new process at the end of which -- in so far as such a process can have an end -- an extensive, fair and balanced world trade system, one integrating north, south, east, west, will be possible, a system, which in addition to bringing benefits for the individuals, also takes into account global aspects. At the beginning of an economic upturn, this positive conclusion of negotiations will bolster the confidence of business and all those involved in the economy -- entrepreneurs and consumers, investors and manufacturers. On the one hand, the conclusion of the negotiations creates conditions for our companies to have worldwide improved access to existing and expanding new markets. On the other hand, what it provides for consumers is a larger, price-orientated supply of goods and services. Even if it is difficult to give a precise figure for the "the economic gains" that will emerge in the long and short term, directly and indirectly, for the parties concerned, it can nevertheless be stated that the gains and advantages will amount to several hundred billion. The Difficulties in Implementing the Results of the Negotiations However, what seems much more important to me is the higher degree of awareness with regard to cooperation in world trade, the extensive transfer of technology and know-how, the greater integration of developing countries and the countries of central, southeastern, and eastern Europe as well the former states of the Soviet Union into world trade and the international division of labor. The end of the Uruguay Round is only the goal of a certain stage. In the ongoing process of liberalizing trade, we are only at the beginning of a more difficult phase, the implementation of results, creating the structures of new world trade organization, and especially the treatment of subjects the importance of which has been recognized, but in view of their complexity, could not be settled in these past negotiations. These subjects include issues relating to trade and competition, especially -- and I am personally concerned about this -- the field of trade and the environment, which contains many problems. Those points of overlap between foreign trade and environmental protection are being discussed more extensively thanks to public opinion, which set the process in motion and induced governments to take action. There are two contrasting patterns of thinking: Some believe that international trade, as the engine of the world economy, definitely affects the environment -- possibly in a negative way -- but that liberalization may be of benefit to the environment if, on the one hand, the more effective and more economic use of resources is maintained and, on the other hand, more prosperity is created. That is why, especially in countries that are dependent on the export of raw materials, there would also be more money for environmental protection, investment in the environment, the purchase of appropriate technology, but also training, including further training, and the combating of poverty. The opposing party is no less strong and is definitely also armed with good, weighty arguments, and it places environmental protection above all else. It indulges in wishful thinking about a zero burden on the environment combined with zero growth, without revealing what possibilities there are particularly for leading developing countries out of their difficult situation, the hopelessness of overpopulation, poverty, environmental damage, and technological and economic backwardness. This area of overlap is a key area for action and a main concern in the future work of the world trade organization. The parties to GATT have decided that the UN Conference on Economic Development process should be taken up by GATT, and that particularly entails promoting lasting development through the liberalization of trade as well as mutual support on the part of trade and environment politicians. The particular importance of the principles contained in Chapter 2.22 of Charter 21, namely, the necessity of international cooperation and the condemnation of unilateral measures, has been stressed. The elements of the work program have already been discussed and fixed within the framework of the Trade Negotiating Committee. Decisions about it should also be made in Marrakesh. However, to my mind, the start that has been made is insufficient. There are significant aspects and partial problems that have not been addressed. We must approach these general problems in a more comprehensive manner. In my opinion, there are two viewpoints that should be the basis of further action: The intensification of the international division of labor combined with a marked increase in the volume of trade -- also as a result of the liberalizing effects of the Uruguay Round -- are to be welcomed in view of their positive effects on economic growth and development and should be promoted. However, a healthy and intact environment -- it is the basis for life, and without it, no trade would be possible -- is an increasingly scarce commodity and one whose status is becoming increasingly important in all countries. If a contradiction is perceived in that, then it is only apparently so. It is entirely possible for environmental protection and liberal international trade to be made compatible, assuming that rules are comprehensible, clearly defined, consider both areas, and clearly established. Long before the conclusion of the GATT round, the representatives of diverse institutions called for a "green round" or talked of the necessity of "greening the GATT." However, the question one must really ask oneself is if the current GATT rules -- applied correctly and in accordance with the principles -- which have created a worldwide legal framework for international trade, also provide such a framework for environmental protection measures? Do present GATT regulations really fail to provide a balance between the right people that have to determine paths and goals, to protect their health and the environment and the right to profit from trade that is as liberal as possible? Abuses Can Be Prevented Now Is there really a need for "greening the GATT" or to create special GATT exceptions that justify the introduction of restrictions on trade or compensatory tariffs for environmental protection reasons, such as the protection of tropical rainforests or reduce carbon dioxide emission levels? Or is it the case that regulations about nondiscrimination provide much better protection against measures that harm the international trading system, being resorted to under the pretext of environmental protection? A comparison of the economic, political, and legal status of various environmental protection instruments shows GATT regulations already contain possibilities for using environmental protection instruments efficiently and preventing their abuse by using environmental grounds as an excuse. State Independence GATT goals, namely "the full use of world resources for development" (GATT preamble), by way of banning obscure, discriminatory or unreasonable trading restrictions and distortions also apply to our environmental resources. The consistent application of GATT environmental policy measures will make it much more likely that the goals of the policy will be achieved and, at the same time, will represent a model for the production, use, consumption and reprocessing of goods. Thus, the authors of GATT have taken a much broader view than one suspects and -- perhaps this is not perceptible and apparent to everyone -- established a basis for environmental protection in the regulations on trade. GATT proceeds from the principle of state independence. Every member state has the freedom to introduce internal taxes and regulations and is at liberty to employ other protection measures for reasons of environmental protection. The current settlement contained in Article 22 in conjunction with GATT makes that perfectly clear! The use of measures to protect the goods listed there is permitted, but, as always within the framework of GATT, not in a groundless and unlimited way. These measures come under GATT basic principles and are conditioned to that extent. Thus, the GATT regulations not only empower the parties to resort to measures and employ instruments that are necessary from the viewpoint of economists. They have also always provided a basis for measures called for by ecologists to the extent that they deal with trade issues. The question is not "whether," but "whether it is enough?" In this area too, something decisive has happened. Thus, the current GATT regulations have to a large extent provided the possibility of taking into account environmental protection aspects within the framework of GATT basic principles. A Whole Series of Open Questions Existing possibilities for using GATT for environmental protections have been further enhanced, extended, and bolstered through a whole series of additional measures and legal settlements contained in the various agreements that were concluded within the framework of the Uruguay Round, for example: -- The codex subsidies do not exclude support and assistance for the promotion of environmental protection. If they satisfy certain conditions, they cannot be attacked. -- The treaty on technical trade restrictions sets out a procedure for determining whether a product or production process "restricts trade more than is absolutely necessary to pursue justified interests such as the protection of health, plant or animal life, or the environment quite simply." -- Like Article 22 of GATT, the treaty on services also does not rule out general exceptions such as the protection of the life and health of people, animals, and plants. The existing rules, measures, and procedures that are to be implemented with the Marrakesh signing indicate that there is growing concern on the part of GATT partners to bring the rules of international trade and the necessity of preserving the environment into harmony with each other. To orient trade and the environment to achieving the GATT preamble principle of the efficient use of world resources, trade and environmental regulations should be mutually supportive. This requires that the prices of the products and services that are traded should reflect internal and external cost factors. Trade restrictions tend to distort prices and should not therefore be a substitute for more efficient direct environmental measures such as production, product, or consumption taxes and controls. Liberal trade regulations will also contribute to improving trade and environmental techniques and technologies. However, despite what has been achieved, there are still things that have to be done in order to achieve the goal of sustained development in the field of "trade and the environment" too. Even if the existing GATT agreement and the additional procedures, measures, and settlements already take into account environmental considerate in numerous ways or at least try to, a whole series of questions and aspects still remains open and has to be dealt with. The first condition for this is to be created in Marrakesh. Within the framework of the future world trade organization -- and on an interim basis until it is created -- structural conditions should be created for dealing with theses issues. A special agency -- irrespective of how it should be called or will be called -- staffed by trade and environment experts will deal with the basic issues. The following subject areas -- for which basic preparations have been made in other international organizations such as the OECD, the UN Environment Program, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development -- should be addressed by this agency thoroughly and as quickly as possible: -- An extensive investigation of those points in trade that would be affected by the application of environmental measures with the goal of making the GATT regulations, including Article 22, concrete. This entails that measures stemming from national environment policies and international environmental treaties, which intervene in international trade to varying degrees (for example, voluntary product identification, economic instruments, and import bans) and vary in their geographical scope (which means investigating causes and consequences) must be viewed in a differentiated manner when checked on the basis of the principles that are to be applied under GATT; Extensive Development -- Specific rules and procedures for dealing with so-called environmental dumping and environmental subsidies; -- Additional requirements for the notification of trade measures based on environmental grounds with a view to greater clarity and to facilitating consultations; -- The investigation and assessment of environmental treaties or other international treaties from the viewpoint of their relevance for trade, and conversely of trade measures from the viewpoint of their environmental relevance. Marrakesh cannot represent an end or even a transitional stage, but must solely represent a new beginning. It must represent a new beginning for an intensive dialogue between trade and environment policies and politicians on national and international levels with the goal of mutual support for trade and environment policies and the constant assessment and checking of such policies on the basis of criteria established jointly, and this could make a contribution to bringing about the desired partnership between trade and environment policies and thus to partnership between international trade and the environment. A dialogue that is established in this way is a contribution to extensive, sustained growth.
