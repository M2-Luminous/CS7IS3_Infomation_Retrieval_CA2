Following preparations for over one year, the committee is about to be formally established in Haikou on June 5. Being neighbours of China, some countries like Singapore and Thailand in Southeast Asia have set up commercial groups to specialize in economic cooperation and trade with China which, however, has no corresponding non-government bodies to deal with commercial relations with these countries. Adverse impacts on economic cooperation and trade between China and the Southeast Asian countries have been seen to a certain extent. The Executive Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Pacific Economic Cooperation, Mr. Chen Luzhi, will be the director of the new group while the Chairman of Board of Directors of the China Import and Export Bank, Mr. Tong Zhiquang, and the Vice Governor of Hainan Province, Mr. Mao Zhijun, will be honorary directors. As Hainan is the province in China to see the shortest distance from the country to the Southeast Asia region and is the largest special economic zone, it can act as a bridge between China and Southeast Asian countries in order to promote economic cooperation and trade between them. A seminar on re-export trade with Southeast Asia and on border trade will be held following an inaugural meeting of the commercial body.
