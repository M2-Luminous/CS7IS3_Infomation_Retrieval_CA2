FR940927-0-00033 FR940927-0-00004 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 13 CFR Part 121 Small Business Size Standards; Waiver of Nonmanufacturer Rule AGENCY: Small Business Administration. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) amends its regulations governing waivers to its nonmanufacturer rule. In essence, this rule reflects more accurately the statutory language set forth in section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the Small Business Act to ensure that SBA's size regulations are consistent with the statute. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective September 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to David R. Kohler, Associate General Counsel for General Law, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20416. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John W. Klein, Chief Counsel for Special Programs, (202) 205&hyph;6645. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 210 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2821, revised section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the Small Business Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv), by providing for the possibility of a contract-specific waiver to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule (the requirement that, for a supply contract, a small business concern that is not itself the manufacturer must provide the product of a domestic small business manufacturer in order to be considered a small business). An earlier statute, the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;656, 102 Stat. 3853) provided for the possibility of waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule for classes of products for which there were no small business manufacturers in the federal market. In a final rule (the ``Rule'') published in the Federal Register on September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48956, SBA defined the nonmanufacturer rule as `` the requirement set forth in 13 CFR 121.906 and 121.1106 that a contractor *␣*␣* provide its own product or that of another domestic small business *␣*␣*'' (Emphasis added). 13 CFR 121.2102(e). The final rule defined the term ``Federal market'' as acquisitions by the Federal government from ``offerors located in the entire geographic United States'' or a more restricted market area. 13 CFR 121.2102(d). The final rule also set forth procedures for waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule as to classes of products. On March 18, 1994, SBA published a final rule amending 13 CFR 121.906 and 121.1106 to provide for a contract-specific waiver. 59 FR 12811. These regulations permit waivers of the nonmanufacturer rule for either classes of products or specific procurements after a determination ``that no small business manufacturer or processor is available to participate in the Federal procurement market.'' 13 CFR 121.906(b)(3) and 121.1106(b)(3). As further background, the prior wording of 13 CFR 121.906(b)(3) and 121.1106(b)(3) also referred to waivers for classes of products for which there were no small business manufacturers or processors ``in the Federal market''. Thus, SBA has consistently regarded the nonmanufacturer rule and its waivers of that rule as involving a single, non-severable requirement for domestic small business suppliers. On August 30, 1994, the SBA published a proposed rule that would make various revisions to its section 8(a) program. 59 FR 44652. Included within this rule was a proposal to clarify the nonmanufacturer rule by specifically authorizing a small business nonmanufacturer to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set aside or section 8(a) contract where the procuring agency makes a non-availability determination under the Buy American Act and section 25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Id. at 44653&hyph;54, 44659&hyph;60. This reference was designed to take note expressly of the separate domestic business requirement imposed by the Buy American Act. The proposed rule allowed a thirty-day comment period, or until September 29, 1994.
