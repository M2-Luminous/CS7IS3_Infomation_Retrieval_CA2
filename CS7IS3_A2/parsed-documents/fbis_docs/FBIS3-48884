FBIS3-48884 "dreas020__a94027" FBIS-EAS-94-020-A Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Regrouping of Political Parties Anticipated OW3001223694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3001223694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] With the support of the coalition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and other parties, the political reform bills, which have as their pillar the introduction of an electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, have been enacted. Following this development, moves toward further regrouping of political parties are now expected to take a complicated course. LDP President Yohei Kono has suddenly moved closer to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, as the former has started to clarify that he intends to cooperate with the Hosokawa administration regarding economic and diplomatic issues. Since Hosokawa plans to respond positively to Kono's advances, it is expected that the framework of the coalition government would be drastically altered should the LDP in fact provide the administration "support from outside the cabinet." The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is split over the issue of electoral reform, is facing a serious crisis. It is expected that drastic political changes, such as a restructuring of the coalition alliance due to a possible falling apart of the SDPJ, may inevitably occur in time. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has strengthened the solidarity of his administration, plans to entrust the steering of the Diet to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. At the same time, he plans to give due consideration to the LDP. Thus, he will apparently take a "tandem" approach toward running the government. At a 29 January joint press conference with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Kono said: "From the standpoint of protecting the livelihood of the people, I think we can make suggestions to the prime minister in terms of our knowledge, experience, and personnel." This was an outstanding stage performance by Kono that impressed the people with the "intimacy" of the two leaders since Hosokawa had already revealed that he plans to hold meetings with Kono again to exchange views on the Japan-U.S. summit meeting and on economic issues. Asked for advice by the Prime Minister's Office on the issue of revising the political reform bills prior to the top-level meeting between Hosokawa and Kono, a senior LDP official belonging to the Miyazawa faction said: "Regarding political reform, all you have to do is throw a strike. What is important instead is to build a relationship of trust under which the leaders can mutually open up their hearts and hold discussions." This signaled that "Kono's LDP" is prepared to support the prime minister in view of the possibility that in the future, the SDPJ may break away from the coalition government over the issue of a consumption tax hike and other disputes. Internal strife within the SDPJ over the political reform bills has shown further signs that the party may split. Party members who insist on preserving the party's independence may break away from the coalition, possibly turning the Hosokawa administration into a ruling minority. Hosokawa reportedly acknowledges that, sooner or later, the coalition must inevitably be reshuffled. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura hopes the LDP will split again so he can challenge Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. He hopes to secure his influence in the administration by joining hands with LDP members who support electoral reform. Various speculative views intertwine around the issue of "regrouping" as a result of the splitting of the SDPJ as well as further splitting of the LDP. Shinseito has aligned its sights on the next general election. It plans to gain political leadership straight out by forming a new party through such means as recruiting members from Komeito, the Japan New Party, and the SDPJ who support maintaining the coalition government. On 29 January, Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, held a press conference at the Diet building. Regarding the "Hosokawa-Kono partnership," Hata praised it, saying: "It means they plan to straightforwardly discuss the domestic and foreign issues that have accumulated." But, regarding its effect on the regrouping of political parties, Hata said: "It (regrouping of political parties) will happen through elections." However, the fact that the political reform bills were rejected in the upper house plenary session due to a considerable number of SDPJ dissidents voting against the bills clearly indicates it will not be easy for both the ruling coalition parties and the LDP to gain a majority in the upper house. To promote regrouping of the political parties, it will become necessary to work out a framework which takes this situation in the upper house into consideration. Parties will have to reconstruct their original strategies which have been based on a "LDP versus non-LDP" concept.
