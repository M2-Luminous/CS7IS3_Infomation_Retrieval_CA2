John Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, on Tuesday [11 January] urged Japan to take concrete steps to ensure that Japan's chronic trade surpus with the United States is whittled down in coming years. Foreign Ministry officials said Rockefeller, a veteran member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, made the request in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Rockefeller pointed to the importance of the upcoming summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa slated for February 11 for alleviating any irritants between the two countries, they said. In reply, Hata said Japan recognized the "need to bolster the transparency" of bidding procedures for the construction market, to which the Clinton administration has been demanding greater access for American contractors, they said. The minister also pointed out that Japan's plan to proceed with deregulation, loosening various curbs binding the hands of Japanese businesses and society will help improve the relations with the United States. Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who studied at International Christian University in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960, is noted for his familiarity with Japanese political affairs.
