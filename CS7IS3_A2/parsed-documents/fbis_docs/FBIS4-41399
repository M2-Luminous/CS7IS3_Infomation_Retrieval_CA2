The center's public council includes Ye. Bonner, B. Zolotukhin, S. Kovalev, and A. Pristavkin. The problems which exist today in the field of the protection of human rights are described by Aleksey Smirnov, the center's director, in a talk with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Dmitriy Orlov. [Orlov] Aleksey Olegovich, what in your view is above all preventing the assertion in Russia of international norms for the protection of human rights? [Smirnov] Primarily the fact that in the law enforcement organs and structures of power there are still people working who have not borne any responsibility for law violations and crimes committed in the past. "That is what it was like then" is a typical empty refrain of the workers of the former KGB. A mass of evidence of crimes by the authorities has been accumulated. I believe that a decision should be made to repeal the statute of limitations with regard to the communist regime's crimes against the individual. Can we speak of law today if past crimes are unpunished? [Orlov] Does that mean you are in favor of opening and inspecting correspondence? [Smirnov] Yes, if this is understood not as sweeping dismissals of state employees but as a careful study of each specific case, exclusively, of course, within the framework of existing legal procedure. Proving crimes committed in the past and even initiating criminal proceedings is hard work. Today there is not a single precedent for punishing KGB staffers. Yet the KGB tortured Sakharov before my very eyes! Many people died in the camps. Where are the culprits? Still in power? Still deciding our lives? I shall cite a personal example. The investigator who was in charge of my case during the years of stagnation has falsified the interrogation records. I can prove this because I kept parallel records and recorded violations of the law. What were violated were not the USSR's international commitments but the criminal procedure norms in operation at the time -- at the time! How did the Moscow prosecutor's office reply to me? There are few investigators and many difficulties and the worker in charge of your case resigned, and it was a long time ago.... [Orlov] Can you note instances of the most flagrant violations of human rights in Russia relatively recently? [Smirnov] Of course. The most graphic of them is the regime introduced by the Moscow City Hall for registering incomers. I like Mayor Luzhkov as a person: He is a practical person who does not stop to think and makes decisions swiftly. But the decision on administrative banishment.... It is clear how it could be carried out (and is now being carried out): According to the principle that you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. In my view when applying preventive measures of this kind in the struggle against crime, powerful mechanisms must be created for monitoring the militia's actions. And unless the Moscow City Hall does this, our center will receive complaints of violations of human rights in this field and render legal aid to victims, including by dispatching materials to the prosecutor's office and court. I nonetheless hope that in the very near future Mayor Luzhkov will create organs for monitoring the actions of the Moscow law enforcement organs within the framework of the registration regime. [Orlov] How effective is your center's activity? Can you help many people? [Smirnov] In one day the organizations belonging to the center receive up to 100 people. In simplified terms 50 of them are simply people who do not properly understand what is happening, 25 percent are not in the right place (as a rule they are interested in socioeconomic problems), and only with regard to the remaining quarter do we take any actions. We manage to help nearly half of these. In general we are obliged to work constantly in practical human rights activity. There is virtually no time left for lobbying in the organs of executive power, educational projects, or legislative initiatives on human rights issues. Yet essentially the system of "giving charity to every poor person" is not effective -- we must create conditions such that he does not have to ask for it. [Orlov] A specific question. Recently the organs of state power and the mass media and in particular our publication have been receiving requests to expand the system of benefits for those repressed under the bolshevik regime. What is your attitude toward such appeals? [Smirnov] We often get them too. It seems to me that increasing monetary grants and giving food and so forth on the basis of lists is not very fair to other citizens of the country, to taxpayers! No monetary compensations! We must not "give" or "take." For former political prisoners it would be far more useful to be relieved of taxes and municipal charges. [Orlov] What general recommendations could you give to those citizens who do not want to become victims of the violation of their rights? [Smirnov] The main thing is to know the law and the procedures for protecting your own rights. You must appeal to legal advice bureaus. You must learn to work with the authorities, not to set yourself against a particular zealous official but to demand toughly that he "play by the rules." Systematic violations of human rights today come not "from above," as in 1970-1980, but "from below," from the local authorities. We can and must fight that.
