FR941227-2-00059 FR941227-2-00045 Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the extension, with revisions, of the following reports: 1. Report title: Report of Foreign (Non-U.S.) Currency Deposits Agency form number: FR 2915. OMB Docket number: 7100&hyph;0237. Frequency: Quarterly. Reporters: Depository institutions. Annual reporting hours: 418. Estimated average hours per response: 0.50. Number of respondents: 209. Small businesses are affected. General description of report: This information collection is required [12 U.S.C. ยง248(a)] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. ยง552(b)(4)]. Abstract: The FR 2915 reporting form collects weekly averages of the amounts outstanding for foreign (non-U.S.) currency deposits held at U.S. offices of depository institutions, converted to U.S. dollars and included in the FR 2900 (OMB No. 7100&hyph;0087), the principal deposits report that is used for the calculation of required reserves and for construction of the monetary and reserves aggregates. Foreign currency deposits are subject to reserve requirements and, therefore, are included in the FR 2900. However, foreign currency deposits are not included in the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915 data are used to back foreign currency deposits out of the FR 2900 data for construction of the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915 data also are used to monitor the volume of foreign-currency deposits. The Federal Reserve proposes to reduce the reporting frequency for current monthly reporters to quarterly. The proposed revision would reduce the annual reporting burden for this report by 66 percent. 2. Report title: Financial Statements for a Bank Holding Company Subsidiary Engaged in Bank-Ineligible Securities Underwriting and Dealing Agency form number: FR Y&hyph;20. OMB Docket number: 7100&hyph;0248. Frequency: Quarterly. Reporters: Bank Holding Companies. Annual reporting hours: 1,519. Estimated average hours per response: 12.25. Number of respondents: 31. Small businesses are not affected. General description of report: This information collection is mandatory to obtain or retain a benefit [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. Abstract: This report is filed by bank holding companies that have received the Board's approval by Order to engage in limited underwriting and dealing in securities of a type which a bank may not underwrite or deal in directly.

In addition, there are several memoranda items which collect information on intercompany liabilities and off-balance sheet items, and information that is needed for an alternative measure of indexed-revenue. The proposed minor change, to become effective as of December 31, 1994, involves the addition of memoranda items on the income statement to collect year-to-date gross income, total expenses, and net income. By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 20, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board.
