When promulgating the law, President Sanchez de Lozada said: With the promulgation of the Capitalization [as heard] Law we are closing a chapter in the government reorganization process. The Chamber of Deputies approved the law on 20 April, including the amendments introduced by the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies also is planning to discuss the national budget during the congressional term that is about to expire. [end relay] [passage omitted] As we reported a few minutes ago, labor unions are indignant over the approval and promulgation of the Popular Participation Law. [Begin relay] [Cathia Rodriguez, identified by screen caption] Union leaders allege that the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] cannot be happy with a Popular Participation Law that was drafted and approved without popular participation. According to union leaders, the law's main objective is to abolish traditional union organizations. [First unidentified union leader] Until today, COB, labor unions, federations, and confederations of different sectors have been the mediators between civilian society and the government. Today, the government wants to take this role away from the COB. This is why the Popular Participation Law does not discuss the concept (?of grass-roots) organizations [words indistinct]. They are being virtually disavowed. [Second unidentified union leader] Although laws are being approved, we have to see whether they will be enforced in Bolivia. [Rodriguez] Does COB believe it can prevent their enforcement? [Union leader] We believe we represent those who have been marginalized from the drafting of these laws. Therefore, those who have been marginalized will be following this issue very closely. [Rodriguez] The Popular Participation Law was approved on 20 April and the national budget will be approved soon. The union leaders are aware that once the budget is approved, salary negotiations will end then and there with the imposition of an 8 percent salary increase offered by the government. However, they assert they will continue fasting until the government's will is broken. Nationwide, there are already 90 union groups that are fasting and 738 people on strike. The group that has been fasting the longest is in La Paz. The group has been fasting for 18 days. At the national level, 40 people on a fast are in serious health. Meanwhile, the demonstrations continue. This week retail shop workers staged two protest demonstrations. COB has announced that tomorrow there will be a demonstration staged by all labor unions. In La Paz, the demonstration is scheduled for 1500 in San Francisco Plaza. [end relay]
