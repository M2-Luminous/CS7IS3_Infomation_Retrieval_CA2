The Supreme Procuratorate has set up a "Corruption Elimination Supervisory Team;" procuratorate offices in every jurisdiction have set up "corruption elimination enforcement teams;" and "clean government offices" are being studied. Does the advent of these new "teams" and "cases," and even "offices," in the "corruption elimination system" truly help eliminate corruption? Just what problems have arisen in this system? Institutionally speaking, the main reason for no effective action in the elimination of corruption is that in the overall corruption case adjudication process, the investigation and judicial organs receive too much "political" interference." This makes it very difficult for them to handle matters independently according to law. [passage omitted] Thus, even though investigative organs make a great effort to gather evidence, they lack the authority to decide whether a case is forwarded to the local procuratorial office. Although the Investigation Bureau is under the Ministry of Justice, "daddy is the Ministry of Justice and mommy is the National Security Bureau," a senior investigator said. "Big cases," in particular, must be presented to an "advisory unit"--the National Security Bureau -- which considers "what effect the handling of a big case will have on social stability" before deciding whether or not to forward it to a procuratorial office. The National Security Bureau is, in turn, subject to the president's direction. Some "big cases" about which there has been speculation in the media, such as the "Eighteen Bids," are seemingly quiescent now. Should these "big cases" be tried? "Whether they are tried depends on the decision of higher authority. They are not forwarded for prosecution on the basis of evidence obtained," said an investigator. "Whether a big case is tried depends on the "determination of higher ups." After cases are "filtered" by the Investigation Bureau, they are forwarded to the local procuratorate where they face another "filtering." This is because, even if the procuratorial officer in charge feels evidence is sufficient to prosecute, in practice, the principal procuratorial officer and the procurator "jointly consider" the case, and it is "considered level by level" before a final decision is made. Some years ago when Kao Hsin-wu was a low level procuratorial officer, once he determined that the evidence was sufficient, Wu T'ien-hui, who was director of the Judicial Conduct and Discipline Department, was immediately detained and prosecuted in a bribery case without notification to higher authority. For this Kao incurred criticism for not respecting judicial ethics, aruption" as a result of the opposition party's clamor to get something done.

For this Kao incurred criticism for not respecting judicial ethics, and for failure to observe procedures for handling cases. Had Kao Hsin-wu abided by normal procedures for presenting the case, Wu T'ien-hui might not have been prosecuted for bribery. Taiwan's procuratorial institutions are not a part of the courts, but are subordinate to the Ministry of Justice in the administrative system. Procurators are judicial administrative officers who must consider policies. The declared policy of the government is to punish corruption severely. It was on the basis of the "corruption elimination program" that the Supreme Procuratorate set up the "Corruption Elimination Supervisory Team," the public procurator-general convening these teams, which are made up of the head of the Investigation Bureau, the head of the procurator's office, and the administrative discipline office director. All local procuratorial offices set up "corruption elimination execution teams" for which the procurator is the convener and the members include the procuratorial officer in charge, the Investigation Department (Station) chief, and the administrative discipline office director in the procuratorial organ. The execution teams hold a meeting once each month. At the end of each month, they must tabulate cases and report their adjudication to the "supervisory team." In reality, the holding of such team meetings only provides the procuratorial organs a chance to exchange views. They do not discuss individual cases. "Today it is still a matter of general discussion about how to proceed. It is idle theorizing, not using the time to deal with cases," a procuratorial officer in charge said indifferently. Since these "teams" function in such a limited way, what would happen were a "Clean Government Office" set up to deal with corruption? "To have a system like the one in Singapore or Hong Kong, the first problem is to amend the law. Only if it is geared to the law can a clean government office play a role. Given the Legislative Yuan's present efficiency and attitude about handling its agenda, with too many laws awaiting formulation and amendment, I think this is a very difficult problem," said a deputy magistrate pessimistically. " What units to set up is a secondary consideration. The most important issue is the determination and coordination of law enforcement personnel," said a procuratorate officer in charge who has handled cases for more than a decade, thereby expressing the same view. Even if the determination exists, there are two few judicial personnel. When it comes to the elimination of cooperation, it is a case of the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak for judicial personnel. Today, every procuratorial office and court has a "designated" procurator and justice in charge of corruption cases. In the view of the procurator general and the Chief Justice, a trait they hold in common is unquestionable personal integrity. They have enthusiasm for their work and ample experience in handling cases. They can serve only after being selected. Nevertheless, despite use of the term "designated", they must handle other cases as well. Take the greater Taipei area, for example. Each month, the local procurator must handle between 140 and 160 cases. On average, he must handle six cases every work day. At the end of each month, he is under pressure to conclude cases, in addition to which corruption case investigations take time. The designated procurators who are able to "take the initiative, and actively" investigate evidence are few and far between. The difficulty is that the job "is impossible to do, but has to be done." One procurator said with some agitation, "the number of judicial officials on record is extremely limited, so procurators want the Investigation Department to help out. The number of Procuratorate personnel is decreasing rather than increasing. There are just too few hands..." Every month and every year the number of criminal cases mounts, but the number of procurators and justices on record do not rise in proportion to the number of cases. In addition, the manpower that the Investigation Department and transferred lawyers can devote to is consequently insufficient. All the courts and procuratorate offices agree. People have known this for a long time. This problem has lingered without solution for many years. It is a perpetual thorn in the side of the judicial system. In addition to an insufficient number of judicial personnel, the system for selecting justices is also currently unable to ensure the quality of legal personnel. Law officers are generated by an examination system. If they are not versed in the law, even the law cannot pass them, much less can it produce officers having moral character. Examination Yuan member Ti Tsung-ch'uan believes that testing of justices should emulate the United States system, increasing moral character checks, and that a system for eliminating justices should also be instituted. Second, the provisions of the law are not clear and punishments are not uniform. This also permits grafters to suppose they can get away with violations. They are willing to test the law. Current provisions for the punishment of corruption include the criminal law's dereliction of duty articles and a special law's "corruption punishment regulations." If other laws contained heavier penalty provisions, in view of the principle that "severe laws are superior to light laws," sentences would be heavier. However, in actual enforcement, a sentence may be light at one time and heavy at another. The explanation that the courts give is that sentencing depends on the strength of the evidence. Some evidence only supports a sentence for an attempt to make money for oneself or for others; others support a sentence for offering bribes, and still other support a sentence for accepting bribes. Thus, sentences vary in severity or lightness. However, in the corruption realm, when distinctions are made as to whether corruption consists of payment for administrative action, the conveyance of benefits, profit for oneself, offering bribes, or accepting bribes, even justices must consider carefully so how much more so ordinary folk. Thus, everyone begins to calculate his own risk. Some who are risk takers by nature take a gamble. If they fail and receive a heavy sentence, they chalk it off to bad luck. Only when the provisions of the law are crystal clear will the people be able to understand how to act. "When Japan ruled Taiwan, major matters of justice such as participation in government and political affairs were clearly not accorded the people, but small matters of justice involving the courts, taxation, and the police, the Japanese did not withhold. Moreover, government adherence to these small matters of justice, which affected the people most, built the people's confidence about civil rights. No wonder that many people have fond memories of the past," said Huang Yueh-ch'in.
