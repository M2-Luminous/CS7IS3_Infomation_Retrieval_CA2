RIA's correspondent met and had a talk with Anatoliy Lopata, chief of the Ukraine Armed Forces General Staff. [Katin] Mr. General, as far as I know, this is the third time that you have participated in such sessions. Ukraine is not an outside observer in this military organization; it already has one foot in NATO: I mean the joining of the Partnership for Peace program. As a result, Russia has found itself in a situation in which, via Ukraine, NATO directly pushes against its lengthy Western ground and also sea borders. Presumably Kiev's policy is more oriented toward the West than toward its traditional ally? The impression is that Russia's interests are being ignored. [Lopata] I do not like the statement that Ukraine has one foot in NATO. Ukraine simply supports the Partnership for Peace program. Actually this means support of peace and stability in Europe. Tell me, is this bad? I consider this a universal task. Now you say that through Ukraine's participation in the Partnership program, NATO is approaching Russia's borders. I personally have no doubt that Russia will also join the Partnership. Yet, this does not at all mean that NATO has opened all the doors for us. The meaning of the Partnership is, by joint, coalition-based actions, to facilitate the preservation of peace in Europe, prevent an outbreak of war, put an end to internecine fighting, and stop bloodshed wherever it occurs. Russia cannot exclude itself from participation in addressing these tasks and therefore it cannot but accept the Partnership program. I have no doubts on this count. After all, Russia is already doing very much to stabilize the situation in various regions of the world. [Katin] At what stage of cooperation with NATO is Ukraine at present and what is being done in practical terms? [Lopata] We have signed what is basically a framework agreement with NATO. Now the possibility is being considered of allocating forces and funds as our contribution toward implementing some joint tasks with NATO. I do not think that at the moment these will be large or complex tasks. After all, such participation also has an economic aspect -- expenses. But even now we can prepare and send our military units for participation in joint actions with NATO. This, however, cannot be more than one battalion with reinforcements. [Katin] If I understand you correctly, this year Ukraine is ready to enter the phase, as you say, of implementing practical tasks in interaction with NATO units; is that right? [Lopata] Absolutely. This can begin in the current year. You know that two of our battalions are now operating in former Yugoslavia. We put them at the UN Security Council's disposal. To be sure, Partnership is quite another program, but so far we have the right to send a mere 1,220 military personnel: soldiers, officers, and observers. Such is the will of our parliament. This is the size of the contingent allowed to be kept outside the country. It seems that a new parliament, which will start working in the very near future, will adopt more definitive legislation on this score. [Katin] Let us return to the "Partnership for Peace" program. You think that Russia will finally accept this program, join it. But you must be aware that in Russia this approach has been formulated as follows: We may join it, but not on the terms on which, say, Albania or Estonia did it. What is your view on such an approach? [Lopata] This is a very wrong approach. If we are to be partners -- I underline in boldface -- partners, then relations within the program should also be partner-like, that is, honest and equal with regard to rights and obligations. We have not yet talked about how many troops or how much money one member or another should provide. What we are talking about is that everyone may participate with as many resources as he has at his disposal in fulfilling joint missions to keep peace and stability in one region or another... But to demand that a special status be given means to place oneself above your partners. In this case there will be no partnership. I repeat: partnership is equality of all members. [Katin] How do your assess the current state of Russian-Ukrainian military relations? [Lopata] Our relations with Russia are currently undergoing a difficult period. The reason for this instability is uncertainty regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem. The Black Sea Fleet is a stumbling block that precludes us from reaching understanding. What is the reason here? The problem is not how to split the fleet. Precisely this problem can be resolved fairly easily. Everyone understands that -- both the Russian side and the Ukrainian side. The main problem is the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, its basing on Ukrainian territory. It is here that we encounter many complex nuances that should be resolved both at the political level and at the level of defense ministers. We should make it clear where Ukraine's fleet will be based and where Russia's will be. If a corresponding political decision is made, we should determine what, how, and on what terms should be given to Russia from this infrastructure, say, with regard to bases... By raising the question like this we, in turn, create the need to resolve the problem of mutual payments. I hope you understand me. This is why these should be very well balanced, respectful relations. One should not forget that relations between Ukraine and Russia, relations between our two peoples, largely shape the overall situation in Europe. This is why I would like our problem to be resolved in the worthiest and gentlest manner possible. I am completely certain that we will be able to untangle these knots. Without fail! This is just a matter of time and... personalities who are dealing directly with the entire range of matters. The role of personalities has its own significance. I would like experienced specialists to deal with that, so that people will look somewhat farther than the present day, so that they will see the prospects for the evolution of our peoples. We should be attuned only to benevolent prospects, for they are for the whole life. The way current problems are being settled will determine our future, the future of our children and grandchildren, their relations. This is why we should act competently and respectfully with regard to each other.
