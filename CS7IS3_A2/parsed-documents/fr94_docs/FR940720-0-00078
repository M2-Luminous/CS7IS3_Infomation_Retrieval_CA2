FR940720-0-00078 FR940720-0-00006 c. Sampling and Testing. Section 80.101(i)(1), which concerns requirements for sampling and testing of conventional gasoline and other products to which the compliance standards apply, is being revised to delete the requirement that such sampling and testing be conducted prior to the gasoline or product leaving the refinery. This change is necessary because this requirement interferes with the ability of refiners and importers to do composite sampling and in-line blending. 2. Controls Applicable to Blendstocks (§80.102) Since gasoline produced for and marketed in California is subject to that State's stringent reformulated gasoline standards, it is not necessary to include such gasoline, or applicable blendstocks used in the production of such gasoline, in EPA's blendstock tracking requirements beginning in 1995. Thus, the definitions of the volume of gasoline, ``V g '' and ``V g,i ,'' in the averaging period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio in §80.102(d)(1)(i) and the running cumulative compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio in §80.102(d)(2)(i), respectively, are amended by adding an explicit exclusion for California gasoline. Similarly, an additional subparagraph (v) has been added under §80.102(d)(3) to exclude applicable blendstocks used to produce California gasoline in the blendstock ratio calculations. These corrections are necessary to make clear that the volumes of California gasoline, and applicable blendstocks used to produce California gasoline are not part of the ratio calculations. 6 6 The baseline blendstock-to-gasoline ratio does include both gasoline and blendstock produced for the California market. This baseline ratio nevertheless is a valid basis for comparison with the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratios (that exclude California gasoline and blendstock) because the baseline ratio represents a refiner's or importer's actual 1990 gasoline and blendstock volumes. 3. Record Keeping Requirements (§80.104) Under §80.104(a)(2)(ix), refiners and importers are required to retain documents to demonstrate that blendstocks were transferred for other than gasoline blending purposes as a basis for excluding such blendstocks from tracking. There are various other bases specified in §80.102(d)(3) for excluding blendstocks from tracking (e.g., exported, transferred as a feedstock) for which document support is not required in the final rule. EPA believes that the document support requirement should apply to all excluded blendstocks. Therefore, §80.104(a)(2)(ix) is expanded to require the retention of documents which demonstrate any of the specified bases for the exclusion of blendstocks from blendstock tracking. 4. Reporting Requirements (§80.105) Section 80.105(a)(2) in the final rule requires refiners and importers to report the overall volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and transferred to others. This provision is being clarified to require separate reporting for those applicable blendstocks that are, and those that are not, excluded under §80.102(d)(3). C. Preamble The preamble of the February 16, 1994, notice of final rulemaking contains two errors in the sections discussing reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping enforcement provisions. The following corrections should be noted for these sections of the preamble: •On page 7759, in the second column, in the 12th and 13th lines of the second full paragraph, ``(March 1, 1996, through February 29, 1996)'' should read ``(March 1, 1996, through February 28, 1998).'' •On page 7800, in the second column, in the 4th and 5th lines of the carryover paragraph, ``section 211(k)(c) of the Act'' should read ``section 211(k) and (c) of the Act.'' V. Summer/Winter Season Section 80.91 of the Reformulated Gasoline Final Rule (59 FR 7716) defines summer and winter data and sampling requirements as follows: paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) states that ``Data shall have been obtained for at least three months of the refiner's or importer's production of summer gasoline and at least three months of its production of winter gasoline.'' The regulation goes on to define a summer month as ``any month during which the refiner produced any gasoline which met the federal summer gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month which could not be considered a summer month.'' Several comments received by EPA since the rule was published indicate that this present definition severely restricts or eliminates the winter period in some cases, and inappropriately allocates winter data to the summer calculation. Further, the current rule inadvertently precludes the use of actual data in some calculations, even when such per batch actual data is available.
