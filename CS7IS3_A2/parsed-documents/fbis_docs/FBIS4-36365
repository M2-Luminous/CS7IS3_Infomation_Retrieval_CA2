Recently the new UN assistant secretary general, Norway's Terje Rod Larsen, called for international help to finance the police force. Without a functioning police force in Gaza there will be chaos, Terje Rod Larsen warned. The PLO's coffers are more or less empty. The situation is so precarious that the Palestinian policemen in Gaza are not even having their wages paid to them. The Foreign Ministry's message is the same which PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat heard from Prime Minister Carl Bildt during his visit to Stockholm in November last year. However, Sweden is prepared to help with the training of the Palestinian police. The Police High School in Solna has drafted a training program, said Alf Samulelson, Aid Minister Alf Svensson's under secretary of state. The Swedish proposal, which has been passed on to the PLO, is about teaching forensic procedures and traffic surveillance. [passage omitted]
