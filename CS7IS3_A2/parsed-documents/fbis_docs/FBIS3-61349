Does this indicate a change in the attitude toward our state on the part of the world's "mighty"? [Horyn] It must be admitted that quite a number of Ukrainian politicians have been counting upon comprehensive support for Ukraine on the part of Western democratic states that will be happy to help us. We needed time for our society to become convinced that a Ukrainian state, about which dozens of generations dreamed and for which millions of patriots died, can only be built by our own efforts. It is only possible to create a favorable political climate in Ukraine when it stands on its own two feet concerning the economy and defense, and when it manages to convince its neighbors and the entire democratic world that it will ensure stability inside the state and will thereby promote stability in the region and in the world. In that case, it would be political short-sighted to ignore us and not to establish mutually advantageous relations with us. As regards the policy of the United States and some European states, it has undergone a certain evolution in a direction favorable for us. Earlier, there were calls for us to return to the "bosom" of the empire, and the new leader Bill Clinton tried to talk to us through ultimata. Their policy with regard to the states of the former USSR, with the exception of the Baltic countries, was pro-Russian. This, in turn, stimulated leading Russian state figures to pursue a tough policy with regard to Ukraine. There even were territorial claims. It must be pointed out that this was always encouraged by the unprincipled policy pursued by our government and president. [Pasichnyy] After all, we remember quite well George Bush's visit and his speech at the Ukrainian Parliament in which he openly called upon us to return to the empire. Or the present position of President Clinton, a position that is openly coercive.... [Horyn] They expected that the young state would yield to such powerful pressure.... However, our parliament had enough common sense to state: We will not fully disarm ourselves, because we do not possess guarantees for Ukraine's security as an independent state in what concerns its borders and territorial integrity. The refusal immediately to give up nuclear weapons was an extremely clever step on the part of the Ukrainian external policy, as it drew the attention of the entire civilized world to Ukraine. The world started thinking: What sort of state is Ukraine, why does it refuse to give up its nuclear weapons, how does it motivate its position, and to what logic do its politicians adhere. There arose a problem of imperial threat on the part of Russia, and our northeastern neighbor acquired the image of an aggressor. The Western mass media steadily spread this idea and, as a result, in recent months, there appeared a change for the better in the attitude toward Ukraine. We became an object of a thoughtful U.S. policy, and, finally, Washington realized that the giant state in the center of Europe required a proper attitude toward itself. This does not mean that today's U.S. policy has become pro-Ukrainian. However, we have not freed ourselves from pressure on the part of the United States. Clinton's planned trip to Moscow is quite telling. However, now Clinton demands that we dismantle our nuclear weapons in exchange for compensation. It will depend upon our president whether he will manage to convince Clinton that the best security guarantee for Ukraine would be to retain those 46 strategic missiles until all nuclear states disarm. However, it must be admitted that we are no longer being totally ignored. [Pasichnyy] I agree with you, but I want to remark that Clinton arrived in Kiev in order to offer us assistance in dollars. However, he does not want to guarantee our security. We cannot count upon assistance from the United States or NATO in the case of Russian encroachments.... [Horyn] Recently, I had a conversation with a German deputy defense minister, who stated that they are not interested in the existence of a strong Ukraine. Such frankness was nothing new for me. Back in Soviet [prison] camps, Levko Lukyanenko [Ukraine's Republican Party leader] and I foresaw such a turn of events. Well, this high-ranking German official explained his idea in approximately this way. Ukraine is presently in a state of crisis. We do not have enough food. However, some 10 years will pass, and our state will finally be standing on its own two feet. It will be a competitor on European agricultural markets. At the same time, traditional exporters, such as Germany and France, will find themselves in a difficult situation.... I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War II. Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people. The recent elections in Russia are disturbing. [Pasichnyy] After all, the consequences of the recent elections in Russia have again placed before the world a threat of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still alive, and it has now acquired features of communo-fascism.... [Horyn] Yes, they showed that it is not only the ruling circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus of imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their own eyes. The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue. [Pasichnyy] Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of Ukraine's Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude of the Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status? [Horyn] We believe that the very fact of nuclear missiles in Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all of our neighbors that they should refrain from playing with fire. We are not opponents of disarmament and we are not against dismantling those missiles whose service life has expired. However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps. One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of U.S. dollars. I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors. I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would be an irreparable blunder.
