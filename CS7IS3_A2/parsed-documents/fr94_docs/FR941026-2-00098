ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On September 12, 1994, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a notice soliciting project proposals and information from transit authorities, planning officials, States, the private sector, and the public on its Innovative Financing Initiative. The FTA seeks to identify issues and obstacles to innovative financing of transit capital or operating needs, as well as project proposals that demonstrate or test an innovative financing mechanism. FTA is extending the comment period to allow interested parties additional time to review the Notice and to formulate proposals on this initiative. DATES: Proposals must be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Proposals should be sent in triplicate to Janette Sadik-Khan, Associate Administrator, Office of Budget and Policy, Federal Transit Administration, Room 9310, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Marx (202) 366&hyph;1675 or Janette Sadik-Khan (202) 366&hyph;4050. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Transit Administration issued a notice on September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46878) seeking proposals and information from transit authorities, planning officials, States, the private sector, and the public on the FTA's Innovative Financing Initiative. This initiative is based on Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments,'' signed by President Clinton on January 26, 1994, which directs each executive department ``to ensure efficient management of infrastructure * * * and to ``encourage private sector investment which is a key objective of our efforts to promote innovative financing.'' Accordingly, Department of Transportation Secretary Federico Pe√±a directed FTA to explore innovative ways to finance the transportation needs of our nation, taking into account a continuing Federal commitment to transit, as well as a growing private sector interest in transportation investment. Hence, the FTA is interested in identifying ways for States and localities to plan and execute integrated public transit investment programs. The original comment period would end on October 30, 1994. FTA is extending the comment period for an additional 60 days, in order to allow interested parties adequate time to formulate their comments and/or proposals. The comment period will now close on December 30, 1994. Late-filed proposals will be considered to the extent practicable. Date Issued: October 20, 1994. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.
