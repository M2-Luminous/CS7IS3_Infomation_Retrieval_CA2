When expounding yesterday on some decisions by the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office regarding the finding of arms at the Maribor airport, Dusan Pozar, senior prosecutor in the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office, pointed out that the basic prosecutor's office worked according to law. Proof was insufficient to prove unauthorized dealing in arms, or to prove smuggling. According to the prosecutor, there is still the suspicion that the Defense Ministry has recognized Hasan Cengic as the authorized envoy of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and traded in arms with him. This happened in spring 1992 when it sold him 5,560 automatic rifles in violation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the embargo on arms sale to the territory of the former Yugoslavia. According to the prosecutor, Janez Jansa, as the only competent person, has violated the Security Council Resolution several times. Therefore, the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office has presented the matter to the Ljubljana Public Prosecutor's Office.
