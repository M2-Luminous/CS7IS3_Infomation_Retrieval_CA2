David Morales, our correspondent in Paris, has the latest: [Morales] The latest information on the police swoop in the French Basque country and Brittany reveals that among the 20 or so arrested for their alleged links with ETA -- the majority of them French citizens -- there are at least five Spaniards. Police sources contacted by RNE say that the operation is still going on but they have refused to reveal the identities of those arrested. They could be connected with the terrorist organization's support infrastructure in France. The arrests seem to be a result of investigations carried out by the Paris investigating magistrate, Laurence Levert, on ETA but other sources also believe that there is a link between the extradition to Spain on 2 June under the emergency procedure, that is without the customary hearing, of ETA member Jose Domingo Aizpurua Aizpuru, alias Pitxas, just as he was leaving Fleury prison on the outskirts of Paris where he had just served a sentence for criminal association.
