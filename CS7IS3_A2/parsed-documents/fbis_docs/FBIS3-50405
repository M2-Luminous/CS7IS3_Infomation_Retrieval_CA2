This was stated by Zoran Djindjic, who replaced Dragoljub Micunovic as president of the Democratic Party last night, at his first news conference in this capacity. Srdjan Savic reports: [Savic] Yesterday's discussion on various policy concepts was not a discussion on the party's program orientations, which means that the Democratic Party will continue the policy that existed before the election. This was stated by the new leader of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic. He stressed that the former party president Dragoljub Micunovic would remain the head of the deputies' caucus in the federal parliament and that his full participation in the work of the party would be appreciated. Speaking about the continuation of the talks on the inauguration of the republican assembly scheduled for tomorrow [31 January], Djindjic stressed that the opposition expects a gesture of goodwill from the ruling party. This means that the opposition expects the ruling party to allow Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] to appoint the chairman of the assembly. However, the Democratic Party will try its utmost to unblock the work of the Serbian Assembly even at the price of a non-opposition assembly chairman, because it wants to enable the parliament to perform its main, legislative function, Zoran Djindjic said.
