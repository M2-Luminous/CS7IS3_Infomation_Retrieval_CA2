CNW has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) the line is not used for movement of overhead traffic; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) have been met. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on March 25, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 3 must be filed by March 7, 1994.

See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment _ Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Thomas F. Flanagan, 165 North Canal Street, Chicago, IL 60606-1551. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . CNW has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by February 28, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248.
