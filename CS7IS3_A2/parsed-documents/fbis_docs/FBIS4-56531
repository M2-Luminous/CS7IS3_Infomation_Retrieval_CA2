The CID/Gallup poll indicates that Blades would win the presidency in the event of a last-minute coalition between Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Vallarino, Democratic Alliance candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and Change '94 candidate Ruben Carles. If Carles were presented as the candidate of such a coalition, he would gain 22 percent of the votes, Blades 33 percent, and United People alliance candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares 30 percent. If Moscoso de Gruber were the candidate of such a coalition, she would obtain 23 percent of the votes, Perez Balladares 30 percent, and Blades 32 percent. If Vallarino were the presidential candidate, he would obtain 9 percent of the votes, the PRD's Perez Balladares would maintain his 30 percent, and Blades would get 38 percent. This poll, prepared exclusively for EL PANAMA AMERICA by CID/Gallup, was taken between 24 and 29 April to determine the Panamanian people's political preferences in the upcoming 8 May elections. For this poll, 1,200 citizens were interviewed in 60 different parts of the Panama City metropolitan area, Aguadulce, El Roble, Anton, El Valle, Portobelo, Baru, Dolega, San Lorenzo, Los Santos, Guarare, Atalaya, and other districts. The poll reveals that most of people prefer Ernesto Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades; they obtained a 30 percent and 26 percent support rating, respectively. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber obtained 17 percent, Ruben Carles 14 percent, Eduardo Vallarino 2 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo 1 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz 1 percent. The poll highlights the fact that Ruben Blades' rating increased 14 points, but the Papa Egoro Movement candidate has relatively little support in the interior of the country. CID/Gallup found that while Blades and Papa Egoro have improved their positions in the past 60 days, Perez Balladares is suffering a decline. Nevertheless, the latter continues to have the majority of support among Panamanians. Of the people polled, the PRD registered a 26 percent support rating, Papa Egoro 21 percent, Arnulfist Party 14 percent, Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 9 percent, Christian Democratic Party 3 percent, and Morena [National Renewal Movement] 3 percent, while 20 percent of those polled did not express a preference. Other relevant findings in the poll show that nine out of every 10 Panamanians will vote and that a similar proportion are against a return of military personnel to power. Some 87 percent of Panamanians "do not want any kind of alliance with military personnel to govern Panama in the future." Ernesto Perez Balladares, according to the CID/Gallup poll, is the candidate who would favor a new military force. If one of the presidential candidates withdrew from the race, CID/Gallup determined that Blades would attract 50 percent of Perez Balladares' followers, 30 percent of those backing Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 44 percent of the ones endorsing Eduardo Vallarino, and 31 percent of those who support Carles. Carles would receive support of 34 percent of those who back Mireya Moscoso, 25 percent of Blades' followers, and 17 percent of Vallarino's backers. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber would receive the support of 35 percent of Carles' supporters, 24 percent of those backing Samuel Lewis Galindo, 20 percent of the voters who support Vallarino, and 17 percent of the Papa Egoro supporters. The poll revealed that 41 percent of the Panamanians polled believe unemployment is the main problem facing the nation. The issue is followed by corruption with 20 percent, and drug trafficking with 11 percent. Guillermo Endara was viewed favorably in the CID/Gallup poll. Endara "is improving in the eyes of his people, and he has not been evaluated this favorably since March 1991," the polling firm observed. The president improved 28 points in one month, and, according to CID/Gallup, the broadcast of the documentary on the civilist struggle "has a lot to do with the positive change in his favor."
