A lawmaker of the Foreign Affairs and Reunification Committee of the National Assembly said: "While the president said that the people do not have to worry, the prime minister asked the people to strengthen their alert posture. Their contradictory remarks were made on the same day." He then added: "Under this situation, it is natural for the political circles to have been divided into hard- liners and moderates." He also said: "We are in an emergency state requiring all the people to wear gas masks. The government, however, assumes an inadequate attitude." Another lawmaker who asked not to be identified said: "The people's lack of security sense is a result of the government's muddled position. It seems that officials concerned do not fully understand President Kim Yong-sam's policy on dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue." The lawmaker continued: "Demonstrations by the Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the workers' struggle to establish the second Federation of Korean Trade Unions will likely be intensified when the issue of sanctions against North Korea passes a critical moment." He then stressed, "Measures to minimize the internal confusion to be caused by this must be prepared."
