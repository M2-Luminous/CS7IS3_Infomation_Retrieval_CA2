Peter's Prut campaign, the Crimean War, the war of 1878 and the subsequent Congress of Berlin--in hardly any other region have the Russian military and diplomats experienced such humiliation and failures. Nonetheless, Russia intervened time after time in the bloody Balkan quarrels in the vain hope that the local Slavs, close both in language and in faith, would appreciate it, would be inspired, and would become for all time a dependable outpost of the empire. But the whole problem is that the Balkans were for Russia merely a military theater: Political and military expansion was never seriously accompanied by economic expansion. The region (Yugoslavia particularly) has always gravitated toward Central Europe, primarily toward Germany. Millions of former Yugoslavs, Serbs included, are working in the FRG today also. The Deutsche mark is the main currency both in Serbia and in Bosnia. It is to it that the "new" Yugoslav dinar is tied. Slav brethren have always at a difficult moment sought armed assistance in Moscow, and when the storm has abated, they have, perfectly naturally, forgotten about their "great northern brother." In the summer of 1914 Russia emphatically supported Serbia (having begun mobilization of the army) in the diplomatic conflict with Austria-Hungary following the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. In the ensuing world war and the revolution it caused, Russia was devastated, losing, according to certain estimates, up to 10 million killed. And what remained became the USSR. Serbia, on the other hand, as a result of the war enlarged its territory several times over, annexing Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Vojvodina. Today the Serbs are once again attempting to draw Russia into their war in the Balkans. The "unprecedented success of Russian diplomacy" in Sarajevo at the end of February was (this is now perfectly obvious) prepared in Belgrade and Pale by no means for reconciliation in earnest in Bosnia. The Serbs, it would seem, are of a mind to fight until they have taken all the surrounded Muslim cities (Sarajevo included). And several hundred of our airborne forces have found themselves in Sarajevo simultaneously hostages of Russia's future behavior in the region (totally dependent on the mood of local field commanders) and, on top of that, a live shield against possible NATO bombing raids. When the Serbian tanks tore into Gorazde, all the same (during the latest armistice negotiations), Mr. Churkin threw up his hands--"he had, alas, been deceived." In which there is, of course, no particular perfidy--the internationally isolated Serbs have no other solution. It was, after all, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (not the Serbs) that should have done everything possible to prevent Russia's involvement in the war, having concentrated its efforts instead in republics in which the ruble, not the Deutsche mark, is the main currency. There are, for that matter, no dazzling conditions for "unprecedented successes" in the "near abroad." The lessons of history have yet to teach anyone anything. Last night a new contingent of crack Russian airborne forces flew to the former Yugoslavia to show that Russia is still a world power with global interests.
