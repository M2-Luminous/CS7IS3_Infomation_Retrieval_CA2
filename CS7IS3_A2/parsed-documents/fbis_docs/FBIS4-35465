FBIS4-35465 "drnes105_k_94009" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 27 May 1994 IRAQ Iran's Support for Islamic Movement Criticized Iran's Support for Islamic Movement Criticized NC2805050794 (Clandestine) Voice of the People of Kurdistan in Arabic 1626 GMT 27 May 94 NC2805050794 (Clandestine) Voice of the People of Kurdistan in Arabic 1626 GMT 27 May 94 Arabic BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] The terrorist group, the so-called Islamic Movement, thought that through the use of weapons it could generally obstruct the liberation march of our Kurdish people, and in particular, harm the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and isolate it from its masses. In order to implement its aggressive plan against the just aims and aspirations of our people, this terrorist group, the so-called Islamic Movement, a few months ago resorted to the policy of creating crises and establishing the necessary grounds and atmosphere for wicked plots and plans against our people, which they prepared outside Kurdistan. But it was the Almighty's will that the true face of this terrorist group be exposed to our Kurdish people. This group did not value the lives of the people of Kurdistan. It directed its guns against the innocent people in al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, Raniyah, Halabjah, Klar, and other Kurdistani cities. In view of this foolish action, the forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, in cooperation with the angry people, chased the members of the Islamic Movement and drove them out of Kurdistan. The crimes committed by the fighters of this so-called Islamic Movement are in flagrant violation of the principles of human rights which Islam has strongly defended. What we regret are not the actions of this group, but we are sorry to see a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran supporting such a terrorist group and directing it to kill the children, women, and old people of Kurdistan. Kurdistan has always looked to the Islamic Republic for assistance and support and expected it to treat Kurdistan at least as it treated the Muslims of Bosnia and not to interfere in its internal affairs. Kurdistan never expected it to go against the will of its people through a terrorist group which was rejected by the masses of Kurdistan long before it started its wicked plots and plans. This terrorist group has proved its failure and inability to find any popular base in Iraqi Kurdistan and inability to win the sympathy and support of the people. The aims of any political party rejected by the masses are doomed to failure, because the attitude of the masses is the proper criteria for the suitability of any political party. Our Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan thought that the success of the Islamic revolution in Iran and the defeat of the oppressive Shah regime would be good for them, because they believed that the Islamic Republic, having has ended an oppressive regime like that of the Shah, could not stand against the will of oppressed peoples who yearn for freedom. We thought defense of the oppressed people was one of the important principles the Islamic Republic of Iran believes in, and our Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan is one of the leading oppressed nations in the area which deserve support and assistance. Any military action against our Kurdish people is tantamount to siding with Saddam Husayn and his dictatorial regime against the aspirations, desires, and aims of the Iraqi Arab and Kurdish people, the Iranian people, and all the peoples in the area.
