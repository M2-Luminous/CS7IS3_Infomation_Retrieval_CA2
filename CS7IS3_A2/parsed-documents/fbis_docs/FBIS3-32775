Robaina made this statement during his announcement of the conference, which will bring together approximately 200 Cuban exiles from diverse countries. Robaina also stressed that given the difficult situation Cuba faces today, it is time to prevent emigration from being a negative factor in the hands of others. "This invitation is an opportunity for Cubans abroad, acting in good faith, to express their logical concerns and hopes to Cuba. There is no possibility for political manipulation, nor space for meddling with hopes that are by nature the sole concern of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland. There is no room for doubt or speculation. This invitation does not include counterrevolutionary organizations, nor does it concern itself with the opinions of their kingpins." Robaina added during the news conference, conducted to announce the conference: "In the bosom of the exile community there are today sectors and organizations separate from the counterrevolution. These concur in criticizing the hostile policies toward Cuba, particularly, the blockade. They advocate respect for our national sovereignty and the normalization of relations, and support the Cuban people. In this manner, they contribute to creating an atmosphere conducive to advancement. The maturing of this process, despite the counterrevolution and those who manipulate immigration issues and try to create a schism between the exile community and Cuba, confirms that relations with Cubans abroad is an issue Cuba is undertaking in a sovereign manner and without conditions by foreign interests. The Cuban people and their authorities will not be manipulated by illegitimate, minority organizations and spokesmen [words indistinct] who with the worst of intentions try to represent the exile community and speak on its behalf when in reality they are tools of anti-Cuban policies moved by petty personal interests." Ricardo Alarcon, Carlos Lage, and Abel Prieto, as well as Robaina, will participate in the conference, "Cuba and the Exile Community."
