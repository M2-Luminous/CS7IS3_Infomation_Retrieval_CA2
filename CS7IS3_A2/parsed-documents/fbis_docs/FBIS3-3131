When Chairman Li Ruihuan left the group of Macao CPPCC members for the conference room of the Hong Kong CPPCC members, many reporters had been waiting for him outside the door of the room for some time. With the snapping of camera shutters, Li Ruihuan entered the conference room while reporters from Hong Kong and Macao remained outside. Upon taking a seat, Li Ruihuan found no Hong Kong and Macao reporters in the room and said to people working there: "How come Hong Kong and Macao reporters did not come in. This is a discussion held by the group of Hong Kong CPPCC members, and we should invite them in." When a person working there went to invite Hong Kong and Macao reporters in, Li Ruihuan saw Mr. Xu Simin, member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and director of the Hong Kong paper CHING PAO. He then humorously said: "Standing Committee Member Xu Simin is a reporter running a newspaper. Such an important reporter is let in, why not other reporters?" This provoked laughter among the people in the room. Given the green light by Li Ruihuan, the anxiously waiting reporters joyfully entered the room. At the group discussion, attendees spoke one after another. Li Ruihuan's remarks were humorous yet profound, which were punctuated with applause and laughters. Hong Kong and Macao reporters recorded the scene with regular and video cameras as well as with pens.
