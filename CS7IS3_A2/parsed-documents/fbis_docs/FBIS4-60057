Clashes, which broke out on Wednesday in the town of Kou Senjaq, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the city of Irbil, in the east of Iraqi Kurdistan, were reported to be spreading to nearby areas on Thursday. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud Barzani accused each other of starting the battle. No casualty toll has so far been issued. Northern Iraq has been under PUK and KDP control since an uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to Husayn, accused the PUK of breaching the May 8 ceasefire agreement in a statement to AFP. The INC-brokered agreement ended two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people were killed, and which caused the Kurdish region to split with the KDP controlling the western part and the PUK the eastern part. Under the ceasefire accord INC militiamen could control check- points in the Irbil province lying between areas held by the KDP and the PUK. "PUK troops came down the hill and took our checkpoint by force, and after that the KDP started to fight back," Ahmad Muhammad Nasiriyah, a Moslem Shiite from the southern Iraqi city of al-Nasiriyah, told AFP. He said the clashes forced him and two fellow Moslem Shiites to flee the checkpoint and cross the fighting area on foot waving the INC flag. The United Nations on Monday warned the PUK and KDP that further armed feuding might halt international aid to the Kurds. The renewed battles came as the PUK accused Iranian militiamen of having fought against its forces in previous clashes, saying one Iranian fighter was captured. PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said an undetermined number of Iranian Revolution Guards, or Pasdarans, had crossed the Iraq-Iran border and fought in the nearby Iraqi Kurdish villages of Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah. The allegations were strongly denied by KDP spokesman Bruska Shaways.
