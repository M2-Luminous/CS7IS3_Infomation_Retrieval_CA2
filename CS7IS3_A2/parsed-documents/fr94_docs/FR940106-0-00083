FR940106-0-00083 FR940106-0-00021 The interim final rule, which was published in the Federal Register on December 6, 1990, invited comments through February 4, 1991. 55 FR 50500. comments were received from 21 organizations and individuals, including employers and employer associations, labor organizations, a nurse association, a commission, an attorney association, two individual attorneys, one Member of Congress, and one State employment security agency (SESA). The 41 comments received on the NPRM were discussed at 55 FR 50501&hyph;50504 and are further discussed in pertinent part below. The labor organizations and other organizations representing the interests of registered nurses asserted that the interim final rule did not offer U.S. nurses the protection offered in the proposed rule, while the attorneys and commenters representing the interests of employers asserted that the interim final rule did not go far enough in ``streamlining'' the attestation process. See 55 FR 27992 (July 6, 1990); and 55 FR 30720 (July 27, 1990). Some commenters stated that the Department had been successful in addressing concerns that the proposed definition of ``nurse'' did not take into consideration the differences among State governments in defining nursing duties and practices and did not clearly state that foreign nurses who have not been licensed by State nursing boards must have passed the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) Examination. The major concerns expressed by commenters on the interim final rule included: the type of and location for retention of supporting documentation; the waiver provisions; DOL's role in reviewing attestations; the definition of ``facility''; and the indicators of substantial disruption. All of the comments received on the interim final rule, as well as those comments received on the proposed rule that may not have been fully addressed in the interim final rule, have been reviewed and considered in preparing this final rule. 1. Location for Retention of Supporting Documentation Three labor organizations and one Member of Congress commented that supporting documentation should be available at DOL, as well as at the facility. The attorneys commented that only the Form ETA 9029 should be submitted to DOL and that the requirement concerning the accompanying explanatory statements should be removed in the final rule. Two employer associations commented in support of the interim final rule provisions which require the attestor to maintain the supporting documentation at the facility, but these commenters wanted the rule to be more specific about the explanatory statements to be submitted with the Form ETA 9029. As indicated in the preamble to the interim final rule, ETA found the comments offered by Former Representative Bruce Morrison, then Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law when INRA was passed, and one of the principal authors of the legislation, to be very persuasive. In commenting on the proposed rule, Representative Morrison voiced his support for the kinds of supporting documentation required, and indicated that the intent of a streamlined attestation process would best be served by keeping the amount of documentation filed with the attestation to a minimum, and requiring the bulk of it to be retained at the facility. (The preamble to the interim final rule also pointed out that the Office of Management and Budget in its official comments to the Department on the paperwork burden stated that there should be a streamlined attestation process.) See 55 FR at 50502. After reviewing the comments received during this rulemaking concerning the location for retention of supporting documentation, and considering the fact that the comments received from Representative Morrison and OMB are consistent with a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, the Department has decided to retain the interim final rule's provisions concerning the location of the supporting documentation. The facility must submit to DOL only a brief statement of what documentation is available at the facility to demonstrate compliance with the various attestation elements. The full documentation must be retained at the facility for the duration of the attestation period, and for as long thereafter as the facility continues to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse hired under the attestation. Further, the facility must attest that the documentation will be available for public examination within 72 hours of receiving a request. Failure to provide access may be the basis for a complaint as a ``failure to perform.''
