Contrary to the Japanese, which has set up large support programmes for developing solar energy, "Western Europe is continuing to waste billions" by betting on nuclear energy, thereby running the risk of leaving this large market to the Japanese, says no Euronatur. Another harmful consequence of this policy is that Eastern European countries should thus miss a "unique opportunity "of succeeding in their change in energy policy. Euronatur mentions as a concrete example the EU project to support the construction of two nuclear power plants in Ukraine and adds: "It is a scandal that public funds continue to be spent in the wrong directions." Euronatur deplores the fact that the promotion of solar energy is not mentioned in EU assistance programmes for Eastern Europe, which shows "that assistance programmes seem to have been conceived in cooperation with the nuclear lobby."
