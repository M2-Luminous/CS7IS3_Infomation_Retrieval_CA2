Two Diametrically Opposed Views Expressed on Yugoslavia"] [Text] Two press conference have been held at the State Duma on the same day by deputies who spoke about their trips to the former Yugoslavia. The first group was headed by an official, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy of State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Zhirinovskiy. He was accompanied by Vitaliy Sevostyanov, a communist; Lyubov Rozhkova, from the New Regional Policy faction; and Yevgeniy Fedorov, an independent. The second group was made up of Viktor Sheynis, "Yabloko," and Mark Feygin, "Russia's Choice," who traveled there at the invitation of the Serb-Russian Friendship Society. Speeches at the press conferences have demonstrated an expected, but still paradoxical result: the official group was characterized by extreme radicalism, while the private one was extremely moderate. Both groups outlined a similar range of problems facing the present-day Balkans, but offered diametrically opposed assessments of the problems and methods to resolve them. In the view of Mr. Vengerovskiy's "team," the situation in the republics of the former Yugoslavia could not be worse, while Mr. Sheynis and "Yabloko" believe that "the tide is turning, although it is weak and fragile." The deputy speaker thinks that the Yugoslav conflict was provoked by outside forces, while his opponent thinks that internal ones are to blame. The State Duma's official representatives entitled their statement "On the Situation in the Serb Republics," while the unofficial ones emphasized that there are no such subjects of international law. The former denounced the Russian Foreign Ministry for conniving at the UN actions, while the latter praised the Foreign Ministry for its recent constructive steps. Speaking about the Serbs' hopes for Russian support, the first group focused its attention on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and military assistance provided in the form of "Russian volunteers" as opposed to "Muslim and Croat mercenaries;" the second group pointed to Russian democrats who could support Serbia's peace-loving forces. The officials offered two exotic drafts: the resettlement of 140,000-200,000 Russians -- "refugees, officers, and warrant officers" -- to the Adriatic coast and the deployment of the Russian Navy in locations where Croat aggression seems most probable. The other group was stingy with drafts. Both groups favored the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia, but by different methods. Mr. Vengerovskiy proposed that they be lifted immediately, that the Serb republics be recognized, and that "UN bribe takers," who profit by smuggling illicit goods, be spurned. Mr. Sheynis pointed out that a lack of joint borders between Yugoslavia and Russia makes it impossible to lift the embargo unilaterally, that bypassing the United Nations would be irresponsible and counterproductive, but that one has to fight for the official lifting of the sanctions imposed because the Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan, which has already been buried by all the conflicting sides. The two missions had different visions of the State Duma's role, too. The deputy chairman called on the Duma to head the pro-Serb movement in Russia and to revise "legislation that regulates the activity of the Russian Government with regard to the republics of the former Yugoslavia." The "private" Sheynis put forward the modest idea of "influencing public opinion in Russia and abroad" and parliamentary hearings on the Yugoslav question. The only occasion where Mr. Vengerovskiy sounded softer involved his opponent: In his words, Sheynis professed universal human values. The opposite side's assessment was harsher: In "Yabloko's" opinion, members of the official group were characterized by a pre-formed stance, incompetence, and the desire to exploit international problems in the domestic struggle.
