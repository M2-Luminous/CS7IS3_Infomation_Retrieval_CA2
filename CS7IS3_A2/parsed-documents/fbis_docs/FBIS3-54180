The chairman of the committee, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, presided over the meeting which was attended by Ms. Benazir Bhutto. The committee discussed and approved the action plan for the observance of the country-wide strike. Referring to the secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said from Pakistan's point of view, the talks have been a major success because India for the first time agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue as a separate agenda item of Pakistan-India parleys. By agreeing to our demand, India has also accepted the fact that the Kashmiri people are party to the issue which needed to be solved in accordance with their wishes. The prime minister said the talks failed to make any headway due to Indian intransigence. We had asked India to take several steps to reduce repression. India failed to do so, leaving no option for Pakistan but to go to the human rights commission in Geneva with a view to mobilizing international community to pressurize India to improve the human rights situation in Kashmir. Ms. Benazir Bhutto regretted the dualism of the United Nations in implementation of its resolutions. She said Pakistan had supported UN resolutions on the Gulf war and Somalia to strengthen the United Nations' role. The prime minister said the issue of Kashmir continues to be on the United Nations' agenda. There should be one law for all, she said and emphasized that if the UN resolutions could be applicable elsewhere in the world, they should also be applied in the case of the Kashmiri people. Speaking on the occasion, the chairman of the Special Committee of the National Assembly on Kashmir, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, said participation of the prime minister in the meeting reflects the importance the government attaches to the cause of Kashmir.
