FR941012-0-00080 FR941012-0-00011 Many commenters supported an exception permitting trainers to ride on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;10, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 32, 201, 206, 337). These commenters said that an exemption be allowed because trainers were not as great since they ride for only short periods and, therefore, they are not exposed to hazards to the same extent as machine operators. However, several commenters said that if instructors were permitted to ride on machines that at least seat belts should be required and training should be conducted on level terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 169). Another commenter said that trainers should not be permitted to ride on machines during actual production because ``such conditions may not be conducive to rider safety'' (Ex. 5&hyph;54). Other commenters said the exemption should include other employees in addition to training (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 206). One commenter supported expanding the exception to allow mechanics to ride on machines (Tr. OR 206). Another commenter said that the exception should be permitted for large multi-purpose logging equipment where there is sufficient room in the enclosed operator cab to permit another person to ride safely, even though there is not a second seat (Ex. 5&hyph;27). One commenter said fellers should be permitted to ride back to the landing at the end of the workshift (Ex. 9&hyph;2). However, none of these commenters provided any evidence that these riders were not exposed to the same hazards as the machine operator. OSHA has carefully considered all comments and data in the record. OSHA agrees with the commenters that riders face the same hazards as machine operators on moving equipment and that they need protection equivalent to that of the operator. According to logging fatalities reported to OSHA between 1985&hyph;90, there were reports of riders killed when machines roll over (Ex. 4&hyph;65). The OSHA FCI report also indicated that loggers have been killed riding on unauthorized parts of machines (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Even those who opposed the prohibition on riders recognized that such an activity is hazardous due to conditions of the work environment, such as unlevel terrain. In addition, the record indicates that an exemption for trainers is unnecessary because other methods of communication between the trainee and trainer are available and in use in the logging industry. As such, OSHA has retained the requirement in the final standard that machines must have passenger protection equivalent to operator protection if the employer allows riders on machines. 9. Equipment protective devices. In the hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding protective devices for machines: the need and cost of retrofitting machines with rollover protective structures (ROPS) and falling object protective structures (FOPS), and the appropriateness of incorporating various consensus standards covering ROPS and FOPS into the logging standard by reference. a. Retrofitting. In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether the final standard should require machines without ROPS and FOPS to be retrofitted with those devices. The proposed standard would not have required retrofitting. In the proposed standard, OSHA specified that certain machines placed in service after the effective date of the final standard to be equipped with ROPS and/or FOPS meeting Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) minimum performance criteria. There was no opposition from commenters on the general requirement that certain machines used in logging operations be equipped with ROPS and/or FOPS. NIOSH stated that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42). This is approximately 13 deaths each year due to rollover accidents. Another commenter cited a study where 12 loggers were killed in rollover accidents in the State of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Tr. W1 27). Several commenters said that machines without ROPS and FOPS should be retrofitted (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;54, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W1 22). The West Virginia Forestry Association safety committee said that retrofitting was necessary because operators were exposed to ``extreme danger'' if machines were used in the woods without such protective devices (Ex. 5&hyph;54). In addition to the safety necessity of retrofitting, the committee said that retrofitting was economically feasible for the industry as whole.
