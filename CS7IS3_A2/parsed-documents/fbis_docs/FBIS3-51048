This is a decision of paramount importance in order that Brazil might begin 1994 with the hope that public finances will be set in order and the national budget balanced and, at the same time, so that there might be a good chance of success in curbing inflation. We would thus be able to consolidate sustained economic growth and strengthen our path toward achieving stability and social justice. Are there alternatives to this option? I do not rule out the possibility of alternatives; the government does not believe it owns the truth. True to the most genuine democratic spirit, and perfectly aware of the importance of power-sharing between the three branches of government, the government has always been open to dialogue and to negotiations with Congress. We welcome any proposal that seeks to establish a strict budget balance, such as the one we have submitted through the constitutional amendment. The only thing that we cannot relinquish is the zero budget deficit. Without this, the root cause of inflation would continue unabated. In that eventuality, because the government would be unable to cover its expenditures with the revenues it had at its disposal, it would either have to continue placing government securities on the market, or pass the hat around at banks to collect funds. And all this would take place at the expense of higher interest rates and even worse runaway inflation. Those who criticize the government's proposal keep insisting that the increase in taxes will exact a great sacrifice from the people, and yet they seem to overlook that our objective is to put an end to the most unfair and cruelest tax of all, a tax that weighs heavily on all Brazilians. A 5-percent increase in the federal income tax bracket (or in other words, whoever pays 10 percent will now pay 10.5 percent income tax) is a light burden to shoulder, if one considers that everybody has to contribute according to his abilities in the effort to stabilize the economy. There are also those who reacted against the proposal to establish the Social Emergency Fund, arguing that states and municipalities would stand to lose from it. They did not seem to realize that this fund is a simple accounting device which, by bypassing the constitutional rigidity arising from the system that provides that government revenues should be tied to appropriations, would be instrumental in balancing the budget. Besides the fact that appropriations for states and municipalities would in real terms be kept at the same level as in 1993, the resources from this fund would return to federal agencies to be earmarked for social programs. A little goodwill and national solidarity is all that is needed to understand that the government's budget proposal is by no means perfidious or Machiavellian. It is a solution tailored to the country's needs and possibilities. Furthermore, it has above all the advantage of opening up new horizons, as it would enable us to sail through 1994 with balanced public accounts and -- which necessarily follows -- with the economic stabilization measures under way. Thus the year that is about to begin -- a presidential year, which is likely to be fraught with many anxieties and expectations -- would not force us to sail into uncharted waters. Without fiscal adjustment the country can expect nothing but hyperinflation, recession, higher unemployment, widespread hunger, and abject squalor. We must put an end to the perverse cycle of the crisis we are steeped in. The government headed by President Itamar Franco -- whose term in office comes to an end in a year's time -- has all the political excuses it needs to limit itself to a policy of the status quo. It could have simply continued with the routine tasks of the state apparatus and government programs, while waiting for the elections in order to hand over power. Why did it not want to do this? Simply because in light of the anguish and privations that Brazilians are suffering the government cannot afford to waste one single minute. It would be an utter irresponsibility to sit back and do nothing. We must prepare the ground so that we finish our long journey in an atmosphere of social harmony and renewed trust in institutions and in the country's future. This is the path we have followed. Despite all the problems we have had the country resumed growth in 1993, and will continue to grow in 1994 if we keep on the same course. There are no strikes going on at present in our country. The purchasing power of wages has been enhanced. Exports and imports have grown. Our reserves are at an all-time high. We have rescheduled our external debt. The private sector -- industries, agriculture, services -- has streamlined and updated its methods so as to be in a position to lead the great leap forward in the economy that the country is about to make. Everything has come together to successfully push forward this modernization process the Brazilian economy is undertaking, and which will enable us to compete in an increasingly active and efficient way on the international market. I have no doubt whatsoever that once we settle the fiscal problem and curb inflation, there will be a significant inflow of resources to our country. The world economy has at present good liquidity, and Brazil cannot miss the opportunity of taking advantage of this. Nevertheless, in order to do so we must first fully restore the soundness of the economy and stamp out inflation. This is why, in my capacity as finance minister, I am in a position to say that once Congress passes the fiscal adjustment, I am going to propose to the president of the Republic that he implement the Real Value Unit, the URV, which will be the economy's new leading reference index and will contribute to end creeping inflation. I will venture to take this step as soon as we have achieved a balance in our public accounts, because I believe that the mainstream of our society wants to definitely clobber inflation. The URV will enable us to pave the way for the final stage of the stabilization program, which will entail the creation of a new national currency. The change we are envisaging is sure to be opposed by profiteers, speculators, tax evaders, or those who close their eyes to the social iniquity brought about by inflation. But I am sure that it will be welcomed by those Brazilians who work, produce, and believe in the country's destiny.
