Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports: [Halousek] [Passage omitted] Addressing the working group on the issues concerning the admission of new members to European institutions, the Czech prime minister stressed that the future status of Europe in the world does not depend so much on the existence and activities of multilateral European institutions as on the quality and structure of the political, social, and economic systems in individual countries. In this context Vaclav Klaus spoke in favor of abandoning bureaucratic measures and unnecessary state interventions. He said that it is necessary to build a Europe of citizens and not a Europe of politicians. The Czech Republic, as well as all other Central European countries, has always considered itself to be a part of Europe and, thus, would not like to be deprived of advantages ensuing from membership in European institutions. I firmly believe, continued Vaclav Klaus, that my country has crossed already the Rubicon between the two totally different political, social, and economic systems, and that it is ready to take further steps toward a reasonable European integration. However, by this term I do not mean a total integration. The Czech Republic does not want to be always the recipient and it is prepared to offer something. According to Vaclav Klaus, we are aware of the fact that we have to solve our problems ourselves and we do not expect Europe to solve them for us. [passage omitted]
