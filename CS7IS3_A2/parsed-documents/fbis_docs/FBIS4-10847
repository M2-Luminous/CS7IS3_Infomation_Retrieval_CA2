Ignacio also expressed his concern about the draft law that is currently in the hands of Congress and has been approved by the Senate's Penal Committee. This draft law provides for "a six-year sentence for the crime of slander and damages, and from six months to two years for the illegal enriching of an official." "The trouble is that President (Carlos) Menem occasionally makes these verbal outbursts on certain occasions and they worry the media. They are trying to penalize the crime of slander and damages in the same way that the Penal Code penalizes a homicide committed during a fight," he said. Ignacio added that a court of ethics "only serves for the authoritarian censorship of the task of a professional who may not be on good terms with the management of a professional association or with the members of that court." The ADEPA chief stated that the media submits "to the court that is made up of the people, and of course it is always open to action by the courts," and that "if this draft law is approved the country's press freedom will be doomed." He said: "We have never demanded impunity for journalism, on the contrary, we have always said that there are no special types of press crimes, there are just common crimes that can be committed through the media." In remark to a Buenos Aires radio station, Ignacio termed events in Santiago del Estero as "inadmissible because Labor Ministry Resolution No. 08/94 obliges the prior recognition of the Union of Sellers of Newspapers and Magazines in order to allow the distribution of the newspaper EL LIBERAL." ADEPA expresses its rejection of the presidential initiative to create a court of ethics to control the media in a 10-page document in which the Press and Information Commission expounds all the reasons for concern regarding the possible gagging of freedom of expression.
