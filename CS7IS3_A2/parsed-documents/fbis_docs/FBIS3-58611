For Beijing, the communique means that France has agreed to all Chinese demands, promising not to sign new armament contracts with Taiwan in exchange for an end to trade sanctions. So Deng Xiaoping's intransigence seems to have paid off. Unsurprisingly, Paris' interpretation is quite different, to say the least, which shows the benefits -- or the limitations -- of the equivocal diplomatic language. In order to patch up relations with China, which had gone sour as a result of his socialist predecessors's action, and above all because of the sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, Mr. Balladur has agreed to take into account China's political needs, but reserves the right to use a -- small -- way out: France may approve some arms sales provided they are not considered as threatening -- and offensive -- for China. Still according to Paris, then, French firmness would have prevailed. In fact, both sides needed to unlock the situation. Paris wanted to cut its trade balance deficit and give French companies a new chance to do business in China. Above all, it wanted to reestablish relations with one of the world's foremost political, military, and economic powers, and not be cut off from the huge Chinese market. For China -- which has been squabbling with the United States over human rights, trade, and exports of atomic and missile technology; and which is currently in a row with Britain over Hong Kong -- restoring friendly ties with France was a way of putting an end to a certain isolation. So all is well that ends well. Provided Mr. Balladur manages to meet expectations aroused during his visit to China "in the near future." In the meantime, he has asked Mr. Peyrefitte [former minister of De Gaule] to be the first one to go to Beijing. But will the latter be able to convey the French determination to his hosts in such a way that they give up any hope of brazenly pressuring Paris into accepting their point of view in the future? One would be mistaken to believe in a necessarily bright future. The Chinese have shown in just how little regard they hold their promises of trade advantages. The eagerness to enter the fray demonstrated by French companies already counting aloud the billions of francs they stand to make does not strike one as particularly appropriate. Beijing -- convinced that "hypocritical" Western concerns for human rights will eventually be superseded by greed -- is bound to take advantage of it to raise the stakes. Subsequently, other large industrial powers such as Germany will have to be reckoned with.
