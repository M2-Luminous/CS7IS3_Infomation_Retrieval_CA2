The developments in eastern Bosnia, i.e., the looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gorazde, undoubtedly represent a violation of all UN Security Council resolutions regarding the status of that area and require a very clear, unequivocal, and effective response by the international community as its credibility is at stake, Minister Granic says. Apart from witnessing the tragedy of Gorazde, we are also witnessing several very worrying developments clearly directed against the attainment of peace in the republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina: In Baranja, repeated cases of seizure of heavy weapons which had been placed under UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] control in accordance with the so-called Zagreb agreement; threats by Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic that units of Karadzic's army of the Srpska republic will attack targets on the territory of the Republic of Croatia by all available means, including missiles; the continuation of ethnic cleansing in Prijedor and Banja Luka; the continuation of the Serb offensives against Brcko, Orasje, Usora, Bihac, and Tuzla; the arrest of a dozen UNPROFOR members; and the closure of humanitarian corridors in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is therefore necessary, Minister Granic said, that at this moment the international community should not only continue and persist in relaunching negotiations in good faith and in searching for a generally acceptable and permanent political solution, but also in every separate case, it should use all legal means, including all the forms of the use of force, as laid down by the UN Security Council, to express its consistent resolve not to allow the violation of international norms and UN resolutions and also of the defined principles and the framework for the resolution of the crisis in this part of Europe.
