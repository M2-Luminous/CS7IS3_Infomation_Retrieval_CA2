Judging by all signs, he was not alone in his desire to be well informed on events in Russia. But while he does not have any particular choice and will have to turn to the same--or similar, in terms of professional level and motivation--experts, his foreign colleagues do not have to step on the banana peel twice and again trust what they hear from Moscow. In the beginning the West, particularly the American leadership, cherished more than enough romantic hopes. For instance, Senator D. Moynihan (D) from New York state proposed in 1991 to abolish the Central Intelligence Agency and transfer its functions to the State Department. Although this quite radical proposal was not accepted, intelligence organs could not fail to sense that establishing new relations with their former main enemy does not improve their prospects for the future. Very soon, however, the tentative "thaw" in the area of intelligence lost its urgency. It turned out that one cannot rely on the quality of information of the Russian side, even though it may be willing to share with the former opponents its appraisal of the situation in Russia and other republics of the former Union. In this connection the U.S. President set CIA Director James Woolsey the task of boosting intelligence and information-gathering on Russia and the states of the former USSR. The result was a classified intelligence report analyzing the situation in critical points of the planet and an evaluation of the threat to U.S. interests emanating from there. A sanitized version of this report was presented on 25 January 1994 at hearings in the Senate Intelligence Committee. As James Woolsey put it, the complete and original text of the report may only be presented to senators at a closed hearing. Judging by all signs, it may contain: (a) characterization of the political and physical state of "first persons" of the main countries under intelligence evaluation, including the Russian Federation; (b) confidential estimates of the intentions and plans of these countries' leaderships; (c) information on plans for conducting intelligence activities, including mention of most sensitive active measures; (d) commentary on so-called "black programs" in the consolidated draft federal budget for the 1994-1995 fiscal year; (e) references to agent sources of most valuable information; and so on. Actually, even the sanitized version of the report, which was quite voluminous (31 pages), was presented to the gathering only in the form of a summary. The other speaker--Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General James Clapper--was in keeping with military tradition concise and limited himself to a document half as long (14 pages). We will skip the parts of James Woolsey's report dealing with North Korea, China, Libya, Near and Middle East countries, Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti. We can also bypass the sections of the report dealing with the topic of international problems of proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons among developing countries, and the problems of combating terrorism and drugs. What is worth looking at is Page 10 of the report presented, which covers the situation in Russia and other republics of the former USSR. Analyzing the results of the December elections in our country, the CIA director first and foremost emphasized Russians' ambivalence. The new parliament elected in our country combines political forces that are more united in opposition to the old course of reforms than in the desire to make clear and constructive corrections to it. At the same time, it is obvious to the head of American intelligence that the voters supported the expansion of President Yeltsin's constitutional powers, and this is precisely what could guarantee consistent continuation of the reform. James Woolsey also noted that the Russian leadership is aware of the hopes of all electoral groups (regardless of political orientation) for increased social protection of the population and the securing of proper public order. Next, James Woolsey outlined four basic directions of intelligence and information-gathering work with respect to Russia. First, providing decisionmakers with the most important and sometimes unique information of a political and economic nature in order to be able, in an environment of high uncertainty, to warn them of the risks they may encounter in relations with Russia. While giving credit to what has already been done on the road of far- reaching socioeconomic reforms, James Woolsey pointed out that it is still unclear when the subsidizing of unprofitable industrial and agricultural enterprises will cease. Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that our president will continue the reforms that are already underway, although perhaps at a somewhat different pace (if this may provide sufficient grounds for compromise with his critics). The most important part, the CIA director continued, is to make sure that a softer finance and credit policy aimed at attenuating the pain of the reform does not untie the hands of those who will push the country into the abyss of hyperinflation. Second, the plan is to continue surveillance of places of deployment and the status of approximately 27,000 of our nuclear warheads, as well as the means of their delivery. In this respect the greatest concern on the American side is the decline in esprit de corps in armed forces ranks. This appears especially dangerous in light of the provocational approaches undertaken by some countries with the aim of getting their hands on samples of the most important weapons and military equipment and nuclear technology and materials. Intelligence-gathering activities in this area will be combined with practical help to our side in ensuring the necessary physical security of nuclear weapons and fissionable materials. Third, American intelligence intends to continue monitoring our general-purpose forces. The CIA director already reported in 1993 on the state of these types of Russian armed forces, which are experiencing serious difficulties in providing their commissioned personnel with housing, decent cash pay, and supporting the needed moral and psychological state of mind of servicemen. As James Woolsey correctly noted, the Russian military does not have any special immunity and suffers equally from the political, economic, and social adversity in which our reforming country is so rich. Fourth, the CIA is concerned over the development of relations between Russia and its new independent neighbors, which until recently comprised a unified Soviet Union. The presence of 25 million Russian-speaking people outside Russian borders, as well as the economic interconnection and interdependence of the former Union republics, which developed historically and in many instances naturally, are seen by the report's authors as key factors determining the evolution of their policy. In this connection the presenter dwelled at length on Russian- Ukrainian relations, particularly the problem of Crimea. Woolsey informed committee members of the CIA forecast regarding the outcome of presidential elections on the peninsula, which were to take place five days later--on 30 January. The subsequent development of events confirmed the American analysts' conclusions. Later, Langley experts predict increasing instability in this region, exacerbated by the worsening general economic situation in Ukraine. They view as quite probable new attempts to involve Russia in a resolution of the Crimean problem, which will inevitably affect the state of Russian- Ukrainian relations. Concluding his chapter on Russia, which accounted for about 10-15 percent of the total volume (approximately the same amount of space was allocated to Ukraine and other republics of the former USSR), James Woolsey reminded the senators that the political system that existed in our country for several decades has left a perceptible imprint on Russian society. Therefore it should come as no surprise that this legacy will be felt for many years to come in the form of some or other crisis both in Russia proper and among its immediate neighbors. Let us sum up. It was not at all our task to present the viewpoint of expert analysts from the CIA or the U.S. Defense Department intelligence arm as the most faithful reflection of the real situation in Russia and the most convincing picture of our immediate future prospects. And the reason is not a priori suspiciousness stemming from lopsided professional thinking. While the American special services' approach is thorough, they have a long way to go to achieve a deep understanding of the substance of events taking place here, which is quite excusable in intercultural interaction of such different social formations. The resultant mutual cognitive dissonance represents an academic and practical problem that should be interpreted by theoreticians and methodologists of intelligence services of both countries within the framework of the dialogue between American and Russian special services that has been developing lately. This is why, acting at the very least from a desire to better understand the position of American experts and even more so in order to react usefully, some (or better still, all) observations of our counterparts can and should be perceived, weighed, and evaluated with due attention and without any partisan bias in research units of Russian special services. Which is made easier by the fact that they are now directly subordinated to the president, who is above all branches, above the political ambitions of some or other groups. This at least partially exempts our analysts from a prejudiced, biased approach. The latter assumption may perhaps be a little optimistic and does not square well with the harsh opinion presented at the beginning of the article. But the intellectual and moral potential of Russian intelligence officers and the presumption of their loyalty to their civic duty give one the right to hope for it. There are also other applied aspects in the detailed study of an outside view of Russian reality. For example, this may enable us to better understand the American reality and to have a better picture of the potential attitude toward us in the highest echelons of state power in the United States.
