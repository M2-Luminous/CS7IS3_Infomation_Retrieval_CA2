Chairman Abulaiti, 51, appeared to be ebullient as he talked. He said: Xinjiang accounts for one sixth of China's total territory. It is approximately 16 times the size of Zhejiang or is the size of the other four northwestern provinces and regions together. It has a population of 16 million, of whom nearly 10 million are minority nationalities. Xinjiang's poverty-stricken areas are mostly in the minority nationality-inhabited prefectures and autonomous prefectures of Kashi, Hotan, Kizil, and Aksu in southern Xinjiang. It is very rare across the country that poverty-stricken areas are as concentrated as they are. Abulaiti clearly told this reporter: Last year, Xinjiang's GNP increased by 4.5 percentage points less than the national average and its industrial output value increased by 12 percentage points less than the national average. In recent years, the gap of people's living standards between Xinjiang and the national average has become increasingly wide. The main reason is Xinjiang's poor infrastructure. Despite State help to Xinjiang in various aspects over the past 40 years or more, Xinjiang's infrastructural development has long lagged behind, limited by various objective conditions. In light of remarks made by Deng Xiaoping during his tour of southern China, the State has formulated the policy of opening up border areas. But due to Xinjiang's poor infrastructure, problems regarding its development are still very prominent. On an inspection tour in Xinjiang last year, State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji remarked: "The Lanzhou-Xinjiang double-track railway project, which is now being built, has come at least five years later than it should have." His understanding has a profound meaning. Abulaiti said: In order to enable Xinjiang to reach a comparatively comfortable standard with the rest of the country by the end of this century, with State help Xinjiang's infrastructural development has already grown some. In the Eighth and Ninth Five- Year Plans, a number of key and development projects will be completed and initiated. In the meantime, Xinjiang also hopes that the Korla-Kashi extension project on the southern Xinjiang railway and the project on diverting water from northern Xinjiang to southern Xinjiang will be initiated as soon as possible to guarantee that Xinjiang makes headway in its national economy. Abulaiti said frankly that without these infrastructural projects as a guarantee, Xinjiang's advantage in resources cannot be properly utilized nor can Xinjiang change the passive situation in which it has to aid poverty-stricken areas every year. At present, Xinjiang is having increasingly closer ties with the country's overall development, especially in petroleum, the chemical industry, nonferrous metals, cotton, and other bulk commodities, and is playing a more important role in the country's economic field. As China is gaining in national strength, it is extremely urgent that the State's strategy for the development of western China be implemented as soon as possible and that Xinjiang's infrastructural development be further strengthened. Abulaiti stressed that if development proceeds in this way, the gap between Xinjiang and the mainland proper will naturally narrow, and Xinjiang's contribution to the country will become more outstanding, people will live and work contentedly, the various nationalities will become much more united, and there will be a guarantee for the long-term stability of society.
