Perry told reporters at a special news briefing that the helicopters were Army UH-60 Blackhawk and the fighter planes were Air Force F-15c. The incident took place at approximately 35 miles north of Irbil in Iraq at about 3:30 am eastern daylight time when the helicopters were attacked by missiles fired by the fighter planes. "Apparently the U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified as Iraqi Hind helicopters operating in the northern no-fly exclusion zone," Perry said. There were about 12 American crew members on the two helicopters and more than 20 passengers including U.N. officers from several nations. Visiting British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind said at the news briefing that two British officers were likely to be killed in the incident. Perry expressed regrets over the tragic incident, adding that "I take full responsibility for today's tragedy" and "I pledge that I will take a direct role in ensuring that the investigation is conducted as thoroughly, as quickly as possible." General John Shalikashvili also expressed "deepest sorrow and regret" over the incident, saying that "as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff I feel a sense of personal responsibility for this tragedy and the loss of so many lives."
