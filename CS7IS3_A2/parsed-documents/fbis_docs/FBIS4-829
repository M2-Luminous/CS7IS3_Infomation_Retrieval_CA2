FBIS4-829 "drafr074_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Youth Brigade Submits Demands to Government IFP Youth Brigade Submits Demands to Government MB1804131894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1258 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804131894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The Inaktha Freedom Party [IFP] Youth Brigade on Monday [18 March] announced a stayaway in Johannesburg and its environs on Tuesday, saying this was part of its right to push for true democracy in South Africa. At the same time, the Youth Brigade set a deadline of 4PM on Tuesday for President F W de Klerk to respond to a series of demands, failing which it would embark on rolling mass action. "We also ask our people to mark tomorrow (Tuesday) as a day of prayer for our parents who were murdered by (African National Congress armed wing) Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation] thugs in Johannesburg two weeks ago," Mr Zenzeli Phakathi, the brigade's national publicity secretary, told a press conference in Johannesburg. He said demands put to Mr de Klerk include investigating the deaths of eight people outside the ANC's Shell House headquarters on March 28, to explain why MK had not been disbanded and IFP constitutional requirements. If Mr de Klerk did not responded appropriately to their demands, the Youth Brigade would embark on "rolling mass action". This would be spontaneous, with participation by IFP members in Natal, the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], the Orange Free State and parts of the Cape. IFP Central Committee member Themba Khoza acknowledged the action could have serious consequences for the economy. "We say that the rand is our major target. We want to shoot it down. But before the rand falls, (Mr) de Klerk must rise and deal with our demands," Mr Khoza said. "This is civil disobedience in the way that Mahatma Gandhi carried it out. The position of the Youth Brigade needs to be taken seriously. We are trying to prevent a civil war," he said. On the constitution, Mr Khoza said it was important the April elections be postponed. "If they don't postpone the elections half the people will stay away and will not want to be ruled by a new government composed of (Mr) Mandela/(Mr) de Klerk. "We say they should rather postpone the elections for two or three months and deal with the unrest during that period, rather than have the elections now and then have unrest that does not stop at all," he said. He said the IFP Youth Brigade had the support of the parent body's national leadership. "We are one body just as an upper abdomen and a lower abdomen are linked."
