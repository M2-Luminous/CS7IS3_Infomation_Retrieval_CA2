Since farmers are devoting more of their land to cash crops, the bureau's economists say, this year's grain output may not outstrip the record yield of 1993. According to the bureau's latest survey of 9,730 big agricultural villages across the country, this spring cotton-planting acreage rose to 5.33 million hectares, up 6.3 percent from the same period of 1993. Much of the original grain-planting land is now being used for cotton as farmers respond to the government's call for greater cotton production, Huang Bingxin, an economist with the bureau's General Organization of Rural Socio-Economic Survey, told Business Weekly. "The grain production might stand at around 450 million tons this year," he added. This spring, the country's total cereal-sowing acreage dropped by 0.6 percent from a year ago, but the acreage planted with legume and potato rose by 4.7 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. Huang explained that the government also considers legumes and potatoes part of the country's grain catalogue. But, Huang predicts that this spring the gross grain and cash crop acreage will not be smaller than last year's, which was 176,600 hectares less than 1992 because of rural industrialization. The country devoted 110.4 million hectares to growing grain and cash crops last year, he added. Of the grain acreage, fields planted with rice and wheat shrank this year by 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. However, maize fields grew by 0.5 percent, and Chinese sorghum acreage jumped by 12.8 percent. In order to ensure higher cotton output, the State has set a target of seeding at least 6 million hectares with cotton this year. Henan Province, the country's leading cotton producer, has raised its cotton purchase price to 370 to 450 yuan ($42.50 to $51.72) per 50 to stimulate production. Meanwhile, farmers in the province also foresaw a profitable year with expanded cotton production. This followed two consecutive years of shrinking cotton output that reduced the country's supply and forced up retail prices. In Henan, the cotton acreage exceeds 1 million hectares, up 4.5 per cent from a year ago. The cotton acreage in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, another major cotton producer, also increased this spring, by 17 percent from a year earlier. The bureau's figures also show that the acreage for edible oil crops increased by 666,700 hectares from last year, tobacco-growing lands dropped by 333,300 hectares and vegetable planting farmland grew by more than 266,600 hectares. Sugar-planting fields remained at the same level as last year, 1.73 million hectares.
