FBIS3-31374 "dreeu033_p_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 POLAND WASHINGTON POST Seeks To Discredit Poles LD1602222594 Warsaw TVP Television Second Program Network in Polish 2000 GMT 16 Feb 94 LD1602222594 Warsaw TVP Television Second Program Network Language: Polish Article Type:BFN [Relayed by TV Polonia Network] [Text] The purpose of THE WASHINGTON POST article was to discredit us in the eyes of the Russians, who are our number-one partner in special equipment trade, Cenzin [arms trading company] Chairman Tadeusz Bednarek has told Panorama. On Monday THE WASHINGTON POST reported that 10 years ago Poland used to sell high-class Soviet military equipment to the United States. [Begin recording] [Rajmund Szwonder, Democratic Left Alliance senator] This case concerns a story that is about 10 years old, isn't it? In my home town of Laskarzew, they say that reheated pancakes are indigestible even when eaten with Russian caviar. [Tadeusz Bednarek, Cenzin chairman] Cenzin sold weapons to the United States, but they were museum pieces and weapons items for collectors. [Correspondent] What about reexports from what was then the Soviet Union? [Bednarek] There were instances of this kind, but these exports, these shipments from Poland, went to credible, verified end users in the recipient country. [Correspondent] So what happened after that was up to the recipient? [Bednarek] Well, the supplier cannot check on this for a long time. A credible end user is necessary for the issue of an export permit. Then you check whether the goods have reached their destination. But we are unable to check what some countries went on to do with the purchased weapons. I would also like to emphasise that these were not components, as the WASHINGTON POST suggests, of strategic weapons, nor were they the latest technologies. [Szwonder] The gun scandal [Polish officials found not guilty of alleged arms trade offenses by a U.S. court], of which to a degree I was a hero, the Burmese scandal [U.S. ban on sale of Polish helicopters to Burma], and the current scandal amazingly coincide with our export successes, even if only minor ones. [Bednarek] I believe that the publication in the WASHINGTON POST and the whole press campaign around this subject is unambiguously aimed at discrediting us in the eyes of our Russian partner, who is Poland's number-one partner in special equipment trade.
