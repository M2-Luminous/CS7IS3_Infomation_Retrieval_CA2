South Korea's real gross national product (GNP) increased to 8.8 percent in the January-March 1994 period (compared to the corresponding period of 1993), which is the highest growth since the April-June 1991 period. Now, some people express anxiety about the possibility that the economy might overheat and inflation would surge. On the other hand, South Korea is urged to open and liberalize its markets in connection with its bid to become a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1996. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN recently interviewed ROK Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong on the current state of the South Korean economy and its prospects. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the current state of the economy? [Hong] The South Korean economy hit the bottom in January 1993. Since then it has been reviving. It is continuing its growth this year as well. Such sectors as production, exports, and investment are all expanding. The annual economic growth in 1994 will be about 7.5 to 8 percent. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the economy is in danger of overheating? [Hong] An 8-percent economic growth may be too high for a single year. But because we registered low growth in 1992 and 1993, I think the figure is appropriate. Although some are worried about possible overheating of the economy because of a high production- line operating rate in the manufacturing industry, there are no signs of the economy overheating. It is not time for the government to adopt a policy to slow down the economic recovery. We will administer economic affairs in such a way that the nation can maintain a stable economic growth. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about price behavior? [Hong] I believe the government can achieve its goal of pushing up consumer prices by 6 percent. But it has to steer economic affairs while being mindful of next year's consumer prices. We must observe price behavior with the greatest interest. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Last year, your country earned a surplus on the current account balance of payments for the first time in four years. But because of increased imports in the process of economic recovery, it has again shown a downward trend. [Hong] Although exports are steadily growing, an increase in imports exceeds it due to the expanding import of capital goods. Imports will continue to increase because of the economic recovery. But if an increase in the import of capital goods leads to an increase in exports, this year's current account balance of payments will be in balance. Or it will close with a small deficit of about $1 billion or $1.5 billion. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] South Korea plans to become an OECD member in late 1996. [Hong] The objective is for the country to play its role and assume its responsibility in the international community, now that the South Korean economy has grown. OECD membership will help improve ROK's position in the international community and enable the country to actively participate in creating a world's economic order. Seoul has promoted the internationalization of its economy and the opening up of its markets. In the financial sector, it has been implementing the phased deregulation of interest rates and the open market plan. I think conditions for South Korea to become an OECD member have gradually been created. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that South Korean financial institutions are less competitive compared to those in developed nations. Do you not think they will face business difficulties if the market is liberalized? [Hong] That is possible. Even now, competition among South Korean financial institutions is very severe. But if the market is liberalized, customers will be offered better service. You cannot stop moves toward opening the market. It is possible that competition among banks will promote streamlining of management and lead to lowered interest rates. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Expanding direct foreign investment is also a major task for your country. [Hong] On 10 June, the government compiled measures to promote foreign capital inflow. They include easing regulations concerning foreign affiliates' lending funds from foreign firms, and simplifying investment procedures. I hope technology-intensive industries will invest in our country. These measures will be effective in facilitating industries' structural reform and speeding up business ties between South Korean enterprises and foreign companies. I strongly hope Japanese parts makers will make inroads into the South Korean markets.
