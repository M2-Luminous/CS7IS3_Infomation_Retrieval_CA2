This is the first time for Seoul to allow the DPRK's loggers to resettle in South Korea through a lawful procedure, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. "As they wanted to seek refuge in South Korea, the government decided to allow their resettlement here from a humanitarian point of view," Chang claimed. He refused to disclose detailed information about how the loggers could flee and reach Seoul, saying he had to put into consideration the position of countries concerned and the personal safety of related people. The South Korean Government decided on April 15 that it will accept all DPRK's escapees who wish to settle in South Korea. However, the DPRK has accused South Korea of stepping up efforts to "kidnap" its loggers working in Siberia. If the South Koreans "persist in their operation to kidnap our dignified workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of our reasonable warning, they will drink a bitter cup," said a statement released by the DPRK's Foreign Ministry earlier. The DPRK has thousands of workers in logging camps in Siberia, getting paid by Russia in wood in return for providing the labor. An estimated 500 loggers are said to have escaped from the camps, some of whom are hiding in various parts of Russia and seeking refuge in South Korea, according to reports. The logging contract between Russia and the DPRK was to expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still negotiating its extension as Moscow demanded human rights condition improvement inside the camps. The loggers who came to South Korea will get vocational training at a vocational education organization for a period, while receiving some amount of money for their resettlement, according to official sources.
