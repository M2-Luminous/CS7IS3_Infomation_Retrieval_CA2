The police and judges will be urged to waste no time, to hunt down the killers and above all, those who sponsored the murder of a woman whose integrity and courage were acknowledged by all. Then everyone will go back to their own occupation. It is a very old flaw in our miserable society: The dead are solemnly buried, and then soon forgotten. As for the Hyeres tragedy, the situation may -- alas! -- turn out to be exemplary. A few hours after the murder, the public prosecutor said that "everything seems to indicate that it was done by professionals." No doubt this is true; one would only wish it will not be made into an alibi. By definition, professional killers slay their designated victim without passion but with accuracy; and they make sure they leave no evidence behind. Millions of detective motion picture and TV serial viewers know all about such details. However, there is no hard and fast rule; there are mediocre professionals and careless assassins. Sometimes, also, chance interferes with action. We shall see whether the investigation progresses, whether names can be placed on shadowy figures. It may be necessary to go even further. This murder is not only a physical act, it is also a message meant for the whole political class, for judges, for policemen, for journalists. Whether the murder's sponsors belong to the French naturalized Mafia or to the scum of political circles does not make much of a difference. In France today as in Italy yesterday, someone is trying to scare people. There are issues which politicians should refrain from investigating -- drugs especially. Because the drug trade is a state within states; because millions of people make a living out of it; because it brings unlimited wealth to seemingly blameless individuals. What is a mere Parliament representative in the face of this huge global industry? Of course, nothing supports this explanation right now. But it is exactly what must be on the mind of other deputies who have been meticulously working toward the defeat of the Mafia and drug traffickers. Once again, the two motorcycle men who killed the Hyeres representative on a back road were in fact taking aim at France's whole political class. This is an absurd threat, though. Politicians are not easily terrorized. While they are often cowardly before their electors, in front of threats they are not. In any case, they will keep in mind Yann Piat's face. Her death may sign the beginning of a confrontation between the Mafia and our country's political system. As we all know, no mercy may be expected from killers; one would like to see the Republic demonstrating equal determination. After all, its own dignity is at stake.
