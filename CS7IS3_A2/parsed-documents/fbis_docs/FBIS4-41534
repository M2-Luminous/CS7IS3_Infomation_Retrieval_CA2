In his opinion, such prolongation could be welcomed even by the opposition "since none of its leaders would stand a chance to win the 1996 presidential race." Shakhray is convinced that such possible extension could be objected only by the ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and that part of the political opposition which is not represented in the Federal Assembly. He stressed that the key role in persuading the public to accept such possibility could be played by "regional political elite", which would support it, if the powers of all authorities, from top to bottom, were prolonged to contribute to stability. He believes that the president would "keep a pause" on the matter longer than anyone else. "In a transitional period, elections makes it possible to let the steam off a politically explosive boiler and thereby prevent what happened on October 3-4, 1993," Shakhray believes. As a legal basis to make this idea work, Shakhray suggests that a law be passed to introduce amendments into the constitution for an interim period. However, he emphasized that its passage would require no less than two thirds of votes in the Duma and three fourths of votes in the Federation Council, and its ratification would need support from two thirds of the Federation members.
