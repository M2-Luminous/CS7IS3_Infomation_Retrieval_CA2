In an interview with the CNN Television Network, Christopher said, "We have information they have taken out probably 50 or so of the heavy weapons and we understand that they are beginning to move some additional weapons out ... [ellipses] It means that they've got lots more to take out. They've taken out only a minority." He said U.S. President Bill Clinton would make a statement Saturday [19 February] morning on the possible air strike on Serb Forces in Bosnia, in which the United States Air Force will take part if it ever takes place. "Right now, we're in a wait-and-see attitude... [ellipses as received] I am cautious about this. The Serbs have disappointed us many times before," said Christopher. "There will be severe punishment if they (Serbs) don't comply with the NATO ultimatum. They will pay a very heavy price," Christopher added. He also said that Russia's decision to deploy 400 troops in Sarajevo would not affect NATO's decision on air strikes. He rejected Russia's warning that any air strike would lead to an all-out war in the Balkans, saying that the air strike would only end the "carnage" in Bosnia. Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton met with his top advisors on Friday in the White House on the Bosnia situation.
