FR940318-0-00166 FR940318-0-00023 (d) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in polyurethane integral skin foam. HFC&hyph;134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents in polyurethane integral skin foam. Plant or process modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC&hyph;134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC&hyph;11. (e) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in polyurethane integral skin foam. HFC&hyph;152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents in polyurethane integral skin. Plant or process changes may be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC&hyph;152a, and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. Also, foams blown with HFC&hyph;152a will need to conform with any product safety requirements that relate to flammable materials. (f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 in integral skin foams. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 offer the possibility of a non-ODP replacement for CFC&hyph;11 in integral skin foams. Plant or process modifications may be necessary to accommodate the flammability of saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 and to make the necessary technical and process modifications. (g) Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in integral skin foam. See methylene chloride discussion under Polyurethane Flexible Foams for additional details on toxicity issues. Use is subject to waste disposal requirements under RCRA. (h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in integral skin foams. (9) Extruded polystyrene sheet foam. (a) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene sheet foam. HFC&hyph;134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents in polystyrene sheet foam. (b) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene sheet foam. HFC&hyph;152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents in extruded polystyrene sheet foams. The compound is commercially available and its low molecular weight suggests that its blowing efficiency will be double that of CFC&hyph;12. Plant or process modifications may be needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC&hyph;152a. (c) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene sheet foam. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents in extruded polystyrene sheet. At present, pentane and butane are used extensively as blowing agents in extruded polystyrene sheet. These compounds are widely available at low cost and offer excellent solubility with the polystyrene polymer. (d) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene sheet foam. (10) Polyolefin foams. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, or CFC&hyph;114. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. (b) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. HCFC&hyph;142b offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, or CFC&hyph;114. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems.
