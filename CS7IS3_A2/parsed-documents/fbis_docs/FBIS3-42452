Voskresenskiy] [Text] The OPS-5 water distillation plant was accepted into troop supply in 1990 to replace the OPS plant and is designed to desalinate, neutralize, and purify water. Unlike thermocompression desalination of water, the OPS-5 uses the highly productive progressive method of membrane isolation of the media--reverse osmosis. The technology of reverse osmosis desalination of water is noted for high reliability and simplicity of design, and makes it possible to decrease the size characteristics and power-intensity of the plant. Depending on the salt content of the source water and the depth of its demineralization, the OPS-5 plant provides for a stepped desalination, making it possible to do deep demineralization of water and obtain lightly mineralized water of up to 1-2 grams/liter. The plant ensures complete purification of water by treating it with chlorine-containing preparations with subsequent dechlorination in a sorption filter. The plant includes water purification and desalination equipment, a power-generating unit, a PLVS laboratory, RDV-5000 reservoirs, reagents, and a spare parts, tool, and accessories kit. All equipment in the OPS-5 plant is arranged on one KRAZ-260G base chassis. The power-generating unit is actuated from the vehicle's transfer gearbox. The OPS-5 plant's output for desalination of water is twice as high as the OPS plant, and the power consumption has been cut 40 percent. The OPS-5 plant can be used in areas experiencing a shortage of fresh water, on seagoing vessels, and also in emergencies and ecological catastrophes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Specifications of the OPS-5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Base |KRAZ-260G motor vehicle | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Output for water with following salt | | |content: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2-6 g/l, cubic meter/hr |6-5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5-18 g/l, cubic meter/hr |5-3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |18-35 g/l, cubic meter/hr |3-18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Set-up time until receipt of desalina-|2 | |ted water, hrs | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Shut-down time, hr |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fuel consumption, l/hr |22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight, t |21.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crew size |4 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
