FR940324-1-00010 FR940324-1-00004 Based upon the above findings, the President authorized the Secretary of Commerce to modify the existing restrictions on the export of crude oil produced in the lower 48 states to initially allow the export of an average quantity of 25,000 barrels per day (MB/D) of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower. The President also directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, the Interior, Transportation, and other interested agencies, to conduct periodic reviews of such exports in light of then-existing market circumstances. Based upon the results of these market reviews, the President authorized the Secretary of Energy to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce that adjustments be made in the quantity of California heavy crude oil that may be authorized for export (i.e., adjustments to the initial average authorized level of 25 MB/D). Department of Commerce Actions The Department proposes to take the following actions to implement the President's decision: (1) Propose rules to implement the President's decision; (2) Solicit public comments on the rules; and (3) Publish a final rule implementing the President's findings and taking into account public comments on this proposed rule and other relevant evidence. The Department of Commerce's Proposals This notice proposes to amend ยง777.6 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to allow the licensing of exports of up to 25 MB/D per day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower. To implement this program, the Department proposes to: (1) Grant licenses for these exports on a first-come-first-served basis; (2) authorize the export of up to 25 percent (2.28 million barrels) of the annual authorized volume (9.125 million barrels) of such California crude oil per license; (3) approve only one application per company, including its affiliates, as long as there are other outstanding non-affiliate company applications in that month; (4) allow the licensee up to 90 days from the issuance of the license to export the oil; (5) require the licensee to certify to the Department in writing that the export(s) occurred during the 90-day license term; (6) carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota that the Department has not licensed, except that the Department will not carry forward unlicensed portions more than 30 days into a new calendar year; (7) return to the available quota volume all licensed volumes not shipped during the 90-day term of an export license, except that the Department will not carry forward unshipped portions more than 30 days into the new calendar year; and (8) allow a 10 percent shipping tolerance on the licensed, but not shipped volume of barrels and a 25 percent shipping tolerance on the total dollar value of the license, respectively. The Department proposes to require that a prospective exporter: (1) Submit an application on BXA Form 622&hyph;P; (2) state the total number of barrels for export during the 90-day license term not a per day rate; (3) include supporting documents proving that the applicant has: (i) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application, or an accepted order for the purchase of the quantity of barrels stated in the application, (ii) a verifiable contract of sale to export the crude oil contingent on the applicant obtaining an export license, (iii) documentation proving that the crude oil to be exported has a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower, (iv) documentation proving that the crude oil was derived from production within the state of California, including its state submerged lands, (v) documentation certifying that the crude oil was not produced or derived from a U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserve, and (vi) documentation certifying that the crude oil was not produced from the submerged lands of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf; and (4) export the licensed volumes within 90 days of the issuance of the license and to report the export to the Department of Commerce. In addition, the Department will allow the applicant to combine licensed quantities into one or more shipments, provided that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has expired. As set forth in the EAR, the applicant cannot transfer a license to another person. An applicant can file for a license at any time during the calendar year. The Department, however, will process only one license per applicant per month as long as there are other non-affiliated applications pending during that month. The Department will issue validated licenses expeditiously as long as there are sufficient quantities of the authorized heavy crude oil volumes available. If there is no available volume of heavy crude oil, the Department will return the application without action. If the volume of heavy crude oil available for export is less than the applicant requested, the Department will contact the applicant and determine if the applicant wants the available volume. If not, the Department will return the application without action. If the applicant wants the available volume, the Department will request that the applicant amend its application to reflect the lesser volume.
