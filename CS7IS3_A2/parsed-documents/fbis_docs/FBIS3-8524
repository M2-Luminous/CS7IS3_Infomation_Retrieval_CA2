"They will not end today," the premier said, adding that he expected to spend the whole of the weekend in Vienna. "I do not think we are in any hurry," he said. "We have to pay attention to each detail. It is serious work." The US-sponsored talks were scheduled to work out the details of an agreement reached earlier this month in Washington to set up a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The talks were complicated by a decision by Bosnian Croat leaders inside Bosnia on Wednesday to insist that the Moslem-Croat entity be formally linked in a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. Silajdzic said he had talks scheduled for Friday evening with Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic. He said Serbs would be invited to take part in a joint effort to find a negotiated settlement to continued fighting between their forces and the Moslem-led Bosnian army, even though the Serbs have so far refused. "Certain relations with the Serbs of Serbia and the Serbs of Bosnia will have to be discussed," he said. Silajdzic noted that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had assured him during a meeting earlier this week in Moscow that Russia would do its best to bring the Serbs into a negotiated final solution. There was a chance of reaching agreement in Vienna if there is "enough goodwill and if our friends, in particular the United States, maintain their current commitment," Silajdzic said.
