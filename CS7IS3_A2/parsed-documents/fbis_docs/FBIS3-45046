According to the investigation, since the beginning of this year, the Tongchuan Mining Office's coal production has shown a significant downward curve and its deficit dramatically increased, which has seriously undermined the production of coal, circulation of funds, worker livelihood, and the stability of the mines. In view of the existing problems, provincial CPPCC committee members put forward a six-point suggestion. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, upon reading the investigation report of the Shaanxi provincial CPPCC committee, which had been transmitted to him by a relevant department on 27 October, commented: These suggestions are very good. They should be really looked into. I hope the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Labor, and relevant financial and banking units will form a work team, to be led by the Ministry of Coal Industry, to join hands with the Shanxi government in helping Tongchuan solve the problem. The same principle should apply: Reducing workers, enhancing efficiency, recognizing clearly who the users are, and organizing transportation. According to Comrade Zou Jiahua's comments, the State Council work team, the provincial economic and trade commission, the labor department, the coal industry administration bureau, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and the Xian Railway Subbureau conducted a joint investigation and study and put forward specific solutions to the difficulties now facing the Tongchuan Mining Office.
