According to a report released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), key projects, those worth at least NT$200 million (US$7.58 million), will be the primary contributors to the expected boost in investment willingness. The report was based on a survey of 1,800 private enterprises. Investments by large enterprises are predicted to surge by [figure indistinct] percent, but those by small- and medium-sized enterprises will fall by 7.5 percent and 14.4 percent respectively, according to survey results. "The anticipated drop in investment willingness among small businesses is the result of a combination of negative factors such as the lingering business slowdown, stringent pollution control requirements and a dearth of capital," a DGBAS official explained. Nearly all sectors of the manufacturing industry indicated a strong desire to invest, the survey found. Machinery equipment investment, an index often used to gauge investment willingness, was predicted to increase to a record high of 20.3 percent over 1993 levels. The metal industry is projected to lead the investment spree, surging 64.3 percent over 1993. Just as dynamic will be electrical accessories and appliances, which are predicted to jump 53.9 percent. The report also forecast a 9.3 percent growth in revenues for the manufacturing industry as compared with the 6.9 percent growth rate registered in 1993.
