The proposal of Aleksey Mitrofanov, member of the State Duma, was supported by the majority of the legislators. The State Duma adopted a resolution by the roll-call voting on setting up a commission, which will prepare and hold parliamentary hearings, whose topic will be "threat of fascism in Russia." Yuliy Gusman from the Russia's Choice bloc, who suggested it, said that thugs professing fascist ideology are already walking without hindrance by the streets of Russian cities. "Today they look like clowns, but if we close our eyes to this problem, a situation may emerge, which will mean nothing but the revival of fascism," Gusman stressed. Sergey Baburin responded to his words in an original way. He said that "the threat of fascism does exist, and it became evident in October 1993." On the suggestion of Viktor Zelenkin from the Russia's Choice bloc the State Duma will hear a report of the group of deputies, who visited Vladivostok following the much-publicised removal from office of the city mayor. The State Duma decided as well to hear a report of a representative of the prosecutor-general's office in connection with accusations against Bella Kurkova, head of the St. Petersburg TV company.
