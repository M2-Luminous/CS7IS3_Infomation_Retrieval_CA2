It is obvious that the presence of the Attorney General's Office, in the conversations that have taken place so far, only seeks to learn about the circumstances surrounding the establishment of bases that could result in the benefits established by the law. As the legal circumstances may merit, the Office of the Attorney General of the nation will independently define its stand with regard to each case. Yours truly, [Signed] Mauricio Echeverri, attorney general of the nation
