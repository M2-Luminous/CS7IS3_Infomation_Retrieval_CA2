The Reserve Bank discloses in its Quarterly Bulletin that the net outflow of capital exploded to R16.3-billion [rand] last year from R3.7-billion in 1992. The cumulative net outflow since 1985 is now R49-billion. The bank warns that the outflow could hurt the revival of economic activity and the attainment of financial stability. It ascribes the outflows to "political uncertainty, the ongoing internal unrest, pressure on the rand and the high cost of borrowing overseas." The outflow also caused the net gold and foreign exchange reserves to plunge by R10.3-billion last year, forcing the bank to seek foreign loans. Figures in the bulletin show that SA [South Africa] made drawings of R7.1-billion on foreign credit facilities last year, including the R2.8-billion International Monetary Fund loan. On a more positive note, the bank notes that the current account of the balance of payments improved from R3.9-billion in 1992 to R5.9-billion last year and that foreigners were net buyers of JSE [Johannesburg Stock Exchange] shares worth R4.2-billion in 1993.
