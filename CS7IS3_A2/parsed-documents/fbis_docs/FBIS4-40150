FBIS4-40150 "drsov115_a_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Yeltsin Interviewed Prior to Departure for Tuva Yeltsin Interviewed Prior to Departure for Tuva LD1406155394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1420 GMT 14 Jun 94 LD1406155394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] On Tuesday, President Yeltsin set out to the Amur Region and to Tuva (Russia's constituent republic in southeastern Siberia). On the eve of his departure, he was interviewed by Interfax corespondent Boris Grishchenko. Speaking about the goals of his trip, Yeltsin said that both of these far-away regions were "historically ill-fated", because despite their enormous riches they still remained economically and socially backward. The numerous state programs drafted in the Soviet time failed to bring about the expected results, he said. Yeltsin also noted that he did not intend to propose any programs. "I will take decisions on the spot," he said. "It's clear, however," he went on to say, "that this region is badly underfinanced. It is rich in gold, coal, oil and other mineral resources which can benefit the people. I hope, therefore, that my visit will help encourage foreign companies--Chinese, Japanese and Korean (the Republic of Korea - Interfax) to invest in the local economy." He also announced that on Monday evening, he held lengthy telephone talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two presidents will urge the U.N. Security Council to hold an international conference on the North Korean nuclear problem and on international sanctions against that country. "This is an extremely serious issue," said Yeltsin. The Russian president's press service circulated a press release on Tuesday which says that the U.N. Security Council is drafting a resolution on the North Korean nuclear problem. "Possible sanctions and the idea of holding an international conference on the comprehensive solution of the problems facing the Korean Peninsula must be equally reflected in this document," says the press release. To quote Yeltsin, on Wednesday or Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will meet in Brussels to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem. Yeltsin also said that he had accepted Clinton's invitation to visit the U.S. next September. While in the U.S. he is also planning to deliver a policy speech during the U.N General Assembly. "This is likely to happen on September 25," he said. Speaking about the possibility of signing an agreement on partnership with the EC during the meeting of the European Union leaders in the island of Corfu, Yeltsin said: "I was told the agreement had been almost drafted. This is no good. I will go, when I'm told that the agreement is completely prepared." According to Interfax sources, a group preparing Yeltsin's visit to Corfu, led by Chief of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol Department, has arrived in Corfu. A team of Russian experts is to fly out to Corfu soon. Informed Moscow sources believe that during his trip to Siberia and the Far East Yeltsin will give his go-ahead to the construction of Russia's Far Eastern cosmodrome in the city of Svobodny-18 (the Amur Region). Yeltsin is expected to visit this city during his stay in Blagoveshchensk. A spokesman for the Russian Military Space Forces told Interfax that a feasibility study was being carried out on commission from the Russian government. IF Note: Previously, Svobodny-18 accommodated a strategic missile division. The work to rebuild this facility and adjust it to small boosters Rokot and space modules for them has got underway. Commander of the Russian Military Space Forces Vladimir Ivanov stated that the first rocket would be launched in 1996 from one of the five silos saved after the disbandment of the division in accordance with the treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons. In the future, Svobodny-18 will accommodate a new launching complex for heavy boosters Angara-24. Compared to the Proton boosters currently in use, the Angara-24 boosters will have higher ecological standards and be able to carry heavier payloads.
