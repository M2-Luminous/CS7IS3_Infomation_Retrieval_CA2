Niitsoo said that the fact that in the last round of Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations Russia abolished its promise to withdraw its troops from Estonia by August 31, 1994, changed nothing in the order of organising the pickets. "We have enough patience and if necessary, the pickets will be continued until we have reached our aim," he added.
