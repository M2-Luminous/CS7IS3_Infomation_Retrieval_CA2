Trade union leaders did not specify the points discussed but said both sides had opposed the planned overhaul of the union-run health insurance system. ANSSAL [National Health Insurance Administration] national health administration director Jose Luis Lingiero unveiled an alternative union-backed health insurance scheme which advocates a gradual deregulation of the current system. The proposal will be presented to the government and businessmen. The proposal came as a direct reply to Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who criticized the social welfare funds during a visit to Mexico, branding the Argentine system as corrupt. "The union medical plans are and always will be a guarantee of health for workers, often replacing the inefficient public health system," Cassia said in a communique aired after his meeting with Alfonsin. "One thing is to change for the better and another to pretend to overcome alleged shortcomings by handing health services over to other sectors which privilege profits over workers' needs," he added. Cassia also told reporters the Radical Party had agreed to negotiate all future labour-related draft laws with CGT. Also yesterday Alfonsin and the CGT chief ratified their wish to curtail the president's power to sign emergency decrees and analyzed the make-up of the future Socio-Economic Council to be set up after the reform of the Constitution.
