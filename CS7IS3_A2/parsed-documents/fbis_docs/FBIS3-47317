Referring to cuts in income tax, the senior U.S. official said: "I have heard the size of the cuts will be 6-7 trillion yen and I expect the cuts to lead to an expansion of Japan's domestic demand." She also said: "The effect of income tax cuts hinges on whether income tax and consumption tax are cut and raised simultaneously." The U.S. official suggested in a roundabout way that, the United States hopes Japan will defer raising consumption tax. During the interview, Under Secretary of State Spero said: "Both Japan and the United Sates have committed to work on the macroeconomic area in their economic framework talks, and the U.S. Government has already made a noteworthy advance in cutting the budget deficit." Asked to comment on the stimulus measures under consideration by the Japanese Government, she declined, only saying: "All stimulus measures are matters to be decided by the Hosokawa government." But she added: "I expect the stimulus measures to lead to a further expansion of Japan's domestic demand and a cut in Japan's trade surplus. That is one of the goals of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." Referring to the income tax reduction, which is a pillar of the stimulus measures, Spero said: "It has been reported that the scale of the reduction will be 6-7 trillion yen and I have heard the reports." But she pointed out the effect of the tax cuts hinges on the size of the raise in consumption tax and its timing, which is now fueling a debate in Japan. In the interview, she also stressed the need for the Japanese Government to work for not only stimulus measures, but full deregulations and industrial restructuring. She said: "I hope the Hosokawa government will come to grips with the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and work on a comprehensive economic plan after carrying out political reform."
