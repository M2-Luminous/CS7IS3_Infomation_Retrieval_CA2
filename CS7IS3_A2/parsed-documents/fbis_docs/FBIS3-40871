"In addition, the leaders and the managers did not act at a high professional level to overcome critical situations involving the masses," the MENPANGAB [Minister/Armed Forces Commander] said yesterday when he gave the welcoming address at roll-call ceremonies for deputy heads of provincial police, heads of the regional police, and heads of sub-area police at the Police Education Center in Sukabumi, West Java. Notable cases which the MENPANGAB said have damaged the credibility of ABRI/POLRI include the Banturujeg (Majalengka) case, in which some people were killed; the Sei Lepan local transmigration case, in which there was an attack on the Pangkalan Brandan Sector Police Headquarters; the case involving peasant dissatisfaction towards the Rancamaya (Bogor) real estate project; the case of the Nipah (Sampang) dam, which led to the death of several demonstrators; the case of the worker Marsinah in East Java; and the destruction and burning of Indramayon Inc.'s employee housing in Sumatra. The MENPANGAB thinks that weak coordination between ABRI/POLRI officials and the agencies involved in facing these critical problems have also resulted in decreased credibility. The decreased credibility, according to the PANGAB, was also caused by poor management, particularly command of the initial data, control in the field, and control over the firearms given to the members of the units. In addition, he said, the lack of emphasis placed on carrying out duties, including firm procedures for personal security and operational security for members carrying out their duties, also played a role in that decreased credibility.
