They exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula. Kakizawa briefed Qian on Japan's views regarding the current situation. Qian said that on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, it is China's basic goal to promote denuclearization and maintain peace and stability in the region, which are in line with the fundamental interests of all the countries in Northeast Asia and should be the starting point of resolving the current problems. Qian pointed out that at present serious concerns over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula have arisen, for which China has much concern. "We express our regrets at the move taken by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on June 10 to stop its technical assistance to the DPRK and the results brought about by the move," Qian said. Facing the difficulties, Qian continued, parties concerned should keep calm, exercise restraint and not close the door of negotiation hastily, trying every means to leave room for solving the problem through dialogue. Qian noted that sanctions, which would not help solve the problem, could only intensify the contradictions and even lead to results that all parties would not like to see. "We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open dialogue, mitigate contradictions and seek a way of settling the problem step by step," Qian said.
