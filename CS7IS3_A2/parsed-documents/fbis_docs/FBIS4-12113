The sources said that the Jordanian monarch expressed to the Palestinian official his deep resentment of the PLO's policy of ignoring Jordan and excluding it from any coordination although what is being discussed between the Palestinian and Israeli sides affects the internal situation in Jordan, in fact -- as the king said -- it is the crux of the Jordanian internal situation. The sources disclosed that Jordan informed Bal'awi of its resentment over two press statements made by the PLO official spokesman: The first statement deals with Security Council Resolution 904 and includes "unjustified indications that would lead to an unnecessary dispute with Jordan;" and the second statement openly accuses the Jordanian press of being "a paid agent." It is noted that while in Amman Bal'awi refused to make any statement or grant any interview to a Jordanian newspaper in an expression of the PLO's resentment of the unofficial Jordanian media. AL-MUHARRIR learned that Jordanian officials indirectly expressed to the Palestinian envoy their dissatisfaction with the level of the delegation represented by Bal'awi himself. They told him that he is "from the people of this country," indicating the Jordanian diplomatic passport held by Bal'awi. On the other hand, Bal'awi explained to King Husayn and to the Jordanian delegation whom he met the conditions surrounding Resolution 904, noting that the PLO is very much preoccupied and that most of the time it briefs the Palestinian ambassador in Tunisia on what takes place on the negotiations front. Bal'awi also said that the PLO's internal situation has brought the issue of coordination and dealing between Jordan and the PLO to the present situation. Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's dissatisfaction with Jordan's decision to open a branch of the Bank of Jordan in Ramallah. He said that Jordan should have waited for the convening of the Jordanian-Palestinian financial committee to endorse such a decision. Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's annoyance at failing to hold the meeting for the foreign ministers of the cordon states scheduled to take place following the Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week. Bal'awi accused Jordan of playing a role in this to exclude the PLO with the aim of forming a Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese axis. The Palestinian envoy also discussed the Jordanian measures related to the movement of Palestinians in the occupied territory via the King Husayn and Prince Muhammad bridges. The Jordanian side categorically denied that it worked toward the formation of a tripartite axis in order to exclude the PLO from any coordination, and stressed that what took place in connection with the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers is a declared Syrian stand.
