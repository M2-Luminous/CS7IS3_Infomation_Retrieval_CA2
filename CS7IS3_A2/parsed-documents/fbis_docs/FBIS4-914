FBIS4-914 "drafr076_a_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF: Government Response to Talks Disappointing RPF: Government Response to Talks Disappointing EA1904164194 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1900 GMT 18 Apr 94 EA1904164194 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Army and the Rwandan Government forces held an informal joint meeting under the auspices of UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] at the Meridien Hotel, Kigali, on 15 April 1994 to explore the possibility of holding further negotiations between the two forces to discuss the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace to the country. The military leadership of the Rwandan Government forces has reportedly now responded to the conditions for negotiation which are advanced by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. Whereas the RPF appreciates that there are significant sections of the Rwandan Government forces who detest the atrocities which have been committed over the iast two weeks by Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] and its allies, the conduct of the Rwandan Government forces during the current national crisis leaves a lot to be desired. [passage omitted] The RPF regrets that the response of the Rwandan Government forces to the above conditions, which are entirely reasonable, has been disappointing. The Rwandan Government forces have only accepted two terms. First, they promised to start apprehending the people who have been involved in the conduct of the violence. Second, they agree to the conduct of joint patrols with RPF for the pacification of the country. The Rwandan Government forces have rejected outright calls by RPF for the disbanding of the Presidential Guard and the so-called provisional government, both of which are largely responsible for the atrocities which have been committed. The RPF finds the attitude of the Rwandan Government forces not only unacceptable, but most disturbing. [passage omitted] The RPF cannot and shall not agree to negotiate peace with the Rwandan Government forces while that gang of war criminals (?represented by) the provisional government still enjoys the recognition of the Rwandan Government forces. [passage omitted] In view of the foregoing [word indistinct] the RPF wishes to reaffirm the following. One, the RPF reaffirms its strong resolve to fight and destroy the MRND and Coalition for the Defense of the Republic regime of murderers that is responsible for the unprecedented genocide and destruction our country has been subjected to. Two, the RPF further reaffirms its commitment and patriotic obligation to continue its mission of liberating all Rwandan people who are still under the threat of genocide and calls upon all the citizens of our country who are still outside the [word indistinct] areas so far liberated by RPF, to stand up in unity and to resist the murderers while they await rescue by the RPF.
