Leaders of federal structures and presidents of neighboring republics attended the inaugural ceremonies. Nikolay Vasilyevich Fedorov was born in 1958 in the Chuvash SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] into a peasant family. He is a Chuvash. He is a lawyer by education. He worked as a senior instructor in the department of scientific communism of the Chuvash State University. After his election in 1989 as USSR people's deputy, he moved to Moscow. He was a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet, and he headed one of the subcommittees on questions of legislation, legality, and law and order. He participated in the development of laws on the press and on the rights and duties of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR. He was appointed Minister of Justice of the RSFSR in July 1990. He was a member of the CPSU until August 1991. In January of 1992, he spoke against the edict of the president on the establishment of the Ministry of Security and Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. At the Eighth Congress of People's Deputies, he came out with a statement that the legislative activity of the Russian Federation does not always confine itself to the scope of the Constitution. He retired in April of 1993. He is married and has two children. During the inauguration, Nikolay Fedorov took the oath in two languages--Russian and Chuvash--to apply all of his strength to lead the economy of the republic out of the crisis situation and to promote an increase in the well-being of the people. To the sound of the Chuvash national anthem, those in attendance were told that the first president of the republic had assumed office, in commemoration of which young people in national costumes presented Nikolay Fedorov with bread, salt, and beer. According to long-standing tradition, a festive concert was held after the ceremonial performance. Having finished celebrating, both the new president of Chuvashia and the parliament will have to begin work "on increasing the well-being of the people." Valerian Viktorov, the head of the Cabinet of Ministers, sent in his resignation, because he was elected chairman of the Federation Council of Russia. According to the republic's legislation, the entire cabinet is also supposed to follow him. Thus, Nikolay Fedorov's presidency will begin with the formation of a new government, in coordination with parliament. Parliament is supposed to return to a consideration of the budget for 1994, which was interrupted because of the inauguration of the president. This is a very complicated question for Chuvashia, inasmuch as it had been receiving a third of its resources as subsidies from the Russian budget. The size of the subsidies is unknown, since the federal budget has not been ratified. And indeed there should be no particular counting on Russia's investment this year: As was said by Nikolay Smirnov, the present minister of finance of the republic, they can be received only by the territories that are acknowledged to be in adverse circumstances. In forming its own budget, which has not yet been coordinated with the Moscow budget, the republic, nevertheless, hopes to join the adverse circumstances category, inasmuch as the volume of products fell by 40 percent in 1993.
