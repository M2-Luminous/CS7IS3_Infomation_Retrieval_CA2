At one time he was the most popular politician in the country. That is because in the Netherlands, popularity is synonymous with fame. And Mr. Leendert Cornelis (Elco) Brinkman was a famous Netherlander as minister of welfare, public health, and culture in the Lubbers I and II cabinet. The most junior member of those cabinets, he was only 34 in 1982, he always sought publicity. [passage omitted] Exactly 10 years ago this week, he showed his contempt for the parliament during an interview, casting serious doubts on the functioning of the Chamber, "Sometimes, the parliament is like one big clique," he said. The question is whether Brinkman will continue to constitute part of this clique for much longer. Can a political leader whose party has plunged from a representation of 54 seats to the dramatic low-point in CDA history of 34 seats stay on as leader? In the speech he gave upon hearing of his defeat, a deeply dejected Brinkman gave no indication of whether he blamed himself for the result. The possibility of a "putsch," maybe inspired by the Catholics, cannot be ruled out. The party could have swallowed losing 10 seats. The "Lubbers effect" was worth the same amount. And after the Arscop affair (joining the board of Uncle Arie's company), their representation dropped to 40 seats. But 34, a loss of 20 seats? How did the bright and brilliant young man of the CDA come to fall so far? Certainly, Brinkman was put, maybe unintentionally, under considerable pressure by the outgoing prime minister. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers recently admitted in his own words that he had launched his crown prince much too early. As a result, Brinkman found himself in an impossible position as party leader. On the one hand, he had to support the CDA/PvdA [Labor Party] coalition; on the other, he had to profile himself as the future leader who wished to distance himself from policy that had become adrift, and frequently gave the impression that he would much rather team up with the VVD [People's Party of Freedom and Democracy] than with the PvdA. Which almost succeeded in the WAO [Law on Labor Disability] affair, about pensions. The Brinkman shuffle was suspected by show-off Frits Wester and on Monday [2 May] it was announced that he had left the ship. This marked the start of an old-fashioned American campaign aimed at stepping cleanly into the shoes of Lubbers, as leader of the largest party, with nobody able to ignore his claim to the prime minister's job. However, what may have been a dream turned into a nightmare in which Brinkman himself again, Lubbers and Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin commanded the rather unedifying main roles.
