On this occasion, Li Tieying granted our daily an interview on the issues affecting China's economic development, its economic reforms, and cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The 21st century is considered to be the century of China. If the trends do not change, during its first quarter, China should -- according to the forecasts -- achieve overall a gross domestic product of the level of the United States. Do you think that this is a realistic forecast? [Li] These observations, being made in the West, seem exaggerated to us. In any case, China is not governed by any competition. We simply want to advance the economic and social level of the Chinese people, to eradicate the centuries-long backwardness of the country, and to improve its standard of living. Now, for example, we have set ourselves the task of eliminating poverty from our country by the end of the century. Some 80 million people -- mostly in the mountainous regions and the areas severely affected by drought -- still live in poverty in our country. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] That is a modest reply. Some powers give the impression that they would like to slow down or at least check China's economic boom by means of secondary issues and internal instability. Do you not think that this stems from their fear of Chinese competition in the economic and political spheres? [Li] China is a large country. It plays an important role in the world. It is necessary to regard China's economic progression and social progress as a major contribution to the world's peaceful development. From the historical point of view, China has always been a peace-loving country. An economically strong China will also remain a guarantee of peace in the world. It will never strive for hegemony. It will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Naturally, it will oppose activities that interfere in Chinese internal affairs. Owing to their long-term efforts from the time of the opium wars in the middle of the last century, the Chinese people finally rose up, founded a republic, and are scoring successes. The common goal of the 1,200 million Chinese is to develop multilaterally the Chinese nation and to work for the country's prosperity in order to improve its standard of living and culture. It is impossible to frustrate this goal. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Internal stability is a condition for reform policy and economic development. In recent years, however, China has given the impression that it must struggle again and again for economic balance and social stability. Do you think that the reason for this is the headlong development, or rather the tedious transition from a planned to a market economy? [Li] Our reform concerns the essence of the system, the whole process of management. Therefore, we consider this reform to be a second revolution. As far as its dimensions are concerned, it reaches into the people's overall economic activity and living conditions. We think that the reform steps have to be implemented under the conditions of internal and social stability. It is difficult to develop the economy in an uneasy political atmosphere and it is impossible to reform its management. It is obvious that one should not build a skyscraper on tectonically very active ground. It is also not possible to reform the management of the economic system in an uneasy society. We are concentrating all our efforts on economic construction. This is the center of our endeavor's gravity. Now and for the future -- as long as nothing fundamental that could divert us from this task occurs in the world. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Do you view the progress of the Chinese economy, which can be expressed in automobile terminology as "stop and go," as a consequence of making rapid progress or of the slow course of reform? The supporters of shock reform consider the main problems of the Chinese economy to be the aftermath of slow reform changes. [Li] The economy develops in cycles in all countries. A cycle is a typical form of economic development in capitalist countries. We also had an economic cycle in the past under rigid planned management. I do not mean to infer that the economic problems could not also be caused by our mistakes. Moreover, in the transition from a planned to a market economy, many phenomena that we are still not very familiar with are cropping up. The issue of the cycle in the construction of a social market economy is still the subject of research. A major boom has occurred in our economy after 15 years of reform. Now we have the fastest pace of development in China's history. Japan, and later other Asian countries, experienced a similar boom and problems after World War II. In our country, reform has been responsible for the rapid growth. The rapid progress in recent years, however, has also contributed to overheating the economy. Some factors -- such as energy and raw materials or communications and the transportation infrastructure -- cannot keep pace with this economic temperature. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Economic progress, however, was also responsible for the disparate development of the Chinese regions, for the unequal partnership between the eastern provinces and the central and western provinces of China. The self-confidence of the rich regions has increased, and this has provoked a limited willingness along the seaboard to return to the rest of China the resources that it put into the special economic zones and the whole of the east. This is the logic of a market economy that reproduces wealth, but is reluctant to give it up. Will administrative measures and the attractiveness of the raw-material resources in the poorer provinces be enough to resolve the problem, or will it be necessary to prepare for more serious political and migration problems? [Li] The disparate development between the west and east of China is indeed a serious issue. It has come to the forefront of the attention of China's leading bodies. For example, this year we have introduced new reform measures in the spheres of taxation and investment preferences for the poorer regions. We want to extend wealth from the east to the west of our country. More recently, the central government has consolidated 60 percent of all tax receipts. We are beginning to make more significant investments in energy, the transportation network, and the raw material base in Central and Western China where great natural wealth is to be found. We are trying to increase cooperation between the rich eastern and less developed western provinces and we are supporting the tendency of domestic and foreign companies to invest more in the west. We are striving to ensure that this is advantageous for them. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Practice indicates that this is a complex process. [Li] It will take a long time to adjust this difference, perhaps whole decades, because the eastern provinces are also not standing still. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Moreover, the wealthy provinces are not willing to give up their dominant economic position. [Li] We can make use of the state enterprises that still predominate in our industry for this task. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] They also have their problems. At the moment, China suffers from relatively low unemployment; compared with our small country with its 15-percent unemployment rate, for example. In the process of transferring to a market economy, how do you intend to resolve in China, with its huge population potential, the problem of mass unemployment that a market economy inevitably brings? [Li] We already have this problem. We are combating it by creating a labor market and a social security system. The new economic system must have mechanisms for changes in the labor force and coping with unemployment. In the cities, we are developing, on a broad scale, individual and private sectors that create new jobs. In the country, we are expanding in particular the tertiary and secondary sectors -- the so-called rural industry. Rural industry already has 25 million enterprises. It catches the labor force let go in agriculture. Some 110 million former farmers have already found work this way. A further 6 million were added to this number last year. Another 160-200 million farmers will find work before the end of the century in the services and rural industry spheres. Chinese experiences in this regard are important for all developing states, because they reveal how to industrialize the country and, at the same time, improve agriculture. Our task is to develop rural industry and to establish thousands and thousands of little towns and communities so that the laid-off labor force from the countryside does not engulf the large cities. In China we are now modernizing the villages and industrializing agriculture. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The political changes in Central and Eastern Europe have greatly reduced the level of economic and political relations between these countries and China. In your view, what are the prospects for these relations in the near and more distant future? [Li] It should not be a problem to increase the level of relations. Your pen may also help to build a new bridge. There is traditional friendship between China and the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries. At the start of our republic's development, both the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries -- including Czechoslovakia -- gave us a great deal of assistance, including major investment deliveries and training experts. In the late 1950's, I myself graduated from the Charles University Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Prague. The Chinese people are grateful to you for this support. They harbor profound emotional ties toward the former socialist countries and will never forget their help. The Chinese people and the Chinese Government fully respect the changes that have occurred in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. The Slovak people have a right to choose their own political system and way of life. As old friends, we are monitoring the developments in Slovakia with great attention and interest. We would be happy to see economic growth and stability in your country and your people's prosperity. There is a great deal of scope for cooperation. We can complement each other economically. We have traditional ties of friendship at our disposal. There are no historical disputes between us. I think, therefore, that it is not only possible, but also essential to boost cooperation between China and your part of the world. However, it is impossible to overlook the fact that major changes have occurred in our economic system. These make closer cooperation possible by the means normal throughout the world. The recent visit by our premier, Li Peng, to four of the former USSR's Central Asian countries is an example of this. In our view, all countries, whether large or small, strong or weak, have a right to participate in equal international cooperation. They have a right to choose their own social system and way of life. We are against intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. All countries in the world must live in peace. Economic relations must be based on equality and mutual advantageousness. There are more than 180 states in the world and approximately 3,000 peoples. The world is multifarious, each country has its own specific history and culture and specific geographic conditions, and they all have to respect each other. It is impossible to force a single view or single model on countries. Variety and diversity are manifestations of human civilization. China is a large country with a rapidly growing economy. Even if we become economically strong, we will not intervene in the internal affairs of other states. We will not strive for world domination. We are at the end of one century and we will soon enter into another. We must bring a peaceful, developing world into the next century. All forward-looking politicians must strive for this.
