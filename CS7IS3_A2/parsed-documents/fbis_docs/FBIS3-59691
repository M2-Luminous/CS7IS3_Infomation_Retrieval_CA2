Confirm Pr Isotope and Half-Life 94FE0107D Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 5 Oct 93 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0107D Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), in cooperation with Nagoya University, synthesized and separated a new isotope, praseodymium-127 (Pr: a rare-earth element whose atomic number is 59). The researchers ascertained the half-life and at the same time confirmed that gamma rays are emitted by the isotope. This is the latest of the results obtained at the ion irradiation research facility (TIARA) that was established in 1991 at JAERI's Takasaki Laboratory. Because the Pr-127 isotope has 14 fewer neutrons than the naturally occurring stable Pr-141 isotope and is very unstable, its existence was difficult to confirm and its half-life was unknown until now. The researchers formed Pr-127 in a reaction with argon-36 (Ar-36) and molybdenum-94 (Mo-94), then, after separating the isotope with an on-line isotope separator (ISOL), confirmed its existence by measuring gamma-ray and other radiation. The researchers used a strong Ar-36 beam, which was generated with the TIARA's AVF cyclotron, in a synthesizing nuclear reaction with Mo-94 to form Pr-127. Next, they isolated only three types of Pr-127 from the isotopes produced, and then measured the Pr isotopes, which became extinct within seconds. The results of the analyses showed that the half-life of Pr-127 is 7.7 +/- 0.6 seconds. Isotopes are the components of space from which the structure of matter originates, and studying the properties of isotopes is useful in understanding the process by which the elements are formed. Because of that there is vigorous research on isotopes in the advanced countries, and, in the 80 years since the discovery of isotopes, one thousand and several hundred isotopes have been confirmed. In 1989 JAERI discovered a new isotope of lanthanum (La-121). After that JAERI used the newly set up AVF cyclotron in research on Pr isotopes. Now JAERI plans to search for Pr-125, which has even fewer neutrons than Pr-127 and is expected to have an even shorter half-life.
