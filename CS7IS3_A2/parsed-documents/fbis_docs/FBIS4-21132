On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7 March 1991 that Washington "stated today in an official report the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing narcotrafficking in the Caribbean." The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted that in 1990 "the Cuban Government continued to maintain its policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco) traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking." Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported: "A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in 1992." "The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to its antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by actions, the U.S. branch report stated." Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated with the United States, "the largest drug consumer in the world." That same document admitted that in the past five years, heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America has been diversified. According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries of the hemisphere. Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the report published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention and "is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives." Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug-trafficking efforts may possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades ago. In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's ability to intercept drug traffickers. As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking. This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its present situation.
