FR941013-1-00028 FR941013-1-00005 V. Regulatory Flexibility and Small Business Impact DEA has examined the impact of the DCDCA and this proposed rule in the light of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (PL 96&hyph;354). DEA has identified approximately 1,500 firms or persons, other than retail distributors, who handle List I chemicals. These non-retail chemical firms are generally known to DEA because most have been subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the CDTA for a number of years. Independent retail distributors, however, are primarily small business entities. DEA has found that in addition to the traditional sources of distribution (i.e., hospitals, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, etc.), independently owned and operated retail outlets such as convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, and nutrition centers engage in sales to the public of the single entity drug products that are not regulated. Based on information received from various distributors, the potential affected population of retail outlets that handled the single entity drug products prior to the April 1994 effective date of the DCDCA, could be as high as 100,000. How many of these will choose to continue their sales of the single entity drug products and be subject to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements is unclear, due to such factors as: (1) The introduction of state laws making drug products containing ephedrine prescription drugs, (2) the availability of alternative products which are not subject to the chemical regulations at this time, and (3) the intent of the DCDCA to eliminate sales by those persons who have been supplying clandestine laboratories. The DCDCA requires that any person wishing to distribute, import, or export a List I chemical must obtain a registration from DEA for each location at which such activities are carried out, prior to conducting such activities. The statutory basis for this requirement is found in Sections 822 and 957 of the CSA, as amended by the DCDCA. Therefore, a separate registration must be issued for each location pursuant to the factors regarding the public interest set forth in Section 823(h) of the CSA. Prior to taking final action on an application, DEA will conduct an on-site investigation at each location for which registration is requested. The guidelines set forth in the Office of management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;25 require that the costs of the registration process must be recovered through application fees charged to the applicants. As noted in the fee analysis, the preregistration investigation for retail distributor applicants will be less intensive than the investigation for other chemical applicants, due to the limited scope and volume of a retail distributor's chemical activities. As a result, the retail distributor's fees will be significantly less than those for non-retail chemical applicants. In addition to the cost of registration and reregistration, it is estimated that applicants would be required to expend one-half hour per year completing the appropriate application for registration or reregistration. In reviewing the implementation of the registration requirement, DEA gave consideration to the specific purposes for requiring registration and the nature of the problem of diversion of List I chemicals and made the following determinations: 1. DEA will not require that persons already registered to engage in certain activities with controlled substances obtain a separate registration for similar activities with FDA approved drug products which are regulated as List I chemicals. A principal reason for requiring registration is to allow DEA to determine the fitness of the applicant to conduct a specified activity and to allow DEA, if circumstances require, to prohibit the applicant from engaging in the activity. Persons required to register with DEA to engage in activities with controlled substances are subject to Federal and State investigations of their fitness which exceed the requirements for registration for List I chemical activities. Further, the proposed regulation allows that DEA may remove any person's exemption from the registration requirement and may, if appropriate, take action against the person's controlled substance registration, if the person engages in activities in violation of the chemical laws and regulations. Accordingly, DEA is proposing in ยง1309.25 to exempt persons registered with DEA to handle controlled substances from the requirement to obtain a separate chemical registration for certain similar activities with the regulated FDA approved drug products. The exemption could potentially exempt over 70,000 hospitals, pharmacies, distributors, manufacturers, importers, and exporters of controlled substances who are currently registered with DEA to handle controlled substances.
