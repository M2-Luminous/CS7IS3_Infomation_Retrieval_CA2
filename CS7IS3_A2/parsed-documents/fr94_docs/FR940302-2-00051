Estimated Annual Burden: 50 responses; .50 hours average burden per response; 25 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: FCC Form 313&hyph;R is used by licensees of remote pickup, television auxiliary, aural studio link and relay stations that are not broadcast licensees (e.g., cable operators, network entities, international broadcast services, motion picture producers and television producers) to renew their auxiliary broadcast license. An application for renewal of license (FCC Form 313&hyph;R) shall be filed not later than the first day of the fourth full calendar month prior to the expiration date of the license sought to be renewed. If the prescribed deadline falls on a non-business day, the cutoff shall be the close of business of the first full business day thereafter. On 9/18/92, the Commission adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order which eliminated the requirement that broadcast applicant(s) report pending litigation. The portion of the question dealing with pending litigation has been eliminated. The data is used by FCC staff to ensure that the station is operating as authorized.
