The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) made the request during its first high-level consultations with China's State Economic and Trade Commission, which started Monday. The Japanese team to the two-day talks, led by Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, pointed to ambiguous rules by Beijing on labor conditions and sudden changes in its administrative rules on foreign business activity, such as prohibitions on the receipt of money in foreign currencies, a MITI official told a press conference. The Japanese delegation also complained about deteriorating living conditions in China for foreign corporate employees, such as a sudden hike in rents, for example, to 10,000 dollars per month from 8,500 dollars, the MITI official said. The Chinese side, led by Yang Changji, the commission's vice minister, promised Beijing will do its utmost to improve the situation which was described by the Japanese team as "eroding incentive for investment." The Chinese commission explained that China is pushing ahead with various reform programs as a way to pave the way for China's admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the MITI official said. Tokyo welcomes the move, hoping for the communist country's early entry into GATT, the official said. The State Economic and Trade Commission was created in April 1993 as the Chinese version of Japan's MITI. The two parties agreed to hold their second round of high-level talks in the first half of 1995, the MITI official said.
