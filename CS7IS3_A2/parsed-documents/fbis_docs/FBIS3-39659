According to an AFP dispatch from Brussels, Commission President Jacques Delors said these measures are no good either for building Europe or for the family spirit that should govern the member states of the European Union. The European Commission's press spokesman said the Commission is awaiting the results of the discussion the European troika will hold as well as the explanations the Greek side will give before adopting a position concerning the free movement of trade between a united Europe and third countries. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Greek Government's decision does not facilitate the dialogue that France desires and one which would provide a solution and contribute to the necessary stability in the Balkans. The spokesman noted that France intends to convey to Greece its concern at a time when everyone's goal should be to ease the tension in the Balkans. The German Government has also expressed its concern over Greece's measures. The German Foreign Ministry spokesman said Bonn considers the Balkan region needs more, not less stability. Denmark criticized Greece's decision to impose economic sanctions on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and asked Athens to resolve its disputes with Skopje through negotiations. Danish Foreign Minister Niel Helveg Petersen asked that the issue be raised at the European Union's foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday [21 February].
