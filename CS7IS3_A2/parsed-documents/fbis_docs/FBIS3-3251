"Triangular debts", Mr. Zhou said, reflected the shortage of circulating capital in enterprises resulting from the failure of utilization of investment in fixed assets and products failing to meet market demands. The key to solving such debts, he said, lay in restricting overgrowth of investment in fixed assets and the speeding up of the transferring of enterprises' operating mechanism. There was also a need for adjustment of product structure and an improvement in economic efficiency. The People's Bank of China, Mr. Zhou said, would strictly control the total amount of credit this year. A new increase of RMB [renminbi] 470 billion for bank loans had been decided based on an increase of nine percent for the national economy this year. The restriction on the total amount of credit did not mean tightening the money supply but indicating support for key industries. Funds for agricultural production and the purchase of farming and sideline products as well as loans for infrastructural construction for energy, transport and raw and finished materials would be guaranteed, he said. Circulating capital would also be offered to enterprises in cases where what they produced could find markets. Mr. Zhou said that more than 90 percent of money offered by the state for key construction had been made available. "Triangular debts" were the result of some enterprises failing to raise enough funds for themselves, resulting in a funding shortage. Mr. Zhou reiterated that three principles set out in Premier Li Peng's government work report had to be carried out in order to control the scale of fixed assets investments. First, a certain proportion of the capital on hand should be guaranteed for new infrastructural construction products. Second, the banks should strengthen their supervision and administration in order to see that there was no embezzling of circulating funds for investment. Third, basic circulating capital should be guaranteed for production purposes.
