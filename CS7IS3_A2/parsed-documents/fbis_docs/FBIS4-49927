Officials attending an ongoing national conference on reform training here told XINHUA that some 1.2 million prisoners who have been released since 1984 have acquired different levels of diplomas and some one million of them have won technical titles after studying in prison training courses. Only 5.39 percent of those released have committed crimes again, according to information at the meeting. Wang Mingdi, chief of the reform bureau under the Ministry of Justice, said that Chinese prisons always respect the dignity of inmates, and never discriminate against or maltreat them because China's reformation organs assume that all criminals can be reformed. Training courses offering lectures in law, morals, culture and scientific knowledge have been set up in China's 700 prisons. "Skills and techniques learned in prison increase reemployment possibilities for prison inmates after their release," Wang said. "Re-employment helps cut the rate of crime recurrences." He said Chinese prisons have achieved satisfactory results in setting up training courses and individual prisoners are channeled into different courses according to their knowledge level. "The training courses have helped turn Chinese prisons into special training schools," he said.
