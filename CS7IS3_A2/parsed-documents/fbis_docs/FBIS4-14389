The sources added that the negotiators are waiting for the outcome of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and also the outcome of Presidents 'Arafat and Husni Mubarak's talks, which will have direct bearing on overcoming the disputed points between the Palestinians and Israelis. The sources expect the two sides to reach an agreement next week on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement in preparation for the signing of the agreement by Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin under President Husni Mubarak's auspices.
