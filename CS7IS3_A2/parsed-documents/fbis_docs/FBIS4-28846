FBIS4-28846 "dreas114_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea MAC, Defense Ministry Suspend Panmunjom Tours MAC, Defense Ministry Suspend Panmunjom Tours SK1406024394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0235 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406024394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Military Armistice Commission (MAC) has suspended foreign tourist trips to the truce village of Panmunjom, while the South Korean Defense Ministry is restricting the number of foreigners who visit underground tunnels near the truce line, tourism sources said Tuesday. The moves are apparently related to the rising tension fueled by the North Korean nuclear dispute, the sources said. The MAC recently notified the Korea Travel Bureau, Inc. of its decision to suspend visits by foreign tourists to Panmunjom for a week from Monday. The travel company has exclusive rights to arrange foreign tourists' trips to Panmunjom. Without citing any reason, the MAC said that such tours would be possible again in a week. With the MAC notification, the travel company has canceled Panmumjom tours which amount to an average 100 foreign tourists per day. A business source said the MAC has often suspended Panmunjom tours according to conditions at the truce village, such as military training, and speculated that the abrupt suspension might not be related to the tension between South and North Korea. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry recently did not approve parts of applications submitted by travel agencies for foreigners to tour underground tunnels dug by North Korea at the truce line, causing the cancellation of these tours. Another business source said the Defense Ministry had notified the Korea Association of General Travel Agents that the number of Korean and foreign tourists recently exceeded the appropriate number of people to observe the tunnels.
