The decrease in Ion Iliescu's popularity is an exceptional sign for our nation, which has been considered as dulled by 50 years of communism. If Ion Iliescu wavers, then the power situation is truly serious, because the current president has more than close links with the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] and the justice structure and is trying to achieve the same thing with the Army, and also because the executive branch is nothing but Cotroceni's direct extension. Ion Iliescu is also supported by another extremely important force: the great magnates of the market economy, who come from the ranks of the former nomenklatura and Securitate. There are troubled waters in the Iliescu bloc. It is not so much the people's attitude that weakens Iliescu as the trend toward a split within the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. It is obvious that quite a few people in the ruling party have realized by now in which direction the wind is blowing and that we are on the threshold of a process of the society's normalization. These people, who are labeled the "reforming wing," are not interested in going into the opposition but rather in distancing themselves from a conservative power which, sooner or later, will give in. The crisis within the PDSR has been accentuated by the pitiable Vacaroiu government -- a straw cabinet run from Cotroceni. As a matter of fact, we are facing here a double crisis of disgrace and conceit. The antidote to this crisis, namely the emergence (creation) of a new leader, [PDSR Executive President] Adrian Nastase, is very interesting. Nastase began his mission by trying to attenuate the dissent within the party. However, his chances of success are very small, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize conservatism with reformism. Hence the dissonance occasionally struck by Nastase. In the morning he makes reformist statements on the radio, while in the evening he makes conservative statements on the television. However, all this has little impact on the population, which is politically untrained. The second step by Nastase was to trigger off the electoral campaign for early elections. The intelligent PDSR executive president realized that these elections can no longer be avoided. Adrian Nastase is well aware of the significance of power at the local level, as far as elections are concerned. The ruling party needs the local administration. The opposition's mayors are beginning to receive their dismissal. The idea of early local elections is being spread around and gaining ground. Even if the power does not manage to lay hold of the mayoral positions, it will manage to intimidate the electorate by implying that the power is very strong and that if the opposition wants early legislative elections, then the power can also impose early local elections. All this movement to create a new leader is fascinating. Of course, Ion Iliescu will often make public appearances alongside Adrian Nastase, thus drawing the attention of the electorate to the fact that he is endorsing Adrian Nastase. At the same time, Mr. Nastase displays an appealing seriousness, compared to Ion Iliescu's shallow smile. The moment will come when he will also distance himself from certain insignificant concepts of the president. "The old" Iliescu will then pass onto Adrian Nastase the "secret keys" of the relations with the SRI and with the force of the former nomenklatura, turned great capitalists overnight. Anyhow, the current government must be preserved until the elections. Why did such a move as the creation of a new leader become necessary? It is true that Ion Iliescu's image is sinking, but the elections are legislative, not presidential. Here lies the PDSR's subtlety -- the party won the previous elections thanks to its leader. It is trying the same thing again, only this time the leader will not be the outworn Ion Iliescu but Adrian Nastase. Therefore, the PDSR is trying to win over a new electorate; if the party splits, then those who leave will not be able to take with them part of the electorate. We wonder whether Nastase will also distance himself from Ion Iliescu, if he is successful. After all, Mr. Adrian Nastase is an intelligent politician. Will he observe the guarantees he gave? Or do they have something on him to keep him on a leash? As for us, we must vote. The waters are troubled and they hide all kinds of fish. Some of them are sharks, with wide open mouths....
