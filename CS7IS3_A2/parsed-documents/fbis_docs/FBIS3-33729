[passage omitted: prayers, inviting worshippers to observe piety and importance of the revolution anniversary celebrations] Another issue, to which I will briefly refer, is the issue of cooperation between the esteemed government and the Majlis. It is a pleasure to see those two big powers have full cooperation and understanding, particularly in important issues such as the 1373 [year starting 21 March 1994] budget and the Second Five-Year Development Plan. They will solve the problems through close consultation and understanding. God willing, both powers will perform their duties. I ask the esteemed deputies to be coherent, as much as possible, and consider the future. Do not look at issues on an individual basis and through the sole consideration of your own constituency. Look at them according to the constitution, state laws, and in relation with the world. In fact, look at the current and future effects of those issues. You yourselves are, more than anyone else, aware of the important role of this kind of outlook. I ask the esteemed government, and particularly the esteemed ministers who have a role in the budget issues and the plan -- on which all cabinet ministers play a role -- to make the most use of experts and other consultants who may even not be so famous. The more a decision is based on expert and scientific opinion, the better its effects. [passage omitted] The first duty of judicial power is to monitor the best implementation of the laws and confront the violators at different levels. I apologize that I cannot mention the violators' names, whether government affiliated or not, who may exist in various offices, ministries, and organizations. They have been confronted and they will be confronted. We have had some cases, which I do not want to mention here. It is not good to go on a platform and talk about shortcomings. I would like to say here that your country's judicial apparatus is using all its power and all the supervisory devices at its disposal to supervise the rule of law in the country and confront the offenders. There are other organs that help the judiciary perform its duties properly, such as intelligence bodies, and law enforcement and popular forces. Now there might be an individual case who may come to me or to you, and faced with this situation I should not interpret this in a special way and raise the question: What is the government up to? This is why I stress the importance of a holistic and generalistic outlook and far-sightedess. Now to the issue of Afghanistan. I would like to call on my Muslims brothers and tell them: O brothers! Enough is enough. Do not destroy your country any more. Do not fight against one another any more. Why do you not put your weapons away and sit together and talk to resolve your issues and reform your country? Do not constantly associate yourselves with certain bodies and create this ugly situation that might prompt someone to question Islam's ability to manage and rule, God forbid. It was under the banner of Islam that you succeeded in deposing the previous regime and then set out to establish an Islamic government. Can you not see our country, where in a very short period of time all the internal squabbles came to an end and the late Imam [Khomeyni], may he be admitted to God's paradise, put a stop to all the arguments? Of course we had different opinions here, and we still do, and we always will. Such differences are only natural. However, how long do you intend to inflict so much destruction on a poor country? Enough is enough; stop the civil war! Now to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Given what you all know, one is really ashamed of all the international organizations, which according to what has recently been announced, have issued nearly 30 resolutions, only one of which has been implemented. This is the one preventing Bosnia-Herzegovina from defend itself. They have implemented this resolution pretty well, while nothing has been done about the rest; nothing of course but idle words. They are all after the partition of that Islamic land and the suppression of the Muslims. However, we are confident that the Muslims, under any condition, will not be prepared to suffer shame, and they will not concede to the partition of their country, no matter what hardship they have to endure. [crowd chants] As the compromise agreement progresses both sides realize what the situation is. The fact that Rabin said we would not even retreat from the Golan Heights and the occupied lands shows how things are. Optimists should realize what the final outcome will be. We are certain that the home of Palestinians belongs to the Palestinians and that they should return to their home. My time is up. There are two or three more issues that I will not talk about, but simply refer to. The approval of the Dutch Senate in connection with a legal and judicial matter -- with a majority of three -- that prescribes mercy killing, as they put it, is definitely rejected and condemned in our view, as the judicial and legal system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is not correct to kill a patient even in the last moments of his life, out of mercy and for a quicker release. The remarks made by the head of the Turkish Constituent Court [as heard] are totally rejected by us. Fortunately, some Muslims in Turkey--and another fortunate thing was that the prime minister himself was involved in the matter--have rejected his remarks. That gentleman thinks--I am speaking for the judicial sector--that he can say anything he wants when he is in court. He says Islam cannot be considered as a system of government. What he has said is pointless. That judge should be told: You might be of high rank, but your legal knowledge is very poor, let alone your Islamic knowledge. You should reconsider.
