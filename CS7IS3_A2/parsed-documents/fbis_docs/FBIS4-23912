These include several new posts for people who have to oversee this affirmative action program. This follows the announcement, barely a week ago, of a short- and long-term plan for affirmative action in the civil service. In terms of the short-term plan, all vacant civil service posts will be advertised. Posts where recommendations for appointments have already been made will have to be advertised again. Part of the long-term plan is to appoint people in every department at national and provincial level to oversee the affirmative action program in the departments. The majority of the posts advertised in the document of approximately 800 pages are existing vacancies or posts where recommendations for the filling of those posts have been withdrawn in line with the policy of affirmative action. Altogether 246 of the 11,000 vacant posts are for the management sector of the civil service (directors and higher). The new posts for people overseeing affirmative action are posts for a chief director, director, deputy director, four posts for senior administrative officials, and two secretaries. These people will work in the office of the Public Service Commission. According to the advertisement the duty of the chief director is, among others things, to give advice on the collection of information on the composition of the civil service, concerning steps for a more representative civil service and negotiations on policy for a more representative civil service. An unknown number of posts for role interpreters in all departments at national and provincial level are also advertised. The duties of the people in these posts are described as, among other things, the introduction of steps to make the civil service more representative and the delivery of support services to people belonging to the "under-represented groups." A spokesman for the office of the Public Service Commission said upon enquiry that the new posts will only be filled if suitable candidates apply.
