In an official statement here, the Nadeco said that only Chief Moshood Abiola could set up "a legitimate Sovereign National Conference". On June 11 Abiola, widely perceived as the winner of annulled elections held a year ago, proclaimed himself "President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria." The statement Monday, signed by Nadeco General Secretary Ayo Opadokun, said that the Nigerian people "now have in place the president they have freely elected to preside over this nation who is now the only morally and legally competent authority to administer the affairs of Nigeria." The constitutional conference, planned by the government to start in Abuja next Monday, "can never produce democracy," the Nadeco added. The insistence of the government to go ahead with the conference while two constitutions (1979 and 1989) remained unused was a "pointer to its lack of programme except the perpetuation of itself in office" and a display of "insensitivity" of the military to the wishes of Nigerians.
