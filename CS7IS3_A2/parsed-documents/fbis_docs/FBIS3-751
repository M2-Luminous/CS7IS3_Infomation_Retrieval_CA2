Good evening gentlemen, and welcome. [Kriegler] Good evening. [Moseneke] Good evening. [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, let me start with you. Free political activity -- is that going to be going on in Bophuthatswana now? [Kriegler] Most certainly, that is one of the priorities at this stage. Priority one is to get law and order and ordinary civil society going as soon as possible. But as the same time electioneering, free political activity is absolutely imperative. We have already put all of our plans in motion. The IEC will be visibly present in Bophuthatswana, or the ex-Bophuthatswana and the various composite sectors thereof within the next two days. [Mashokwe] You are presently in Mmabatho, what about the other areas? Seemingly concentration is here now and the other areas are not well attended, like in Itsoseng, for instance, where we were yesterday? [Kriegler] Now Leslie, I made the point, maybe it was not picked up. It is our duty to see that the election as a reality, as a gateway to the future, is visible in all of the parts of the former Bophuthatswana, and we will see that it is done within the next few days. [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, we would want you to explain this to us: it would appear there is a party called the North-West Democratic Christian Party, something like that, which we are informed is going to be led by President Mangope. What is the story there, was this party registered before. Are we seeing a new leeway being given to President Mangope, or ex-president Mangope to come on board here? [Moseneke] Leslie, the North-West Party was registered in time together with all the other parties who were registered, and duly submitted a list within the time that lists had to be submitted. It is quite well known now that we were approached with an application to amend the name of the party to be North-West Christian Democratic Party and the photo of the leader was also changed to be the photo of ex-president Mangope. So clearly that is the vehicle that he is likely to use and he is entitled to if he wants to, to run elections under the name, North-West Christian Democratic Party. [Mashokwe] Are we talking here of a party that is going to be running for national and regional offices. Do you remember? [Moseneke] Come again, will you repeat that please? [Mashokwe] Is the North-West Christian Democratic Party going to be contesting elections, regionally and nationally? [Moseneke] No the registration is limited to the province of north-west, so that is where they would contest the elections, and not nationally. [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the preparations, it would appear even in South Africa itself preparations are not well, at an advanced stage. Are you going to be able to distribute your resources in the north-west area, which was not within the plans I would imagine? [Moseneke] Let me start with the first remark. Preparations are well underway, and we are working as hard as we can to make sure that the whole country is ready for elections on the 26th, 27th and 28th. And in Bophuthatswana obviously the start there is much -- is late, and we are sending, as Judge Kriegler said, a special SWAT team whose function would be to be bring Bophuthatswana up to the same speed as the rest of the country. [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, I would like you to explain to us exactly how visible these people are going to be here, come tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? [Kriegler] First of all our monitors will be in Bophuthatswana by not later then Tuesday. We will have established offices in Bophuthatswana by not later then midweek, that is election administration, voter education, and our ordinary monitoring teams will be there from not later then the middle of this week. It is a special effort that is being made. Our program for the access of political parties will be particularly stressed in Bophuthatswana, and there is no reason at all to doubt that the citizens of the north-west will be as well able as the rest of the citizens of this country to make their choice freely and fairly at efficiently administered voting stations on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of April this year. [Mashokwe] Already there is concern about the fact that the National Peacekeeping Force will be overextended come the 26th, 27th, and 28th. Are you going to have bodies and men who will then be deployed in this region? [Kriegler] There is no reason to link the National Peacekeeping Force to the elections. The ordinary agencies of law and order in the country, in collaboration with the IEC will be in a position to ensure that the electorate can exercise their right to choose their own future. [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, if you could come in here. We talk about a free and fair election that is going to be exercised in Bophuthatswana, yet we saw the might of the SADF [South African Defense Force], ISD [Internal Stability Division], SAP [South African Police] and everybody else in this area -- are they going to be forcing the South African way of thinking, or way of looking and demanding things as opposed to allowing people to choose and decide whether they want to be free and partake in these elections? [Moseneke] Leslie, you know that they are there, present now, for a very specific and limited purpose -- that is, to restore law and order, and to ensure that normal services are available to the citizens of Bophuthatswana, indeed who are South Africans citizens. We perhaps should start talking about South African citizens. Having said that, we will be monitoring to make sure that the presence of the army, which normally would be inconsistent with free and fair elections, does not result in that. We will have to make sure that they limit themselves to the normal law and order functions, which will not in any way impede free electioneering by all parties -- the normal functioning, for instance, of voter education programs, and all other preparations that we need. An example that comes to mind would be establishing voting stations, and I've no doubt that the security forces would have little or nothing to do with that sort of function. So, in short, they are there for a limited purpose to restore law and order, and to protect the rights of our citizens there present, but not to stand in the way of conducting a free and fair election. [Mashokwe] What about President Mangope's party, is it also going to be given the kind of leeway, freedom to run amock here and hold rallies? [Moseneke] Every party duly registered would be entitled to conduct rallies, and Mr. Mangope's party is a party so registered, and they too should be allowed the opportunity to canvass, and the opportunity to fight elections like any other party which would be contesting elections in the north west region. [Mashokwe] We seem to hear, Judge Kriegler, your colleague there, Advocate Moseneke, talking about: we will made sure that people get free and fair elections, we will do this and that. How visibly are we going to see the IEC -- what are we talking about when we say we will make sure that the defense force doesn't get involved in this -- who are we and what are we talking about here? [Kriegler] Leslie, let's get one thing clear. An election is about people and political parties. An election will succeed or fail because the political parties and their supporters play the game. We are the referee. If the players want to make a fight of it, we will have to be tough about it. We have the muscle, we have the necessary legislative power to prosecute people, to ban parties from participation, to scrap their votes in any area where they don't make it possible for others to play. We will not hesitate to do that. But, we will also at the same time, particularly in areas such as the ex-Bophuthatswana, be singularly alert to ensure that the remnants of an earlier regime are not permitted to pervert the political process; nor will we permit the abnormal situation where there are military forces there at the moment to reduce the unrest and to bring the country back to sensible normal operations -- we will not allow those forces unreasonably to interfere with the right of all political parties to put their point of view. And I may say, the real point is not to allow the parties to put their point of view, but to allow the people who have got to make a choice to hear all of the choices that are available so that they can make an intelligent choice come the election. [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, your last word on -- we have like 30 seconds left. We know that Bophuthatswana has been independent. A new administration is in place and the laws of this country are still in place anyway. The IEC has legally no right to be exercising its authority here? [Moseneke] Well, IEC clearly has a right to exercise authority in Bophuthatswana. You need to look at the electoral act, you'll see that the country is defined to include Bophuthatswana, so we are acting lawfully. Let me just very quickly say to you, who are we? We are the monitoring department, we are the many monitors that you'll see in T-shirts, in our cars with our logos and our flags. You'll see pamphlets, you'll see offices were people can go. That is what we are, that's the IEC. You'll find it there present in all the regions of Bophuthatswana. [Mashokwe] Thank you, Advocate Moseneke, Judge Kriegler. Thanks for talking to us. That was "Newsline" from Mmabatho, and I may just mention that the pictures of President Mangope have been removed from this hotel where we are, and the conference room has been changed from Manyane Conference Room to Conference Room only. That was Leslie Mashokwe from Mmabatho, and from the team here, goodnight.
