"We cannot but be concerned by the developments in Gorazde. We believe that these events have greatly harmed the peace process and now the international community should be extremely careful in deciding on its future steps in order to return the three sides back to the table of talks", Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. He recalled the declaration of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry of April 12, 1994 which says that the reaction of the international community under UN aegis in Bosnia is an expression of its determination to do everything possible for enforcing the respective UN resolutions in defence of the safe zones and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] personnel and that this reaction is a signal to the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to start active negotiations for halting the conflict. Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said: "The authority of the United Nations has been questioned in an unexpected way and what was gained in the agreements around Sarajevo is beginning to unravel. I think that the United States, the EU [European Union] and Russia should decide together on a course of action, that it is extremely important that this be a joint effort. Certainly the United Nations have to act with great determination to get the parties back to negotiations.
