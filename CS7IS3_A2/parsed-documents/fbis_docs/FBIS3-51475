This is why they will never be eliminated. This was explained in the newspaper TRABAJADORES, which also explained the difference between subsidies to enterprises and social security benefits. The newspaper stressed that subsidies are given to state enterprises to make up for losses and drops in prices. Social security subsidies, on the other hand, are money allowances given to workers when they are disabled, either temporarily or partially, due to illness or accidents.
