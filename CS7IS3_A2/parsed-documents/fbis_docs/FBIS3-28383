The Thai parliamentary delegation visited the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and the Republic of Cambodia from 1 to 7 February. The visit was termed highly successful. The Indochinese countries agreed with Thailand's proposal to set up parliamentary friendship associations which will highly benefit the Indochinese countries in terms of legislative and parliamentary development. The establishment of friendship associations between Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia should be accomplished in the near future to forge closer relations among those countries. The Thai parliamentary delegation was accorded great honor and warm welcomes throughout the visit. It received requests to provide knowledge of modern laws and to introduce interesting laws of Thailand for the others to study. Thailand also discussed with Vietnam the fate of a group of Thai fishermen arrested there. Vietnam pledged to take proper steps in order to achieve their release prior to the visit to Vietnam in March by the Thai prime minister. Asked by newsmen about Thai investment in Cambodia, Marut Bunnak said Thai businessmen encountered some small problems which should be settled through clarification of the contracts. He noted that it was only the beginning and Thai investors, therefore, should be careful about what they are doing. Anyway, he said those problems would have no impact on overall investment by Thai businessmen.
