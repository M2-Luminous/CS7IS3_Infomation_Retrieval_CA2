The GLC said the government has totally alienated itself from the people, opening a wide chasm between itself and the overwhelming majority of the Lebanese people. The GLC accused the government of circumventing the demands of the working class and its trade union movement and of inventing new trade union organizations and platforms to attack the GLC. At the same time, the government is trying to appear as if it is concerned about the workers' demands.
