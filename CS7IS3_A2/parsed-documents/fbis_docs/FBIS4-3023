By announcing on 6 April that Russia would join the program in the near future, President Yeltsin temporarily put an end to the argument in Russia. It is reported that Russia is likely to sign the program's framework agreement on 21 April. The "partnership for peace" program was approved at a NATO summit meeting early this year. Its main contents are: NATO will not be expanded for the time being, but will establish a partnership with countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] so that they can "make a gradual transition toward NATO member status." Russia welcomes the NATO "partnership for peace" program, holding that it will prevent another split in Europe, but that it is not fully in keeping with Russia's interests. The Russian Government is sharply divergent on whether it should join the program. The Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry hold: Russia cannot prevent NATO from developing relations with East European countries. If Russia disregards this reality, it will be excluded from the new European security system. Participation in the program will be conducive to coordinating its relations with the United States and other Western countries and it can transform this program internally to make it conform to Russia's interest. Russian parliamentary leaders and others, however, are opposed to hurriedly joining the NATO mechanism on the grounds that it is out of keeping with Russia's status as a big power and that it will probably result in Russia losing its room for diplomatic maneuvering and its right to carry out arms trade and hamper strategic cooperation within the CIS. The parliament's International Affairs Commission approved a resolution saying that only when NATO accords Russia "special status" will it join the program. Under such circumstances, while announcing that Russia would join the program, President Yeltsin emphatically pointed out: Russia's partnership with NATO should "be in keeping with Russia's status and role in world and European affairs and with Russia's military strength and nuclear status" and "be different from other countries' relations with NATO in terms of scope and contents." Judging by the Russian leader's statement, the "special status" Russia is seeking in the NATO program generally includes the following aspects: allowing Russia to attend NATO membership meetings and join in making important policy decisions; recognizing Russia's "special responsibilities" toward the former Soviet region; and taking into consideration Russia's interest on such issues as military transformation and defense structures. Moreover, Russia also wants to link its participation in "partnership for peace" with its participation in the G-7 economic group so as to get more economic aid. Russia's demand for a "special relationship" poses a difficult problem for NATO. Acceding to its demand is tantamount to a recognition that the CIS belongs to Russia's sphere of influence, thus upsetting the course of Eastern European states joining the program. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine have warned NATO that "accommodating Russia" is likely to scuttle the entire "partnership for peace" program. In fact, NATO and Russia have their own axes to grind. The United States and its allies are attempting to fill the "security vacuum" in Eastern Europe and establish a new system of European security, with NATO as the nucleus. Russia, however, is worried that NATO will place Eastern Europe in its sphere of influence and thus threaten Russia's security interests. Therefore, it wants to maintain Eastern Europe as a buffer zone, with Russia and the West guaranteeing its security. It wants to develop a partnership for Europe as a whole through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This actually reflects the strategic differences between the two parties. Consequently, even if Russia signs the "partnership for peace" program, it will still bargain hard with the West about the essence of this program.
