The pipeline will supply natural gas to Beijing by the year 1997. This is an important step China has taken to support Beijing's effort to win the right to host the International Olympic Games in the year 2000. The pipeline from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas fields to Beijing will measure 800 kilometers in length and more than 600 centimeters in diameter. The pipeline runs through Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hobei provinces and passes through five river crossings across the Huang He and 140 river crossings across numerous smaller rivers. It crosses railroads in 20 places, highways in 48 places and runs through complicated relief and geological structures such as hilly areas, valleys, and gorges and the loess plateau. The project will take three years to complete. Work on the project is planned to commence during the first half of 1994 and by the end of 1997 the conditions will be there for the supply of natural gas to Beijing. Total engineering investment is about 2.5 billion yuan. When Phase I of the project is completed, the pipeline will be able to supply about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Beijing per year. At the same time, Beijing will also start work on its natural gas supply, storage and usage facilities to synchronize with the pipeline project. Total investment is about 1.5 billion yuan. When Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas is made available to Beijing by the pipeline, the natural gas will replace the charcoal. It will reduce the number of residential fireplaces by 600,000 and the number of furnaces in public utilities and industrial users by 40,000. This will improve greatly the environmental conditions of Beijing and raise it to the level and standards required by the World Health Organization.
