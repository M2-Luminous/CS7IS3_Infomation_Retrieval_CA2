Rosada Granados said these subjects will be discussed in this order and that the second one will be debated in an ad hoc meeting. He said special mechanisms will be used to complete the discussion after it was decided to carry out the study and analysis. The official said the signing of the framework agreement early in the year was the end of the beginning and that the General Agreement on Human Rights now marks the beginning of the end. Rosada said he regards the fulfillment of the agreement very probable because he detected in the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] commanders a determination to make good their words and reach a political understanding so they can be reincorporated into the country's legal life. He said the URNG leaders have also pledged their word abroad, and the negotiators and the international community are waiting for the two sides to abide by the agreement. Finally, he said the only thing that remains is to march forward with common sense and tolerance so this process, which now exists only on paper, can become reality.
