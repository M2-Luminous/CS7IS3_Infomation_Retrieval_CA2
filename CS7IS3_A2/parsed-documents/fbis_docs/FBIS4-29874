They also reconfirmed the need to institute domestic economic reform, steadily implement measures outlined in the government's February pump-priming package and flesh out a market-opening package unveiled in March, a government spokesman said. Hata and his top aides agreed that the yen's movement has a strong impact on the just-emerging recovery of Japan's economy, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura told reporters. Hata convened the emergency cabinet meeting following the yen's overnight surge in New York to a new global postwar record high of 99.85-95 yen against the dollar. At the gathering, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii voiced concern about the yen's violent fluctuations and spoke of the need for Japan to keep in close touch with other G-7 nations to stabilize the currency markets, Kitamura said. The dollar ended Wednesday morning in Tokyo at 101.15 yen, down 1.00 yen from Tuesday, after opening at a postwar record low in Tokyo of 100.35 yen. Attending Wednesday's meeting were Hata, Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai.
