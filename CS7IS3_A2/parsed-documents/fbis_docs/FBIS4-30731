[passage omitted] According to forecasts your party has 23 mandates in the individual constituencies. [passage omitted] What are your first impressions? [passage omitted] [Petoe] We had two aims. [passage omitted] One of these was to repeat our 1990 result, in that we should come a strong second. [passage omitted] Our second aim was--we formulated this between the two rounds of the election--to prevent if possible the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] from gaining an absolute majority because we thought that it would be more advantageous if better conditions for a coalition government developed. It seems that the electorate did not adopt this advice of ours. It appears that the MSZP's absolute majority is certain--about 55 percent, if I understand the forecast correctly. The electorate decided in favor of a one-party government. This does not mean, naturally, that we will not negotiate with the MSZP. Our convention [kueldoett gyueles] will have the final word. [passage omitted] The convention will decide on the coalition question. We have already indicated between the two rounds of the election that the coalition conditions will be very different if the MSZP were to have an absolute majority from conditions if it were not to. [passage omitted] [Hortobagyi] Is there any big winner or big loser in the SZDSZ? [Petoe] [passage omitted] I do not think there was a big loser in the SZDSZ, taking everything as a whole, because the SZDSZ has delivered a good result as a team. We are satisfied with our achievement. [passage omitted] According to forecasts, Gabor Fodor and Gabor Kuncze will win in their constituencies. My position appears to be the reverse. I am a loser, shall we say. If you like, I am a big loser. [passage omitted]
