Two departments that used to train specialists to service nuclear reactors on surface vessels and submarines have thus been combined and transformed into a department for nuclear power installations. The experienced instructors in it will train specialists for the nuclear electric power plants of Ukraine. The refitting of the teaching laboratory, which has unique simulators of the control panels of operational shipboard nuclear power installations, will soon begin under the supervision of department chief Captain 1st Rank Nikolay Peregudov. Experienced specialists--representatives of the Ministry of Nuclear Power of Ukraine--will be assisting in this work.
