Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, describes the most important guidelines of the program, which has been given the title "The Strategy for Poland." [Begin Kolodko recording] We want to dramatically step up the growth rate, finalize the macroeconomic stabilization, stabilize the system, and considerably improve living conditions. This is economic growth based mainly on investment and export expansion. The aim of the program is to reduce not only the rate of inflation but also the level of unemployment. By 1997 we want to reduce the unemployment level to less than 14 percent. As early as 1996, we want to reach a monthly inflation rate of not more than 1 percent, and, in 1997, we want to reduce the annual level of inflation to one figure. The question, above all, is what is our target? We want to increase national income by about 22 percent over a four-year period. It is clear that almost all Poles should benefit from this rate of growth because the level of consumption will grow. This, I think, has gained us the support of the trade unions for the program. The investment capability of Polish economy will also increase, which, I believe, will be supported by business circles. I am generally pleased that the Strategy for Poland is gaining support from both the working people and businessmen. I really think one can conduct an economic policy in this way, with support for what we want to do coming from both directions.
