Leading specialists of the American Heritage Foundation, Jeffrey Gainer, Kim Holmes, and John Robson, see the reform course corrections as a real threat for the revival of the command-administrative system, which could bring Russia to the brink of economic catastrophe. Despite a certain difference in approach, the Americans draw one common conclusion: It was not the "shock therapy" and "wholesale privatization" which brought the reformers to economic crisis but, on the contrary, the all-too-slow reform development caused the failures and setbacks in both economy and policy. "Yeltsin's economic policy appears radical," John Guardiano, Heritage Foundation policy analyst, maintains, "but in reality it is quite moderate. Far from being `shock therapy,' it destroyed the old economic system without having created any new one in exchange." The expert offers his harsh prescription: "To go much further than the relatively timid Yeltsin policy of price liberalization and privatization. This essentially means destruction of the monopoly system of industrial sectors subordinate to the state, the establishment of `iron' laws, and the creation of a system for social protection of the people who have lost their jobs." In Yegor Gaydar's opinion, Russian reform and privatization could not have been of a different character: The reformers were faced with abandoning the reforms altogether or accepting the compromises that were imposed by the Supreme Soviet. Only by agreeing to the imposed rules of the game did they acquire an opportunity, albeit in distorted, crude form, to undertake the "standard, mass circulation" of private property. Three of the four main tasks--internal liberalization of the economy and its openness to the outside and privatization--were accomplished at the first stage of the reform. Just one of the set tasks--financial stability--was not accomplished. "Public" check privatization is now being completed, private property and the stock market have become a reality, and it is possible to embark on the next stage--the restructuring of enterprises and sectors. At the new stage, Gaydar believes, it is necessary to switch from universal to individual methods of privatization and from the distribution of property free of charge to its sale. The general political task is to create a strong social stratum of property owners and market mechanisms ensuring the impossibility of the revenge of the administrative-command system. The "romanticism of a return" to a communist regime is a forlorn hope, for that matter--even at the state-owned enterprises today not one director wants a return to the State Planning Committee and the party district committees, which would once again command them and, as earlier, "set the wages of his secretary." Only rightwing extremism and "radical nationalism," which could incite a mass protest with dangerous consequences, might represent a real threat today. This problem, however, as Yegor Timurovich joked, "has no solution within the framework of the privatization procedure." Only economic growth, the surmounting of the sharp differentiation in income, and legality and law and order in the state could be effective weapons here. Then there would be a real chance of "private property not being bulldozed one more time." More specific tasks at the next stage of privatization were outlined by Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State Property Committee. By July we need to have completed check privatization, and not simply to have "collected" the vouchers from the public, what is more, but to have sold as large a proportion of state property as possible--only the substantial weight of the private sector can "really make Russia a bourgeois country." The enlistment in the privatization process of land and nonresidential property--this is the basis of small- and medium-sized business, without which, essentially, there is no market--will be of immense significance at the next stage. Petr Filippov, leader of the president's analytical office, set forth at the conference his view of the mechanism for surmounting such monopolism, proposing, specifically, the introduction of a progressive payroll tax prompting the breakup of economic structures into small units. Government tax policy in relation to small business and enterprise today is just about the main reason why they are being wound up. The question of investment policy, the attraction of foreign investors included, was raised repeatedly at the international conference devoted to problems of privatization in Russia. The opinion of the American expert John Robson is eloquent in this respect: "Money is cowardly, it goes only where there is political stability, a prospect of economic growth, and real hopes of a multiplication of capital."
