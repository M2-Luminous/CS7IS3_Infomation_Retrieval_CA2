NODONG SINMUN today views this as a scheme to prop up the tottering regime and gratify its wild ambition for the reunification of the country through Northward invasion by serving the United States as its servant and shock brigade in the execution of its policy of aggression and war. The analyst says: An official of the defence agency of Japan made it plain that the manoeuvres are a dangerous military action directed against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea when he said the joint operation in the Rimpac "will be a political message" to "North Korea over its nuclear program." The United States intends to facilitate the formation of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance and, at the same time, establish "a collective security system" involving the whole of the Asian-Pacific region by inveigling South Korea and Japan into the manoeuvres. The Korean peninsula is the first target in the "new military strategy" of the United States seeking "a new world order" after "the end of the Cold War." And it is the invariable goal pursued by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war. The Kim Yong-sam group is zealously behaving as a shock brigade in the execution of this criminal aggressive strategy, fully revealing its true color as a faithful war servant of the United States and a group of traitors trying to slay the fellow countrymen in the North in league with outside forces. The South Korean puppets must stop imprudently serving the United States in its perilous policy of war, clearly mindful that they have nothing to get from toeing outside forces' policy of "strength."
