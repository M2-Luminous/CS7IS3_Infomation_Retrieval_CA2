Mr. Hajdari spoke about the commission and the work of the parliament in support of the democratic reforms and discussed new legislation passed by the parliament. Mr. Bouvard appreciated the great work carried out by the commission in revising Albanian laws, which are now completely different from those which existed under the communist regime. Further on, Mr. Bouvard spoke of the role of the North Atlantic Assembly he directs, in the field of defence and security of its member countries. "I am also happy for the unanimous efforts of the member countries of our alliance to accept Albania as an associate member in the pact. We consider it a moral obligation toward your country because you have suffered for 50 years under a communist dictatorship. Our alliance follows attentively the efforts of the people of Kosova, led by their honoured President Rugova, under Serbian occupiers, in defence of their human rights." Mr. Bouvard also underlined the efforts of the alliance not to allow a spillover of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the south. [passage omitted]
