[Terasawa] I want to see an administration that takes markets into account. I have the experience of having worked for private companies. I think I can make myself unique by putting the experience of having been in a market economy to good use. I would like to take timely action to deal with the problem of commodity price gaps existing between Japan and other countries, deregulation, and improvement of market access. Besides, I would like to be a mediator within the government who works from the viewpoint of making the lives of consumers more abundant. Doing deskwork is not good enough. It is necessary to absorb voices from wide areas of the private sector all the time. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the current state of the economy? [Terasawa] I consider the high yen problem as serious. The auto and high-tech industries which are supposed to be competitive are having a hard time because of the high yen value. Meanwhile, restructuring of companies will proceed. As far as we can see from the perspective of gains in business income and investments in plants and equipment, the poor state of economy will continue. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the recent yen moves on the market? [Terasawa] The exchange market being violently pushed around by speculators is not desirable. I would like to see a market that reflects economic fundamentals. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is strong criticism that the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] judgment on the economy is wrong. Do you think the government prediction (of 2.4 percent in growth) is achievable? [Terasawa] Certainly, past judgments have been wrong. The EPA takes the criticism solemnly, and will make maximum possible efforts to help economic predictions prove correct. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you intend to revise the economic plan (five-year economic plan to become a lifestyle superpower) adopted during the Miyazawa government? [Terasawa] Three years have passed since the plan was adopted. The Economic Council (prime minister's advisory body) is checking on the progress being made on the plan. I am not thinking about revising it as yet. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The EPA is often cited as an "unnecessary government office." [Terasawa] The EPA has competent economists working for it, and I think it is an important office which has the duty of defending individual consumers and the public. We will be able to defend the EPA's raison d'etre as long as we perform the jobs expected of us. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have long worked in the securities industry. Using your experience, could you tell me whether the current average stock of price of about 20,000 yen is appropriate? [Terasawa] Six years have passed since I left Kabuto-cho. I have since worked in international organizations and later as a Diet member. I have lost a sense of it as I have been away from the industry for so long; I know nothing about stocks now.
