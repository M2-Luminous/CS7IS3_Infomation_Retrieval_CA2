FR940602-2-00127 FR940602-2-00080 Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and (18)(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. 2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemption of shares. The order would supersede the Prior Order and would permit the Funds to impose CDSC schedules that may be different from the one described in the Prior Order. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The designation to each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing from a service and/or distribution fee; (c) different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund may in the future determine to allocate to a specific class (``class-specific expenses''), which will be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) director's fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares ( e.g., the adoption, amendment, or termination of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (except as provided in condition 15 below); (e) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as described in the prospectuses of the Funds; and (f) classes that impose a 12b&hyph;1 fee may convert to another class. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The directors of each the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the variable pricing system prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the variable pricing system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed variable pricing system is in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose of which the expenditures were made. 4 On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Underwriter will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Underwriter at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale of servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to the class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each class and except that any class-specific expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares.
