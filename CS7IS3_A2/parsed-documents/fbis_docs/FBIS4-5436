Tharin said he will affirm the proposals at the coming GATT meeting to be held in Morocco on April 12-15. Foreign banks will be allowed to open only 5 branches in 1997 as BIBFs in Thailand, Tharin said. Tharin said the GATT talk will seek agreement on trade issues which could not be resolved in the last meeting. He said as a representative of Thailand he will confirm the same proposals which were raised in the last GATT meeting. The minister disclosed Thailand will allow some part of the monetary market to be open to foreign banks. Tharin said Thailand will allow foreign banks to open only five branches to conduct BIBF business in the country within 1997 and will specify the commercial banks which will benefit Thailand most. Apart from that, the Finance Ministry will consider the relaxation of some regulations used for foreign commercial banks, such as the regulations for services. For instance, foreign commercial banks will be allowed to install ATMs, and given the right to form joint-ventures with Thai companies in the businesses of financial and securities companies. "I believe that we will be the one country to propose the free monetary market most at the GATT meeting in Morocco and the proposals are larger than the limitation of GATT on the issue," Tharin said.
