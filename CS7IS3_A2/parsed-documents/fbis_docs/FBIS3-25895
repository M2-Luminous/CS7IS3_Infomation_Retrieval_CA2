Ms Deng, who writes under the pen name "Mao Mao," told the Shanxi Youth newspaper she was gathering reference materials for the book and expected it to be completed within the next couple of years. It will focus on the latter half of Mr Deng's life, a period in which he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution before finally taking absolute control of the Communist Party in 1976. Ms Deng described her father's later years as "the brightest and most glorious chapter" in his life. The first volume, published last August, has already reportedly sold more than 20 million copies. Most were bought up by government offices and work units eager to show their enthusiasm for China's "chief architect of reform". The new biography would rely to a greater extent on Ms Deng's personal experience rather than historical documents and the memories of her parents which formed the basis of the first volume, she said. "I know a lot more and have a greater understanding of the second half of father's life," Ms Deng, who was born in 1950 when her father was 46, told the newspaper. However, it is unclear just how much detail about the factional intrigues which led to the downfall of her father in the Cultural Revolution Ms Deng will provide in her new personal account of his life. Most analysts are not expecting any major revelations in the book, rather a subtle reworking of recent history to finally establish a definitive place for Mr Deng in the annals of the Communist Party. "All this publicity about the life and works of Deng is clearly designed to shape Deng's legacy before he finally dies and thus hopefully ensure his ideas are not abandoned," a Western diplomat said.
