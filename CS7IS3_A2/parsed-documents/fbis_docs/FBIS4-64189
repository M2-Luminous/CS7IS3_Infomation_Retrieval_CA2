The incident was, according to a protocol, raised at a meeting of the Republikaner executive committee for Mittlelrhein. Some party members were concerned that the Republikaner involvement in the attack might be covered up, so they sent a protocol of the meeting with a personal explanation to Schoenhuber and the chairman of the party's federal arbitration court, Munich Judge Johann Muehlberger. During the course of a search of the federal arbitration court last Friday [22 April] in Munich, the documents were found, according to the state prosecution service. Schoenhuber's office could not be searched, because as a member of the European Parliament, the Republikaner boss enjoys parliamentary immunity. The Cologne prosecution service is now considering having his immunity lifted.
