FBIS4-52110 "dreas088_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 South Korea BAI To Start Special Inspections of Officials BAI To Start Special Inspections of Officials SK0605012494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0104 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605012494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) will conduct special examinations of government officials who have adopted an easy-going, don't-rock-the-boat attitude, it was reported Friday. A senior BAI official said the lackadaisical posture of many public servants has reached a critical point, reflected in a recent turbulence at farm and fishery wholesale markets created by implementation of a revised act on the distribution of farm and fishery products. Declaring that some government officials' easy-going attitude is blocking the administration's reform efforts, the official said the BAI has decided to take a closer look at officialdom. Critics as well as ordinary citizens are blaming the recent fiasco at farm and fishery wholesale markets on official incompetence, negligence and indifference. The markets were nearly paralyzed earlier this week when wholesalers, protesting against the new act, refused to take part in auctions, causing prices of farm and fishery products to skyrocket at the retail level. The new act, which went into effect last Sunday, bans middlemen in the distribution of farm and fishery products in order to protect producers and consumers. But in enforcing the new law, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry failed to anticipate the kind of disruption it would cause at the wholesale level and to provide an effective alternative to the existing system. The Ministry announced Wednesday it would put off implementation of the new act for six months. The BAI has already conducted a series of unannounced inspections of governmental agencies, covering a two-week period last month, in which it unearthed instances of officials neglecting their duties, the official said. The BAI plans to undertake additional examinations, he said. Specifically, in the first phase the BAI wants to find out whether some officials are needlessly sitting on proposals or documents or have rejected papers on unjustifiable grounds, the official said. In the second stage, the BAI plans to expand the inspections to cover officials suspected of neglecting their duties or not handling their jobs actively, the official said.
