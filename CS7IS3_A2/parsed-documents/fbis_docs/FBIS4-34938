As for the institutional arrangements detailed in Paragraph 2, Chapter 5 of the agreement, it is established that the commission will be made up of two government representatives, two representatives of the displaced persons, and two representatives of the donor and friendly countries and of international cooperation agencies, who will serve as advisers. The agreement indicates that the Commission will be formed within 60 days after the signing of the this agreement. To this effect, the Guatemalan Government will issue the corresponding regulatory decree. The agreement, signed before negotiations on mechanisms for the historical clarification of the past, introduces the definitions, principles, and objectives of general resettlement strategies. It also touches on guarantees for the same, the productive integration of displaced persons, development of resettled areas, international resources and cooperation, and institutional arrangements. This last issue also contemplates the creation of a fund for the implementation of the resettlement agreement. The fund will be created with international community contributions, and the UNDP [United Nations Development Program] will manage the resources allocated for each project. There is a paragraph on the security of people resettled in areas affected by the armed conflict, which recognizes the need to immediately remove all mines and explosive devices planted or left behind in these areas and for cooperation in these activities. The parties agreed to request that UNESCO draft a plan to meet the educational needs of these people and to help them get their personal identification documents in order. In conclusion, it is worth noting what the agreement stipulates on the land issue. We will seek to give greater facilities for the use of these lands to ensure their better use as established in the support, agricultural development, and other guidelines.
