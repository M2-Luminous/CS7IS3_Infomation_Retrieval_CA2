[Baena Soares] I am very pleased with the fact that I was able to be present at the OAS during a period of reaffirmation and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern world. All the governments represented at the OAS have been elected in free elections and this represents a huge difference from the situation 10 years ago. [Banales Marino] Are we entitled to say that the OAS has matured as an international organization throughout these 10 years? [Baena Soares] I believe it has improved. This organization was established in 1889. Afterward, our countries met periodically until the OAS Charter was voted on in 1948. And this may be the date when the OAS was formally established. It is not possible to say that an organization established more than 100 years ago is not mature. I would prefer to say that this was a period of reaffirmation of our organization as a mechanism for dialogue among countries in our hemisphere. [Banales Marino] At this moment and with the current OAS structure, do you believe the OAS has more mechanisms available to improve Latin America's political and social perspectives? [Baena Soares] No doubt. I believe these mechanisms involve the three reforms of the OAS Charter and the approval of such a new idea as integral development. [Banales Marino] During your tenure as OAS secretary general there were a number of crises in Latin America in which the OAS became strongly involved. In your opinion, which one was the most delicate? [Baena Soares] I believe the entire peace process in Central America represented a very significant participation effort by our organization. We are involved in various stages of a process in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Understandably, this is absolutely necessary from a humanitarian viewpoint--in the first place--and considering a country's economic interests, job openings, and the use of land. When democracy was under attack, we created a favorable atmosphere with our participation, but I am aware of the fact that the decisions to restore democracy are made by the people. It is not the OAS but the people who guarantee democracy. The inter-American community, through the OAS, may actually cooperate, assist, and create a favorable atmosphere. In Haiti, we still have problems. I am used to saying that the mere fact that there still are problems is something essential because, if you look back, 15 years ago there were people like Duvalier and Generals Nanfir and Avril. There was a different reaction, one of approval. Now there is one of rejection. Not a single American country has recognized the de facto authorities in three years. Moreover, there has always been an adverse reaction, seeking a solution. What are the roots, the profound reasons for this crisis? The links between entrepreneurs and the military are at the root of the crisis because the entrepreneurs never accepted the elections, never accepted the presence of President Aristide. And as long as we do not tackle the cause of an illness, it cannot be cured. [Banales Marino] Do you believe the embargo on Haiti, the way it is currently being implemented, represents a final solution? [Baena Soares] As long as some entrepreneurs are allowed to travel abroad, do business, and carry out transactions with their foreign accounts, we will be doing something that does not directly affect the people responsible. Therefore, I am saying that not all our organization's and its member countries' resources have been exhausted. Attempts already have been made to achieve an agreement. We already have four agreements signed. These agreements have not been respected at either the OAS or the United Nations. Therefore, solutions may not be invented. In my opinion, a military intervention does not represent a solution. We must not forget that in the past Haiti was occupied for 19 years. Duvalier's period, and not democracy, followed this occupation. The consequences of the Duvalier period still can be seen. [Banales Marino] What about Cuba? [Baena Soares] Cuba is a country that belongs to this hemisphere. The OAS is this hemisphere's international organization that may not ignore any situation prevailing in this hemisphere. We currently are experiencing many changes in the international system. There are transformations that must be taken into account. All this represents a clue for discussion of this issue. I cannot anticipate the stances to be taken by the governments, but I can actually point out that it is necessary to hold this discussion. This issue has not been included on the OAS General Assembly's agenda but it obviously is present.
