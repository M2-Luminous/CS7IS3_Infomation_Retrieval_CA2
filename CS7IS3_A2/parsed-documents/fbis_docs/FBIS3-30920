In the middle of the budget debate, we first witnessed the recall of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec, and a few days later -- the recall of Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister. Among observers and politicians were, and probably still are, people who do not rule out the possibility of a split within the coalition. Some are already counting the votes in new configurations. A return to a state of balance may turn out to be short-lasting. All this is happening seemingly before the eyes of the people. Seemingly -- because on television screens we can most often see first of all Polonezes, Mercedeses, and Lancias, in which participants of the talks arrive at various entrances; these are frequently back entrances. Sometimes we can see politicians entering a building: Either they have a not too intelligent joke to tell, or do not condescend to say anything to journalists' questions at all. Those who are criticizing their partners for not having an appropriate information policy are also acting this way. The prime minister's press secretary most often says that she has nothing to say. It all changes a little when the politicians come to the conclusion that the situation is under control to such a degree that a few general sentences can be said about the reached agreement. This is exactly what happened yesterday night. The preparations for the meeting at Parkowa Street were made in strict secrecy. Journalists and photo reporters were constantly misled by all possible methods. Especially at important moments, politicians have the right, and maybe the duty as well, to hold talks quietly, without any microphones and camera lenses. It is more than certain that appropriate services would be able to organize such a meeting of the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and Polish Peasant Party. However, if the prime minister -- the chairman of the greatest Deputies' Club, the Sejm speaker, and a few other politicians do not want to take advantage of such a possibility, then it is their duty to the public to issue information about such negotiations. No matter what the result is. Otherwise, no one should be surprised at the reluctant attitude of the mass media toward the authorities.
