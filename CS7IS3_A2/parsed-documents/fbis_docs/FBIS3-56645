According to Shevardnadze's press service, there are 104 such apartments, most of which have been seized by Georgian military officers, who threaten to use arms if any attempt is made to evict them. A source in the press center of Russia's Armed Forces Group in the Transcaucasus told Interfax this was the first time the Georgian authorities had taken up the matter. If Shevardnadze's orders to give back the apartments were ignored, relations between Russian and Georgian troops could deteriorate, the source said.
