This was set forth at the meeting on improving investment environment held by the provincial government on 24 March. As introduced, since the commencement of reform and opening up, the province has made great progress in building investment environment. The province has renovated and built Dalian and Shenyang international airports, rebuilt Dandong, Jinzhou, and Anshan airports, expanded Dalian port, and newly built Yingkou, Dandong, and Jinzhou ports. Shenyang-Dalian Expressway has closely combined the port city group with the central city group, with Shenyang as the center. Over the past two years, the province has again added a number of port berths and small wharves, has developed the roll-on ship service, and has newly opened the Shenyang-Irkutsk, Shenyang-Hong Kong, and Dalian-Tokyo air routes, with the total number of air routes reaching 68, and with the number of cities linked by these air routes reaching 33. The province has also newly added 400,000 lines of telephone switchboards, with the total installed capacity reaching 1 million lines. Most cities and counties in the province have been furnished with international direct dialing facilities. A total of 21 development zones of various kinds have been approved in the province, with a total planned acreage of 407 square kilometers. A total of 1,486 foreign-funded enterprises have entered these development zones, and $5.27 billion in foreign capital has been utilized. Last year, breakthroughs were made in bonded areas, foreign-invested banks, and large-scale land development. It is revealed that compared to tangible investment environment, the intangible investment environment has dropped in quality over the past several years, thus provoking much complaints among foreign traders. For instance, some of our departments have handled the contradictions emerging in reform only from the angle of their own departments instead of considering the overall situation of reform, thus giving rise to the phenomenon that too many checkpoints are set, too many interferences are imposed, one project is approved by many places, and a contract is transferred among many departments. Lagging behind in management and service, tangible environment has been unable to exploit its due role. Some hotels and inns experiencing power and water failure have not adopted remedy measures, thus making foreign traders unable to have a bath at night and wash their face in the morning. Although furnished with good installations, some of our airports lack emergency measures and are poor at meeting emergency under special cases. At the same time, our custom situation and our board and lodging situation are unable to satisfy foreign traders, and our urban public hygiene environment has become worse and worse. To further improve investment environment, the provincial government has defined six construction targets, namely, "efficient working functions, scientific management norm, quality service, beautiful urban environment, fine social order, and excellent moral practice." In addition, corresponding measures have been adopted for this work in a bid to achieve results within this year and to embark on a new stage in three years.
