FR940816-1-00020 FR940816-1-00007 IV. Serious Area SIP Requirements The Act requires States to submit several SIP revisions, as necessary, providing for implementation of increasingly stringent control measures and demonstrating when those control measures will bring about attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. The first SIP revision was due November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. For areas redesignated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 in the future under section 107(d)(3), the first SIP revision will be due within 18 months after the area is redesignated (see section 189(a)(2)). This SIP revision must, among other things, provide for implementation of RACM on sources in the area (see sections 189(a)(1)(C) and 172(c)(1)). All available technologically and economically feasible control measures would be considered RACM, and therefore reasonable for adoption, for areas that cannot attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 1994 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas) (see 57 FR 13544). 9 9 Note that if it can be shown that measures are unreasonable because emissions from the sources affected are insignificant or de minimis, such measures may be excluded from consideration as they would not represent RACM for that area (see 57 FR 13540). Moreover, in international border areas, measures which go beyond those which the SIP demonstrates would be adequate to attain and maintain the standard, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., would not be considered ``reasonably'' available_and therefore would not be required by RACM_since they would not advance the attainment date (although States may elect to implement such measures in order to reduce the public's exposure to PM&hyph;10) (see discussion under International Border Areas of this guidance document). If EPA determines that a moderate area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date (or determines the area has failed to attain) and reclassifies the area as a serious nonattainment area under section 188(b), a second SIP revision for the area is required under section 189(b). This revision must, among other things, include provisions to assure that BACM (including BACT) will be implemented in the area (see section 189(b)(1)(B)). In addition, a demonstration (including air quality modeling) must be submitted showing that the plan will attain the NAAQS either by the applicable attainment date or, if an extension is granted under section 188(e), by the most expeditious alternative date practicable (see section 189(b)(1)(A)). The SIP revisions to require the implementation of BACM must be submitted to EPA within 18 months after an area is reclassified as serious (see section 189(b)(2)). The BACM are to be implemented no later than 4 years after an area is reclassified (see section 189(b)(1)(B)). The EPA's policies regarding the requirement to implement BACM in serious areas are discussed in section VI of this document. The serious area attainment demonstration required under section 189(b)(1)(A) must be submitted to EPA within 4 years after an area is reclassified based on a determination by EPA that the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory deadline for moderate areas. It is due within 18 months after an area is reclassified for actually having failed to attain the NAAQS by the moderate area attainment date (see section 189(b)(2)). The new attainment date for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious is to be as expeditious as practicable but not later than December 31, 2001. For areas that are designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 in the future and subsequently become serious, the attainment date is to be as expeditious as practicable but no later than the end of the tenth calendar year beginning after the area's designation as nonattainment (see section 188(c)(2)). If the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of EPA that attainment by the statutory deadline for serious areas (as set forth in section 188(c) of the Act) is impracticable, the State must demonstrate that the SIP provides for attainment by the most expeditious alternative date practicable. The State may apply to EPA for a single extension of the serious area attainment date, under section 188(e) of the Act, not to exceed 5 years beyond the serious area attainment date. A State requesting an extension under section 188(e) for an area must, among other things, demonstrate that the plan for the area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can feasibly be implemented in the area. The EPA intends to issue guidance in the future, as appropriate, on applying for an extension of the serious area attainment date. If a serious area fails to attain by the applicable attainment date (which may be an extended attainment date), another SIP revision is required within 12 months that provides for attainment and until then for annual reductions in PM&hyph;10 or PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions within the area of not less than 5 percent of the amount of such emissions as reported in the most recent emission inventory for the area (see section 189(d)). In addition to the specific PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements contained in subpart 4 of part D, title I, States containing serious areas must meet all of the applicable general SIP requirements set forth in section 110(a)(2) and the nonattainment area SIP requirements set forth in subpart 1 of part D, title I, to the extent that these provisions are not otherwise subsumed by, or integrally related to, the more specific PM&hyph;10 requirements. 10 The general SIP requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas are discussed in the General Preamble at 57 FR 13556&hyph;13557. 10 See 57 FR 13538 (April 16, 1992). The requirements specifically applicable to serious areas under subpart 4 are found primarily in section 189. Those requirements include:
