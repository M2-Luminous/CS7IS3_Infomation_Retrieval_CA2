Rapin, secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, had an interview with the KCNA correspondent in Moscow on June 20 on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the start of work by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. A.A. Rapin stressed: Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man of the world, is a symbol of all the people who are against the scheme to establish international order under the manipulation of the U.S. imperialists, a beacon of mankind and an emblem of the international anti-imperialist struggle. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's start of work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 30 years ago was a historical event of epochal significance in strengthening and development of the WPK and in the development of the Korean revolution. The WPK has made a distinguished contribution to the development on the international communist movement. A clear example is that the WPK proposed to adopt the "Pyongyang declaration" signed by more than 210 communist and workers' parties and revolutionary and progressive parties of the world. The "Pyongyang declaration" is a banner of struggle and victory which gives hope to human beings and arouses them to a new struggle. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made a great contribution to the development of the international communist movement by publishing many famous works including "The historical lesson in building socialism and the general line of our party," "On the fundamentals of revolutionary party building" and "Abuses of socialism are intolerable." His works solemnly declared that although socialism was frustrated in the Soviet Union and some other countries, it would not change the desire of the world people for their liberation. Works of Comrade Kim Chong-il were a powerful ideological weapon which practically dealt a fatal blow at the bourgeois propaganda campaign of the world. Comrade Kim Chong-il, marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is an outstanding military strategist and an ever-victorious, iron-willed brilliant commander. It is not accidental that the DPRK is fully ready to make a decisive counter-attack on the imperialist adventurers under the outstanding guidance of Comrade Marshal Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean Peoples' Army, at the most difficult time when the U.S. imperialists are scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK, a small country. The imperialists dare not pounce upon the DPRK because of the iron will and unrivalled grit of Comrade Kim Chong-il. We will actively propagandize achievements of the DPRK, the wisdom of the guidance of the Korean leadership in particular.
