Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the People's Bank of China, said yesterday that Shanghai's financial circles must quicken its tempo in deepening the reform of the financial system. He expressed his views on Shanghai's financial reform for the next year. Mao Yingliang was interviewed yesterday right after he attended the class for leading cadres in Shanghai to study Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Through the study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the cadres in Shanghai's financial circles have deepened their understanding of the remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping who said: "When a single move of chess is lively, the whole game of chess becomes lively. This applies to the financial affairs" and "Shanghai has gained international standing in financial affairs. First of all, we must rely on Shanghai." Meanwhile, remarkable achievements have been attained in implementing the measures laid down by the central authorities on exercising macroeconomic control. All this has provided Shanghai with conditions to deepen Shanghai's financial reform in ideology and in practice. First of all, Mao Yingliang analyzed the current financial situation in Shanghai. He pointed out that after exercising the macroeconomic control, Shanghai's financial order in Shanghai has been stabilized and its business operation becomes normal. The amount of bank deposits and loans is increasing on a large scale. The financial market remains active and opens wider to the outside world. All this supports the sustained, rapid and healthy development of Shanghai's economy. By the end of November, the total amount of deposits of all types in Shanghai was increased by 33.8 billion yuan over that in the same period at the end of the last year, marking a growth of 9.08 billion yuan as compared with that in the corresponding period in the previous year. There is a regular increase of saving deposits. As compared with the end of the last year, the amount of savings deposits rose by 13.5 billion yuan, more than 90 percent of which were fixed-term deposits. The amount of deposits from government enterprises also sharply rose. With the amount of deposits increasing, there is a steady rate of growth in loans. The funds are being used on all major construction projects in support of the economic development in Shanghai. Various specialized banks turn over 9.8 percent of their deposits to the central bank as reserve requirements, 4 percent more than that before the macro-economic control and higher than what they are required to do. The financial market is unprecedentedly active. The annual volume of business on the security market is expected to reach 500 billion yuan; the total amount of foreign exchange that change hands on the swap market may exceed U.S.$4 billion; and the total amount of inter-bank loans will reach 210 billion yuan. The balance of inter-bank exchange remains normal, the rate on the swap market is basically stable, and the situation in the returns of money is fine. Mao Yingliang believed that the measures adopted by the central authorities in exercising the macroeconomic control has brought stability and prosperity to Shanghai's financial circles and created a good environment for further deepening the financial reform for the next year. On the financial reform for the next year, Mao Yingliang put forward the following seven tasks on the basis of the principle of emancipating our thinking and seeking truth from facts: 1. We must introduce the market mechanism to energetically cultivate and develop the financial market. Foreign exchange, money, securities and gold markets should be further expanded and developed. Efforts must be made in establishing the center for foreign exchange of China. This center located at No 15 Bund in Shanghai is now under construction. It is expected to go into operation in early 1994. This is a large, nation-wide market. It is necessary to make use of this market to form a national unified foreign exchange market and a nation-wide system for a unified foreign exchange rate. Meanwhile, it is essential to unify foreign exchange rates in coordination with the reform in foreign exchange system and to lay a foundation for the internationalization of our currencies. Efforts must be made to improve the money markets including the short-term national bonds market, the inter-bank loan market and the discount market; and exercise macro-economic control with open market operations. It is essential to further improve the securities market and enterprise management system, and optimize the allocation of resources. Currently, the Shanghai securities market has basically become the national business center in this connection. During the next year, it will further expand business and promote standardization. Efforts should be made to build a gold market according to international standards. During the last year, more than 10 tons of gold jewelry were sold in Shanghai. The sale of such gold jewelry is expected to exceed 20 tons this year. We must study how to increase transactions in gold bullions and gold certificates. 2. We must truly turn state commercial banks into ones which operate like modern commercial banks. First, efforts must be made to help specialized banks separate the existing policy-lending business from commercial lending business and engage in the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and in management of risks. They must be helped to develop a mechanism of assuming responsibilities for their own business management, their own risks, profits and losses, and in restraining and developing themselves. It is imperative to help the existing commercial banks develop a mechanism to operate like genuine commercial banks. They must be allowed to compete, and their businesses be permitted to overlap with one another. 3. We must actively and steadily develop the system of cooperative banks and establish rural and urban cooperative banks. Urban cooperative banks must be established on the basis of the 99 existing urban credit cooperatives. They should serve the small- and medium-sized enterprises and render regional economic services. Urban cooperative banks should operate at the grassroots and the city level. All of them enjoy their status as independent legal persons. Rural cooperative banks should be established on the basis of existing rural credit cooperatives. State commercial banks may hold shares of rural cooperative banks, but may not change the latter's characteristics in cooperating with each other on a collective basis. 4. It is necessary to open wider to the outside world in financial affairs, and welcome more foreign-funded banks to open up their branches in Shanghai. We hope that the number of branches of foreign banks will reach 50 in 1995. Foreign-funded banks are welcome to move their regional head offices or their head offices in China to Shanghai. We must strive to carry out experiments in allowing a limited number of foreign-funded financial institutions to do business in renminbi. 5. It is imperative to popularize the use of computers in financial operations. During the next year, we must set up a credit card network and use computers for local check clearance. 6. We must blaze new trails in improving ways in handling financial affairs including business in offshore financing, mortgage loans, and others. It is necessary to develop real estate financing business in close connection with housing reform. 7. We must strengthen the macroeconomic control in financial affairs. The central bank must strengthen its financial supervision and auditing and further standardize the procedure in handling financial affairs. Particular efforts must be made to change from direct control to effective indirect control by improving the market mechanism.
