FBIS4-4567 "dreas064__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-064-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Ryukyu Asahi TV Licensed To Operate in Okinawa Ryukyu Asahi TV Licensed To Operate in Okinawa OW0104131994 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 1 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0104131994 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Tokyo -- On 31 March, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] called on the Frequency Control Council (chairman: Masaki Ikuta) for advice, asking whether a preliminary license for operating a television station should be granted to Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (which is being formed by Takashi Higa, representative organizer and adviser to OKINAWA TIMES). The council positively responded to the inquiry the same day. The preliminary license is a de facto approval to begin service. Because of this, full-fledged activities, including establishment of the company itself and construction of the station building, will take place for the establishment of the third private television station in Okinawa. It is expected that the station will start its service in October 1995. Since Ryukyu Asahi plans to establish cooperative ties with the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation (RBC), which is an exisiting operational station, attention is focused on the possibility that two channels will be given to one company. As for granting a preliminary license to Southwest Broadcasting Corporation (representative organizer: Hidenobu Goya, chairman of the Kanehide Group), the MOPT did not ask the council for advice this time. Following the MOPT's decision in July last year to allocate two additional channels to Okinawa, Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation, which is affiliated with Television Asahi, and the Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, which is scheduled to receive television programs from Nippon Television Network Corporation, applied for a preliminary license. Of the two, the application of Ryukyu Asahi was approved and the Frequency Control Council, which is an advisory organization to the MOPT, advised the ministry to grant a preliminary license. According to the preliminary license, Ryukyu Asahi's call name is QAB and will use channel 28. Its transmitting station and main station will be constructed in Kakazu, Tomishiro-son, and Kumoji, Naha, respectively. Construction of the stations will be completed on 6 October 1995. Moreover, the total amount of its capital is 700 million yen. Its investors are Asahi National Broadcasting Co., ASAHI SHIMBUN, RBC and 10 local companies. Takashi Higa, representative organizer, is scheduled to become president of the new station. Ryukyu Asahi will use seven relay stations to transmit its programs. Because of this, 87.2 percent of all households -- almost the entire area of Okinawa -- will be covered. Miyako and Yaeyama [islands] will not be included in the coverage area for the time being. The preliminary license will be issued on 6 April. Ryukyu Asahi plans to establish a company in May. After that, Ryukyu Asahi will start to construct its office building, order equipment, and compile programs to prepare for its grand opening. According to a plan, Ryukyu Asahi will have its office in the building of RBC, which will also dispatch its capable members to Ryukyu Asahi. As for Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, the MOPT decided not to query the council this time regarding issuance of a preliminary license, saying: "We are still screening its application." The Nippon Television Network Corporation explains: "It is difficult to take action because the situation regarding the television business is still severe. No progress has been made at the site."
