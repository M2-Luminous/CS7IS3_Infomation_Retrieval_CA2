Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and concurrently foreign minister, was invited to answer questions raised by Chinese and foreign correspondents on the portion of Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" regarding the active promotion of the motherland's peaceful reunification and China's diplomatic work. [XINHUA correspondent] Two days ago U.S. President Clinton expressed disappointment at the outcome of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China. What are your views on this? How do you assess the chances of the United States extending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status? [Qian] I am somewhat disappointed at Secretary of State Christopher's visit because we were hoping to achieve more results. The visit produced some agreements and results, but not as many as had been anticipated. In addition, I am of the opinion that if China's MFN status is maintained, it would be good for both China and the United States; if it is revoked, it would be bad for both countries. [EUROPE TIMES correspondent] The French prime minister will soon visit China. How do you view the prospects for Sino-French relations? [Qian] The Sino-French Joint Communique released on 12 January of this year proclaimed the normalization of Sino-French relations, with the French Government promising not to approve participation by French enterprises in arming Taiwan in the future; its purpose is plain. Thereafter, I paid an official visit to France, one of the purposes of my visit being to prepare for Prime Minister Balladur's visit to China. I believe Prime Minister Balladur's visit is a major event in Sino-French relations and will have an important effect on promoting the development of Sino-French relations, including economic relations and trade. The visit will take place in early April. [LIEN HO PAO correspondent] You raised the possibility a few days ago during a meeting with the Taiwan delegation to the NPC of signing a cross-Strait investment protection agreement. What kind of an agreement will probably be signed? [Qian] The "Law on Protecting Investments by Taiwan Compatriots" formulated by the NPC Standing Committee is beneficial to granting legal protection to Taiwan compatriots' investments and to promoting cross-Strait economic cooperation; it is more comprehensive and authoritative than relevant regulations in the past. We cannot exclude the possibility of nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait signing investment protection agreements in the future. However, conditions are not ripe yet. The most important reason is that two-way exchanges have yet to be realized. [Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited correspondent] The U.S. secretary of state said both sides had narrowed their differences following his meeting with you. Do you agree? Also, when will you meet the British foreign secretary again on the Hong Kong issue? [Qian] I think the two sides may not necessarily have narrowed their difference in their fundamental viewpoints on the human rights issue. However, we did reach some concensus on the concrete measures for dealing with this matter, and this can be characterized as a narrowing of our difference. As to whether the Chinese and British foreign ministers will meet, I do not think it is possible now. Opportunities do exist in the future, at least at a time when the UN General Assembly meets. [DPA correspondent] Why are you disappointed at the outcome of Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China? [Qian] Both sides held the meetings according to the invitation I extended during our meeting in Paris on 24 January. In mid-February, he wrote me a letter in which he indicated his plans to visit China in mid-March. I concurred, hoping the visit would produce an agreement that was conductive to further developing the relations of the two countries. However, some things happened prior to the secretary of state's visit to China, and these disappointed us [hen shi wang 1771 1136 2598]. The occurrence of these things at least shows that the United States is not sincere enough [cheng yi bu gou 6134 1942 0008 1124] about the visit. [LIANHE ZAOBAO correspondent] In his "Government Work Report," Premier Li Peng said China does not seek hegemony at present and will not do so when it has become economically developed in the future. China's national defense expenditure will total 52.04 billion yuan this year. What percentage is this of China's gross national product [GNP]? China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan last year, and the budget for 1994 is 52 billion yuan. On the surface, the figure has somewhat increased; but in real terms, the increase is to offset inflation. As is known to all, inflation in 1993 hit 13 percent; and this year it is expected to reach 10 percent. Hence, the military expenditure actually has not gone up. In 1994, military expenditures account for 11 percent of the state budget, a proportion which has remained largely unchanged; and military spending accounts for less than 1.7 percent of China's GNP, which actually represents a slight drop. Converting the defense budget into U.S. dollars, there is no change in the level of China's military spending. Compared with the military spendings of other countries, China's military spending is a pittance, and it is out of proportion with the U.S. spending of more than $200 billion and the Japan's more than $30 billion. Therefore, China's current defense budget explains exactly that China is trying to concentrate its financial resources on developing its national economy instead of seeking to be a military power. [ANSA] If the United States does not renew the most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China, economic relations between the two countries will deteriorate. Will this also lead to a deterioration of their political relations? [Qian] I think deterioration of economic relations will surely affect deterioration of political relations, but efforts being made by both sides are just to prevent this kind of deterioration from occurring. [CNA] The fourth round of consultations between the Strait Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait will be held at the end of this month. How does the mainland assess the demand of the people on Taiwan for the Taiwan authorities to develop space? [Qian] We stand for frequent consultations between nongovernmental organizations from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to reach agreements on relevant issues. Such contacts will undoubtedly help improve cross-strait relations. However, there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China. This is the consensus of both sides of the strait, as well as a fact recognized by the international community. Therefore, if the move to "develop space" aims to develop economic relations, we can understand. But, if it aims to create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," that will harm the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and it will be detrimental to the cause of the motherland's reunification. At present, the Taiwan authorities are asserting that their "holiday-making diplomacy" is aimed at developing economic relations. This is somewhat like "no 300 taels of silver curried here" [the sign put up by the man in a folk tale over the place where he had hidden some money meaning obscuring the obvious]. There are political intentions in the "holiday-making diplomacy." We understand the wish of some countries to seek to develop economic relations with Taiwan. But the Taiwan authorities want to take advantage of such economic relations to develop the so- called "diplomatic space" in an attempt to create "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." This is a move that is not in keeping with the trend of the times and goes against the aspirations of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will soon visit China. What are China's expectations of his visit? [Qian] China and Japan are close neighbors and the leaders of the two countries often exchange visits. Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan was a great success. Now Chinese leaders are looking forward to Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit. I believe the visit will play an important role in further developing Sino-Japanese relations and cooperation in economic fields. During the visit, China and Japan will sign an agreement on strengthening cooperation in environmental protection. [AP] You have just mentioned that efforts are being made between China and the United States to avoid deterioration of relations. What efforts will China make to this end? Will the Chinese foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state meet again? [Qian] The two sides did not discuss whether to meet again. But both sides agreed to maintain contacts. What China or the United States intends to do will be decided by the country itself. We have no intention to interfere with internal affairs of the United States, and it should also not interfere with China's internal affairs. [CHINA DAILY] Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei made a trip to South Africa not long ago. What are the prospects of diplomatic relations between China and South Africa? [Qian] China and South Africa have had some contacts. They have nongovernmental organizations stationed in each other's country. South Africa is preparing for an election in April, which is to elect a new democratic government that abandons the policy of apartheid. Establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries is not possible before that. The formal diplomatic links between China and South Africa will certainly be put on the agenda after the general election in South Africa. [SING PAO DAILY NEWS] The prime ministers and foreign ministers of both China and Britain have agreed that the work of the Joint Liaison Group [JLP] should be sped up. However, the JLP has only made slow progress in its work. What are your views of the JLP's work in the future? Will the JLP's work have an impact on Hong Kong's stability and prosperity? [Qian] Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong 1994-95 elections have broken down, but this does not mean work of the JLP will suspend. The JLP should continue its work and negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing, too. In my view, both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a breakdown in Sino-British talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 Hong Kong elections, China still cares about Hong Kong's economy and the livelihood of its people and will try its best to cooperate with the British side. Whether or not cooperation can proceed smoothly depends on both the attitude and action of the British side. [REUTERS] What are your comments on the current situation in regard to the inspection of nuclear facilities in the DPRK? [Qian] China hopes that the situation on the Korean peninsula will move towards relaxation and stability and also hopes the peninsula be nuclear free. This conforms to China's interests as well as to the regional and world interests. China supports the DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States, the south, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the past, the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved some progress too. The situation can be perfectly described by this verse: "When the mountains and streams come to an end and one would think there is no path, the shady willows and bright blossoms bring him to yet another village." Now some difficulties have cropped up again. We believe that as long as all sides are patient in negotiations and do not adopt measures to complicate the situation, the negotiations will achieve important progress. [China Central Television] Someone said that whether the United States renews China's MFN trade status is not just a matter between China and the United States. It will have a worldwide impact. Do you agree? [Qian] MFN trade status is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and it is the base for normal trade for the two countries. The United States has given the MFN trade status to many other countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on. If it should happen, China and the U.S. would be the first to suffer losses, and other countries and regions will also suffer. Therefore, I hope that this will not happen. [SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST] Which conditions in President Clinton's executive order are acceptable to China, which are not? [Qian] China does not have the obligation to carry out the U.S. President's executive orders. Some of the "conditions" mentioned in the "executive order" do not constitute a problem. Take the export of prison labor products for example. Even the United States acknowledges that its prison labor products are exported to some countries. However, the United States does not want prison labor products from other countries to enter the United States. This can be solved easily. China has a big market and it is entirely possible for China not to export its prison labor products to the United States. Moreover, an agreement on this issue was signed and a statement on cooperation in implementing it has just been signed. We can say that this question has been settled. For another example, the "Jackson-Vanik" Amendment requires the United States to remove the MFN trade status of any country that does not have immigration freedom. This is not a problem as far as the Chinese are concerned. The obstacle now is that the United States often denies Chinese citizens visas on the ground of "intent to immigrate." This and similar matters may be regarded as conditions and maybe not. If you want to make a mountain out of a molehill, then they become conditions. If approached with a realistic attitude, they would not constitute a problem. We do not want to see issues played up or played down for political needs. So long as the two sides adopt a realistic attitude, these issues can be solved without much difficulty. Over 500 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the news conference.
