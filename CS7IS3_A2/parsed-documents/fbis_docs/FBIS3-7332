Chiang, minister of economic affairs of the Republic of China [ROC], Monday [28 March] called on the Vietnamese Government to allow Taiwan banks access to Vietnam. During a meeting with ranking officials of the central bank of Vietnam, Chiang said establishment of Taiwan bank operations in Vietnam is essential "to helping Taiwan investors stay and expand and consequently contribute to the economic growth of the Southeast Asian country." After accepting applications from nine foreign banks, including one from Taiwan, the Vietnamese Government froze all other applications. Chiang asked the Vietnamese officials to give special consideration to an application from another Taiwan bank -- the Medium Business Bank of Taipei -- to set up an affiliate in their country as Taiwan is the top foreign investor here. Meanwhile, a draft cooperation agreement was signed during a ceremony Sunday for the development of a sugar refining plant in Vietnam. The agreement brings together the state-run First Vietnam Sugar Co., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and three other Taiwan food processing companies. The joint venture operation, to be named Vietnam-Taiwan Sugar Corp. (VTSC), will be the biggest single investment project ever from Taiwan. The VTSC investment, with a price tag of U.S.$66 million and a projected annual production of 90,000 metric tons of crude sugar, is awaiting approval from the Legislative Yuan, Chiang said. Chiang, during a meeting with Vo Tran Chi, ruling party secretary-general of Ho Chi Minh City, pointed out that increasing land prices in Vietnam, fueled by a new land law, have led to difficulties for foreign investors, specially those from Taiwan. The greatest effect will be on a Taiwan industrial processing zone which was developed in Hanoi before the land law went into effect. Under the land law, investors who use the land must pay compensation for crops which would have been produced on the land for the next 50 years. "The investment plan may be put on hold if the problems surrounding land acquisition are not resolved," said Fang Jeng-hui, manager of the processing zone. The new land law has already scared away many potential Taiwan investors who planned to move their operations to Vietnam, Fang said. Up to January, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113 applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over U.S.$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the top forign investor here.
