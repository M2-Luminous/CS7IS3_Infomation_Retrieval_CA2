The prime minister reviewed the results of the recent visit to Jordan by Dennis Ross, the U.S. Middle East peace coordinator. Following the meeting, Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and minister of information, told the Jordanian News Agency that the prime minister explained the most important points raised during his meeting with Mr. Dennis Ross. Ross expressed his optimism about the possibility of reaching an agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides on the issue of security arrangements in Hebron, in addition to immediate steps to take measures ensuring the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. He pointed out that the Israeli side agreed to a Palestinian police force in Gaza, Jericho, and Hebron even before an agreement on the final arrangements has been reached. The minister said the prime minister noted his meeting with Ross touched on the issue of the powers that will be transferred from the Israelis to the transitional Palestinian authority in various West Bank and Gaza Strip areas, with the exception of Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, and Israeli military bases, as well as matters pertaining to expanding the scale of these powers. Al-'Anani said the cabinet reviewed discussions with the U.S. side on bilateral relations, with a clear emphasis on the methods used to inspect ships in the Red Sea by warships stationed there, most of which are American. During his meeting with Ross, al-Majali noted that recently a noticeable increase has occurred in the number of ships turned back for unacceptable excuses. Jordan strongly protested this in view of its immense negative effects on the Jordanian economy. The number of ships inspected since 1991 has reached 1,700. The international inspecting forces have not been able to find a single violation. Therefore, Jordan rejects the continuation of this method and thinks the inspection should be transferred from the Red Sea to the Port of al-'Aqabah and that inpsections should be done by a neutral, nonmilitary side. Jordan proposed this just before his majesty's recent visit to the United States. It was discussed during his majesty's visit. The American side promised to look into this matter seriously at the time. A breakthrough is expected in this issue within a short time. Al-'Anani added that the third point al-Majali put to the cabinet, and which was discussed during Mr. Ross's visit, is Jordan's emphasis on the need for practical progress in the peace process. The Israeli side has been sticking to its position, refusing to broach substantive issues, and has even resisted the implementation of agreements already reached. Without substantive progress in the near future, the peace process will be subject to great doubts. Dr. al-'Anani explained that the fourth point discussed was the return to the bilateral negotiation rounds in Washington in April. The Jordanian side had announced that the agreement to return to negotiations should be an Arab decision, particularly by the cordon states. This issue may be discussed as part of the Arab foreign ministers meetings that began today. Al-'Anani pointed to the possibility that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher may visit the region to discuss the return to the negotiation rounds in Washington and to agree on arrangements that would secure a positive development in the negotiations. The information minister said Dr. al-Majali briefed the cabinet on the fact that Ross and his delegation said a tangible and clear breakthrough will be achieved on some negotiating tracks in 1994. Dr. al-'Anani said the cabinet session touched on the campaigns external parties have begun to launch against Jordan. The cabinet quickly reviewed an Amnesty International statement that included praise of Jordan's important political developments and democratic march. This statement, however, criticized some formal restrictions mentioned in the new press and publications law and the execution of some civil criminals tried by civil Jordanian courts. The cabinet listened to an explanation of this issue, presented by the information and interior ministers. The cabinet noted that Israeli media are launching campaigns that cast doubt on the Jordanian democratic march. It is clear that this campaign has certain objectives and is in harmony with current pressures on Jordan, in order to affect Jordan's political and negotiating position. The prime minister said the constants of the Jordanian position are clear, that Jordan seeks a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace on all fronts, and that Jordan adheres to the joint agenda calling for discussion of all issues on the agenda, particularly occupied Jordanian territory, Jordan's water rights, and the refugees and displaced persons issue. The prime minister said unless satisfactory solutions to these points are reached, Jordan will not sign any peace agreement with Israel. Jordan has shown a real desire for peace since the Madrid negotiations began. Jordan's position has always supported real peace and the negotiations process. Therefore, the government rejects tendentious campaigns that cast doubt on Jordan's democracy and democratic institutions.
