Tariel Abulfaz Ogly Guseynov, President of the Azerigaz State Gas Company of the Republic, Is Our Interlocutor"] [Text] FROM OUR FILES. T. Guseynov has been working in the oil and gas industries for more than 30 years now. He began his labor activities as a fitter with the Artemeft NGDU [Oil and Gas Production Directorate]. After serving in the army, he graduated from the imeni M. Azizbekov Oil and Chemistry Institute (currently, the Oil Academy). Subsequently, he worked within various establishments for marine oil and gas production and was director of the Azerbaijan Gas Processing Plant. For seven years, he headed the Aztransgaz administration. He has been president of the Azerigaz State Gas Company since September 1992. He has a son, a daughter, a grandson, and a granddaughter. [VYSHKA] Esteemed Tariel, you are at the very apex of the pyramid of a complex and diverse economic unit which is one of the pillars of the republic's economy. This pyramid has been shaking for a long time, and the magnitude of this "fever" strikes a strong blow at our entire lives. After all, it is hard to even imagine Baku being left without the blue fuel.... [Guseynov] Let us not take too dim a view of the situation; nonetheless, this is not ruled out. It is paradoxical that one of the powerful oil and gas regions of the former Soviet empire cannot presently provide fuel for itself. The reasons for this are many. The disintegration of the uniform imperial structure for the management of the most significant, strategic sectors that had operated for decades actually paralyzed the gas sector of Azerbaijan. The established centralized system of gas distribution (even if greatly flawed) was destroyed, and this affected in a most lamentable manner the economy of not just our republic but also other states of the CIS. Emergency measures were needed to salvage the gas industry and use it as much as possible in the interest of a sovereign Azerbaijan and its people. The creation of the Azerigaz State Company by an edict of the president of the republic one and a half years ago marked the beginning of this effort, as immense as it is crucial. [VYSHKA] Pardon me, but attempts to somehow gather the gas sector under the same hand had been made in the republic before.... [Guseynov] Certainly, attempts had been made. Beginning in 1980, I had personally pushed through projects of centralizing the gas supply of the republic at the various levels of authority. However, this did not advance beyond verbal approval. Proceeding from its interests, Moscow tenaciously held all the ropes of the gas supply in its hands. The gas sector of the republic was an eternal stepchild: In some cases, it was merged with other state structures, and then they would think of something else. In a word, the sector was left without a master. Figuratively, it was tightly bound hand and foot. As a result, the structure of the distribution system is chaotic; it does not comply with international standards and, most importantly, at a great cost, which even now results in nothing but losses. Of course, one and a half years is not a period sufficient for bringing the sector to the level of effective development, even more so in view of a huge "backlog" of pent-up problems. However, is it possible to discuss any shifts at present? Of course, there have been certain changes but they are not of the essence. The main point is that our company which has succeeded in creating a unified sectoral mechanism has asserted itself. The might of Azerigaz is great: There are about 10 associations, the gas facilities of cities, main administrations of construction, two machine-building plants, the Scientific Research Institute of Gas Issues, and dozens of other auxiliary enterprises and organizations. It is very important for this huge mechanism to begin operating smoothly.... [VYSHKA] Unfortunately, this has not come about yet. At present, reports on gas deliveries are akin to messages from the front line. This is how you hear it: Turkmenistan has suspended gas deliveries to Azerbaijan; plants have stopped because of a shortage of the blue fuel; gas supply to the rayons has been turned off. [Guseynov] All of this is true. Putting it frankly, the gas delivery situation is critical. The overall need of our republic for gas comes to 16 billion cubic meters. Previously, we received 7 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia and Turkmenistan; Iran delivered another 3 billion cubic meters. At present, we obtain about 6 billion cubic meters of our Azeri gas and, in addition, we have a contract for the delivery of [number illegible] billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas on a clearing basis. Turkmenistan must deliver over 8 million cubic meters of gas. [word illegible] production toward the repayment of the debt has not been shipped from our republic so far. Only a few days ago did the government confirm quotas for the shipment of Azeri products; this has been recorded in a pertinent decree. We are now taking measures to solve the existing problem although this is not all that easy to accomplish, given that the debt for the Turkmen gas has come to 60 million of accounting dollars since the beginning of the year. [VYSHKA] Apparently, the existing situation is prompting the Azerigaz to take extreme measures. [Guseynov] Of course, there is no other way out. Gas supply for many rayons of the republic has been cut off. We deliver gas at the very limit of our potential to the enterprises and population of Baku and other large cities. At present, the most significant task is to create reserves of the blue fuel, to pump the gas received into underground storage facilities. We endured the past winter with difficulty. We should now think about the forthcoming cold season. Fuel prices are growing and by all signs the growth of costs will continue. Therefore, one can hardly count on an abrupt improvement in gas supply in the immediate future. [VYSHKA] In all of this, it should be taken into account that the still immense quantity of gas that is purchased at great expense during what is wartime to us is simply lost, and at times also stolen. At present, the issue of [lines missing in the original], strict accounting, and the prevention of all theft is as acute as ever. You will agree that in this respect, the Azerigaz itself has many shortcomings. [Guseynov] I agree. Despite the measures taken, the large loss of gas persists. Imagine that until very recently one out of four or five consumers in the republic was not registered. Rampant permissiveness and arbitrariness of individual leaders of rayons, enterprises, services, and so on have produced the background for all types of violations in the consumption of gas. In the last two years, a lot has been done to rectify the situation although I will repeat that a very great loss is still allowed to occur. We have introduced a new service within the organization of our company--the directorate of state gas supervision--which regularly examines the correctness of gas consumption. I will note that in Baku alone, recent inspections have established major violations in the consumption of gas in Sabuninskiy, Surakhanskiy, Narimanovskiy, Khatainskiy, Nasiminskiy, and other rayons. Unregistered enterprises and organizations have been discovered that have been consuming gas for a long time without paying for it. We also clarified the picture of gas consumption in the residential sector where great loss is also allowed to occur. We can say that in the republic as a whole, up to 10 percent of natural gas consumers are unregistered. Besides, the condition of many gas mains serving farms is lamentable; tremendous funds are needed to upgrade them. We are now making various efforts to reduce the loss of gas; we have tightened up monitoring in order to prevent its theft [lines missing] to create a precise system of accounting for gas. Some 300,000 household gas meters will be manufactured for us under a $14-million contract signed with Minimetals, the Chinese state company. The technology of producing these meters is also being purchased (250,000 a year), with the right to sell them to all countries for five years. Incidentally, the first 30,000 meters have already been delivered to Baku; at present, preparatory work for their installation is underway, primarily in the suburbs of the capital city. We engage in active cooperation with Israeli companies with regard to the local production of gas lines made of polyethylene. Several days ago, we had yet another meeting with representatives of the World Bank with whom we are negotiating, by decision of the government, the allocation of credit for upgrading the entire gas industry. We are developing a technical and economic feasibility study on rejuvenating the gas sector of the republic jointly with SOFREGAZ, the well-known French company. On the whole, the signing of an agreement on the extension of a large long-term loan at the level of our government and the leadership of the World Bank is scheduled for the fall of this year. [VYSHKA] All of this is good; all of this is in the future; of course, in the absence of rejuvenation industry will not be placed on a developmental path. However, what is to be done about gas, what is to be done in order not to be left without the blue fuel? [Guseynov] It should be saved, and saved again everywhere and anywhere. The government of the republic has confirmed priority measures to save natural gas. It is necessary [lines missing] to switch to the use of liquefied gas in rayons, villages, and settlements, to convert enterprises on a mandatory basis to residual fuel oil (of course, where conditions for this exist), to introduce high punitive sanctions, and to use other measures against the violators of gas consumption procedures. We should dispense once and for all with the flawed practice whereby: You provide natural gas for us, and we will settle later. Consumers owe us more than 4 billion manats, and we just cannot collect them. However, no sooner than we cut back gas delivery to a debtor, complaints are lodged with all echelons. [VYSHKA] Incidentally, recently some publications have missed no opportunity to let you have it--among others--without concealing their malice. [Guseynov] I respond to such antics by some sorry excuses for journalists calmly. Unfortunately, the pages of certain newspaper publications have become a place for slandering and abusing people, for accusations without proof against officials. We talk to such solely through the judicial system. Something else is alarming: Recently, attempts at undermining confidence in the authorities and the leaders of state structures have been growing; they are bending over backwards to promote nervousness and get in the way of actual endeavors to overcome the crisis in the national economy and the entire republic. This is why we cannot relax by any means. We should undertake to skillfully solve problems, to do everything to defeat the enemy and strengthen and develop our native independent Azerbaijan. [VYSHKA] Thank you for the interview.
