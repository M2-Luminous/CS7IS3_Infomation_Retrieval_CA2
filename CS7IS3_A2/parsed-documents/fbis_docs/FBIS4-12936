According to the sources, this will be followed by the entry of the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA], which is made up of 7,000 soldiers and officers, as a Palestinian police that will take charge of public security and prepare for the entry of the PLO apparatuses within five or six months. The sources assert that the Palestinian side emphasized a number of points during their talks with Israelis in Cairo, primarily the commitment to a specific timetable ratified by the Israeli side that links the entry of the vanguards of the Palestinian police to that of the basic force into the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinian demands involved the size and armaments of the Palestinian police and emphasized that these troops should enter with their weapons and equipment and dressed in an official uniform. The European sources said that the Palestinian side insists on the entry of the police force according to a timetable that coincides with the redeployment of the occupation troops not later than the end of April. The sources add that the Israeli side is trying to delay the entry of the Palestinian police to the period 15 May-1 July. The PLO warned against the effect such a measure may have, noting that it might create a security vacuum with moral and military repercussions, particularly since Israel is encouraging the possession of personal weapons in Gaza. The sector is witnessing a state of chaos deliberately encouraged by the Israelis with the goal of creating more problems for the Palestinian leadership before control is turned over to it. According to the sources, the Palestinian side insists on the entry of the Palestinian police with their official uniform, weapons, and equipment to create a reassuring atmosphere of dignity. Meanwhile, the Israeli side wants these troops to enter in civilian cars or buses with sealed windows, like prisoners of war or infiltrators instead of a police force returning to the homeland. The European diplomatic sources said that the Palestinian side is emphasizing the psychological side by insisting on the entry of the police force in the official uniform behind their flags in an official ceremony to win additional support for the Declaration of Principles. The sources add that the most prominent personalities that will lead the vanguards of the police force are Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police force; Major General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majaydah, deputy chief of staff of the PLA, who will be commander of the Gaza police; Major General Mahmud Yusuf, head of the PLO military department, who will be commander of Jericho police; and Brigadier General Mamduh Nawfal, who will be in charge of criminal security. According to the sources, the commanders of Palestinian troops in Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Algeria, Iraq, and Jordan have prepared lists of their personnel to prepare for leaving for Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, the sources add, the Saudi Government has undertaken to transport the Palestinian military units on its planes.
