ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) are promulgating regulations governing the filing and enforcement of labor condition applications filed by employers seeking to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations and as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability under the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant classification. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), an employer seeking to employ a nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability is required to file a labor condition application with DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) may approve an H&hyph;1B visa petition. The labor condition application process is administered by ETA; complaints and investigations regarding labor condition applications are the responsibility of ESA. The Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA) amended the INA and the IMMACT to change substantially the H&hyph;1B labor condition application program, retroactive to October 1, 1991. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 19, 1995.
