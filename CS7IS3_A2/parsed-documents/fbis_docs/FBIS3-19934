With a military parade, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) welcomed the last soldiers returning from the East African country at the Cologne/Bonn airport and officially dissolved the "Somalia Support Committee." The minister praised the Bundeswehr for the skill it showed in the Somalia operation. He stressed the "masterly military achievements" of all those involved in supporting the UN blue helmet forces. "Punctually like a German Intercity train, the German contingents were are the disposal of the United Nations in Beledweynne," the minister stated, addressing 197 soldiers who had returned aboard a Bundeswehr plane from Djibouti a little while earlier. Ruehe particularly stressed the "excellent leadership" of the Somalia unit -- of Colonels Harf and Kammerhoff. He awarded them the Federal Service Cross on behalf of the federal president. As clear as Ruehe's praise for his troops was his criticism of the shortcomings of the United Nations -- the main reason the German contingent was not able to supply a 4,500-men strong Indian brigade with water, foodstuffs, and other goods, as originally planned. Ruehe spoke of "quickly changing UN plans" and of an "apparently not optimal cooperation between Mogadishu and New York." He also pointed out that the United Nations had "no solid political concept" for the peace process in Somalia. [passage omitted]
