Yeltsin's words to the effect that henceforth Russian ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads were no longer targeted on U.S. cities were given quite a restrained welcome by the Bush administration and did not meet with any special desire on the part of the White House and the Pentagon to take an analogous step. It now comes to light, however, that the Russian military was also in no hurry to retarget the missiles -- talks on this are proceeding only now both at the highest level and directly between military chiefs. Thus, Colonel General I. Sergeyev, commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, recently met in the United States (Omaha) with Gen. L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, and with high-ranking Pentagon representatives. It is too soon to speak of the result of the talks but, according to available information, they discussed precisely the retargeting of U.S. and Russian ICBM's at deserted areas of the World Ocean. According to U.S. data, 20 such regions have already been identified. The retargeting scheme itself is not complex: The coordinates of targets in the Russian Federation and the United States which had been entered into the missiles' computer operational memory will be replaced by the coordinates of regions in the ocean. These are the main targets, while the reserve targets, also entered in the computer memory, will remain untouched. In general, the coordinates of the main targets have to be entered in the computer memory, since the possibility that the missile will fall onto the territory from which it was launched cannot be ruled out. The flight mission -- the coordinates of the main target -- can be changed in 15 minutes, so retargeting is a symbolic, diplomatic step rather than a military, operational-tactical one, and a demonstration of the significant warming of Russian-U.S. relations. At the same time there are several aspects which complicate even this, at first sight simple and understandable diplomatic maneuver. It is not clear, for example, how Ukraine, on whose territory 176 missiles with 1,240 nuclear charges are stationed, will react to this. In addition, 81 missiles (81 charges) are on the territory of Belarus and 98 missiles (980 nuclear charges) in Kazakhstan. Under interstate treaties all these silo-housed ICBM's with their nuclear multiple reentry vehicles belong to Russia, but the Ukrainian leadership is known to dissent on this question. Therefore the possibility cannot be ruled out that Kiev will once again show self-will and refuse to retarget "its" missiles (which L. Kravchuk has transferred to the jurisdiction of the 42d Missile Army of the republic's Armed Forces), offended that the talks were held without involving the Ukrainian military department. The retargeting of ground-based ICBM's will reduce the danger of their unsanctioned launch and, thus, of a nuclear war arising by accident. But similar missiles with nuclear warheads (Russia has 788 of them with 2,652 charges) will remain on submarines of both states, and there seems to be no question of retargeting these. In addition, problems of inspection arise with regard to where the missiles are actually targeted. It only remains for us to take the Pentagon at its word that henceforth Russia will not be the main target of the U.S. military, but only a reserve target. States bordering on the regions of the World Ocean at which the missiles will be retargeted and also Greenpeace will be indignant. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the retargeting of missiles at "abstract" targets will dampen the ardor of missilemen and lessen their attention -- which could lead to unsanctioned launches. The most radical option for preventing an accidental unleashing of nuclear war is to remove the nuclear warheads from the carriers and store them. Incidentally, this simple solution to the problem, proposed by Bruce Blair, a U.S. specialist in questions of nuclear weapon command and control systems at the Brookings Institution, as well as by some Russian specialists, is categorically rejected by both Washington and Moscow. The fact that, apart from the United States and Russia, which have "become friends," other nuclear states exist in the world, and the policies of some of these inspire real fear, serves as a weighty argument.
