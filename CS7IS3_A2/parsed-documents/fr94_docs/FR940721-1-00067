FR940721-1-00067 FR940721-1-00014 (vii) Is the definition of a qualified CLO sufficiently flexible, considering the nature of this emerging industry and the Secretary's consumer protection objectives? (viii) Are the requirements concerning lender-neutrality and the selection of lenders on a qualified CLO reasonable? (ix) Is the minimum number of lenders on a qualified CLO (i.e., 20) practical from an operational perspective? Is it sufficient to ensure competition? (If another number is suggested, please explain why this number would be superior in promoting competition and the consumers' interests?) (x) Is the requirement that all disclosures be made before performance of CLO services reasonable? (xi) What will be the impact of the requirement that any borrower payments must be made outside of and before closing? (xii) Does the requirement that qualified CLOs must provide the borrower with certain information about loans generally available; collect information about the borrower, the property, and the loan sought; and provide the borrower with information about loan products available to that borrower accomplish the intended objective of ensuring that a meaningful service is provided? The Department anticipates that the Technology Demonstration that it plans to conduct (see Section I of this preamble) will also be a useful vehicle for developing answers to some of these questions. (3) Issue 3: Preemption of State Laws or Regulations In ยง3500.13(b)(2), the November 2, 1992, final rule provided that ``in determining whether provisions of State law or regulations concerning controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary may not construe those provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as inconsistent with RESPA so long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' In connection with the preemption issue, the Department's July 6, 1993, notice requested comments on establishing standards to be used in evaluating whether provisions in State laws provide greater protection to consumers. The Department also invited any other comment relative to the preemption provision of the 1992 final rule. (a) Positions Taken by Commenters Critical of the Rule's Preemption Policy. While the Department received hundreds of comments addressing the preemption question, this issue attracted fewer expressions of opinion than did the other three issues raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most of the commenters addressing the issue (excluding identical-form responses) were attorneys or major institutional commenters. However, even among the comments from organizations representing institutional interests or segments of the real estate and real estate finance industries, preemption was the least-frequently addressed of the four issues. Commenters who were critical of other aspects of the rule had a mixed approach to the preemption issue and reflected suspicion of the Department's motives. These comments assumed that, despite the benign phrasing of ยง3500.13(b)(2), HUD would (in light of the other features of the 1992 final rule) use preemption in the future to weaken State-initiated regulation of controlled business arrangements. Those commenters who shared this suspicion varied in their recommendations for improvement of the rule's preemption feature. Several commenters advised HUD to provide ``greater clarity'' regarding a State's right to ban or closely regulate controlled business arrangements. Other commenters referenced particular existing State laws that require controlled business entities to seek a substantial portion of their business from sources other than their affiliated entities. These commenters urged that HUD provide explicitly that State laws and regulations of this type would not be subject to preemption.
