According to the deputy director, there are 2,292 financial institutions engaging in foreign exchange businesses at present across the country, of which 2,042 are domestically funded, 90 are foreign funded or Sino-foreign joint ventures. The total foreign exchange assets are put at U.S.$230 billion. The foreign exchange market in the country mainly includes two parts. One is the foreign exchange swap market with over 100 foreign exchange centres of various kinds offering services to enterprises and individuals for foreign exchange trading. The transaction value of foreign exchange in recent years was about U.S.$25 billion. Another part is the securities market for capital raising. Chinese enterprises have, since 1991, issued "B" shares for overseas investors. At present, some 30 kinds of "B" shares have been listed in the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges with over U.S.$1 billion of foreign exchange capital raised. Mr Song said that several medium and large state-owned enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year and, at the same time, China also raised foreign capital by issuing bonds in foreign countries including Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Luxembourg, and the United States. In addition, China's foreign exchange capital market and futures market are improving. Mr Song was convinced that with the sustained and rapid economic growth and the further opening to the outside world, the unified foreign exchange trading market for inter-bank businesses opened last April, replacing the foreign exchange swap markets. [sentence as received] Such a unified market will greatly speed up the circulation of foreign exchange capital and increase the market supply and demand, which will promote the development of the foreign exchange market across the country.
