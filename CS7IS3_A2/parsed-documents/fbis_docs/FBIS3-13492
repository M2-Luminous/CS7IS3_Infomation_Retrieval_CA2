[passage omitted] The question is: Are these measures considered political? ['Urayqat] First, the Israeli measures have not risen to the required levels. [passage omitted] The issue is extremely sensitive. There must be international protection for the Palestinian people. Israel cannot be entrusted with the security of the Palestinians, especially as the Israeli army killed more people after the massacre than fell in the terrorist operation in Hebron. Second, with regard to the decision to outlaw the Kakh and Kahana Hay Organizations, the Israeli Government adopted a decision in 1988 banning political activity by Kakh and preventing it from taking part in political elections. What's new? Before leaving for the United States, did Rabin want to send a message to the U.S. public to say that something was done? This is the peak of Israeli indifference, particularly, as I have said, as the Kakh Organization has been banned from exercising any political activity from the start. [Al-Jundi] Since you referred to Rabin's visit to the United States, permit me to ask you: Did Rabin intend, by these recent measures, to address a message to the United States and U.S. President Bill Clinton to avoid pressure by the U.S. Administration? ['Urayqat] This is possible. But we must remember that the United States has been trying from the first day of the massacre to extricate Israel from its predicament. For example, the first decision made by Washington was procedural, that is, to transfer the negotiations from Cairo to Washington. The decision disregarded the substance. The negotiations in Cairo took place under Egyptian Government auspices on the highest level. There was very strong, positive Egyptian intervention in these negotiations. The United States has not intervened since the Madrid conference in any of the negotiating tracks. The second attempt to limit the damage has been the enormous pressure we have been facing as the Palestinian people and leadership at the UN Security Council. Everyone knows this and it is tantamount to extortion. With these measures, which have not risen to the required level of seriousness, Rabin wanted to ameliorate world public opinion and convince it that he is adopting measures. [passage omitted] As we see on our streets and in our neighborhoods, the settlers move around with their weapons and provoke the people. Curfews are imposed on the victims. What we want to say is that the Israeli Government measures are ridiculous. They are surprising. They cast suspicion on Israel's credibility and desire for peace. We have told Israel from the beginning that the settlements are a time bomb. Israel said it will guarantee that no settler will carry out operations against the Palestinian people. After the terrorist operation in Hebron, who will guarantee that no new crime will take place in a mosque, church, field, university, or hospital? We must consider these issues, because we don't want to turn the occupied Palestinian territories into a new Bosnia in 10 years. [Al-Jundi] Can we say that the Palestinian negotiating strategy will take a new course, especially with regard to the removal of the settlements, because they constitute hotbeds of tension and time bombs in the occupied territory? ['Urayqat] The negotiations are not an end in and of themselves. Nor is their resumption. The issue is the substance of the negotiations. After the massacre, we are saying that any negotiations that do not have the settlements issue on their agenda will be useless and will complicate things. [passage omitted] We are saying that the negotiations cannot proceed as they did before the massacre. What we fear is that Rabin wants to reorganize the occupation. The peace process was based on the principle of land for peace and on Resolution 242, which stipulated in its preamble that the occupation of others' territories by force is impermissible. The time has come, not only for a Palestinian, but also for an Arab stance, that is, a stance by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the PLO, one that is directly concerned with the peace process. There is a need to convene a summit meeting and I call on the Egyptian Government to sponsor such an initiative and convene a meeting in Cairo to discuss the overall peace process in light of recent developments. It is unreasonable for this massacre to pass as if nothing had happened and for life to return to normal as a result of U.S. pressure and Israeli intransigence. [Al-Jundi] Arab brothers, we thank our guest Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Dr. 'Urayqat, thank you very much and happy holiday. ['Urayqat] Thank you. A happy holiday to all.
