March machinery orders, excluding volatile orders for ships and from electric power firms, came to 946.8 billion yen, after falling a month-on-month 6.3 percent in February. On a year-on-year basis, the figure marks a 0.2 percent dip, compared with an 8.9 percent yearly drop reported the previous month. Private machinery orders are regarded as the key indicator of corporate investment in plant and equipment for the months ahead. An EPA official said the March figure underscores that the downward cycle in machinery orders is coming to completion. Thanks to the boost in March orders, orders for the January-March quarter marked a 6.6 percent increase from the previous three-month period, which is far above the government's target of a 9.6 percent decline. The official, however, quickly added the agency wants to keep a close watch on the data for the time being rather than making its own prediction on machinery orders in the coming months. His caution apparently reflects poor forecasts for the April-June period simultaneously released, which projected a 13.0 percent plunge in private machinery orders excluding volatile ones. He said the forecast, based on the agency's hearings conducted in late March on 280 firms, seems partly dampened by a negative reaction to the buoyant results in the January-March quarter. In the latest reporting month, private orders including those for ships and from power firms, at 1,158.6 billion yen, were flat from February and down 5.1 percent from the year before. Orders from the public sector totaled 334.3 billion yen, a 25.3 percent surge from the prior month and up 6.4 percent from a year earlier. Foreigners placed orders totaling 542.4 billion yen, also up a steep 24.2 percent from February and an 8.8 percent rise from the same month last year. All included, overall machinery orders in March amounted to 2,231.6 billion yen, 9.1 percent larger than February and 0.2 percent more than a year earlier, the agency said. The EPA also said private machinery orders, free of volatile factors, for fiscal 1993 which ended March 31 totaled 10,568.4 billion yen, down 9.4 percent from the previous year. Overall orders also dropped 3.3 percent to 24,679.8 billion yen for the third straight year of decline, but the EPA official noted the fall was less sharp than a 9.8 percent drop the previous year.
