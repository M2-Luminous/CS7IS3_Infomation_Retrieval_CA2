The slump in wheat quotations resulting from this move has caused Argentine producers to lose $180 million. Felipe Sola, the agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary, met with his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale for one of the most complicated negotiations of President Carlos Menem's state visit to Canada, which is taking place without other problems. The issue is complex. Beside the losses incurred, Argentine authorities know the expected stabilization of the Brazilian economy would reverberate on the market, causing quotations to tumble even further. The diplomatic side of the issue adds its share of complexity. Indeed, Argentina must try to convince Canada to review its actions and, at the same time, prevent Brazil from getting annoyed over the resulting increase in the prices of their imports. The Argentine Government needs the support of Brazil, one of the beneficiaries of the deal in question, in this issue since one of the possible legal battles will probably be fought within the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] agreements. The other front would be GATT. Nevertheless, Argentine negotiators have an advantage over their Canadian counterparts. By Canadian standards, to be accused of dumping is a very serious insult. Canadian officials are therefore willing to go overboard to prevent such an awe-inspiring "stigma." Canadians are proud of their fair-play in trade -- even though Argentina sometimes disagrees. They boast that "the United States has on several occasions charged us with unfair competition practices, but could never prove our guilt." The Argentine decision could be the acid test of incipient Mercosur mechanisms, prompted by the fact that Canadian trade practices triggered a drop of at least $20 per tonne of wheat. One may wonder how much of the $180 million can be recovered by Argentina as a result of these negotiations. So far, considering that there are three parties involved, most estimates do not exceed 30 percent while others go a bit further.
