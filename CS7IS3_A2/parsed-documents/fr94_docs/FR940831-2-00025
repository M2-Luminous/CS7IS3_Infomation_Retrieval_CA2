FR940831-2-00025 FR940831-2-00019 EERE&hyph;Denver Regional Support Office Financial Assistance Award; Intent to Award Grant to the State of Utah AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7, that it intends to award a grant based on a noncompetitive determination to the State of Utah to support the activities of the Region VIII Weatherization Managers Association in the amount of $325,000. The State of Utah is the sponsor of the Weatherization Managers Association which is an organization comprised of representatives from each of the six states in the region: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed financial assistance to the State of Utah for the Weatherization Managers Association will assist the six states' Weatherization Assistance Programs by supporting and stimulating technical development activities which improve the depth of knowledge and the caliber of technical skills of the regional Weatherization grantees and subgrantees. The project's objectives are to facilitate technical assistance activities identified by the Weatherization Managers Association which benefit all of the state programs in the region. The proposed project meets the criteria of 10 CFR Part 600.7 (b)(2)(i) (B) and (D) in that the activity would be conducted by the Weatherization Managers Association using their own resources. However, DOE support of the activity will enhance the public benefits to be derived by increasing the amount and quality of training to be presented. The Denver Support Office knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct any of these activities. The Weatherization Managers Association sponsored by the State of Utah is the only region-specific organization of which every Weatherization program is a member and, therefore, possesses exclusive capability to perform the activities successfully. Project Period The initial term of the award will be for twelve (12) months, for a possible project period of three years from the initial date of award. Possible additional funding in future years will be based on satisfactory completion of the initial term and availability of funding.
