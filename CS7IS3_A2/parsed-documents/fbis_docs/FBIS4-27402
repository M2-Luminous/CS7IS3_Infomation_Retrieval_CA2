The visit was aimed at further building and promoting the relations of friendship and strengthening, ever more fruitfully, the all-around solidarity between the two armies of Laos and China. Recalling Lao-Chinese history, we see that Laos and China have maintained relations with each other in many respects for a long time. The two countries share a common border and maintain similar customs. This is why the Chinese People's Liberation Army [CPLA] and the Lao People's Army [LPA] have maintained the traditional relations of friendship for a long time. Noteworthy is that during the period of the national salvation struggle against the imperialist aggressors, the Chinese army and people always stood by the side of the Lao army and people in carrying out the cause of struggle. In the visit to the PRC on this occasion, the high-level military delegation of the LPDR therefore intended to offer the CPLA pure friendship from the LPA to jointly develop and further enhance the relations and solidarity of fraternal friendship and comradeship. During the four-day visit -- a very short visit, but in the spirit of close friendship -- the high-level military delegation of the LPDR was accorded a cordial welcome by the fraternal CPLA side. The LPA delegation was welcomed in an honorable manner at a solemn ceremony with the review of the guards of honor organized by General Chi Haotian, national defense minister of the PRC. The delegation was also accorded a warm welcome by cadres, combatants, and state employees of many army units it visited. The important thing, which served as a token of the promotion and enhancement of the relations of friendship, was the meeting between high-level military delegations of the two countries. In the meeting, which proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, the two sides reiterated in a straightforward manner their readiness to flourish the blooming solidarity and relations of fraternal friendship between the two armies. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR also had the honor to pay a courtesy call on General Liu Huaqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Committee, at the Government Guest Hall. On that occasion, Gen. Liu Huaqing expressed pleasure at welcoming the courtesy call of the LPA delegation. He also expressed satisfaction over the increasing enhancement of the relations of friendship between the parties, states, armies, and peoples of the two countries. It was a great honor for the LPDR delegation that Liu Huaqing, as a party leader, firmly reiterated the determination to vigorously encourage all parties concerned to do everything possible to strengthen the blooming friendship relations with Laos under the present favorable circumstances. On the occasion, Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason informed Gen. Liu Huaqing of the outcome of the delegation's visit. He also exchanged views with Gen. Liu Huaqing on many issues amid an atmosphere of good mutual understanding. Following the visit to the PRC on this occasion, the high-level military delegation of the LPDR has profoundly understood the economic growth and development of the PRC as a result of the implementation of the open-door policy as maintained by the CPC. The delegation has been impressed with the welcome that was given, in a pure spirit of friendship, to the Lao side by the Chinese side during the visit. Every place the delegation visited, it was accorded a welcome in a sincere manner. The Chinese side also explained in an open manner useful lessons on educating, training, fostering, and managing soldiers, which have been carried out by the CPLA. The four-day period of the visit was therefore considered a dynamic period for the already progressing relations between the two armies of Laos and China. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR highly assessed the friendship relations and all-around cooperation between the two armies and expressed the conviction that these relations and cooperation will be increasingly developed and strengthened and will last forever.
