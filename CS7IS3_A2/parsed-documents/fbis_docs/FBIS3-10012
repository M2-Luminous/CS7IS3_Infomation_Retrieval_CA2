At the conclusion of a Mexican Foreign Service meeting in preparation for the binational meeting with the United States to take place on 7 March in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Tello Macias said that there is the possibility that some measures announced by the neighbor to the north could be set aside. He rejected accusations made Saturday by Chicanos, according to whom the Foreign Secretariat spends more resources and time on organizing the commemoration of holidays than on providing consular protection. Tello Macias said that violence against any single Mexican citizen will be considered an act of violence against Mexico's integrity. The man responsible for the country's foreign policy said he does not know of any plans to construct a barbwire fence parallel to the metal fence that already exists along the border.
