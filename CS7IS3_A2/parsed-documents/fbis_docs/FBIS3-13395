Palestinian sources told our correspondent Moti Amir that this date was proposed to Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin by U.S. officials. The sources believe that agreement was reached on this issue. The talks will resume in Washington and in Paris. The sources told our correspondent that the PLO's agreement to renew the negotiations was made conditional on the Security Council's resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, and was given after Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin promised the Americans that the negotiations, as well as Israel's redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, would be completed before 14 April.
