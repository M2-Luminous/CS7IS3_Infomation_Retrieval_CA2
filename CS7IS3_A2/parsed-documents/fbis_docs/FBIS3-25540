Markets remained closed, and shops in the commercial area have not opened, public and private offices are almost completely paralyzed. The increased insecurity began on Sunday [20 February] when unidentified elements barricaded the roads leading to the Nyamirambo regional stadium in order to hinder the holding of an Republican Democratic Movement meeting organized by Faustin Twagiramungu, who is the president of the party. The insecurity was aggravated yesterday afternoon when members of the CDR, Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, practically occupied the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, barring all access to it by road. The CDR wants to obtain the code of ethics documents that every political party has to sign in order to take part in the transitional institutions. As we shall see later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation claims not to possess the documents. The security forces have been able to clear the area around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have freed about 40 employees who had been detained as hostages.
