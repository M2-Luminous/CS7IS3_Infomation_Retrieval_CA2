The Commission unanimously approved the draft and passed it on to the Assembly plenum for its second debate as an emergency bill. The bill defines the strategy for fighting the production, consumption, and trafficking of drugs, money laundering, possession of goods and assets obtained from drug trafficking, and related crimes. The document is a combination of proposals presented by Legislator Leo Gonzalez and Acting Attorney General Jorge Ramon Valdes. It also includes recommendations made by the UN International Narcotics Convention held in 1988 in Vienna. The draft improves the current description and adds several types of criminal activities to the list, including covert operations and controlled deliveries.
