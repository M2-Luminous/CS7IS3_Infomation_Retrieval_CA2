Talking to IRNA, Rowhani who is also secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), expressed surprise that the British Government raised so undocumented and hollow claims, at a time that European countries are adopting positive views on their relations with Iran. He was referring to the recent British allegations that Iran is backing the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Rowhani remarked that over the past 15 years Britain had kept a close connection with the armed terrorists fighting Iran and that its officials and media had repeatedly ignored the diplomatic norms by supporting the anti-revolutionaries both overtly and covertly. "By backing terrorist groups they have violated international laws," said Rowhani. He regretted that the British media had become an instrument for political games because its political figures realize better than all the hollowness of such claims. "Iran, as a victim of terrorism, had always called on the Western countries especially the European Union to conduct coordinated and joint measures against armed terrorism but received no answer from them," he added. Noting that Iran knew well what goals Britain pursued by such claims, the SCNS secretary invited Britain to bring its claims before the free world's public opinion, if it had any reliable documents, rather than creating tension between the two nations. He said London's hollow claim is actually designed to cover up the failure of its police in confronting the IRA, as well as the public hatred that the British Government's support for the Serbs in the Balkans has aroused. Referring to the presence of the American Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, in the Middle East, the Majles vice-speaker, said that the coordinated propaganda of the U.S., Israel and Britain against Iran, revealed a plot by this evil trio against the Islamic republic for its support for Palestian and Bosnian Muslims. He was pleased to note that after 15 years Britain had come to realize that backing terrorist grouplets was wrong. Rowhani concluded by repeating Iran's readiness for joint measures with the European countries and the European Union in particular against terrorism.
