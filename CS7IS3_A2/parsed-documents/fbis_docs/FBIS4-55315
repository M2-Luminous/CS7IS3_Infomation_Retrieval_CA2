A decision on access of state organs to Polish Television will be made by KRRiT this morning. Every week the most numerous political parties will be able to present themselves on Polish Television in a program that will be prepared jointly by television journalists and the parties' representatives. According to unofficial information that we learned from KRRiT, Polish Television President Wieslaw Walendziak is not really delighted with this solution; he believes, however, that this kind of the parties' "windows," in the form of a magazine program, will make it easier for political parties to get access to television. Cooperation in the creation of a model of such a program was declared by KRRiT, which is going to invite the parties and the public broadcaster to work out a set of rules for the appearances of the parties on television. Along with the resolution, KRRiT prepared a statement in which it draws attention to the general mannerism of broadcasters, who violate the integrity of statements by shortening them or by lowering the volume of the voices of politicians who are talking with journalists. According to KRRiT, it is proof of nonprofessionalism, which is not found in the West. Some KRRiT members note that people are presented with the danger of the council's censorship, whereas the worst type of censorship is employed by journalists, who cut out two out of four spoken sentences as they wish. The KRRiT statement also mentions a dangerous blurring of responsibility: The Polish Television president, the head of the Television Information Agency (there is an autonomy in information programs), and the directors of the individual programs are not really responsible for mistakes in information programs. The most important decisions here are made by the editor of a particular program, who is often only an associate member of television. It is necessary to make this responsibility clear, says the KRRiT statement.
