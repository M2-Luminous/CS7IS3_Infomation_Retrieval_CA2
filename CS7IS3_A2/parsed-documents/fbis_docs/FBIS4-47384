The tracks were recorded on cellulose nitrate. The growth rate varies from 1-16 mm/million years. For three concretions the growth rates are determined for the two opposite sides: for two of them, the concretion did not increase in one direction, and in the third, the growth rate differs by a factor of two. The rate of accumulation of the sediments on which the concretions lie was determined through radiocarbon dating and with the excess [.sup]230[/]Th method. The rate varied slightly, with an average of 0.4 mm/million years. The divergence in the age of concretions and the sediments on which they lie is associated with the activity of benthic fauna, which explains the inversion of radiocarbon date with depth.
