Zedillo, a former secretary of planning and budget and of public education, was campaign manager for candidate Colosio, who was killed last week by two shots in the city of Tijuana, in northwestern Mexico. In a statement for NOTIMEX via telephone after learning of Zedillo's designation, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio called for "strengthening relations with Mexico based on respect for sovereignty and self-determination." Meanwhile, Obdulio Chinchilla, president of the Finance Commission of the Guatemalan Congress, said should Zedillo win the Mexican elections on 21 August "there will be an opportunity to restructure more dynamic commercial relations with Mexico." In Managua, Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro, through government spokesman Luis Rivas Leyva, expressed hope that the PRI decision will continue maintain the normal course of the Mexican electoral process. Panamanian President Guillermo Endara commented in Panama City that Zedillo's appointment was "a good selection." Costa Rican Vice President German Serrano Pinto said "Mexico has shown it has overcome the recent unfortunate events and continues on the democratic path." Nils Castro, one of the vice presidents of the Permanent Conference of Latin American Political Parties (COPPPAL) expressed his hope that the new presidential candidate "will continue the same campaign program and the same government platform" as Colosio. In San Salvador, Ren Figueroa, deputy of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, said that "we do not doubt Zedillo will follow the same path as Colosio, as he was one of his closest collaborators." Ciro Cruz Zepeda, secretary general of the Salvadoran National Conciliation Party (PCN), said the new PRI presidential candidate "is the best man" to assume that responsibility.
