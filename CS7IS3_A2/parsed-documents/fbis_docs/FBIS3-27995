The government will include the step in a package of emergency pump-priming measures to be announced Thursday. Companies have so far been virtually banned from buying back their own shares. The easing will allow companies to buy their own stock from the secondary market, thus soaking up the shares, which are in abundance since the late 1980s, and hopefully activating the stock market. Conditions under which companies will be allowed to own their own stock include buying with the intention of later discarding the shares, or selling them off to their in-house employee shareholding organizations after the acquisition. The Legislative Council, an advisory body to the justice minister, is expected to submit a report on the revision of the commercial law on February 16, enabling the justice minister to present the proposal to the current Diet session. The proposed amendment will allow companies to make buy-backs if they get approval at their regular shareholders' meetings. The current law requires approval from all shareholders, a requirement that has proved virtually impossible to fulfill. Companies will be restricted from buying back more than the amount set aside for payment of stock dividends. When they buy with the intention of selling off the stocks to their in-house organization, the upper limit to their purchases will be 3 percent of the outstanding shares. They will be required to sell off the shares within six months. An extension of the six-month period will be allowed if the in-house organization does not have the necessary funds to buy the stocks.
