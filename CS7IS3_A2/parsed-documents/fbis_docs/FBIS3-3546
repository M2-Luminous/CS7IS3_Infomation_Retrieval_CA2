The island airport is scheduled to go into operation on July 1 this year. The airport is 15 km from Sanya City and 17 km from the sea. As the airport's radar system can cover the South China Sea area and even the high seas, the airport may become one of the aviation administration centers for the South-East Asian area. Some of the airport equipment is imported and of the most advanced kind in the world. After its first stage is completed, the airport will be able to handle about one million passengers per year. When the island in 1988 got State Council approval as a province and a special economic zone, it set tourism as its leading industry. But transport shortcomings have been holding back the development of its tourism industry.
