FR940214-1-00016 FR940214-1-00004 (1) a requirement that the recipient agency pay the Cooperating Sponsor the value of any commodities, monetized proceeds or program income that is used for purposes not expressly permitted under the Plan of Operation; (2) a requirement that the recipient agency pay the Cooperating Sponsor for any commodities, monetized proceeds or program income that is lost, damaged, or misused as result of the recipient agency's failure to exercise reasonable care; (3) a provision expressly incorporating the terms and conditions of this part which govern the implementation of the approved Plan of Operation, the use of funds, record keeping, inspection and audit. (b) Upon request, CCC may, within its sole discretion, elect to waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section where it determines that such an agreement is not feasible or appropriate for any reason, including the nature of the recipient agency, or the amount of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income that may be transferred to the recipient agency. In any case where waiver is granted, however, such waiver shall not otherwise affect or diminish the Cooperating Sponsor's obligations or responsibilities with respect to program commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. ยง1499.11 Liability of the Cooperating Sponsor. (a) The Cooperating Sponsor shall be required to reimburse CCC for all costs incurred by CCC, including the cost of acquisition of the donated commodity where such Cooperating Sponsor has either: (1) Failed to export the commodities from the United States; (2) Been responsible for the reentry of the commodity into the United States; or (3) Used the commodities, monetized proceeds or sale profits in a manner inconsistent with program requirements. (b) [Reserved] ยง1499.12 Sales, barter, and use of monetized proceeds and program income. (a) Section 416(b). (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, commodities donated under a section 416(b) Program Agreement may be sold or bartered only in accordance with an approved Plan of Operation. Such sales or barters may be approved by CCC on a case-by-case basis for the following purposes only: (i) to finance the distribution, handling or processing costs of the donated commodities in the importing country or in a country through which the commodities must be transshipped, or other activities in the importing country that are consistent with providing food assistance to needy people; (ii) in the case of sales of commodities furnished to nonprofit and voluntary agencies, or cooperatives, to generate proceeds to be used to transport, store, distribute and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities, and to implement income generating community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural program, and other development activities; (iii) to cover expenses of the type identified in section 406 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954; or (iv) for any other use specifically authorized by statute. (2) Commodities may be sold or bartered only in the importing country or other country specifically approved by CCC. Monetized proceeds must be expended within either the country of origin or in other countries as necessary to expedite transportation of commodities, or in countries which generally accept the type of currency generated by the sale. Monetized proceeds must be expended within one year of acquisition unless CCC specifically agrees that a longer period is necessary to achieve the purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of section. (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, commodities may be sold or bartered without prior approval of CCC where damage has occurred to the commodity rendering it unfit for the intended program purposes, and sale or barter is necessary to mitigate the loss of the value of the damaged commodity. (4) Cooperating Sponsors who sell or barter commodities must enter into a written agreement with the other party to the sale transaction. A copy of the executed agreement must be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. (5) All monetized proceeds shall be deposited into a special interest bearing account for control and monitoring unless interest bearing accounts are prohibited by the laws or customs of the importing country or such requirement would impose an undue burden on the Cooperating Sponsor. Any accrued interest shall be used only for approved activities. (6) Cooperating Sponsors shall not be required to monitor, manage, report on, or account for the distribution or use of such sold or bartered commodities after all sales proceeds have been fully deposited in a special account and title to the commodities has passed to buyers or other third parties pursuant to a sale or barter transaction. The sales proceeds and the uses thereof, however, must be monitored, managed, reported and accounted for as provided in the relevant sections of this part 1499.
