FR941019-2-00021 FR941019-2-00020 Office of Policy Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reductions, and Carbon Sequestration AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of availability of guidelines. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Department of Energy has developed guidelines for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, their reduction, and carbon fixation achieved through any measure. The data will be reported on forms to be developed by the Energy Information Agency (EIA) and entered into an EIA database. The guidelines provide for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reductions, and of carbon sequestration. The guidelines and supporting materials will assist parties in analyzing activities and determining emissions and reductions in order to voluntarily report this data. The EIA reporting forms will be consistent with the guidelines. The guidelines and supporting material are finalized and will be available for distribution on or before October 31, 1994. DATES: The Guidelines for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases under Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 will be available for distribution on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the guidelines and supporting documents are available in hard copy or on 31/2 ’ ’ diskette. Copies may be obtained by telephone request to (202) 586&hyph;3660, by facsimile request to (202) 586&hyph;2062 or (202) 586&hyph;3047, or by writing to the Office of Global Environment (PO&hyph;63), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585.
