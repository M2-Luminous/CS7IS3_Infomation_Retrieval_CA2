Such lack of sensitivity on the part of the U.N., which is sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina troops whose government has long since declared itself clearly on whose side it is, is simply amazing. Turkey has assisted Bosnian Moslems from the first day of their secession -- politically, militarily, financially, morally. Turkish war correspondents, have publicly boasted in their papers of having shot at and killed "infidels". If this is so among reporters then what may one expect the Turkish troops might do. By adopting the stand that Turkey may send troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. has broken its own vow that former occupying forces could not be among the U.N. peacekeeping force in a respective country. Turks have been occupiers on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for full 500 years. For the Bosnian Moslems, Turkey means incomparably more than Russia does to the Serbs. Even the family of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic lives in Turkey. On the other side, Russia has never been an occupying force on these territories, nor has its troops impaled the Moslems here. However, as regards the Serbs and Turks -- it is different story. All in all, the U.N. decision, among many others which it took under pressure, testifies about further moral degradation of the world organization. Moral strength has always been its mightiest weapon, now this too is lost. If the Turks, nevertheless, arrive to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the only true balance might be achieved by calling on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to send its troops there too. Everything else looks as poorly veiled hypocrisy the objective of which is to threaten the lives of Serbs and their property, and this not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
