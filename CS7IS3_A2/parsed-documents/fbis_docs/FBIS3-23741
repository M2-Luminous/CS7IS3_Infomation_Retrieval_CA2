One Must Guess at What One Cannot See"] [Text] The current reform of the Russian special services is proceeding with indirect support from the CIA, within the framework of the "Freedom Support Project," with its center in Langley and a branch in Moscow. Certain state security officers are convinced that Lubyanka is already operating under political control from the West. Here they refer to information from agency sources--their own and the Foreign Intelligence Service. In principle, this is no sensation at all, because one of the mandatory areas of special service activity is monitoring various of the enemy's functional units--by operational methods and through political lobbying. If one pays attention to the total "Atlantism" of the new Russian policy, the above assessment of the concrete situation can be accepted, at least as one version. Boris Yeltsin's December edict on abolishing the Ministry of Security was a surprise to people working behind the granite walls of Lubyanka. They had expected something like this after the October events. They received reassurances from the Kremlin in November: Go ahead and work, nothing of the kind will happen. But that very edict came from the president on the heels of the election. At Lubyanka they were sure that there was a connection. I was told that it was suggested from above "by the powers that be and the media" that they support the campaign of Russia's Choice, which did not happen. We know the results of the voting on 12 December. Plus there was the quite understandable fear of the organized structure, which sometimes has too much information that is harmful to the regime, and in principle, if something were to happen, is capable of taking forceful actions. Plus there is the desire that follows from this to finally take the "dangerous" organization in hand, right down to the point of creating a new system in a new place. In any state, the special services operate within the framework of the concept of national security. By and large, there is no such thing in modern Russia. Therefore, Lubyanka is still operating with a view to basically the priorities and experience of past times. Which sometimes stands in contradiction to the strategic and, shall we say, local interests of the new powers. I was told that when Anatoliy Chubays came to Lubyanka, he rebuked the officers of the Ministry of Security for the fact that he had received from them nothing but negative developments pertaining to privatization. And these developments illustrate the extreme criminalization of a process; they are above all corruption and entanglement of Chubays' favorite brainchild by the Mafia structures. The chief of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property asked why he does not receive good news from the privatization front. He was given to understand that publicizing positive experience was the work of a different organization. Chubays was dissatisfied with this answer. Only the deaf are not talking about corruption at all levels of Russian power today. And also about the Russian economy as the nutritive environment for economic banditry. The career interests of at least three administrations and one department of the disbanded Ministry of Security were concentrated precisely here. And almost 90 percent of the cases of the Ministry of Security of Russia involved corruption and organized crime. It was these three administrations--economic counterintelligence, transportation control, and the fight against contraband and corruption--that were separated from the general structure and transformed into two independent departments. The investigatory department was turned over to the procuracy. The Lefortovo Prison went to the militia. Just for good measure, the border troops were taken away from Lubyanka and also the operational-mobilization administration, which is in charge of the system of secret underground structures and utilities. By taking direct charge of special services, the president precluded the very possibility of their being controlled by the government, parliament, or public organizations. Thus, counterintelligence was again transformed into a completely secret structure completely under the control of the "party in power." When the president said that there would be no political detective work in Russia, he might as well have said that snow would not fall in Russia. Political detective work always has and always will exist in any state in the form of certain agency measures. This is necessary, to put it crudely, to reveal people or groups that intend to cause one or another kind of harm to the political regime or one of its representatives. It is boring to talk about this, it is primary. And no matter what Yeltsin may say, among the population this will be done by the same people who have always done it, only under a new name, and political detective work at the highest level will be done by a new structure, one might say, under the president himself. Aleksandr Korzhakov is called Yeltsin's shadow. Yeltsin brought him along with him from back in Sverdlovsk, and he has been in charge of the group of the president's personal guard since the times when the current Russian leader was riding in a Moskvich. Since that time, if something has kept Korzhakov from gaining more power, it has been the need to interact in his work with the Kremlin guard, headed by the chief of Alpha, General Barsukov. On 3 October, after Alpha refused to storm the White House, Boris Yeltsin resolutely pushed Barsukov away, and now the president's personal guard is completely in Korzhakov's hands. One can judge the staff of the structure they created from the fact that, as we have learned from informed people, the staff distribution table includes several general slots. Moreover, as other sources assert, the new formation will have control of the main secret telephone communication lines--ATS-1, ATS-2, and operational communications. All this plus the fact that in a presidential republic, which the post-October Russia intends to become, the actual power is the president and the president's circle, means that an extremely important task has been assigned to Aleksandr Korzhakov--to defend the presidential power. This is a new structure in a new place, which, in addition to guarding the president's actual body, will engage, it seems, in serious counterintelligence activity at the highest level, namely: political detective work along the line of parliament-party-government-Yeltsin's inner circle.
