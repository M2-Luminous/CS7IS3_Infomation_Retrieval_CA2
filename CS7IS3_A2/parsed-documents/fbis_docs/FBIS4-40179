Shumeyko paid great attention to the question of further interaction in different spheres between Russia and Bulgaria. He expressed the view that "the development of relations between the two countries should not be allowed to take their own course." The Russian politician explained this thought, while answering an ITAR- TASS question regarding the assessment of the fulfillment of the interstate treaty on friendly relations and cooperation signed during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Sofia in August 1992. "The treaty is being implemented in an unsatisfactory manner. Suffice it say that at that time an accord was reached to resolve the problem of mutual debts within a short period, but the problem has not yet been resolved," Shumeyko said. In this context Shumeyko recalled the important role played by parliaments of both countries, which should assist "lawfully ensure" mutual cooperation, thereby removing different kinds of barriers which exist on the path to movement of capital, in the sphere of trade and setting up large industrial and finance groups. On the whole, Shumeyko values Bulgaria as an important strategic partner of Russia on the Balkans, with which Russia intends to interact within the Black Sea economic cooperation framework. As far as the Yugoslavian crisis is concerned, according to Shumeyko, Russia principly adheres to the stand of "achieving a compromise, reconciliation of the parties, and not punishing only one of them," the Federation Council chairman said. According to Shumeyko, the dialogue held with the Bulgarian leadership has showed that the two sides, in principle, do not have any differences over the question of participating in integration processes taking place in Europe. This, in particular, applies to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" programme, and joining other European structures, including Council of Europe. Certain differences of opinion, which cropped up during the talks, bear rather tactical than strategical nature, he said. Answering several questions regarding the implementation of democratic reforms in Russia and the society's present state asked by Bulgarian journalists, Shumeyko said that he does not consider it feasible to hold pre-term presidential elections, since he does not see "any potential basis" for this, as well as he does for any dramatic social shakeups in the country. The Federation Council chairman also touched on the recent pessimistic statements made by nobel laureate Aleksndr Solzhenitsyn about the prospects of the formation of a democratic society in Russia. Every man of letters is free to voice his opinion, but I do not share the great writer's pessimism, vladimir Shumeyko said.
