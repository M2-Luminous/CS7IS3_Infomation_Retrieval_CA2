FBIS TRENDS-06APR94-EL SALVADOR Leftists Looking For Gains in Legislature Leftists Looking For Gains in Legislature SUMMARY While El Salvador's leftist coalition is unlikely to win the runoff elections for president next month, the former rebels in the coalition are looking to become the main opposition force in the legislature where the final vote remains undecided. END SUMMARY The 20 March contest to elect a new president, deputies to the Legislative Assembly and mayors--the first elections held since the January 1992 Chapultepec peace accords ended El Salvador's civil war--left the ruling party frontrunner just short of the absolute majority needed to win the presidency. Consequently, on 24 April, Armando Calderon Sol, candidate from the ruling right- wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party--who won 49.03 percent of the vote according to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE)--will face the second highest vote-getter, leftist candidate Ruben Zamora. Zamora, representing the Democratic Convergence (CD), an electoral coaliton of leftist parties, including the former rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), won 24.90 percent of the vote, according to TSE figures (San Salvador Canal Doce Television, 31 March) (See Note 1). (Note 1) Beset by internal divisions, the former ruling party during the mid-1980's, the Christian Democratic Party, took only 16.39 percent of the presidential vote (Canal Doce Television, 31 March). Campaign rhetoric notwithstanding, Zamora is unlikely to boost his percentage of the presidential vote in the April elections by the nearly 26 percent required to win the presidency. The CD candidate's plans "to win the presidency in the runoff" by reaching out to a broader "coalition of forces "--expressed by Zamora on 22 March in a television interview--will unlikely generate enough additional votes given the "decision" by the centrist Christian Democratic Party (PDC) not to endorse the leftist candidate (Panama City ACAN, 25 March) (See Note 2). (Note 2) The PDC declined to endores the ARENA candidate, as well. Although Zamora also suggested that the elimination of administrative obstacles facing voters during the March elections would help the CD ticket win in April, prominent FMLN leader Joaquin Villalobos indicated that "anomalies" in the voting process would probably make little difference in the presidential vote (See Note 3). Thus, although Zamora asserted that it is to the CD's "advantage" to have "another opportunity to correct. . . the serious deficiencies of the first election," in a press conference on 22 March, Villalobos noted that alleged incidents of electoral fraud "may not affect the final outcome of the presidential elections" (Canal Doce Television, 22 March). (Note 3) According to the United Nations Observers for El Salvador, some 25,000 Salvadorans--out of approximately 2.5 million eligible voters--were unable to vote on 20 March because their names did not appear on voter registers (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL, 22 March). Focus on Legislature On the other hand, Villalobos indicated that the FMLN viewed voting irregularities as a much more significant issue in the legislative--and mayoral--races and suggested that his party will push to have votes it considers affected by "fraud" resolved in the FMLN's favor. In comparison to the presidential race, Villalobos noted that electoral irregularities "did indeed affect" the March legislative elections because local elections can be "decided" by a relatively small number of votes. Reflecting the FMLN's concern that irregularities in voting results could deprive the FMLN of seats in the legislature--where it stands to become the main political opposition--Villalobos indicated that because the FMLN is "extremely worried" that "anomalies" in the deputy vote count "are designed to establish a PCN-ARENA majority in the Legislative Assembly," it is "contesting" questionable vote counts through "legal means," presumably by appealing to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (San Salvador Radio Maya Vision, 23 March) (See Note 4). (Note 4) "Unofficial" figures on the vote for deputies to the 84- seat Legislative Assembly, indicate that, on the right, ARENA won 40 seats and the National Conciliation Party (PCN), 3. Among the opposition parties of the center and left, the PDC won 16; the FMLN, 20; and the CD, 3. A remaining seat was won by an evangelical party (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL, 22 March). Outlook Although the Salvadoran left will continue to promote the upcoming presidential runoff as an opportunity for victory over the ruling ARENA party, at best the elections will enhance the left's position as a viable political force if leftist candidate Zamora manages to better last month's vote count. A more important indication of the left's performance in its first meaningful participation in electoral politics will be the number of seats it can gain in the Legislative Assembly, where the former rebels stand to become the main opposition party.
