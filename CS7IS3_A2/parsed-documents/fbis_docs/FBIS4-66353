To reduce its energy resource shortages, the Anhui Provincial Government has approved the establishment of the Anhui Province Electric Power Development Corporation to represent the interests of the local electric power industry, assume special responsibility for raising and managing capital for a provincial-level electric power construction fund (including the use of foreign investments) and for local energy resource project development and construction. By the end of September, 1993, the corporation had raised a total of 2 billion yuan in capital for power development. It has made independent investments to build five 125MW generators at Hefei, Tongling, Ma'anshan, and other cities and it is participating in joint investments to establish the key state construction projects at the Luohe and Pingyu power plants and the Huaibei and Wuhu power plants for six generators with a total capacity of 1,400MW. The corporation has also invested over 100 million yuan in joint investments to complete the Huaibei Tongting Coal Mine with an annual coal mining capacity of 450,000 tons. Apparently, Anhui Province also recently decided to use the Anhui Province Electric Power Development Corporation to organize the "Anhui Energy Company, Ltd." to issue public stock to raise an enormous amount of capital to accelerate construction of its local electric power industry and increase Anhui's total installed generating capacity to 10,000MW by the year 2000.
