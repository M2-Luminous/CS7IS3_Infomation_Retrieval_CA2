[Ilijevski] It was banned a month and a half ago. The decision of the Okrug Court in Stip became binding over a week ago. Its sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. It is interesting to note that the court in Stip banned us because we were described as a threat to the country's constitutional order. However, we think that the old constitution is not binding any longer, because there is a new Constitution. It bans violent anticonstitutional actions, but our party has not been accused of any such actions. When Macedonia's Supreme Court discovered this paradox it amended the legal basis of the ban. We were accused of fanning international and interethnic hatred. We cannot even utilize our constitutional right to appeal against this judgment any longer because the reason for it has been changed, and our appeal was based on the previous reason. We sought the protection of Macedonia's chief prosecutor and demanded that the Constitutional Court cancel the ban because it violates the Constitution. We have informed international legal organizations and the governments of many countries. We most fervently appeal to official Bulgaria, because we think that it has the greatest reason to help us. Our party was banned because of its good relations with Bulgaria. [Nikolova] How did the Bulgarian authorities react to this? [Ilijevski] Unfortunately, before and after 10 November 1989 Sofia's policy toward the Bulgarians in Macedonia did not change. We were left in the hands of the Serbian state and Serbian denationalization. After 50 years of oppression we hoped that under the new conditions of pluralism we would have the opportunity to state our rights clearly. However, this did not happen. We think that it is high time that Bulgaria took care of its children outside her borders. There will be nothing unusual in this, because all the countries in the world do it. [Nikolova] Have you met any official Bulgarian representatives to discuss this issue? [Ilijevski] Over the last six months I have had many useful contacts in Sofia. I have had talks with [National Assembly Chairman] Aleksandur Yordanov and with President Zhelev's advisers. I have also had meetings at the Agency for Bulgarians Abroad and many political party leaders. However, most of my meetings have been with journalists. Thus, the problems of the Bulgarians in Macedonia have been presented to the Bulgarian and world public. Unfortunately, official Bulgaria continues to keep silent. It is high time that Bulgaria announced its position on the so-called Macedonian issue. [Nikolova] Our country was the first to recognize Macedonia's independence. Do you think that Sofia is afraid to declare openly its support for the Bulgarians in the former Yugoslav republic? [Ilijevski] There is no reason to be afraid, but I think that the old understandings still prevail. Unfortunately, the good relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia are at the expense of the Bulgarians who live there. There used to exist an unwritten treaty between Sofia and Skopje that there are no Bulgarians in Macedonia. Good relations between the two countries could and can exist only if Bulgaria does not look after us. I do not think that this is either good or moral. If I may use a metaphor, it means that the Bulgarians in Macedonia have a mother who is alive but does not look after them. Let me ask the following: If a mother does not think about her children across the border, how will it help those who live here? [Nikolova] Bulgaria offered Macedonia its ports when Greece announced its trade blockade. How do you think the conflict with Greece will develop? [Ilijevski] I cannot forecast anything, but I think that there could be a positive result. Both Greece and Macedonia could make concessions. However, it is a different matter as to whether Greece is right. Many states throughout the world have already denounced it, while its neighbors are keeping silent in an attempt to maintain good relations with it. It is true that official Macedonia, led by Kiro Gligorov, defends Macedonism. However, this involves twisting historical facts and distorting the history of Bulgaria and Greece. In such a case it was normal on the part of the Greeks to react in such a sharp manner. [Nikolova] How will the Yugocrisis develop and will there be a war in Macedonia? [Ilijevski] I do not think that there will be war if there is no military intervention and the problems are peacefully resolved, unless we ourselves do something to ourselves. In order to avoid this, the Balkan states are called upon to be law abiding and democratic states and respect human rights. In this way international conflicts could be avoided.
