[Hurd] We are at the heart of every discussion and there are core rules, the kind of rules for example which prevent the Germans from excluding British beef, the kind of rules which make the French admit British airlines to Orly, which make us do sometimes things that are in the agreed rules, and that's important, and there are other things which we do because we agree and it suits us to do them, things we call the two other pillars of Maastricht, foreign policy, home affairs policy, the efforts against the international criminal, we cooperate there as governments because we want to tackle the problem together, that's how Europe is developing. [Sturton] But the last time you tried to take a stand, which as you put it, suits Britain and not the rest of Europe over the blocking mechanism in an enlarged community, you were forced into a humiliating climbdown. [Hurd] We compromised there, and you will see when the time comes next year that the compromise works well from our point of view, but that was nothing to do with the national veto. [Sturton] And I did not suggest it was. [Hurd] No, no the national veto is the crucial part. [Sturton] But can you give me one example when the sort of flexibility that you are talking about has actually been used successfully? [Hurd] Of course, a whole number of things which when we started talking about them we were a lone voice, subsidiarity, minimum interference, enlargement of the community, the single market, all these were ideas which we started talking about then, were not well received and now the orthodoxy is actually happening, that is progress being made, but defense, frontiers, the ERM, these are all examples were we already have a multispeed Europe. [Sturton] Can I ask you finally, foreign secretary, were the sort of contortions you all have to go through, for domestic reasons during an election making your life difficult in the Council of Europe? [Hurd] I really cannot accept that, the ideas which the prime minister put forward from Maastricht on the idea I put forward for the example at our Scottish party conference a few weeks ago -- the ideas we are putting forward in this election campaign, this is a very clear and coherent idea of the way we think Europe should go in the interests of Britain and other peoples in Europe, it is different from the old fashioned idea with which you and others occasionally are besotted, that the only good European is one who believes in moving power inexorably to Brussels, that is not our Conservative view, we have a positive view about Europe, and that's the view we are consistently putting across.
