This was stated by Heiner Tropitzsch, the company's personnel chief, in an interview with STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN. Tropitzsch justified the change of course toward working short hours instead of reducing work time by referring to the new framework wage contract concluded in March. In this contract it was agreed that wages and salaries may be reduced in line with work time only if this applies to the entire company. As a result, special work-time regulations for the individual factories have become very expensive compared with working short hours, Tropitzsch said. The industrial vehicle sector of the Stuttgart company is suffering very much, while business with passenger cars is improving.
