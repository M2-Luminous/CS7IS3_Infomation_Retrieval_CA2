FR941125-0-00003 FR941125-0-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 2 RIN 3150&hyph;AF25 Change in Organizational Title and Telephone Numbers AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations regarding petitions for rulemaking to indicate the current title of the organization within the NRC from which a prospective petitioner may seek consultation before filing a petition for rulemaking. This amendment also supplies the current telephone numbers for a prospective petitioner to contact the NRC before filing a petition for rulemaking. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael T. Lesar, Chief, Rules Review Section, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 415&hyph;7163. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is revising the regulations in 10 CFR Part 2 that pertain to filing of petitions for rulemaking to reflect a name change of the NRC organization from which a prospective petitioner may consult with the NRC before filing a petition for rulemaking. This action indicates that the name of the Regulatory Publications Branch, in the Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, has been changed to the Rules Review and Directives Branch (RRDB). The current telephone number on which a prospective petitioner may directly contact RRDB is now (301) 415&hyph;7158. The public access toll free telephone number, (800) 368&hyph;5642, is unchanged. Because this is an amendment dealing with agency practice and procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendment is of a minor and administrative nature dealing with a change to an organizational name and telephone number. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0036.
