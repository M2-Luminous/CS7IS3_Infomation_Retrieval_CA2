But five months before the Bundestag election, the Social Democrats are losing confidence that they can take power this time. So that there will be no doubts, Rudolf Scharping says it again and again: this fall the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] wants to supersede the Kohl government and take over responsibility in Bonn. By this he naturally means a change of power. But the chancellor candidate is not so fond of the term "power." Somehow power sounds like an end in itself and somehow that does not fit in the self-understanding of the SPD. For a Social Democrat, political content comes first and then power. Seen in this way, it was only logical for Rudolf Scharping to react angrily to the election of Roman Herzog as federal president. Anyone who believed that it was necessary to elect the most suitable candidate as head of state must be especially disappointed that power-policy considerations alone decided the issue. But this understandable human disappointment also involves an imcomprehensible political naivete. After 12 years of experience with power politician Helmut Kohl, had the Social Democrats really thought that he would not put the liberals under massive pressure? And does Scharping, who in his initial anger characterized the FDP [Free Democratic Party] as superfluous but then quickly called it a conceivable partner in the government, seriously believe that there is another criterion for the Free Democrats than participation in power? It is one thing to criticize Kohl's instrumental relationship to power. It is another thing to change the political power relations. In his short time as chief of the SPD, to be sure, Scharping was able to maneuver his party out of the corner into which the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] had pushed it with remarkable adroitness. But he was only able to do this because the SPD largely took the course of the Union in the dispute about the right of asylum, fighting crime, and UN missions of the Bundeswehr. And the attempt to make the fight against unemployment the focus of the election campaign and thus to put the Bonn coalition on the defensive got bogged down at the very start. The Most Dangerous Adversary of the Social Democrats Is the Social Democrats First, in his, in principle, correct and honest attempt to put a greater burden on the higher incomes and in exchange to abandon the planned solidarity surcharge for everyone, Scharping got entangled in the definition of the so-called higher earners. Then Oskar Lafontaine reaped sharp criticism from his own ranks for his likewise correct and honest statement that the social expenditures must also be subject to review if it is a matter of the consolidation of the budget. After the election for the federal presidency, in turn, the party chief presented himself as a poor loser. And finally, in the vote in the Bundestag on the abortion paragraph 218, even renowned Social Democrats were conspicuous in their absence. Instead of utilizing this politically meaningless but symbolically important vote to give a defeat to the governing coalition, the parliamentary group of the SPD itself suffered a beating. It appears that the Social Democrats are the most dangerous adversary of the Social Democrats. Six months before the Bundestag election, Chancellor Kohl and his Union once again see themselves on the rise in opinion polls, just as the head of the government had prophesied when the mood was worst at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the confidence of many members of the SPD that this time they can win the election is yielding to the feeling that they will once again be losers. What are the reasons why the opposition is not able to profit politically from the battered image of the Federal Government? The party certainly does not lack unity. The ideas about reform are also quite consistent, at least in their fundamentals. Lower taxes on labor and higher taxes on energy consumption, tax relief for investments, and consolidation of the national budget--all of these are proper goals. But so far the Social Democrats have answered the key question in a fragmentary way at best: How is this to be financed? If the Social Democrats were honest, they would have to declare that for a few years all groups in society must tighten their belts so that later on things can again get better for everyone. And if they were courageous, they would be very specific about naming the demands that are necessary to resolve above all the most pressing problem of this society: the unemployment that can no longer be eliminated through economic growth alone. Certainly there is a justifiable fear of thereby offending voters. But what is the benefit of Scharping getting the approval of socially weaker groups by offering them relief if he also angers all those who by no means count themselves among the higher earners but are supposed to pay higher taxes? And when Lafontaine, in turn, calls for review of all social payments, which at best gets the applause of employers? In terms of election tactics, the two things really do not go together. But do they not fit together into a plausible total concept? What is lacking is not so much tactical skill but rather a consistent election campaign strategy. For this reason, although reconciled in the party program, three positions of the SPD stand side by side: --the position of social fairness, which certainly needs correction after 12 years of Kohl's policy of redistribution from bottom to top; --the national position, which sees itself as participating in the government on the basis of its majority in the Bundesrat and which is therefore oriented toward what can be done in the short term, toward economic interests and the restraining of the national debt; --finally the visionary position, which wants to achieve new jobs through an ecological restructuring of the industrial society through fundamental reforms of the basic conditions in the state. So far the Social Democrats have not been able to present these three positions as indispensable components of a single reform process. For one thing, that is because different politicians of the SPD express themselves on different details without truly making the connection clear. Second, individual Social Democrats still see themselves more as representatives of certain groups of voters rather than as advocates of a comprehensive overall concept, as is shown by Christoph Zoepel's reaction to Scharping's bloated statement on the speed limit or Rudolf Dressler's protest against Lafontaine's position on social outlays. And third, the leaders of the SPD made the mistake of thinking that they could vie for the sympathy of business associations and conservative media. Successful Public Relations Work Looks Different The SPD could copy Helmut Kohl in particular in dealing with the media and managers. The fact that the chancellor avoids the media that are critical to him has not hurt him in any election. And although he might grumble, he absorbs criticism from business associations. Rudolf Scharping, on the other hand, reacted to the--probably expected--warning of Heinz-Peter Stihl, president of the DIHT [German Industrial and Trade Association], against the Social Democrats with a letter of several pages to the entrepreneur. Out of understandable personal irritation, Oskar Lafontaine, in turn, put through a totally incomprehensible law in the Saarland Parliament to restrict freedom of the press. That is not what successful public relations work looks like. Are the Social Democrats unable to realize this? At the present time, the chancellor candidate and his most important aspirant for minister are turning out to be not very sovereign. And if any comprehensive strategy of the Social Democrats is recognizable, then it is to make themselves as unassailable as possible from the conservative side. This, however, certainly gives rise to doubts about how serious the party really is about reforms. Meanwhile, one can hear Rudolf Scharping talk almost more about what he would like to preserve as head of the government, whereas incumbent Helmut Kohl is talking about fundamental change. If one believes Guenter Verheugen, general secretary of the SPD, then the speculation about the specific ideas of his party is quite intentional. Verheugen is calling for the people to be patient, saying that the veil will be lifted on 4 September. At that time a detailed 100-day program will be presented for the takeover of the government. Until then the motto will be: there is much to do, let us wait and see.
