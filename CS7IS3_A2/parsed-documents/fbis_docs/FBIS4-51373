So far, Hainan has built over 40 industrial parks with a planned investment of 16.8 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars) since it was established as a province six years ago. At present, some 200 construction projects are underway in these industrial parks. Under construction are projects involving machine building, electronics, light and textile industry, and pharmaceuticals. These projects are expected to add two billion yuan in output value and 100 million U.S. dollars in export earnings. In 1993 the province's industrial output value surpassed that of agriculture for the first time in history, turning out 10 billion yuan-worth of products. Industrial parks have played important roles in this respect. Drawing experience from Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, Hainan is concentrating on large-scale industrial production, especially by making use of its rich offshore resources, said Wang Xiaofeng, deputy governor of the province. Tourism, processing and transportation as well as high-value-added tropical agriculture will form the backbone of Hainan's industry, he added.
