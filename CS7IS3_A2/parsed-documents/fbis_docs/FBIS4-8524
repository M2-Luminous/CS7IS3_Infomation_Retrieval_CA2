At today's modest ceremony, Sukru Tufan, Turkish ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, unveiled the sign on the embassy building, thus officially opening the embassy and marking the beginning of its work. Ambassador Tufan spoke about the friendly attitude of his country toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the insistence of Ankara on the implementation of all the UN Security Council resolutions concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina. By sending in its armed forces, Turkey will be directly participating in the establishment of peace in our country. It is obliged to do so by both the deep roots and the links between our cultures and traditions. Thus the link between these two friendly and close countries is natural. Turkey will continue to (rally) all the international forces in order to reach a just settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, Ambassador Tufan said. Another ceremony will be held this afternoon to mark the opening of the Turkish embassy in Sarajevo.
