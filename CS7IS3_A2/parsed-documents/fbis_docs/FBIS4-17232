Heads of republican departments and oblast administrations, Almaty and Leninsk administration heads, and chairmen of the boards of leading banks were invited. At issue was the outcome of the Republic's social and economic development in the first quarter of the current year. In the Republic's national economy, negative trends increased in January-March, leading to a decrease in production and higher inflation. The problem of settlement of payments has become even more urgent. It has practically paralyzed all branches of the economy. As stated on 1 April, 1,084 enterprises are at a complete or partial standstill. As result, the gross domestic product in January-March decreased by 30 percent compared to the same months last year. The volume of production output decreased by 30.9 percent and that of the capital investment of state enterprises and organizations decreased by 68.3 percent. A very serious situation is brewing in the fuel and energy complex. Production of electricity fell by 14 percent, coal by 10 percent. Recovery of oil, gas, and gas condensate has also decreased. Oil refineries have refined 2.8 mn [million] tonnes of oil, which equals 64.5 percent of the total reached in the first quarter of last year. The situation in the metallurgy complex has deteriorated. Decrease of light industry is ongoing. The agro-industrial complex is also turning a loss. Last autumn 58,000 heads of cattle and many horses and camels, about 1.5 mn sheep and goats died, although, as has been said, farm units had enough fodder. As a result, production of meat, milk, and eggs is lower compared to the first quarter of last year. Preparation for the spring sowing campaign is a matter of special discontent. Most equipment is in poor repair. Many state and collective farms do not have enough good quality seeds. The situation with fuels and lubricants is critical. Not only single farm units, but also whole rayons do not have any fuel at all. In this connection, speakers said every possibilities should be found to provide all necessary things for farmers to carry out the sowing campaign on all planned areas. In the food industry the decline of production is by 33 percent. In capital construction, at the expense of all sources of financing, 11 percent only of all planned facilities was commissioned. Residential housing construction is in dire straits. Despite the strict financial policy of allocating credits from the budget, the rate of inflation has not decreased. Introduction of the national currency did not help curb inflation. Liberalization of prices for basic foodstaff of 5 January and continuing increase of prices for spare parts, fuel, raw materials and equipment on the part of the CIS partners has significantly increased inflation. Inflation is also increased by the trend of producers to increase prices for their products as well as by inflation forecasting expectations of the population. The public welfare has significantly decreased. Last year an average monthly salary increased by a factor of 14.2, and consumer prices increased by a factor of 23. Simultaneously, indexes and tariffs for paid services have skyrocketed. Everyday consumer services increased by a factor of 24 times, municipal payments, 62. Upkeep of children in nurseries is 31-times more expensive now than a year ago. Medical services cost 37-times higher. First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who chaired the sitting said: "In conformity with the government's plans for January-March, legal norms continue to be formed as the basis for the market economy. Measures envisaged by these plans are being implemented in general as far as the economic policy towards the CIS partners are concerned." Speaking about future prospects, the vice prime minister said that in the second quarter the gross domestic product is predicted to be increased by 6 percent and the output of the industrial production by 8 percent. This will help to improve the situation in the social sphere. The sitting also examined the progress of preparation for celebration of the 150th anniversary of Abay Kunanbayev. The progress is extremely unsatisfactory. In this connection a number of ministries, departments, and heads of oblast administrations were given concrete tasks to improve the situation.
