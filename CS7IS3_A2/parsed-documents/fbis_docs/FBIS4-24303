FBIS4-24303 "drafr125_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-125 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 29 Jun South African Press Review for 29 Jun MB2906115494 MB2906115494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR More Transparent Intelligence System -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 29 June in a page-18 editorial finds that "sadly" the country does need the 400 million rand budgeted for the National Intelligence Service (NIS). NIS Chief Mike Louw makes a case for this budget: "Violent endeavour on the political fringes, while happily dormant, is by no means buried. America's spy system is closing 13 missions in Africa, perhaps to consolidate their efforts from a single SA base. Organised crime is both growing and is overlapping with the political arena. Clandestine combat in the economic and technological fields is overtaking the old simple James Bond issues." Furthermore, "From what little we know of disruptive intentions on and around April 27, it seems that without the intelligence community we may today have been embroiled in something close to a civil war rather than basking in the joyous birth of a new nation." However, "what we can demand is an intelligently transparent intelligence system. Towards that, we make an unexpected start with Louw's testimony. A new parliamentary committee on intelligence will soon take it further. We trust that equivalent information will come to light regarding the ANC and former homeland services that are now part of the expanded NIS." Kasrils Appointment Undesirable -- A second editorial on the same page believes Ronnie Kasrils' appointment as deputy defense minister "is neither necessary nor desirable." The paper points to the "irresponsible role he played in the events leading up to the Bisho massacre of September 1992. Moreover, the key police ministry is already under the control of a communist, Sidney Mufamadi. The appointment of another, Kasrils, as the number two man at Defence could perturb a good few people at home and abroad who still remember old-style communist security machinations." BUSINESS DAY Secret Services Accountable to Parliament -- "One of the more challenging tasks for the new South African administration is to establish a network of spies which behaves decently and does not impinge on the rights of law-abiding citizens," begins Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 June in a page-6 editorial. "At the head of the network would probably be someone like National Intelligence Services director-general Mike Louw, who had the unusual experience this week of appearing before a public hearing to explain why his service should be given a budget of more than R400m [rand]." BUSINESS DAY believes governments cannot get by without intelligence services, however, "the important thing is that secret services should be accountable to Parliament rather than to the executive of government, which would soon be tempted to get involved in the intrigue, and start justifying secret funds and all the excesses that go with them."
