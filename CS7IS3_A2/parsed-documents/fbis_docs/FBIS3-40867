Although this budget stems from the "philosophy" of the so-called government program on the basis of which the parliamentary majority gave its vote for the present government, the finance law is unable to deliver what the said program urges with regard to encouraging investment and creating a suitable atmosphere for it. It is known that the first condition for investment is the availability of clear and precise resources in the proposed state budget. But it is observed that the proposed investment budget represents only seven percent of the GDP. This is a poor average compared with that of the budgets of the early eighties, which reached 15 percent. Even this poor average remains vulnerable, because it is basically linked to Morocco's obtaining foreign loans that the government expects to reach $2 billion in 1994. In addition to the fact that this will increase Morocco's foreign debts, it is not certain that these amounts can be obtained. This means that the investment budget will continue to be dependent on these foreign finances, which remain mere possibilities. Therefore, it can be said that the field of public investment will not develop; rather it will continue to follow the same direction that the successive previous governments followed since the policy of structural reform began. This policy has led to a crisis, which is reflected in particular on the fields of employment and the citizens' social conditions. With regard to employment, this year's budget promises to create 25,000 jobs, an increase of 10,000 jobs compared with 1993. But official data tell us that tens of thousands of graduates will enter the job market every year, some of whom have been unemployed for more than 10 years. The budget submitted this year will not be able to absorb the hundreds of thousands of unemployed blue-and white-collar workers. Also, establishing a special fund for the employment of youngsters with a capital of 100 billion centimes creates the problem of how can this amount can be utilized in order to get maximum benefit from it and to solve part of the problem of the unemployed youths with professional, scientific, and intellectual capabilities. On the one hand there is the problem of structuring the loans and the rate of interest on them and the guarantees that are difficult to obtain. On the other, the general climate is not helpful for the establishment of small- and medium- sized contracting companies. The difficulties include administrative obstacles and the lack of infrastructure, equipment, and land. Therefore, the problem of unemployment remains an urgent matter in the field of Moroccan economy. It is not enough for the budget to come up with promises about job creation and the establishment of a fund in order to overcome chronic, structural problems. The weakness of the social aspect is also reflected in the 1994 budget, both on the level of wages and of reforming of a number of sectors, the most important of which, for example, is the housing sector. The [finance] minister's statement contains quick references to this sector, which should be dealt with in a manner categorically different from the past. The housing sector cannot remain a source of quick and exorbitant profits or be subject to speculation and monopoly as is the case now. It appears that this year's budget is no different from the previous ones in dealing with such urgent social issues. This is because it is a budget stemming from a government program embodying the perpetual pattern the Moroccan governments have been following for the past 10 years. This is due to pledging financial commitments with a narrow scope which adversely affect social conditions and public investment. Perhaps the citizens now wonder: What is the strategy on which this budget is based? It is known that the present government has no economic policy now that the years of a planned economy are over. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the budget is not based on any economic precedent. Although it is not based on a planned and publicly open economic policy, it is based on the state's principal constants that have dealt with the economic and financial situation from a class viewpoint which led to enriching the rich and impoverishing the middle class and the poor. The [government's] answer to these social problems is to ignore them sometimes, to remain silent about them other times, and yet other times, resort to bludgeoning.
