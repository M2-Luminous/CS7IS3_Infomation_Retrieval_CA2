The vote might be a very narrow one. Some people doubt that enough of the 518 deputies will come to Strasbourg. [Klepsch] I think this is a fairy tale. So far, there have been far more deputies present in each plenary week than are necessary for such a vote. I do not see why this should be different this week, unless there are deputies who are present but do not want to participate in the vote for political reasons and intend to block the accession of these countries in this way. [Weixler] It is assumed that the southern countries, in particular, might express their displeasure about enlargement. [Klepsch] I do not get this impression from the southern countries to such an extent. I think that it is rather colleagues from the Netherlands, France, and Belgium who think that the concessions, which the Council has so far made concerning the deepening of the EU are insufficient. [Weixler] Will their abstention endanger a favorable vote? [Klepsch] A total of 259 votes in favor must be achieved. If someone does not want to vote in favor, he can do three things: be present and vote against, be present and abstain from voting, or not participate in the vote at all. [Weixler] Perhaps the vote will not be taken at all. Some members of the Parliament, such as the Greens, want to postpone the vote. The Institutional Committee of the EP has also applied to assign the vote to the next parliament. [Klepsch] The parliamentary groups have decided to hold the vote on 4 May. However, standing orders permit bringing a motion at any time to suspend or postpone a vote. We have agreed to have this done shortly before the final vote. [Weixler] This means tension until Wednesday at 1700. If the vote is taken, it does not mean that agreement on enlargement is ensured. [Klepsch] There were some conditions that the Parliament wanted to have clarified before the vote, and this clarification has largely taken place. The first condition was that the entire text of the treaty must be available in all the languages of the EU in time -- that is, by mid-April at the latest -- so that that committees have the opportunity to examine it in detail. [Weixler] Some deputies are very annoyed that the text of the treaty was pushed through in two weeks. [Klepsch] This may be, but the Council did keep its word. The second question is the assessment of the compromise achieved in Ioannina on the future blocking minority and the qualified majority. There I must say that in Ioannina the foreign ministers actually decided to set down what was desired by the Parliament. There is only one ambiguity on one point, namely that there may be certain delays concerning votes in the Council. However, this is a normal practice of the Council, one that we already have at the moment. [Weixler] Has the Ioannina compromise been sufficiently clarified to make the members of the Parliament agree? [Klepsch] There are certainly some who do not think that this has been sufficiently clarified, but I personally think that it is all right. The third question was the preparation of the revision conference in 1996, at which the great reform of the EU institutions is to be started. In this connection, it was set down in Ioannina that the Parliament is to be involved. The detailed conditions still have to be negotiated. [Weixler] The French do not seem to be particularly happy about the increasing superiority of Germany in the EU. In connection with Austria, there is still the specter of the "German bloc" haunting the discussions. Do these fears also play a role for the French behavior at the vote? [Klepsch] I do not believe so. Because, luckily, our Parliament has been divided along political lines and not along nations; otherwise it would never have worked. And the central problem in voting is always to which line one belongs and not to which nationality. A greater difficulty seems to be that some smaller nations are examining very carefully to what extent the key positions that they have had so far will be weakened by enlargement. [Weixler] Some countries are grumbling that the would-be members were granted too many concessions at the negotiations. Did the EU permit itself to be overpowered by the would-be members? [Klepsch] I think that the result of the negotiations was balanced and that it is approved of by the great majority of the Parliament. [Weixler] What result do you expect of the vote? [Klepsch] A sufficient one. [Weixler] A little more specific, please: 259 in favor, or 280, or how many? [Klepsch] More than 280. [Weixler] If we theoretically supposed that the vote ended in a "no," what would happen then? [Klepsch] Then the whole matter would have to be sent back and new negotiations might have to take place. [Weixler] But that would delay membership by years. [Klepsch] Not necessarily by years, but it would certainly mean a delay. One must see that we already have a delay now, because the negotiators on both sides, the Council and the would-be members, did not stick to the original date of 31 December 1993. Thus we are now five months late. [Weixler] Does the fact that they will find valuable allies in the new member countries in some fields promote enthusiasm for enlargement on the part of European members of parliament? [Klepsch] We proceed form this premise. I also believe that the new member countries will strengthen transparency and democracy. All the would-be member countries have a stable democratic structure, a stable economic development, and are good models of liberal rule-of-law states. This will strengthen the central structure of the EU. [Weixler] Since the Maastricht Treaty the Parliament has more power than ever, but it seems that the European people still think of it as a debating club, which basically has nothing to say. How do you want to change this image? [Klepsch] This image is completely unjustified. I do not know any parliament that works more than the European Parliament. For instance, the Parliament is not to be blamed because the association treaties with Poland and Hungary took more than two years to be ratified. We ratified them immediately, but the national parliaments took their time. By the way, the same might also happen with the ratification of the membership treaties. [Weixler] This might also take two years? [Klepsch] I hope not, but that depends on the national parliaments.
