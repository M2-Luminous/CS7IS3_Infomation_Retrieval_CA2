"It is out of the question that our planes from Udbine were flying over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Srpska republic. Our own airspace is sufficient for us, and we have no need for any Air Force activities over those areas." "We do not want to interfere in the fighting between our brothers from the Srpska republic and the Muslims, knowing that our brothers have enough strength and knowledge to resist the Muslims, who, particularly in recent days, have abused all cease-fires for new armed actions against the Serbs," Martic said. He said that the misinformation about the RSK military activities over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina had originated from BORBA.
