The talks are expected to begin tomorrow, Saturday, with the North Korean delegation visiting Tehran headed by Air Force Commander General Cho Myong-nok. The Iranian side in the talks will be headed by Revolutionary Guard Commander General Mohsen Reza'i. Gen. Cho arrived in Tehran yesterday at the head of a delegation of 28 scientists, technicians, and officers. This is the first time in a decade that a North Korean high-level military delegation officially visits a noncommunist state. The issue of additional cooperation in the field of ballistic weapons will top the agenda. Iran had originally purchased about 800 Soviet-type Scud missiles from North Korea but it is now investing in the development of a new version of the Scud-C missile known as Nodong-2 [number as published] with a range of 600 miles, according to Western experts. The new missile can carry chemical and nuclear warheads and hit almost any Middle Eastern capital. The first version of that missile was scheduled to be tested in Iran last September but the testing was postponed at the last moment, probably because the two parties were worried about the presence of U.S. spy satellites and AWACS planes in the region. The strength of Iranian-North Korean relations could perhaps be gauged on the basis of the number of visits exchanged between the two countries. North Korea is the only country in the world to have visited Iran's leader 'Ali Khamene'i and all his important aides including President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. [passage omitted]
