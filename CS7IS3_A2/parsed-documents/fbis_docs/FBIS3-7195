The two Koreas have placed their armies on alert following the U.S. decision to station patriot missiles in South Korea. Administrator David Cortin of the Overseas Workers' Welfare Agency said there are some 6,000 registered Filipinos in South Korea. Cortin said the contingency plan for these Filipinos has been activated in the event the situation in Korea worsens. The Philippine Government is concerned over the breakdown of U.S-North Korean dialogue over the nuclear arms inspection issue. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo said the breakdown in the talks may isolate North Korea which may lead to a miscalculation from a nuclear perspective. Referring to fears of war in the Korean peninsula, President Ramos said support must continue for those seeking the right path to peace. In the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Blas Ople said a war in the Korean peninsula can put the Philippines and other nations under obligation to send combat troops to fight under the United Nations flag. Ople's fear is shared by Senator Rodolfo Biazon who warned that moving Asian and UN troops the frontline will escalate tension which can explode into a full confrontation.
