Ortiz Lara was arrested last night on charges linked to drug trafficking, the 3 March shootout, and the release of two people involve in this shootout. He also is accused of administrative crimes. At 1400, Baja California Governor Ernesto Ruffo also held a news conference. Jaime Flores, can you tell us what he said? [Flores] Governor Ernesto Ruffo's news conference ended not more than five minutes ago. He came from the capital to meet with the press and give his views on Sergio Ortiz Lara's arrest yesterday, as you have already noted. Mr. Ruffo said he considers the Federal Attorney General's Office as being completely politically irresponsible in the way it has handled these conjectures. Ruffo said the arrest is based solely on theory and not on hard facts. In a sense, he supports Sergio Ortiz Lara. Ruffo has asked the federal government for more transparency and openness in its actions. He said that coordination--as required between state institutions and the federal government--must exist in incidents such as this. I questioned Mr. Ruffo during the news conference on the statements made this morning by Sergio Ortiz Lara. Ortiz Lara had indicated that these actions not only harm the Attorney General's Office, but they also harm other federal institutions and Ernesto Ruffo's government. In this regard, Ruffo said openness and transparency were needed, and he added that the government needs to avoid conjectures or empty theories, because it cannot operate under such conditions. Ruffo said authoritarianism is not the way such issues should be handled. He added that on this occasion the authorities had fallen into authoritarianism. In conclusion, he said--after I had asked him whether this problem had become imminently political in nature--that the current situation of confrontation will prevent democracy from progressing. The truth is that one must not act on conjectures. He said that soon he will try to meet personally with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and with Government Secretary Jorge Cartizo. He also said that, from his point of view, there is no relation between Sergio Ortiz's arrest and the murder of Municipal Security Director Federico Benitez. As everyone knows, Benitez was gunned down last Thursday at La Mesa while travelling with this bodyguard in an official vehicle. The state governor does not agree with the Federal Attorney General's Office handling of Ortiz Lara's arrest. He said this action is based on conjectures and not on hard facts. He also said the matter of Cristine's disco, which was mentioned by Attorney General Diego Valades, is nothing more than speculation, because there is no specific information involving Sergio Ortiz Lara. Unofficially, I would like to tell you that it has been learned that an arrest warrant has been issued against former Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. As I already mentioned, he is considered responsible for having sold identification credentials to drug traffickers--in this case, to criminals who were killed at Cristine's during the shootout. [Announcer] What party is Juan Francisco Franco linked to? [Flores] Juan Francisco Franco Rios was, up intil two weeks ago, justice prosecutor. Of course, he belongs to the PAN [National Action Party] administration. This incident occurred barely one year after Ernesto Ruffo became governor. He has always been linked to drug trafficking matters. This information I am giving you is unofficial, although we will try to confirm it. A tight lid has been placed on this case. Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara depended on former Justice Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. This news is unofficial. It is very suspicious that just over a week ago he left his post and now no one know his whereabouts. The current prosecutor is Pedro Vidal Rosas. [Announcer] Furthermore, Jaime--please allow me to make a comment and remind our listeners of this--I read a report two weeks ago in which the governor of Baja California referred to rumors linking his brother to drug trafficking. He said that if this were true he would put his brother in jail. Now we are hearing that, according to investigations and the events of the past few days, there is an apparent connection between members of PAN--and, remember, this assertion is not mine--and drug trafficking, which has also been linked to the arrest of Baja California Assistant Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara. You also pointed out and wondered whether this is not becoming a political or partisan issue and whether both sides--government officials and the PAN--should be called upon to fully adhere to the law. [Flores] Well, reporter Ana Patricia asked Mr. Ruffo about that very same thing. His answer was this: Oh, the famous Claudio. He said it jokingly; he was smiling and calm. He said the only thing he knows about his brother is that he owes a debt to the Finance Secretariat involving some property he owns in a small town called Rosarito, 30 km south of Tijuana. He says his brother Claudio Ruffo's problems are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Finance Secretariat, to which he owes an unspecified amount of money, and he admitted that his brother is living on the other side of the border. He said, however, that he is not aware of any lawsuit against Claudio, adding that action should be taken against his brother or anyone else charged with drug trafficking. Ruffo added that he has 18 more months in office and that his goal is to combat crime. This is exactly what Mr. Ruffo said about his brother.
