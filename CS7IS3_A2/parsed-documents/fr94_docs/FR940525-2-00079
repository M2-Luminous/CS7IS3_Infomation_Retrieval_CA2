FR940525-2-00079 FR940525-2-00061 The applicant notes that while the Plan held the Mobile Home Loans, the Lorenzos and the Grubers were occasionally delinquent. However, the applicant explains that, in all instances, the borrowers quickly corrected these delinquencies and the loans were current at the time of the sale transaction described herein. The Plan received total investment income of $14,423 in connection with its investment in the Mobile Home Loans. The Plan also paid servicing fees to SAC with respect to the administration of the Mobile Home Loans. Such servicing fees were based on the receipt of a flat 11 percent interest rate. Income received above that rate was retained by SAC. Through December 31, 1988, the Plan recorded servicing fees of $1,571. Following this date, the reporting system was changed and the only entries that appeared were recordings of net interest income received by the Plan. No other fees were paid by the Plan in connection with this investment. d.
