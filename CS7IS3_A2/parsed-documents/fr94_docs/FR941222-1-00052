FR941222-1-00052 FR941222-1-00008 As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was performed using treatment in tanks as the current, or baseline, management practice, and treatment in surface impoundments as a plausible management scenario. For this waste, however, the worst-case management scenario, treatment in a surface impoundment, is also one of the current management practices. The calculated risks of increased cancer or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are presented in Table II&hyph;7. The data presented in this table represent seven samples collected from five azo dye-manufacturing facilities.
