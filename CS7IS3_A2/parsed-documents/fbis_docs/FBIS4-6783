FBIS4-6783 "dreas079_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Trade Union Urges South To Respond to Proposal Trade Union Urges South To Respond to Proposal SK2204152794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1517 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204152794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (GFTUK) in a statement today denounced the South Korean authorities's negative stand toward the DPRK's proposal for the convocation of a national conference and urged them to look straight at the nation's aspirations and respond to the proposal. Noting that the South Korean authorities showed a negative response to the proposal, saying "a conference oriented toward political propaganda is undesirable", the spokesman says this fully reveals their true color as flunkeyist traitors trying to plunge the nation into the scourge of war in league with outside forces, instead of sitting at a negotiating table with fellow countrymen to solve the question of national reunification independently. He said, "Our working class and the whole nation can never tolerate the criminal moves of the Kim Yong-sam group which is taking the extremely dangerous road to a nuclear war in league with outside forces, disregarding the proposal for the convocation of a national conference which was prompted by our warm love of the nation and the stand of national independence to bridge over the present difficulties and open a broad avenue for reunification through the great unity of the nation." "The South Korean authorities must immediately remove the checkbar which they dropped on the road ahead of the political parties, organizations and personages of broad strata in South Korea intending to participate in a national conference," the spokesman said. He called upon all the workers and other sections of people of South Korea to actively turn out in a patriotic struggle for the convocation of a national conference which would open up a short cut to reunification in the '90s.
