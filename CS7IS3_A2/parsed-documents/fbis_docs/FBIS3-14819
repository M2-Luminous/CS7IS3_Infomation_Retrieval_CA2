The statement by the prosecutor general, made public at a news conference held at the prosecutor's office, says: "The Russian Federation president has appealed to me to suspend the amnesty process ordered by the resolution dated 23 February of the Federal Assembly State Duma, entitled `On Declaring Amnesty for Political and Economic Prisoners.' I fully agree with the civic attitude and the content of this appeal by the head of state. "Many dozens of people were killed and over 1,000 were crippled in the May and October disturbances. There are widows, orphaned children, and sorrowing parents. Enormous material damage has been caused. However, the State Duma is forgiving all those people who are guilty of this. In accordance with its will, unrepentant organizers of mass disturbances, their instigators and perpetrators will be set free. Among them there are many people whose conscience is burdened with killings, pogroms, and robberies. The act of `political' amnesty, as the legislators have called it, will forever remain a black page in the history of Russian parliamentarism. "Despite this, as the Russian Federation prosecutor general, I have to think not only of the spirit but also of the letter of the law when I make a decision. The prosecutor in Russia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act. Nor does he have a right to legislative initiative enabling him to appeal to the State Duma for the resolution to be reconsidered. Therefore I have no choice: I resign as Russia's prosecutor general. "I am little concerned about my future. I have always felt strongly about Russia and its longsuffering people. I believe a golden age will come when truth will be called truth, a lie will be called a lie, virtue will be called virtue, and lawlessness will be called lawlessness. But it will come through the efforts of neither the patriot-communists, nor the supporters of Zhirinovskiy, nor yet through those of democrats who have debased their noble status as members of the Russian intelligentsia."
