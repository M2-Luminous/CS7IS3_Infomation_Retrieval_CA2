A municipal government official in charge of economy said that the co-operation will be in the fields of petrochemicals, metallurgy, complete sets of power generating units, telecommunications, electronics, tires, computers and bearings. Shanghai will list 100 key industrial projects, each scheduled to use over 10 million U.S. dollars, for co-operation in the forms of joint venture and co-operation. "This is aimed at helping the city to update its products so as to better compete in the international market," the official noted. While welcoming foreign investment in Shanghai, the municipal government will probe for new ways to use foreign capital in the construction of its second batch of urban infrastructure facilities, including power-generating units, a subway, the Pudong International Airport, the outer city ring road and a garbage treatment plant. It will co-operate with foreign chain stores in the forms of joint venture and co-operation and try to set up Sino-foreign foreign trade, commercial and wholesale companies, and trading companies with sole foreign investment as well as share-holding firms. According to statistics, Shanghai has absorbed a sum of 13 billion U.S. dollars and approved the setting up of more than 6,000 foreign-funded projects. Included are enterprises run by a total of 126 transnational companies. One third of the 100 major transnational industrial corporations have set up subsidiaries in the city.
