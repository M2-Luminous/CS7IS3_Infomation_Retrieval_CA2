Following talks with Vargas, Ruehe told journalists in Bonn today that both sides agreed that further savings have to be made relating to the cost of the aircraft. Ruehe confirmed that Germany and Spain will need a new fighter in the year 2002. The estimated price of each aircraft is now about 102 million German marks. This is "still too high," Ruehe said. Alongside Germany and Spain, the fighter is also being developed by Italy and France. Vargas stressed that the aircraft must also be competitive on the world market. According to the ministers, a Spanish armored brigade will be the first Spanish unit ever to take part in a Eurocorps exercise this year. The ministers also talked about the Partnership for Peace concept adopted by NATO with the Central and East European countries and the CIS states. In this regard, Ruehe referred to the Bundeswehr maneuver planned with Poland and Denmark in the Baltic Sea, while Vargas talked of Spain's intensive contacts with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.
