FBIS4-158 "drafr064_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Not Affected by Emergency Rules Police Not Affected by Emergency Rules MB0204120394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1143 GMT 2 Apr 94 MB0204120394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] his force was not affected by the emergency regulations and would continue its normal policing duties in cooperation with the SA Police [SAP] and Defence Force [SADF]. He described African National Congress President Nelson Mandela's remark that the KZP would be confined to barracks under the regulations as "reckless". "I don't know where on earth he gets that idea. We're an independent statutory force with our own police act." Earlier, SADF Natal spokesman Col Frans Verfuss said clarification was being sought on the precise role of the KZP under the emergency regulations. He added, however, that the KZP would continue its duties in the interim. In a telephonic interview later, Gen During said: "What clarification is necessary? There is nothing to clarify. They've left the kwaZulu Police completely out. "In other words, the regulations don't affect them. "As far as I'm concerned, we continue as in the past and according to the laws of the country." He said the KZP would continue cooperating with the SAP and SADF "as in the past". "There will be operations we'll also plan together." He said there were a few issues within the emergency regulations that required clarity, but as far as he was concerned, "the role of the KZP is not affected at all". He said confining the KZP to barracks would be doing the community a disservice.
