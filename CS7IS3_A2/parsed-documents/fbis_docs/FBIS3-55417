"One should wait," he declared to Ukrainian journalists in the airport. At the same time the deputy minister deviated from any comments regarding results of the Ukrainian-American negotiations held by the Ukrainian governmental delegation this week. Ukraine's Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov, head of the delegation, is still in the United State and will return to Kiev on Monday. Ukrainian officials are expected to voice their statement on the result of the negotiations the same day. Meanwhile, the official press release distributed by the Ukrainian Embassy to the United States says that "during the consultations held by the Ukrainian delegation in the US State Department the parties focused their attention on economic development of two countries." The document says that in the course of a meeting between members of the delegation with the US President Bill Clinton "the parties have discussed a wide spectrum of issues related to bilateral relations between Ukraine and United States and, in particular, prospects of expansion of economic relations between two states, military-political problems, and international security issues." The negotiations paid special attention to the discussion of a program of negotiations of the Ukrainian governmental delegation which is scheduled to visit the United States late January. In Pentagon the parties signed a statement on principles related to the creation of an American-Ukrainian committee on defense industry conversion. The press release contains no information on tripartite Russian-Ukrainian-American consultations on nuclear disarmament.
