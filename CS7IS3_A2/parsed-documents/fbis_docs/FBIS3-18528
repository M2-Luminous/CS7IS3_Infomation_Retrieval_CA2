The National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini rejects the proposition of an incongruous group to lead the country in advance. In this interview with IL GIORNALE, Fini again proposes presidentialism as the unifying theme of the antiprogressive alignment and gives [Northern League leader] Bossi a taste of his own medicine. [Guiglia] The League leader continues to call you "a Fascist." Were you not allies? [Fini] If I were Bossi, I would have to reproach him for his communist past which emerges each time he is in difficulty. Unless this explains the favor done to [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto each time that Bossi attacks the forces in the antiprogressive alignment. He can continue shouting. He will not succeed in dragging me down to his level. The National Alliance differs from the League in two concepts: national identity and solidarity, things that Bossi does not attribute any importance to. So much the worse for him. [Guiglia] Do you also consider Forza Italia as being a party of "recycled people?" [Fini] I consider [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi as being a businessman that has demonstrated great courage. He has the undeniable virtue of never having drawn from the coffers of state to balance the accounts. This explains why the Left prefers someone like [Fiat manager] Agnelli who resorts to state-subsidized layoffs. Forza Italia may have given hospitality to some survivors of the regime in its lists. But denying that it represents a positive novelty, once again means playing the game of the PDS-monopolized front. [Guiglia] According to some people in the south, the Center-Right could also get some votes from the Mafia. What precautions have you taken to avoid such a risk? [Fini] For the time being we should begin by remembering that this is the thesis of Pino Arlacchi, who was much better as a sociologist. Now he is a progressive candidate and must create some ridiculous propaganda about the adversaries. The professor seems to have suddenly forgotten that a high-ranking boss, such as Madonia, has spoken of dangerous links between the PCI [former Italian Communist Party] and work contracts. However, he must at least remember that in all the south the right is advancing precisely by setting itself against the criminal Mafia gangs. We have certainly not changed our minds about the Mafia and the Camorra [Neapolitan Mafia] by asking for sentences that not only set an example, but also without reductions or benefits. [Guiglia] Do you see a "political solution" to the kickback scandal after the 27 March elections? [Fini] Those wanting to wipe the slate clean would do well to vote for the National Alliance. Two things are needed in order to turn over a new leaf on thefts by the regime: trials and the restitution of the stolen money by those who have subtracted trillions [of lire] from the country. [Guiglia] Do you still have faith in [Judge] Di Pietro or has the time come to change your mind after two years of "Clean Hands?" [Fini] I have not changed my opinion. I trusted Di Pietro before and I trust him now. I am not surprised that Bossi has changed his mind after the misadventures that forced him to present himself in court. [Guiglia] According to [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, the Center-Right cannot govern because it does not have a common program. What is your answer to the Pact for Italy leader? [Fini] Segni is nothing but a character looking for an author. His transformation will not give Italy a government. I am convinced that the voters will give a strong and clear indication as to the majority in parliament. If this is not the case, it would be better to return to the polls after having modified the confused electoral law. The direct election of the head of government will also be the ground upon which a new government alliance will be created. There are no prospects for the anomalous coalitions proposed by [Italian Popular Party Veneto regional secretary] Bindi in the first legislature of the Second Republic. Goodbye to the old coalition projects which will not be missed. [Guiglia] Goodbye to [President] Scalfaro as well? [Fini] New parliament, new government, new rules of the game: Can an "old" president of the republic remain at the Quirinale [president palace]? [Guiglia] What are the odds on the "return" of [former President] Cossiga? [Fini] The former head of the government lost an opportunity and I am sorry. He gives the impression of living in a fully-submerged submarine when he should be putting up his periscope. [Guiglia] The MSI [Italian Social Movement] has 34 representatives: What is the threshold of success for the National Alliance? [Fini] I am aiming at 100 representatives, but I will be happy with 70. Two years ago the Right was at 5.4 percent and it seemed a miracle. [Guiglia] Speaking of miracles: In order to achieve the "Italian" miracle should debts be cut first or should we invest in employment first? [Fini] The two priorities are not alternatives, they are complementary.
