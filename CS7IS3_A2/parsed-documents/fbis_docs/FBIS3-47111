The indefinite decision also applies to his relatives and officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]. Baharuddin Lopa, director general for corrections of the Justice Department, told reporters in Jakarta this afternoon that the decision was made because Xanana had discredited Indonesia's reputation in the international community by sending a letter to the Portuguese Government and the International Commission of Justice. Baharuddin Lopa said the Indonesian Government was generous enough to allow Xanana's family and ICRC officials to see him without the presence of any Indonesian official. Xanana, however, had abused the generosity by smuggling out the letter. According to Baharuddin Lopa, an agreement will automatically become null and void if either party violates it under international law. In the wake of the incident, the director general for corrections has instructed his subordinates to closely guard Xanana in case the rebel leader is again allowed to receive visitors.
