FR941013-1-00018 FR941013-1-00004 §381.9 Sales. (a) Except as provided in §381.9(b): (1) No operator of a Special Event Tour shall accept money for a seat on a Special Event Tour, or authorize an agent to accept such money, unless the operator has physical possession of, or written contracts (in the manner described in §381.7) for, a ticket for admission to the event for that individual. To the extent that the operator receives an unsolicited booking for which the operator does not have physical possession of or written contracts for a ticket for admission to the event, any payment accompanying that booking must be returned within 3 business days. (2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator may not sell more seats on the tour than it has event tickets in hand or under contract. (An operator need not continue to reserve an event ticket for an individual who withdraws from the tour by providing notice to the operator or by being notified by the operator that the individuals participation has been canceled due to failure to remit a required installment payment.) (b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and payment from an individual for whom the operator does not have an event ticket in hand or under contract if that individual agrees in writing that he or she understands that no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person. If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections of this rule from that time. §381.11 Refunds. If promised admission to the primary event for which a Special Event Tour was organized is not furnished by the tour operator, at the tour price agreed to before departure (including any increases that the participant has accepted pursuant to §381.13(a)), the operator must provide each tour participant affected in this way a refund of the total tour price. This refund is to be provided within 14 calendar days after the scheduled return date of the tour. §381.13 Price increases. (a) Should the tour operator increase a participant's tour price by more than 10 percent (aggregate of all increases to that participant), that participant shall have the option of canceling his or her participation in the tour and receiving a full refund within 14 days after the cancellation. (b) The tour operator shall not increase the tour price to any participant less than 5 days before departure. 2. To amend Title 14, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 380 as follows: A. Remove the term Super Bowl charter from the definitions in §380.2. B. Amend §380.18, ``Charters for special events,'' to add a new paragraph (f): * * * * * (d) Where the charter operator represents that the charter includes admission to the special event, the charter shall comply with part 381 of this subchapter.
