FR941031-2-00047 FR941031-2-00040 Kadane Corporation, 8/24/94, LEE&hyph;0103 Kadane Corporation filed an Application for Exception from the requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;23, the ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves.'' Kadane Corporation claimed that it lacked the necessary technical personnel to provide the information requested in Form EIA&hyph;23 and that it no longer obtains that information for its own purposes. In considering the request, the DOE found that there were no technical personnel required to complete the form other than those already employed by Kadane. The DOE also concluded that the firm was not suffering a serious hardship and was not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different from the burden borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, the DOE denied Kadane Corporation's Application for Exception. Remedial Order Economic Regulatory Administration, 8/23/94, LCX&hyph;0012 The DOE issued a Decision and Order modifying a 1987 Remedial Order issued to Storey Oil Company, Inc. See Storey Oil Co., Inc., 16 DOE ¶83,007 (1987) (1987 RO). The 1987 RO had been remanded by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a recalculation of the retail overcharges based on new evidence introduced in the FERC proceeding. See Storey Oil Co., Inc., 65 FERC ¶61,216 (1993). In response to the remand, the DOE's Economic Regulatory Administration submitted a recalculation of the retail overcharges for inclusion in a modified Remedial Order. In considering the ERA's recalculation, the DOE rejected Storey's various arguments in opposition to the issuance of a revised remedial order, including Storey's argument that the recalculation was inconsistent with the reseller-retailer price rule, l 10 CFR 212.93. Accordingly, the DOE modified the 1987 RO to reduce the retail overcharges from $61,071.48 to $47,549.90. Refund Applications Enron Corporation/Aristech Chemical Corporation, 8/24/94, RF340&hyph;152 Aristech Chemical Corporation (Aristech) submitted an application for refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding. The DOE determined that Aristech had acquired the assets, including the right to refund, of USS Chemicals. The DOE found that USS Chemicals used Enron propane as a feedstock to produce certain olefins, primarily ethylene, and therefore that Aristech was entitled to a refund for USS Chemical's purchases from Enron under the presumption of injury for end-users of Enron products. The total refund granted to Aristech, including interest, is $820,193. Enron Louisiana Energy Co., 8/26/94, RF272&hyph;92434 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refund of Enron Louisiana Energy Co. in the Subpart V crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. The Application for Refund was based on purchases of petroleum products the applicant used in the processing of natural gas liquid products (NGLPs). Enron failed to prove it was injured by crude oil overcharges because it made no demonstration that it was unable to pass on those overcharges to its customers in its sales of NGLPs. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied. Texaco, Inc./J&J Oil Co., Inc., 8/22/94, RF321&hyph;7211 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by J&J Oil Co., Inc. (J&J), a petroleum products reseller, in the Texaco, Inc. special refund proceeding. J&J requested a refund above the volumetric presumption level of $0.0011 per gallon on the grounds that it had been disproportionately overcharged by Texaco during the refund period. In considering the firm's claim, the DOE found that J&J was likely overcharged by Texaco in the amount of $0.02778 per gallon of propane purchased during the period September 1, 1973 through December 31, 1978. This determination was based upon the findings in a Remedial Order issued to Texaco. Although the total amount of the likely overcharges was $193,277, the DOE found that the firm's maximum potential refund was $21,440 since its banks of increased costs indicated that it had passed through the remainder of the overcharges. The firm also established through the competitive disadvantage methodology that it was injured by Texaco's likely overcharges. The DOE also determined that the interest that accrued on the likely overcharges prior to the effective date of the Texaco Consent Order should be considered in determining J&J's refund. After prorating the firm's maximum potential refund plus pre-settlement interest by the ratio which the Texaco consent order amount bears to the aggregate overcharge amount alleged by the DOE in all enforcement proceedings settled by the Texaco Consent Order, the DOE found that J&J is entitled to a refund of $67,895 (including a pro rata share of the interest that has accrued since the Texaco settlement funds were deposited with the DOE). J.E. Dewitt, Inc., 8/23/94, RF321&hyph;17022 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding on behalf of J.E. Dewitt, Inc. (Dewitt), a reseller of Texaco products. Dewitt sought a refund equal to 60 percent of its full allocable share based on its purchases of Texaco motor gasoline. In support of its claim of injury above the medium-range presumption level, the firm submitted reconstructed cumulative banked gasoline costs. However, rather than demonstrating inquiry by the competitive disadvantage methodology, as would typically be the case, the firm attempted to show that it failed to achieve a historic profit margin based on its average margin in 1971. The DOE determined that Dewitt's inability to sell gasoline at its 1971 margin during a portion of the refund period may have resulted from a variety of factors unrelated to Texaco's alleged overcharges. Thus, Dewitt's profit margin data did not constitute a conclusive showing of injury. However, because the evidence did not show that the firm was not injured, Dewitt was granted a refund based on the medium-range presumption of injury.
