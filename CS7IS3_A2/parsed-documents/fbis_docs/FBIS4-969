These same sources point out that, during the clashes between the Obudus of Cross River State and the Vandeikya of Benue State, more than 550 houses were burned and some 2,000 Obudu villagers fled for fear of new attacks from their neighbors. Most of the wounded suffer from wounds inflicted by firearms and machetes. The military administrators of the two states, Captains Joshua Obademi of Benue State and Ibrahim Kefas of Cross River State, held a meeting over the weekend, after which they sent a strong warning to anyone who is found responsible for new outbreaks trouble between the two communities. Funds have been allocated by the two administrators to come to the aid of the victims. The drawing of the border between the two states at the time of the British protectorate, which is contested by the Vandeikya, is said to be the cause of the clashes between the Obudus and Vandeikya, according to evidence collected by the GUARDIAN.
