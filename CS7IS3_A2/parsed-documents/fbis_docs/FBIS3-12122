This coalition, regrouping MDN [Mobilization For National Development], FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], CARENA [Action Committee for National Reconciliation], and CCGN [Group of Citizens of the Greater North] chose the seventh anniversary of the Constitution to submit its resolution bill for parliamentary approval. It should also be pointed out that the Chamber of Deputies vice president presented his reflections on the 1987 Constitution to the press. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] On Constitution Day, very few legislators responded to the invitation from the office of the Chamber of Deputies. The parliament's commemoration of the seventh anniversary of our fundamental charter could have been as dull as the rest of the country's except for this reflection by Vice President Mac-Ferl Morquette on the importance of the Constitution. Today more than ever, the Constitution remains the only compass for legislators in conducting state affairs, said the PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti] deputy. Mac-Ferl Morquette explains that despite the jolts of national political life, this Constitution, guardian of our republican institutions, was able to stand the test of time. Reflecting on the concept of democracy, the vice president of the lower chamber recalled the ambiguous attitude of those elected on 16 December in the face of the Constitution's provisions. At the same time, he denounced the totalitarianist tradition, which had always characterized the practice of power in Haiti. Lack of tolerance and resistance to consensus are the main causes for our misfortunes, deplored Vice President Mac-Ferl Morquette. [passage omitted]. The political opponents of President Aristide chose precisely this 29 March to defend their political interests and draw the sheets to their side of the bed, launching a new initiative in their search for power. Indeed, in a joint resolution, CCGN, CARENA, FRAPH, MDN, and the Coordination Committee for National Mobilization invited senators and deputies to acknowledge the deliberate refusal of the president of the Republic to fill the presidential vacuum by applying Article 149 of the Constitution, creating a provisional ad hoc government within three days of the official presentation of this resolution on 29 March. Let us listen, successively, to statements by Hubert DeRonceray of MDN, Herve Leveille from CCGN, and Rony Durand from CARENA. [DeRonceray] "This resolution represents the united front we created so the political crisis could find national support. There are two important points in this resolution: First, we are asking the Chamber to take a stand on Article 149 of the Constitution in facilitating the formation of a provisional ad hoc government. We are saying that in case the Chamber does not take action concerning that point, there will be a national mobilization. Popular power will take on its responsibility to install an ad hoc government. [Leveille] ``I believe all Haitians will agree to find a national solution to this crisis. [Unidentified reporter] ``What kind of reaction did you get from the president of the lower chamber? [Leveille] ``The president is very concerned about the resolution. He promised to begin working on it this afternoon with the other presidents within the chamber.'' [Durand] [Words indistinct] mostly autonomy that we are making some proposals. That is how to understand it. The international community has its position. The national community has its own proposal. [Jean] It should be noted that in case it is not carried out by the deadline set by these political groups, they say the nation will fill the institutional vacuum by an act of public power and take measures to establish an ad hoc government. Its message is clear: We will move to option zero, the clean sweep. [end recording]
