K. Samokhvalov, Ulyanov Polytechnical Institute; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] Previous papers have outlined the basic physical phenomena behind electroluminescent structures and the processes which occur in the luminophore and dielectric layers. However, no electric model of electron processes in the electroluminescent structure of thin film capacitors has been developed. A thin film electroluminescent capacitor consists of a transparent electrode, dielectric, luminophore, dielectric, and opaque electrode on a glass substrate. The electric properties of the luminophore layer are nonlinear. In the equivalent circuit this is modeled with a capacitor with a capacitance equal to the geometric capacitance of the luminophore layer connected in parallel to a nonlinear resistance. The dielectric layer is modeled with capacitors whose capacitances are geometric capacitances of the dielectric film connected in parallel with variable resistors. A full schematic is given in a figure. The real thin film electroluminescent capacitor and the model were compared. It was found during testing that volt-charge characteristics could be used for quality control. The time dependence of current was determined for a sinusoidal and linearly alternating voltage. The model provides an adequate representation of electron processes in thin film electroluminescent structures.. The model may be modified to represent more complex effects.
