FBIS3-7246 "dreas059__a94028" FBIS-EAS-94-059-A Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan DPRK News on Oil Field Viewed Suspiciously OW2603121094 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Mar 94 Evening Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2603121094 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Information has circulated among people familiar with Japanese-North Korean relations that "a promising oil field" has been discovered in the eastern sea, east of the Korean peninsula. However, the Japanese Government and industries concerned are uncertain whether it is true. Also, details, such as the exact location of the oil field and the amount of oil deposits, are unknown. A government source said that in light of the facts that the world has increased its suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear development program and that relations between the DPRK and the international community remain strained, "this could be a part of North Korea's information manipulation aimed at dispelling domestic concern over possible economic sanctions by the United Nations." An influential source, who met with North Korean officials between last yearend and early this year, said he was told that the DPRK "discovered an oil field" and that Pyongyang planned to designate the area as a "special economic zone" and would welcome Western nations' cooperation in developing the oil field. Another source said the information on the discovery of the oil field has circulated in various parts of the DPRK. It is said that the DPRK began oil exploitation in Hungnam district in the eastern sea around 1986. It is thought that because Russia has discontinued its aid to the DPRK, and because China, which is DPRK's most friendly nation, has called on Pyongyang to buy oil at internationally traded prices, Pyongyang has keenly felt the need to develop energy sources on its own. About a year ago, information circulated that the evidence of an oil field was discovered in the waters off the east of the Korean peninsula. It is said that a Japanese company was asked to cooperate in digging out the oil field. However, the matter reportedly ended in smoke later on. Sources concerned pointed out that the recent information on the "discovery of an oil field" could be "propaganda to uplift the spirit of the North Korean people" in view of the fact that it has circulated when suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear development program is increasing. The Japanese Government has taken a cautious attitude on this issue. The Natural Resources and Energy Agency said: "We have not confirmed that the information is true." Also, on cooperation by Japanese firms in developing the oil field, a Foreign Ministry source said: "It is impossible at present for the government to join in such cooperation."
