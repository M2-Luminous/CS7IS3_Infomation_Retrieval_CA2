"We are concerned," Kumano told reporters while commenting on the yen's rise following a weekend meeting in Germany by finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. Kumano said Japan's policy stance that its trade surplus should be slashed through expansion of domestic demand instead of foreign exchange adjustments was understood at the group's meeting. The representatives from Germany and Italy supported Japan's appeal for a stable foreign exchange market, he said.
