The high-ranking official pins great hopes for their solution on the second meeting of the bilateral intergovernment commission on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation, which will open here on Wednesday, on the eve of the visit by Russian Premier Viktor Chrnomyrdin to China. Its participants led by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin who will come to Beijing on Wednesday, and Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing will discuss prospects for transition to new forms of trade and methods of regulating border trade turnover and cooperation in agriculture and the transfer of technologies. "The two partners should advance major companies to forward positions in trade and investment," Geng claimed. This is necessary to avoid barter which is responsible for 65 per cent of Chinese- Russian trade turnover up to this time as well as to escape a drop in bilateral trade relations which took place in the first quarter, he added. According to Geng, China is interested in establishing full- fledged business realations in such priority areas as the aerospace industry, chemistry, machine-building and pharmaceutics. Experts will also concentrate on the transport problem containing the growth of Russian-Chinese trade relations. Russian enterprises have good prospects for participating in the construction of a mammoth hydropower development, "Sanxia", on the Jangtze River, which is called here "the most spectacular project after the Great Chinese Wall". Russian trade representative in China Aleksandr Kachanov is also optimistic about prospects for cooperation. "The order book of Russian enterprises for the delivery of complete plant to China up to the year 2000 is worth 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for signed contracts alone," he said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS later in the day. Russia is among leading suppliers of machinery to the Chinese market. It helps to retool several industrial enterprises, including major fuelled power plants and participates in designing a nuclear power station with a capacity of two million kw in the Liaoning Province. "It is self-evident that support from state bodies of the two countries is necessary to realise the potential of our relations. We pin great hopes on the meeting of the intergovernment commission," Kachanov stressed. Many Chinese businessmen engaged in operations with Russian partners have got reasons to review their calcualtions and plans. President Boris Yeltsin's decree on repealing quotas on and licencing of exports, the text of which has just been circulated by the XINHUA news agency, makes a new ten-billion barrier in bilateral trade turnover possible.
