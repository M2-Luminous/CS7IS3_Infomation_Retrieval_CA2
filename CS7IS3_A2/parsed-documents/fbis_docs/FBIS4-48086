It was also obvious that two of the most important players in the African National Congress had been sidelined, deliberately or systematically. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa was excluded from the cabinet of the National Assembly as it gathered in Cape Town. Jay Naidoo, the fiery former general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, is Minister Without Portfolio. While it is said Ramaphosa's omission was at his own request, it indeed has a far-reaching effect on the ANC-South African Communist Party-COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] alliance. Added to that is the fact that Naidoo was tipped for the portfolio of Minister of Manpower in the ANC government. It is prudent, therefore, that an attempt be made to chart the power design of the ANC alliance, as led by man-in-the-middle President Nelson Mandela. -- Ramaphosa shouldered the primary responsibility of negotiating the new dispensation on behalf of his party. He was second on the ANC list after Mandela and as such was the natural choice for first executive Deputy President. However, the riddle remains. Ramaphosa accepted his current post in the ANC in 1991 on the workers' ticket. He was then general secretary of the powerful National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] which formed the bulk of COSATU membership. -- Naidoo once intimated in an interview that he was the person most employers loved to hate. And he was depicted in some newspaper cartoons as the devil incarnate, complete with horns. It was, after all, COSATU that designed the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. Therefore, argument is that the RDP was watered down considerably before being accepted. This indicates trade unionists, or workers, in the alliance were being pressured down for pushing hardline economic policies. The fact of the matter is that COSATU bolstered the ANC election campaign when it agreed to fight the poll under its banner. There are other pertinent factors to the ANC power design, namely, the ANC's internal wing during its twilight years in exile. -- The United Democratic Front [UDF] held the movement's banner, especially bringing to a head the country's politics in the mid-1980s. While it is not surprising that important former UDF leaders Popo Molefe and Patrick Lekota were nominated for premier posts, it becomes clearer that this sector of the broader ANC movement was being appeased, or accommodated, in the power design. Molefe is premier for the Northwest province, while Lekota heads the [Orange] Free State parliament. The two men were instrumental in resistance campaigns, which saw them being jailed in the marathon Delmas Trial in the aftermath of the 1984 anti-high rent unrest in Vaal Triangle townships. The argument goes even further. -- The appointment by Mandela of aging former ANC secretary-general Alfred Nzo to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs has been met with wide criticism. Debate surrounding his appointment, albeit political, emphasises another attempt to accommodate the ANC's former exiled leadership in the cabinet. Charismatic Thabo Mbeki, executive Deputy President-elect, falls in this category even though he was favoured for the Foreign Ministry portfolio. Dr Pallo Jordan was the obvious choice for Minister of Information as head of the ANC's department of information and publicity. -- Then there is the ANC's "old guard" -- Mandela's men, so to speak. Here one refers to the Rivonia trialists, but the only conspicuous appointment is that of Govan Mbeki as Eastern Cape premier. Poignantly, if workers within the ANC alliance were to ally themselves with the Ramaphosa-Naidoo cabal -- which is not formal, perhaps not yet -- a powerful anti-ANC party on the workers' ticket could emerge. But it is Ramaphosa who will be in focus post-May 10. He has yet to explain why he "requested" not to be in the cabinet as Mandela announces his men and women in government in Pretoria tomorrow. It is also widely believed Ramaphosa turned down the offer of Foreign Minister after he failed to become Deputy President. Another argument, however, is that although he did a fine job as NUM general-secretary there is a view among the ANC youth leaders that he was not really in "the struggle" because he negotiated with management in the comfort of boardrooms. Indeed, as the celebrations end and after Mandela has reluctantly sipped the ugly-smelling stuff called champagne at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Cyril Ramaphosa and Jay Naidoo will be the men to watch.
