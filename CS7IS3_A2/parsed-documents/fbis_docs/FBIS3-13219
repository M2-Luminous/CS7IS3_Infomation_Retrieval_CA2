[Darawshah] We have come to offer our condolences and perform a social, pan-Arab, and humanitarian duty. We are not carrying any messages or carrying out any political mission. [Humaydi] Do you believe that the visit will contribute to pushing the peace negotiations forward? [Darawshah] The aim of the visit is not to give an impetus to or influence the negotiations. However, if it secures better conditions, we welcome that. But I stress that that is not the aim. The aim is to perform a duty. [Humaydi] Who are the officials you will meet with during the three days you are to spend in Damascus? [Darawshah] We wish to hold political meetings, and, of course, we are not going to embark on anything of that kind without coordination with the Syrian brothers. [Humaydi] What about the possibility of contacts with those opposed to the Oslo accord? [Darawshah] That is up to the brother Syrian hosts. We have no reservations about any meeting. [Humaydi] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement between Israel and the PLO? [Darawshah] We advocate ending the occupation, establishing an independent Palestinian state, and achieving a just and comprehensive peace -- a peace of the brave, as President al-Asad called it. I believe that Arab strategy is a peace strategy, and Yitzhaq Rabin's government is required to make goodwill gestures by announcing its acceptance of the land-for-peace principle, agreement to implement resolutions 242 and 338, and willingness to end the occupation of the occupied Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan, so that rights will be restored to their legitimate owners. Then there would be a real possibility of achieving peace in the region. We are struggling in two directions: the first is to achieve peace, end the occupation, and provide every possible support for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories so that they can obtain their freedom and independence; the second is to obtain our rights as citizens, because we are suffering from the policy of racial discrimination at all levels. There is discrimination against anyone who is not a Jew. [Humaydi] What is your view of a solution to return the parties to the negotiating table? [Darawshah] As I said in the Knesset, the Israeli Government must make goodwill gestures; restrain the settlers; guarantee international protection for the Palestinians, who are subjected to repression, torture, and massacre; and declare its willingness to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers. [Humaydi] And if that does not happen? [Darawshah] International efforts are under way to find a solution to these issues. We are awaiting a resolution from the Security Council, and I hope the council's resolution will be in line with the Palestinian demands. [Humaydi] You were not offered a ministerial portfolio. Will you be offered one when peace is established? [Darawshah] We have demanded our rights and rejected injustice and discrimination. Rabin has the desire to deal with us. But so far he is still refusing, and we are still insisting on our position and demanding our rights. Our rights are numerous, and we have not obtained them. Our lands and rights have been confiscated, and these are among the things which we will continue to demand. We also demand the return of the confiscated land, our national rights, and our rights as citizens.
