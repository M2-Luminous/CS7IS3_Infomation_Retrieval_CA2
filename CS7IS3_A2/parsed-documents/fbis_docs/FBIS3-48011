That date was the day of the merging of all scattered armed units set up in all regions throughout the country into the Lao Itsala Army. The event marked a major stage of growth and development for the revolution. [passage omitted] On the occasion of the historic founding anniversary of the LPA, we would like to express our overwhelming affection and gratitude toward the beloved and respected President Kaysone Phomvihan for having organized, educated, maintained, and provided leadership to our Army, thus enabling it to grow stronger and bigger, into the state it is in now. Beloved comrades and friends, looking back over the past 45 years, we can assume that the historic achievements and victories of our Armed Forces have been accomplished thanks to the correct and clear-sighted leadership of the LPRP. The party has consistently organized, guided, and educated our Army. Our party has creatively charted an overall military course for our Army in conformity with the conditions in each period. It has adopted a correct fighting strategy and a wise policy for the Army. It has skillfully employed and combined various effective forms of fighting together. Our party knows how to further enhance all potentials in the country and to closely combine them with the strength of the epoch. It has established a combat alliance with the fraternal Vietnamese Army and people and has solicited support and assistance from many friends and progressive forces throughout the world, thus winning glorious victories for our revolution. [passage omitted] In recognition of the great achievements and virtues of our Armed Forces, the party and state have decided to confer the National Gold Order, which is the most honorable medal of our nation, on the LPA for the second time on the occasion of its 45th founding anniversary. [Applause] [passage omitted] On the occasion of the anniversary of this historic day, once again, on behalf of the party and state as well as the Lao Armed Forces and people, I would like to express our profound gratitude to all friendly and fraternal countries for rendering effective and great assistance to the Lao Armed Forces and people and actively contributing to their national liberation struggle [in the past] and the tasks of national defense and development at present. [Applause] The multiethnic Lao people will always remember and are grateful to the Vietnamese cadres, volunteer combatants, and specialists and other internationalist combatants for making sacrifices to the Lao revolution. The virtuous deeds of these comrades will be recorded in the annals of the Lao nation forever. [Applause] Comrades and friends, our nation is firmly marching forward toward its destination by carrying out comprehensive restructuring. On the path of our advancement, we are blessed with numerous opportunities and favorable conditions. Nonetheless, we have also encountered numerous difficulties and trials. At present, even though a trend toward peace, stability, cooperation, and development is emerging, the situation still remains complicated and confused. Under these circumstances, our party and government must continue adhering to and pursuing a foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship, and cooperation, aimed at maintaining and further developing normal relations with all countries throughout the world -- and with neighboring countries first -- on the basis of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefits, and peaceful coexistence. We will continue, together with other peoples of the world, making contributions to the cause of peace and development. To create favorable conditions for national development, we must make and concentrate all efforts on safeguarding our national security, stability, and tranquility. This is the duty which must be firmly grasped and entered into by everyone with a sense of responsibility. First of all, all party and administrative committees, organizations and services from the center down to all localities must increase their sense of responsibility toward the tasks of national defense and public security maintenance work, linking them with all spheres of work and closely associating them with the socioeconomic development of our country. At the same time, we must pay attention to assisting and building the Armed Forces into a more powerful and effective force for defending and preserving forever the revolutionary fruits reaped with great sacrifices by our people. The party and command committees at all levels must make efforts to educate and train cadres and combatants in the Armed Forces to continue multiplying and increasing the glorious traditions of the LPA and our nation and enhance the tradition of patriotism and their faith toward the country and party; to actively study and firmly grasp the party's restructuring policy and the state's policies and laws and to act as a model in implementing them; and to heighten a sense of vigilance and to stand ready to thwart all sinister designs of the enemies, thereby securely safeguarding the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and firmly ensuring its stability and tranquility. Efforts must be made to consolidate and strengthen the Armed Forces by raising their quality as a primary objective so as to gradually make them into a well- organized, strong, and modern revolutionary army. In the immediate future, efforts must be made to raise the level of their capabilities in leading, commanding, and maintaining combat preparedness; to encourage them to engage in studies to raise the level of their culture and specialized knowledge; to engage in training in both the tactical and strategic fields; to increase unity between cadres and combatants; to constantly improve the relations between the Armed Forces and people; to closely look after the party; to heighten a sense of self-dependence and self-building; and to act as a model in working diligently and living frugally. At the same time, we must enhance their actual roles and capabilities in making contributions to the socioeconomic development of the country, for example in the agricultural field, in building the economic and cultural infrastructure, and in providing public services.
