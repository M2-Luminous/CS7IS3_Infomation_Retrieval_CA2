Hewer: Two Largest Slovak Banks and Two Smaller Banks Are Having Problems"] [Text] Bratislava -- The two largest Slovak banks and two smaller institutions are having problems as a result of irrecoverable loans and lack of experience. Ulrich Hewer, representative of the World Bank in Slovakia, told the REUTER agency that the problems affect Slovenska Statna Sporitelna [Slovak State Savings Bank] (SSSP), Vseobecna Uverova Banka [General Credit Bank] (VUB), Investicna a Rozvojova Banka [Investment and Development Bank] (IRB), and Konsolidacna Banka [Consolidation Bank] (KB). The SSSP with a capital of 2.1 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] tops the ranking of 16 Slovak banks, the VUB with a capital of Sk2 billion is in second place and the largest creditor. The IRB is in fourth place and the KB in 11th place in terms of the size of their capital. "We think that the SSSP is having problems. Over the last two years it extended a large number of unreasonable loans. We have discussed the issue with the Slovak National Bank (NBS) and agreed that a solution will have to be found." The World Bank expects the SSSP and the other banks to be placed under control before it helps the Slovak Republic restructure the banking system. "We are waiting for the results of an audit, which should be available by the end of this month. A mission of inquiry will come to Slovakia in mid-June 1994 and these talks will hopefully lead to a solution." NBS representatives were not able to specify the size of the four banks' irrecoverable loans. They noted that in Slovakia no rules exist for rating risks. "We are in the initial stage of collecting information and the relevant documents." The "Memorandum" that the Slovak Government had prepared for the World Bank last fall noted that the SSSP did not have experience in lending money, even though it holds 90 percent of Slovak private deposits. "We are afraid lest its efforts to become a universal bank jeopardize its deposits." "I fundamentally disagree with Ulrich Hewer's view," says KB Director General Jan Pichonsky. He assumes that Ulrich Hewer may have arrived at his conclusion on the basis of an audit for 1993 that was carried out in the KB by the Deloitte & Touche company. Last week it submitted to the KB the final report, in which it recommends to the management that the bank increase the reserves prescribed by law to almost 10 times their present level. Jan Pichonsky considers the recommendation incorrect because "it does not correspond to the state of the Slovak legal system and to the reality." "The IRB denies Ulrich Hewer's assertion," says Vladimir Kovacik, IRB director general and member of the IRB Board of Directors. The IRB's positive situation is also documented by the 1993 auditors' report from the renowned British firm Ernst & Young. "We received the REUTER report at the time of the annual meeting of VUB shareholders, which approved the economic results for last year and a proposal for the division of profits. This proposal provides for the payment of dividends to shareholders at the amount of 10 percent of the shares' nominal value, that is, Sk100 per share. We were surprised by the formulations used by Ulrich Hewer from the World Bank and Peter Bajcik, the author of the REUTER report. We do not know the two gentlemen, who have neither visited the VUB nor have received any documentation from us," states a statement issued by VUB President Jozef Mudrik. "Our bank, as one of the successors to the Czechoslovak State Bank, has taken over some credits that had been extended under the command system of national economic management and the returnability of which is endangered. Over the past four years the VUB has increased the credit volume by only approximately 4 percent, which demonstrates that it has been extending new loans on a very limited scale. Therefore, it could not be extending any new bad loans," Jozef Mudrik states. "Because of our awareness of the problem of the quality of banks' credit portfolio, we were one of the first banks in the then CSFR to have its economic results and the quality of its credit portfolio verified by the international firm of auditors Coopers & Lybrant as early as 1991. We publish the results of these audits annually and send them to all our partner banks abroad. On the basis of these audits, the bank has been accepted by many foreign insurance companies and, on this basis, also by foreign partner banks, with which it is engaged in mutually beneficial partner relations," the VUB president's statement says in conclusion. [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 27 May on pages 1 and 2 carries a 700-word TA SR report on the REUTER report, and the Slovak banks' reactions to it, which includes the following additional passage on the NBS's reaction: "The NBS draws the attention of the population to the fact that deposits in the largest Slovak banks are guaranteed by the Slovak Republic and various conjectures about their safety are groundless. ["Bad loans occur in every economy and are no exceptional phenomenon. Only the extent of these loans can be exceptional. The situation in Slovak commercial banks is no worse than in other transforming economies, in which loans had been allocated in the past on the basis of administrative decisions. The NBS, in cooperation with state bodies, is aware of this problem and is ready to deal with it, after the appropriate analyses are carried out. On no account will the solution affect depositors. ["The NBS does not identify with the contents of the interview with a World Bank representative published by REUTER on 25 May and considers its overall tenor distorted. The NBS secures, in accordance with the law, the stability of the banking system, as is normal in all countries, and, in this process, it also holds talks with the World Bank and the IMF. The two institutions have not officially confirmed such an extent of the problem of bad assets as indicated by the REUTER interview. The NBS will consult on its contents with World Bank representatives in Washington."]
