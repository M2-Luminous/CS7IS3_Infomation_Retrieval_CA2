We extend our cordial festival greetings to the young people of various circles throughout the country! Young friends, in another six years we will step into the 21st century. At this historical moment, straddling two centuries, all people who are concerned with the destiny of the motherland -- and particularly this generation of young people, who represent the future and hope of the country and nation -- are faced with a question: What kind of attitude should they adopt in marching toward the new century? In a sense, the spiritual outlook of this generation of young people will determine, to a great extent, the future of the Chinese nation in the coming century. We are faced with tremendous opportunities for development, as well as stern challenges. The party and the people ardently hope that the young people of this generation will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of 4 May, have a sense of straddling the centuries, understand their responsibilities, shoulder the mission, and become a new generation that has lofty ideals and moral values, that studies hard, and that builds the country through arduous efforts. In the years running up to the 21st century, they should let their youthfulness radiate in the great cause of revitalizing the Chinese nation. To shoulder the historical mission of straddling the centuries, the fundamental thing is to arm the young people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to uphold the party's basic line firmly for 100 years. People can see clearly that the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism for contemporary China and is the only correct guide for the work of leading our country toward prosperity. We should stress this truth frequently and repeatedly, and in connection with vivid reality, and should tell it to this generation, as well as the next. From the high plane of the country's future and the nation's destiny, we should understand the far-reaching historical significance of applying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to educating the generation of young people. Both comprehensively improving the qualities of this generation of young people and training large numbers of outstanding people constitute important tasks for shouldering the historical mission straddling the centuries. In the final analysis, competition in the world is one of economic strength and comprehensive national strength, which is focused on science, technology, and qualified personnel. To meet the challenge of the new century, we should vigorously create conditions to help young people acquire knowledge of science and technology, as well as of the socialist market economy, and should endeavor to gain professional proficiency, improve their labor techniques, and master skills for the modernization program. Practice is the best classroom for training young people, and integration with the masses is the only way to raise young people. We hope that this generation of young people will inherit the glorious tradition of their predecessors and will go to the grass-roots levels and hardship posts, the places where they are most needed for reform and construction. They should accumulate experience in practice, absorb nutrition, temper their will, enhance their talents, and make contributions. They should establish a career and become useful people in the struggle to revitalize the nation and make the country strong and powerful. Molding people with a noble spirit and enhancing young people's level of socialist spiritual civilization is a major project that will continue beyond this century. It is necessary to highlight education in patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; help young people adopt a correct outlook on the world and life, as well as correct values; boost their national dignity and confidence, and the urge to make their country strong; and resist the corrosion of such decadent ideologies as money-worship, hedonism, and out-and-out individualism. Recently, a large number of advanced individuals have come to the fore among the young generation. Represented by Xu Honggang and others, they are exemplary in standing up for what is right and take pleasure in helping others. They have been playing a positive role in encouraging healthy trends and reversing unhealthy social trends. It is necessary to guide young people in learning from heroes and following the correct path; discover and bring up a larger number of advanced and exemplary individuals to attract, educate, and inspire the youth; and greatly upgrade the level of civilization and moral integrity of young people and of society as a whole. The Communist Youth League [CYL] is a mass organization of the youth and it shoulders an important responsibility in leading young people on their journey into the next century. We appraise highly the "Youth Civilization Project Beyond This Century" and the "Young Talent Project Beyond This Century" being implemented by the CYL. These two projects are in line with the party's requirements for youth, and with the demands placed on young people by the reform and construction of the country. We ardently hope that CYL organizations at all levels will stand on solid ground, work in a down-to-earth manner, organize and carry out projects in a painstaking manner, and strive to gain significant results. Party committees and governments at all levels should take good care of, and give energetic support to the CYL in conducting a wide and colorful variety of activities suited to the characteristics of young people. Various circles and departments in society should create still better conditions and environment for the growth of young people. Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the most important aspects of the work of the whole party and country this year. The youth-related work should be aligned to and serve these overall interests. A thousand-mile journey is begun by taking the first step. From now on, our young friends should have a sense of urgency which propels them to race against time. They should have their feet planted in the present and their eyes on the future, should study and work diligently with full enthusiasm and a down-to-earth attitude, and should greet the bell heralding the coming of a new century by creating excellent achievements that will give them a clear conscience before the older generations.
