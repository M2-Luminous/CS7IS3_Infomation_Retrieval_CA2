Gen. Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestine National Security Forces in the Gaza Strip, has stated that the Palestinian National Authority will arrest any person who collaborated with Israel or who will do so in the future outside the framework of the authority, provided that there is sufficient evidence. Asked about Israel's stance on the arrest of agents who collaborated with it, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in an exclusive interview that "this is an internal Palestinian affair. No one can compel us to pardon or to arrest anyone." He added that what we are doing on this matter is similar to what any other national authority in the world would do. On the stance of the National Security Forces in the event a joint patrol comes under fire by Palestinian opponents, he said his forces have security duties that they will implement regardless of the circumstances because our people support any measure that provides them with security and stability. Maj. Gen. Yusuf disclosed that the authority is holding constant contacts with the Hamas leadership, noting that there have been good results so far and that he is optimistic that an agreement will be reached. He said that he does not oppose peaceful demonstrations but that in the next stage such things will require a permit. On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said the main problem facing his forces is the shortage of funds, which the donor nations have promised to give to the Palestinian National Authority to pay the salaries of the security forces. He said: "They have given nothing, other than the vehicles provided by the United States." Maj. Gen. Yusuf said a 300-man police force is expected to arrive in the Gaza Strip today to join the current force estimated at 2,600 men. He added that 120 men from the Fatah Hawks have been merged with the national security forces in view of their security expertise and knowledge of the Gaza Strip.
