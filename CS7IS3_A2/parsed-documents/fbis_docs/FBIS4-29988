PWI said in its press release -- issued here on Wednesday -- that it can understand the government's reasons in cancelling the license of the three publications. The press release, which was signed by its chairman Tribuana Said, and secretary general Parni Hadi, noted that it believes the revocation will not slacken the participation of the Indonesian press in the national development and dampen the openness spirit among the public. The journalist association also proposed to the government to issue new licences for the three publications as soon as possible so that journalists of the three media can have their jobs. It called on the government and the public to go through legal mechanism or the press organization mechanism in handling cases concerning the press itself. It believes that revocation of publications licenses will not happen if such mechanisms are followed. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Newspapers Association (SPS) has also expressed its concern over the revocation. The press release, which was signed by its chairman Jakob Utama and secretary A. Bagyo Purwanto, said that the revocation should remind the press society that the implementation of the principles of "positive interaction between the press, the government and the public" did not yet function well.
