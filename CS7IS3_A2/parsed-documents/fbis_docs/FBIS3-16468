Arguing with advocates of a state of economic emergency in Russia, Professor Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's expert group, writes in the TRUD newspaper that 'the country needs, among other things, an appropriate law to impose a state of economic emergency in the country. 'The law would lay down under what conditions the state of emergency is imposed, for what period, what measures are being enacted and who takes the decision.' Livshits pointed out the absence of such a law at present. Therefore, he claims, 'the imposition of a state of economic emergency in our country is out of the question.' Noting that the Russian parliament should decide what laws should be drafted and adopted, the expert stressed the priority need for creating a legal basis for reforms. Livshits expressed opinion that 'talks about emergency measures are groundless and even undesirable, since they can promote destabilization in society.' Describing the present situation in the Russian economy as 'difficult', the expert stressed that 'the government should keep the situation under control, implement the present programs thoughtfully, including work on structural reorganization. 'On the other hand, a return to administrative mechanisms of government and a freeze on prices and wages would lead the country to a quick collapse'. Commenting on the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, Nikolay Medvedev, head of the president's office division on work with territories, says in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that the treaty is really a qualitatively new basid document recording both the delimitation of subjects of authority as well as mutual delegation of powers between the federation and its member republic. He expressed opinion that the treaty with Tatarstan 'will be both a stabilising factor and work done for the country's future.' 'We have shown an ability to find the way out of really deadlocked situations and what's the main thing -- a desire to come to agreement,' Medvedev stressed. In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, ' the countryside should not be fenced off with a bureaucratic wall from the market. At the same time, peasants should not be herded, in 'the bright past'. The newspaper expresses regret in a report from a meeting of the government commission on urgent matters that the favorable period for the state's timely aid to the countryside has passed. 'The state in the person of the finance ministry has turned to be unable to return debts in time,' ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes, noting that the state now owes 1,300 billion rubles to the countryside 'for already consumed produce.' Writing in the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Margarita Maximova, senior researcher of the institute of world economics and international relations, claims that only economically strong and politically stable Russia can become a driving force for the integration of former Soviet republics. Examining versions for cooperation within the Commonwealth, the scholar draws the conclusion that discrepancy between the interests of Russia and other CIS countries is no barrier to the rapprochement. 'World experience shows that any interstate alliance was and is based, above all, on the balance on interests of its participants,' Maximova stresses. Reporting the publication of the book 'The Last Soviet Government', the PRAVDA newspaper writes that 'the last the ministers of the Soviet Union are convinced that they stepped down unvanquished and unhumiliated'. The newspaper features opinions of nine former ministers Nikolay Ryzhkov, Leonid Abalkin, Vadim Bakatin and others on events in Russia. Under the headline 'Interview with a woman called Soviet Jeanne d'Arc', PRAVDA outlines views of former Soviet legislator Sazhi Umalatova on the situaion in Russia. 'The people will learn to protect their rights later of sooner,' she stresses. Expressing joy over the recent release of inmates for the Lefortovo and Matrosskaya Tishina prisons as a result of the amnesty proclaimed by parliament, Umalatova stated that 'Hysteria concerning unpredictable consequences to be caused by the amnesty of opposition politicians is not accidental.' 'The same 'scenario writers' stir up trouble, trying to split society and to provoke opposition for drastic actions in order to bring tanks back,' she claims. Under the title 'In the Footsteps of Terminator', the SOVETYSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper describes particulars of a massacre at a Russian border post on Tanfilev Island (Russian Far East), including a commentary by Colonel-General Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of Russian Border troops, on this deplorable event.
