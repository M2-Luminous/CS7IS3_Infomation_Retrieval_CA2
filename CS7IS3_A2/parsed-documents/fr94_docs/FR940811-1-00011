Puerto Rico has chosen, in essence, no credit to be taken towards attainment for the application of RACT on these sources and instead that they act as additional measures to make certain the area attains the NAAQS. 4 The emission reductions presented in the table also reflect the reductions from installing control equipment as well as paving the truck haul roads at the grain handling facilities and other control measures. Puerto Rico commits to implementing the control measures (RACM and RACT) by December 10, 1993. Control of the point source categories is expected to result in an estimated emission reduction in PM 10 of 1,202.1 tpy in the area. EPA has reviewed Puerto Rico's explanation and associated documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies its choice of control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Puerto Rico's PM 10 nonattainment plan control strategy will result in the attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this notice, EPA is proposing to approve the control strategy comprising RACM including RACT. D. Demonstration of Attainment As previously noted, moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). PREQB performed an attainment demonstration using the Industrial Source Complex (ISC2) dispersion model and five years of National Weather Service meteorological data. This demonstration indicates the NAAQS for PM 10 will be attained by December 31, 1994 in the Municipality of Guaynabo and maintained throughout the future to year 1999. The demonstration predicted the highest 24-hour average concentration by the attainment date of December 31, 1994 will be 111.3 m g/m 3 , compared to the 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS of 150 m g/m 3 . The peak annual concentration predicted by the model for the attainment year is 48.9 m g/m 3 , compared to the annual PM 10 NAAQS of 50 m g/m 3 . The demonstration also showed that the PM 10 NAAQS will be maintained in future years through the year 1999. E. New Source Review PM 10 Permit Program The general statutory permit requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173 and in subpart 4 of Part D of the Act. For moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, significance level for modifications, and provisions for PM 10 precursors. The following summarizes how Puerto Rico's SIP submittal addresses the NSR requirements. 1. Puerto Rico has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy, a minimum offset ratio of one to one, and a modification significance level of 15 tpy. These provisions meet the minimum federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. 2. Puerto Rico has satisfied the requirement to demonstrate that the control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 , should also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors, such as SO 2 , VOC and NO X . However, such requirements will not apply where the EPA Administrator and the Board determine that such sources of PM 10 precursors do not significantly contribute to PM 10 levels which exceed the PM 10 ambient standards. 3. The provisions to ensure the lifting of construction bans previously imposed on states which did not have an approved nonattainment NSR SIP are not applicable to Puerto Rico since it did not have a construction ban. 4. The provisions to assure that calculation of emissions offsets, as required by section 173(a)(1)(A), are based on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of RFP are already contained in Puerto Rico's existing regulations. 5. Puerto Rico's Rule 203 provides that a permit to construct or modify a source may be granted for a proposed new major source or major modification of an existing major source only if the applicant has received a valid location approval. Rule 201 provides that a location approval may be granted only if an emission offset is provided and the ``emission reductions must [be] based in actual emissions and federally enforceable, through a permit condition made to the existing source, by the time the new or modified source commences operation.'' EPA interprets these rules to require an applicant for a new major source or a major modification to an existing major source to secure federally enforceable emission reductions before a permit to construct or modify is granted, and to require that such emission reductions be federally enforceable and in effect by the time the new or modified source commences operation. That is, the permit condition for emission reductions by the existing source will not have an effective date beyond the date when the new or modified source commences operation. EPA therefore proposes approval of these rules as satisfying requirements in section 173(a & c). 6. The provisions to assure that emissions increases from new or modified major stationary sources are offset by real reductions in actual emissions as required by section 173(c)(1) are contained in the revised regulations, and are therefore approvable. 7. The provisions to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act from being credited for purposes of satisfying the Part D offset requirements are contained in the regulations, and are therefore approvable. 8. Provisions that, as a prerequisite to issuing any part D permit, require an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for proposed sources that demonstrates that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification, are included in the revised regulation, and are therefore approvable. 9. Puerto Rico has included a provision, in accordance with section 173(d) of the Act, for supplying information from nonattainment NSR permits to EPA's RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse. This provision is therefore approvable. EPA is proposing to approve the PM 10 NSR permit program SIP revision. F. Quantitative Milestones and RFP The moderate PM 10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. For moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas, the emissions reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date of November 15, 1991 and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The deminimis timing differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations. Thus, EPA's policy is to deem that the emissions reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date and the attainment date will satisfy the quantitative milestone requirement for these areas (see 57 FR 13539). G. Enforceability All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the state and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556). The EPA's criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions are stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Moderate PM 10 nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program which provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP [see section 110(a)(2)(C)]. The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities identified in that discussion. The SIP provides that only specific sources in the PM 10 nonattainment area and/or that significantly impact the nonattainment area will be subject to the applicable control measures. Several minor sources were excluded in the control strategy because they do not contribute significantly to the modeled exceedances of the NAAQS.
