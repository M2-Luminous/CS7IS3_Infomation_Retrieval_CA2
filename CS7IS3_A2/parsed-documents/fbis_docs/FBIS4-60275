It is over now. The only pending issues are those issues related to daily life, such as travel permits, permits to enter Israel, bringing food from inside Israel, maintaining electrical current and telephone lines, and other issues. However, the administrative apparatus, which includes 6,400 employees, is running like a watch in the Gaza Strip. Military positions are under our control. Their reconstruction is under way to make them fit the coming stage. The problem is that we are starting at zero. It is true that we have an administrative apparatus, but so far the donor countries have not sent enough money to turn the wheel of daily economic life. [Badawi] Yes, there must obstacles. How are you facing these obstacles? Can you specify some of them? [Abu-Middayn] First of all, the major obstacle is now the arrival of university students in the West Bank at their places of study. This issue has not been resolved completely. The second problem is that for the last 27 years Israel made everything in the Gaza Strip, the electrical current, telephones, and even the milk cup, dependent on the Israeli economy, in a programmed and systematic manner. Therefore, we cannot get rid of this overnight. This is a very difficult problem to resolve. Based on this, I can give you an example about bread and how to get flour from inside Israel. The merchant first must get a permit. This needs time. So, once again, the permits are a major point. The agreements signed in Paris and elsewhere are not implemented on the ground. [Badawi] So, how do you coordinate with the Israelis, particularly on daily life issues, as you said? [Abu-Middayn] There is a liaison committee formed of five of our colleagues. They spend four hours a day on this. We believe that immediately after the 'Id al-Adha, there will be a daily plan of work with the Israeli side concerning our joint affairs. However, internally, we have full independence these days. We feel that decisions are being made. So, the heaviest burden is being shouldered by the National Authority members. They were quickly chosen for this post in the Gaza Strip. There are only three members, Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun, and Furayh Abu-Middayn. We were forced to make preliminary decisions on the ground even before official procedures such as oath-taking or the completion of the Palestinian National Authority. As you know, it includes 24 members, and not all have been named. However, we are now compelled to take urgent measures and to make decisions on the ground on a daily and hourly basis. [Badawi] As you said, there is intermingling between the administration of daily affairs and long-term planning concerning the self-rule areas. [Abu-Middayn] This is true. We are trying to create new facts and mechanisms on the ground. We are waiting for financing, for the Marshall plan, so to say. There is the $1.2 billion the World Bank should give to us to begin immediate financing. There is also the EC and another $750 million. The truth is that we must build an infrastructure. This is the most important problem facing us on the ground. The roads, schools, hospitals, and even the armies brought from outside all need houses and other services. [Badawi] What kind of infrastructures are now available to you in Gaza and Jericho? [Abu-Middayn] We have only highly qualified cadres, but no money. This is the problem. The vehicle is lubricated, the driver is in it, and it is waiting to be filled with gas, if we can say that. We need to pump a huge amount of money. Approximately 60,000-70,000 jobs must be created. This is because Israel has closed 60,000 jobs inside Israel. There is a manpower problem in Israel. Unemployment has reached 60-65 percent. This is the most serious problem. Unemployment in the Gaza Strip has reached the zero point or the red line. I am sorry to have deviated from your question, but the truth is that the Arab and Israeli blockades have integrated against us in the Gaza Strip. You know that the Gaza Strip is like an island in the sea. It is surrounded by Israel and the sea. [Badawi] Can we say that your projects are ready and the only thing missing is money? [Abu-Middayn] Yes. I hope the donor countries will fulfill their obligations. We do not want to be another Yeltsin or another Russia with just more and more promises, especially since we are not asking for a favor, but this is the Middle East equation, namely, that without Palestine there will neither be economic or security stability. [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: How are the people inside taking the new situation? [Abu-Middayn] They are looking to the future with a mixture of hope and apprehension. They are glad to be rid of the khaki-clad occupation troops that ruled over them for 27 years and sent 220,000 of them to prison. This nightmare is over. However, the discussions of bread and butter issues will begin in a week or two. This is what the Palestinian people inside look to with fervent hope. We are up to the challenge. But the world has obligated us to this agreement, such as it is. [sentence as heard] However, this is not the Palestinian peace we are looking for. But we will create from this limited achievement something for the future. The international community must, however, remember that for over two and half years of negotiations it has pressed the Palestinians [words indistinct] and (?then we will see what happens later). Even the Europeans [word indistinct], even those who have made the nuclear option available to Israel took this position. The Palestinians are, therefore, rightly apprehensive about the future and that the international bodies will not deliver on the promises they have made to the Palestinian people over the past few years. [Badawi] As you know, in addition to the day-to-day problems you are facing, there is the fundamental issue of the settlers. This week some of them went with their weapons to pray in Jericho. Do the Palestinian police have a contingency plan to contain and handle any future friction; are they armed with the necessary powers to do that? [Abu-Middayn] Let me put it this way. Land mines have been left behind -- three settlements in the Gaza Strip and the synagogue in Jericho. These are flashpoints that bring to mind what happened in Hebron. Yesterday, a settler close to Netzarim was fired on. Today, they carried out provocations on the street that goes past this settlement. We have pointed this out to the Israelis and tried to convince them that, if only for their own safety, these three settlements must be dismantled. Some 550 soldiers are posted to provide protection for 150 settlers. The settlement problem in the Gaza Strip... [pauses], I want to break the glad news to you that 50 to 60 percent of the settlers are bracing to leave the strip. I have been reliably informed that they are putting in claims for compensation in return for moving behind the green line. The security settlements you are asking about are problematic, whether we are talking about the Jericho synagogue or the three Gaza settlements. These are flashpoints. The settlers travel on Arab roads in the Gaza Strip under Army escort. But this is a daily friction that I fear may erupt into a bloody incident. The Israeli Government must, therefore, consider the removal of these three outposts. We may be able to work out a solution in the future. [Badawi, interrupting] In the meantime... [Abu-Middayn] But the settlement activity is the real obstacle. [Badawi] In the meantime, how will you handle the potential for friction? [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police have plans for such an eventuality. None of the settlers may leave their settlement without obtaining a prior permit. But, if an armed settler attacked a Palestinian, no one must expect him to be treated with patience. I am not issuing threats, but bullets will be returned in kind. [Badawi] But this situation will cause problems for you with the Palestinians themselves, especially seeing that three Palestinian factions active inside the occupied land are refusing to surrender their weapons. How do you acquiesce to settlers carrying arms and deny this right to the Palestinians? [Abu-Middayn] Last week, those who wagered on a Palestinian bloodbath or a fratricidal conflict were disabused of their illusions. Brothers in the opposition factions were out on the streets firing in the air in jubilation alongside the Palestinian army. Everyone saw this on television screens. The problem of Palestinian fighting Palestinian does not exist. [Badawi] Yes, but three Palestinian organizations declared from Damascus that they refuse to hand over their weapons in the occupied territories. [Abu-Middayn] Sir, they have not been asked to hand over their weapons. The handover of weapons has not been asked for. What is wanted is to rationalize weapons because control over weapons was lost in a certain phase. There are 20,000 weapons in Gaza. Perhaps, 20 percent or less of these weapons are in the hands of organizations and 80 percent of them are in the hands of ordinary citizens. I am concerned with the loose weapons present in the hands of ordinary citizens; these weapons have reached some criminal cells. These are the weapons that should be controlled. If anyone wants a weapon to protect himself or for other reasons, we can reach agreement and there can be a plan for licensing weapons or something similar in this regard. We, however, do not seek to arm the Palestinian people, the arms are a support for the Palestinians. These weapons [word indistinct] are a support for the Palestinian army's weapons, and they are not against this army. [Badawi] There are other possibilities that cannot be subtracted from the practical theories, such as what happened in Hebron this week. To what extent would this be reflected on the situation in the self-rule areas? [Abu-Middayn] I previously said so, and the Israeli side complained about a statement I made [words indistinct]. If what happened in Hebron took place at a time when we had 6,000-7,000 soldiers in Gaza, the real massacre would have occurred in Gaza and not in Hebron. This is because the reply would have been harsh and violent because the Israeli Army is very strong. However, no one can [words indistinct]. If a Gazan takes to the street, would we open fire on him? Definitely not. Thus, the Israelis, and not the Palestinian side, should take this into account. Knowing that 30 people were massacred at a mosque on a Friday in the month of Ramadan, we cannot say that we in Gaza would not make a violent reply. These issues are submitted to the Israeli side, which should study them because peace is more important than 400 extremists. I do not like to use the word extremist because, to me, each settler is an extremist. Thus, there are 120,000 extremists in the West Bank and Gaza; they are the settlers. Hence, the Israeli Government should have its own calculations. We did not carry out any action whatsoever. However, in case of self-defense and in order to defend dignity, there could be a bloodbath. [Badawi] It can thus be said that construction work has begun, though it may be stumbling due to lack of the necessary funds. On the political level, however, do you have any idea about when the whole team of the National Authority Council will be joining you, or...? [Abu-Middayn, interrupting] Very soon. I believe that by Saturday, the first day of 'Id al-Adha, President 'Arafat will have declared all the names. You know that the responsibility is heavy, and some brothers are reluctant to join the Palestinian National Authority. In other words, you know that there is fear of assuming responsibility at historic moments. This matter needs time to contemplate. I, however, believe there are dozens of people ready to accept this challenge. [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: On the legal level, what laws and jurisdiction are you now implementing to resolve the differences you may face at times? [Abu-Middayn] This is an important question. Palestinian law has existed since the British mandate. Egypt, during former President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's rule, kept this law until the time of Israeli occupation. The Gaza Strip's situation remained as a fully independent legal issue which used to bear the name of Palestine and there was a Palestinian constitution. The judicial system exists, and there are three levels of jurisdiction. The legal body exists but it was paralyzed in the past seven years after the policemen resigned. Immediately following 'Id al-Adha, we will start work in the judicial field. The courts are ready but there are also criminal cases like thefts, murders, and others. Prisons will probably be ready within 48 hours to receive of course, smugglers, thieves, and others. We had hoped that we would have prisons. To cut things short, I would like to tell you that the first case is a surprising case. The first person we apprehended was a man who had stolen things from the Palestinian military administration. These things were the keys to Gaza prison. That's why we released him without any thought because stealing the prison keys had its meanings and historical dimensions after this long time. It will be the first time in our history that a Palestinian will sit in this place. We hope that we will be up to the responsibility. There must be a judicial system that is not factional, and that is independent, honest, and qualified. This is an essential equation and this is the sole guarantee. The military forces should be headed by a sound and independent legal body. The first thing we should do is to respect the law. [Badawi] So far, how do you assess the response of the citizens to the police, the Palestinian force? [Abu-Middayn] Let me tell you something. Murders, and the car thefts have decreased. Look at the cooperation on the streets. People from all walks of life visit police stations, and inform about violations. The man on the street in the Gaza Strip now even tries to avoid traffic violations. One week ago, things were different. One has started to feel that the streets are under control. There is a solid relationship between the Palestinian police and the people. A murder case took place two days ago and the investigation concerning it is proceeding normally and routinely. There is an understanding to activate the role of the law so that we may reach the next stage. How can we hold elections and exercise democracy without law and the prevalence of the law? [Badawi] With respect to elections now, the talk is that they will be held in October, next fall. [Abu-Middayn] Next fall because first of all the law should prevail. Otherwise, why hold elections? First, the issue of the elections should be seriously studied. We are doing our best in this respect. But, elections for a legislative council are not permitted at this stage. But municipal elections, rural council elections will, probably, be the first elections with which we will start. Then we will move to a higher stage. I believe that the Palestinian people are dutybound to set an example among these many Arab regimes which are fighting, particularly what we witness in Yemen. We are pained to see this taking place. [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, thank you.
