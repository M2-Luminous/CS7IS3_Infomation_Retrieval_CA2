President Kim Yong-sam's administration has recently been at odds with the opposition party over such issues as the resignation of Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the Sangmudae scandal. Since the inauguration of the civilian government last February, the ruling party has needed the strong leadership of Kim Yong-sam, who also serves as DLP president, in carrying out reform and purging corrupt officials. But now, Chongwadae believes that stable execution of government affairs should be given top priority. In order to maintain better relations between the ruling and opposition parties, the presidential office has therefore decided to let the DLP take the initiative in handling political affairs. Under the new idea, the ruling party hopes to strengthen inter- party dialogue and remain in close contact with the opposition party through their floor leaders at the National Assembly, as well as through their secretaries-general and policy-makers. DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, speaking at a regular monthly meeting of senior party officials, pointed out that the ruling party exists because there is an opposition and vice versa. "Although there is a gap, the Democratic Party has to be an essential partner (for the DLP)," Kim said. "We should do our best to maintain healthy relations with the opposition party," he added. "We should keep building partnership relations with it." DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said that whenever the opposition launched an offensive in the past, Chongwadae hastened to handle it, assuming a greater burden. Mun thus signaled a change and the party's intention to grab the initiative in political affairs from now on. Another senior DLP official said that Chongwadae is studying ways to leave party affairs to the DLP and administrative work to the cabinet. In view of this new policy direction, the DLP is expected to offer a "cooling-off period" before opening formal and informal channels of dialogue with the opposition party, he said.
