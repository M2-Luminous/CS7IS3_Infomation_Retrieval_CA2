In a statement issued from State House, Nakuru, President Moi said the postponement became necessary as confirmation of attendance had not been received by today from some invited heads of state. Those invited are President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and acting President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of Burundi. He said the postponement would enable him and his colleagues to consult a little more to ensure that all of them attend any such meeting. The head of state reiterated that the problem of Rwanda was complicated and therefore required concerted efforts of all the neighboring of heads of state so that decisions reached might stand a better chance of success. At the same time President Moi appealed to all the combatants in Rwanda to start and observe a cease-fire to avoid any more loss of life. He also observed that failure to take this course of action would mean that the leaders have no value for the lives of their people.
