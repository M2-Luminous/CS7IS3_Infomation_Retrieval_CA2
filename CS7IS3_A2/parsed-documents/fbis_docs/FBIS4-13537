Arab countries are suffering from emptiness, lack of purpose, and weakness. Neighboring them is a Zionist entity with a strong and cohesive fabric. The juxtaposition of strength with emptiness causes cracks and instability on the empty side. Arab countries have despotic and repressive political regimes. Their governments have no popular basis. Governments that fail to communicate and interact with their peoples remain weak and handicapped. More often than not, they end up in conflict with their people or some sections of them. Such governments must seek protection from the state's regular forces and get foreign assistance and protection. Foreigners do not provide such things without a price, usually that of restricting and controlling the national administration. Once an administration is sold out, the state's relations and external interests fall under foreign control. The result, as we see it, is that all Arab regimes flutter like a leaf in the wind or drift like a rudderless boat in high seas, having no initiative or direction of their own. They just react and respond to disasters after they occur. Most of the time, their reactions are too belated and indecisive to rise to the occasion and answer the challenges initiated by others. So, we mostly end up denouncing, lamenting, and shedding tears. In this same region, we have a neighbor that is strong, gritty, and vibrant: the Zionist entity. This entity is a democracy in which the people have the final say. The government there represents the people, listens to the people, and does not defy their will. Such governments are strong because they do not exhaust their resources in a conflict with their people. They need no regular troops to fortify their position with their people. Therefore, their regular forces train the guns on their adversaries, the Arabs. The Israeli Government does not need foreign countries to support it against its own people. On the contrary, it uses the strength, cohesiveness, and support of its people to put pressure on foreign countries whose material and political support it needs. [passage omitted] This is the scary backdrop to the current ideas of peace, normalization, water negotiations, and a Middle East market, all of which are vehicles through which Israel will achieve its historical dream. What it has failed to achieve by war it will achieve by peace. A Zionist empire will spring up between the Nile and the Euphrates, one in which the mighty Zionists will be masters and the inept, misguided, and dysfunctional Arabs the underdogs. It may be said that Egypt is poor and desperate for U.S. help and that this is why it has to listen to the orders of the U.S. Administration. This would explain our role in the Iraq-Iran war and then the Gulf war. This would also explain our unjustified hostility toward Iran and Sudan, our dealings with the Serbs despite their crimes in Bosnia, and our dispatch of troops to Somalia to replace U.S. troops. My answer to this is that honest women go hungry rather than turn tricks. We can avoid antagonizing America while maintaining a measure of independence and freedom of action. But this would require a true democracy, a government that relies on its people, one that would cut its budget rather than seek foreign assistance, and a leadership that awakens the latent power of its people rather than resort to totalitarian police rule to repress them.
