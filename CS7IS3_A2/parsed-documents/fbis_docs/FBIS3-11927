According to Mendes, the president has been showing goodwill and he is seeking to reach an agreement that does not harm the Brazilian people: [Begin Mendes recording] Our expectation is that in such a moment [words indistinct] generalized and reach a situation in which the Federal Supreme Court, STF, would accept indications about the collective agreement renewal date for payment of salaries to its personnel; would give up interpreting the provisional measure text as if it called for moving up the date to convert salaries into the Real Value Unit, URV; and the president would see his proposal accepted, as he expected. It is expected of the president, however, that he recognizes the STF's autonomy and authority. [end recording] Despite disagreements between these government branches, Mendes believes the two institutions will be strengthened by the crisis and that democracy in our country will become more consolidated.
