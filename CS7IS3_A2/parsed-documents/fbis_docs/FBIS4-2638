By including people from the "moderate" democratic camp, including Meeting Point, the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) and even the Hong Kong Bank's Legislative Council representative Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Beijing has moved towards broader consultation. A third cheer would be misplaced. The selection is better than the uncritical supporters found in the previous lists but the new list contains no consistent critics of Chinese policy. It does include a few who could be relied on to argue logically against flawed ideas in their areas of expertise. The question which almost certainly will arise, however, is would many be prepared to speak out publicly against a Chinese position? The most striking, if not surprising, omission is that of outspoken supporters of political reform. The ADPL has broadcast its disagreement with Chris Patten's attempts to broaden the franchise, as has the newly appointed Elsie Tu. Meeting Point faces both ways. Mr Cheng prefers to keep his ideas to himself. Even the appointment of former United Democrats member Lau Kong-wah appears to be a slap in the face for his old political allies. The appointment of moderates and formerly pro-British figures is a typical united front tactic. It rewards defection and makes life in the pro-China camp seem attractive to the waverers. But as a means of effective, broad-based consultation it is highly limited. If China really wanted to know how its policies and pronouncements would affect Hong Kong, it should be prepared to approach its critics. This may be an academic point: those members of the United Democrats China has branded subversives could hardly accept the position in the unlikely event they were approached. Even lower profile United Democrats members would regard appointment as a poisoned chalice. So polarised has opinion become, service as an adviser might be denounced as collaboration. But China has contributed to this air of anxiety and suspicion. Had it appointed and listened to all shades of opinion from the start, it would not now be faced with such hostility and distrust. It should rethink its approach, declaring itself open to all opinions. Hearing the views of people who are prepared to say only what they think Beijing wants to hear does not advance China's understanding of the complexities of Hong Kong society. Appointing democrats as advisers might be counter-productive. But inviting critics to give their views -- and listening to them -- might help heal some of the wounds of the past five years. It might also lead to more balanced, less confrontational policy -- for the good of Hong Kong. One reason for listening to all shades of opinion is to prevent the further erosion of confidence in the concept of "one country, two systems" after 1997. Liberal lawyers were shocked at Duanmu Zheng's recent prediction that the common law system would gradually disappear. The Vice-President of the Supreme People's Court of China and former Basic Law drafter said judgments based on precedent, instead of the available evidence, relied too much on the British system. He praised the mainland system as simpler. Coming from a man of such influence, the remarks were seen as a threat. The subtext read into his statement was that the independence of the judiciary enshrined in the British legal system (as well as the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law) would be phased out with it. Among lawyers appointed as Hong Kong affairs advisers, a different view prevails. A gradual change is seen as inevitable. Chinese company law is already copied from Hong Kong law. Given the relative maturity of the two systems, it is likely Hong Kong law will continue to influence China more than the other way round. The opposing views are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for Hong Kong to influence mainland law without preventing the dismantling of local judicial independence. Phasing out the reliance on precedents would make political manipulation easier, but not inevitable. Other former British colonies have stopped relying automatically on English legal precedents, often following instead the thinking behind relevant judgments in other common law jurisdictions. What matters is not the English system per se, but judicial independence, the presumption of innocence, and the maintenance of the rule of law over the arbitrary "rule of man". By listening to all shades of opinion, Beijing could help assuage local fears of political manipulation. Consulting only those prepared to give China the benefit of the doubt will increase the suspicion and fear among those it still excludes.
