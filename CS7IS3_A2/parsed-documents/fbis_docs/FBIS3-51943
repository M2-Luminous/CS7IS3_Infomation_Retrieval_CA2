A police report states the dead as Carlos Mejia and an unidentified Honduran woman, and the injured as Hondurans Abel and Lorena Dubon Pazos. The tragic accident occurred 7 km on the Northern Highway, which was blocked by a bus belonging to the Unidos Transportation Cooperative, license plate GB-0109. The bus was participating in a three-day-old strike called by transportation personnel against the Chamorro administration. The name of the bus' owner that caused the fatal accident is still unknown. Commander Franco Montealegre, PN inspector general, presented a final count of those arrested in the wake of violent disturbances involving transportation carriers, which started early today and lasted until noon today at the PN Station No. 6, when the relatives of those arrested opposed their transfer to police installations. The police leader reported 206 arrested so far. He added that 19 minors, between the ages of 13 and 14 years old, were released. The cooperatives with the largest number of arrested members are: the 2 August Cooperative with 12; Jorge Salazar Cooperative, 22; Ricardo Morales Cooperative, 31; (Arlensiu) Cooperative, 36; and Democratic Efforts Cooperative, 20. The police report states that 12 of those arrested do not belong to a cooperative. Commander Montealegre categorically denied that the police fired on the relatives of those arrested at noon today at the PN Station No. 6. He also denied the police attacked media representatives: [Begin Montealegre recording] [Words indistinct] it is said they used excessive force.
