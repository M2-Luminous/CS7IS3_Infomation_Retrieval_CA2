Namely, according to reliable information, the republic [of Croatia] has been concentrating major forces in Livno and Ploce these days in order to accomplish Tudjman's platform of a greater Croatia at the expense of our country. According to verified reports, the Croatian Army brigades from Imotski, Split, Vinkovci, Sibenik, and the notorious Vukovar Brigade are already positioned in Herzegovina and around Gornji Vakuf. We must point out that the sending of fresh Croatian troops to Bosnia coincides with the publicly made threats to our country by numerous individuals from the Croatian state leadership. First Tudjman threatened that he would send the Army to save the Croats in central Bosnia. Then the aforementioned Granic did the same. However, the essence of the saber rattling on the Bosnia-Herzegovina borders and the sending of troops to Bosnian gorges has been best explained by Croatian Defense Minister Susak and Croatian Ambassador to the United States Mario Nobilo. For these two, the war of the Croatian Army in Bosnia means defending Croatian ethnic territory and the Croatian state. Drago Krpina, commander of the political section of the Croatian Army, has recently also announced the increased engagement of his formations in central Bosnia. That this is not a mere propaganda trick is proven by the mass mobilization that is already underway in Croatia, with the intention of boosting the troops that are carrying out the aggression against our state. The movement of the Ustasha formations and their incursion into Bosnia are being carefully monitored by our army, too. Necessary precautions are, of course, being taken that will thwart the realization of the plans of Tudjman and his generals. Our fighters have already acquired abundant experience and inflicted a sufficient number of defeats upon the Ustasha formations to know what to do. They are also a guarantee that the plan of the greater Croatian chauvinists will not be realized and that the forthcoming offensive of the Croatian Army in Bosnia will merely rapidly increase the number of deceased Croatian soldiers who will give their lives for a futile cause. The international community will not observe Croatia's aggression against a sovereign and internationally recognized state with their arms crossed either. It is perfectly certain that Croatian may soon face economic sanctions, which would mean the situation in which Serbia is right now. The policies of these two neighboring countries have two common traits. They share similar political leaderships and unrealistic desire to submit and divide Bosnia-Herzegovina. Within this context, one must also view Ganic's waving of an olive branch in Vienna today and yesterday. An olive branch will only make sense if the convoys of Croatian tanks stop tumbling down Bosnian roads.
