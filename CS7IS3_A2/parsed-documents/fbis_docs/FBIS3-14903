One of the two news conferences was given by the observers of the Council of Europe, a body which was also represented by Senator Adrian Paunescu [vice president of Romania's Socialist Party of Labor], and the second was given by the delegation of representatives of the CSCE and NATO Parliamentary Assembly, which included eight Romanian parliamentarians. At the news conference of CSCE representatives, four Romanian deputies were also present. During the dialogue with the press, the general opinion that crystallized was that, generally speaking, the elections were correct and without incidents, with the international observers having access to all voting stations. The largest number of objections referred to the entry of two or more persons in the ballot booths at the same time, usually husband and wife or relatives; in some cases, individuals from the voting sections would advise the voters for what political grouping they should vote. The two news conferences were preceded by a meeting of the international observers with Mr. Petr Lucinschi, president of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who thanked them for their activity during yesterday's legislative elections. The Parliament president said that a first and provisional estimate of the results of the voting indicates that the following groupings will surely be represented in Parliament: the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM], the Socialist Part and Edinstvo Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front [FPCD], and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals. As a matter of fact, later centralized results coming from the provinces confirmed his statement. Afterward, Mr. Petr Lucinschi apologized to the international observers for certain organizational irregularities noted by them and assured those present that the Republic of Moldova will evolve toward economic reform, conciliation, and peace and that it will observe the requirements on democracy formulated by the European structures.
