Government offices have now begun to worry about the future of the new government. It is highly likely that Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill and other pending bills will be delayed. If arguments on tax reform become complicated, this will adversely affect new policies to be implemented with the fiscal 1995 budget. Because it is possible that the current political confusion will slow down the pace of deregulation, government offices have begun to worry that "the policies we have formulated might be baffled." On 26 April, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was covered with an oppressive air. Although the SDPJ had remained reluctant to agree on a consumption tax hike since the idea of introducing a national welfare tax caused an uproar, the ministry has tried to persuade the party to participate in tax reform debates the in coalition's tax reform council meetings. When the ministry's efforts were about to yield the desired results, the political confusion occurred. MOF is shocked because it is now highly likely that their efforts will go up in smoke. Its anxiety has deepened, thinking, "The SDPJ may come to oppose the consumption tax hike." Some MOF officials have even begun to have ill feelings about Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is thought to be "sympathetic to the MOF." They said: "His way of doing things is not democratic. Is it really necessary for him to do things in such a high-handed manner?" The Home Affairs Ministry, which is calling for introducing regional consumption taxes, is also concerned about the future of tax reform. The Economic Planning Agency is worried that if the House of Representatives is dissolved, the product liability bill, which was compiled jointly by nine ministries and agencies, might be carried over to the next Diet session. If this happens, they will not be able to carry out the initial plan to enforce the law next summer. Meanwhile, the Health and Welfare Ministry is anxious about the pension system reform bill, which includes a proposal to raise the age at which people qualify for old-age pensions. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has submitted to the Diet a bill to promote deregulation of the gas industry. It also plans to submit a bill on deregulation in the electric power and oil industries. The ministry takes the current situation seriously, saying, "The delay in enforcing these laws will have negative effects on people's living." The Transport Ministry also has pending bills. They are the bill to revise the road transportation and vehicle law to abolish a mandatory six-month car inspection and the bill to revise the aviation law to obligate airliners to inform the government of their planned air fare discounts. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is worried that the current political turmoil might affect its work to formulate a new farm policy, including the revision of a food control system, which is soon to be carried out on a full scale. The ministry thinks "It is certain that a hot controversy will rage in the Diet this autumn on the ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement." It is also feared that although the Farm Ministry holds a meeting of the Rice Price Council around June every year, it will have to delay it this year due to the political turmoil. Some people have begun to think that the Farm Ministry will fail to not only decide rice prices but also to launch its rice policy, and "this will affect government's rice collection after the summer."
