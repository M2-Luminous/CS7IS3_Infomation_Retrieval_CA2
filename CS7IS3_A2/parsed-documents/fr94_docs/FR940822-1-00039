FR940822-1-00039 FR940822-1-00006 General Provisions Readily Removable Residual Radioactivity It is clear that some structures can easily be decontaminated to levels well below those necessary to reduce individual doses from residual radioactivity at a decommissioned site to a few mrem TEDE/y above background. Past decommissioning practice has been based on the premise that ``the licensee should make a reasonable effort to eliminate residual radioactivity.'' See Regulatory Guide 1.86, ``Termination of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Reactors,'' June 1974, pg. 3. Some previously released structures have been decontaminated to levels below those specified in Regulatory Guide 1.86 for some nuclides. Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that all readily removable residual radioactivity be removed from a site before it is decommissioned. This is considered a necessary and reasonable step toward ensuring that doses to the public from residual radioactivity are ALARA. For the purpose of this proposed regulation, the Commission has defined readily removable to mean removable using non-destructive, common, housekeeping techniques (e.g., washing with moderate amounts of detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive waste requiring subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected to adversely affect public health or the environment. It would also not include removal and transport of soil except when small discreet areas of contamination can be removed by digging up a few shovelfuls of soil. The intent of these proposed provisions is to define the basic types of remediation that should be undertaken as a matter of good practice regardless of whether the site meets the NRC residual radioactivity criteria. However, it is not the Commission's intent to require more substantive remediation without the benefit of careful planning and ALARA considerations. The Commission specifically solicits comments on how to best define the activities that should be included under this provision. Radioactive Materials Previously Disposed of at the Site Under NRC regulations, licensees may dispose of radioactive wastes on their own property. Before 1981, NRC regulations (10 CFR 20.304) allowed disposal without prior approval of limited quantities of specified nuclides under prescribed conditions. On July 28, 1981, §20.304 was revoked because the Commission did not have sufficient assurance that these disposals would be adequately protective. However, onsite disposal can still be undertaken by individual licensees under 10 CFR 20.2002 (previously §20.302), provided the disposal is specifically approved by the NRC or an Agreement State. If this buried radioactive material is considered to be part of the licensee's total site inventory for decommissioning purposes, some licensees will likely be required to remove all or part of this material before decommissioning the site. This position may be controversial because it can be argued that materials already disposed of in accordance with existing NRC requirements should no longer be considered part of the licensees inventory of radioactive material. Nevertheless, removal of the previous burials may be necessary to achieve the proposed radiological criteria and ensure sufficient protection of the public and environment. In this proposed rulemaking, the Commission takes the position that public and environmental risk is the overriding factor. Therefore all residual radioactivity at the site, including that previously disposed of in accordance with NRC requirements in §§20.304, 20.302, and 20.2002 must be included in determining whether the licensee meets the radiological criteria in the proposed rule. However, the Commission is aware that the balancing of risks, costs, and benefits may be substantially different for exhuming buried material than they would be for decontamination of surface soils and structures. Therefore, it is expected that before any decision is made to exhume radioactive material previously disposed of at a site, the licensee will perform a site-specific analysis of the overall risks, costs, and benefits of this action. This position is consistent with positions already taken by the NRC on this issue. In the Supplementary Information to the Final Rule ``General Requirements for Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities'' (published on June 27, 1988, 53 FR 24021), the Commission states it will ``take a hard look at the extent to which the site has been used to dispose of low level radioactive wastes by land burial, and will decide what remedial measures including removal of such wastes offsite, are appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use.'' In the Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP) the NRC staff notes that ``disposals performed under 10 CFR 20.304 have at several sites required exhumation during the decommissioning and takes the position that acceptability of these burials will be assessed in future decommissioning procedures.'' See SECY&hyph;91&hyph;096, Enclosure 1 ``Site Decommissioning Management Program, Revision 1 (January 1991)'' p. 16. See also, the draft Regulatory Guide on ``Standard Format and Content for Decommissioning Plans for Nuclear Reactors,'' which states that the licensee's plan should indicate the extent of waste burial onsite and the remedial measures appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use. Use of Actual Measurements Although the Commission recognizes that it will be necessary in many cases for the licensee to use modeling to estimate the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from residual radioactivity at the site, the proposed rule would require that estimates of the site specific source term (i.e., residual radioactivity remaining at the site) be substantiated using actual measurements to the maximum extent practical. The reason for this substantiation of estimates is that using actual measurements reduces the uncertainty associated with the estimates and provides a greater measure of assurance that radiological requirements are being met. It is expected that substantiation would be carried out in accordance with the survey requirements in 10 CFR 20.1501. Information and guidance related to surveys and use of measurement techniques have been published in draft form for public comment as NUREG/CR&hyph;5849. An NRC staff working draft regulatory guide is being published with this proposed rulemaking which specifically addresses these topics. The Commission plans to publish further guidance in draft form before the effective date of the final rule. Time Frame There is some difference of opinion on how far into the future calculations should be carried out for the purpose of establishing acceptable residual radioactivity levels for decommissioned sites. Current NRC staff practice is to calculate projected doses out to 1,000 years in the future in evaluating radiological impacts associated with residual radioactivity. This is consistent with current DOE practice. See, Order DOE 5400.5 ``Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment.'' EPA's high level waste regulations require that cumulative releases to the environment be calculated out to 10,000 years. See, 40 CFR part 191 (Note: 40 CFR part 191 was remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in July 1987, and is being reconsidered by EPA.) However, there are some who think such calculations should be carried out to provide estimates of potential contamination of groundwater for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years into the future. When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a high-level waste repository, distant future calculations may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure to residual radioactivity at levels near background are small, and considering the large uncertainties, long term modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless. In light of this, the Commission does not believe it would serve any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the future. Although theoretical maximum doses for a few isotopic decay chains do not occur for hundreds or thousands of years, for most radionuclides of interest in decommissioning the peak dose occurs in less than 1,000 years. Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that TEDE estimates be based on the greatest annual dose expected within the first 1000 years after decommissioning. This annual dose must be interpreted as the TEDE delivered in that year, including the committed dose equivalent from radionuclides taken into the body during that year. The Commission notes that a time frame of 1,000 years is also being considered by the EPA, as indicated in the draft regulatory language, discussed during the NACEPT Meeting in May 1994.
