In a provocative diplomatic note to the Greek Embassy in Tirana, the Albanian Government asked the Greek ambassador to reduce the embassy's diplomatic staff from 10 to six people. According to a REUTER dispatch from Tirana, the diplomatic note says that, because there has been no agreement on the question of the diplomatic staff, the Albanian side believes that there should be a reciprocal reduction in the staff of the Greek and Albanian diplomatic missions from 10 to six people. The Albanian note also gives Athens a 10-day time limit to carry out the reduction. REUTER also notes that Albania has a four-member diplomatic mission in Athens.
