FR940902-0-00005 FR940902-0-00001 The second comment was submitted by a grower, Gregory W. Davis, who opposed the proposed rule. Mr Davis commented that in his view the rule is a volume control measure that forces growers to dump marketable kiwifruit. This rule is not a volume control measure. Its intention is to eliminate the blending of undersized fruit. In addition, growers retain the option of adjusting their cultural practices so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the new size requirement. Also, the order does not force growers or handlers to dump fruit. The following outlets are exempt from grade, size, maturity, quality, inspection, and container requirements including: (1) Shipments of less than 200 pounds per day; (2) roadside stands; (3) Certified Farmers Markets; (4) charitable institutions; (5) relief agencies; and (6) commercial processors. Mr. Davis also commented that growers in his district (District 7) are against increasing the minimum size requirement and that District 7, which includes Tulare and Inyo counties in Central California, represents almost one-third of California kiwifruit production. However, some District 7 committee members and alternates, who like all members of the committee were elected by growers from their District, voted in favor of increasing the minimum size requirement in the various subcommittee and committee meetings that took place this past year. A committee member from District 7 reported at the February 10, 1994, meeting that a majority of growers were against increasing the minimum size requirement, but almost all growers were in favor of eliminating the blending of undersize fruit. After a long, thorough, and publicized debate, the committee determined that increasing the minimum size to Size 45 from Size 49 is the best way to eliminate the blending of undersize fruit. Mr. Davis also commented that a redistricting scheduled for next year might change the vote on the minimum size requirement. The Department has yet to receive a formal recommendation from the committee on this issue. It is premature to assume that any redistricting will take place or that a newly seated committee would vote any differently on a minimum size requirement. The present committee was nominated by growers and appointed by the Secretary according to marketing order procedures. If a redistricting plan is recommended and approved, and if a new committee is selected, then that committee may recommend revisions to the minimum size requirement. Mr. Davis' comment further stated that since the recommendation was made on February 10, 1994, he and other growers did not have sufficient time to adjust their cultural practices so that a higher percentage of the 1994 crop will meet the higher size requirement. However, Mr. Davis indicates that he was present at the subcommittee meeting held in Modesto, California on December 8, 1993, in which the subcommittee initially recommended increasing the minimum size requirement. In addition, the January 1994 bulletin of California Kiwifruit, which is jointly produced by the commission and the committee, announced the December 8, 1993, subcommittee's preliminary recommendation to increase the minimum size requirement. This publication is mailed to all known kiwifruit growers. Finally, other kiwifruit growers indicate that cultural practices, such as thinning, are available during February or later to increase kiwifruit size so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit meet the new size requirement. Mr. Davis' comment went on to question the wisdom of preventing shipments of kiwifruit that he considers to be of good quality. However, quality is a term that is often defined by changing consumers preferences. The independent survey funded by the commission is an attempt to identify current consumer preferences and clearly shows that many consumers are adverse to smaller sizes. It is reasonable to require kiwifruit shipments to meet customer preferences for larger sizes. Otherwise, California kiwifruit will not be as marketable as kiwifruit from international competitors who meet customer preferences. Finally, Mr. Davis suggested that the committee lacked formal research that shows Size 49 or smaller kiwifruit is not of good quality. As mentioned earlier, the independent market survey does show an overwhelming trade preference for sizes 42 or larger. Although no formal research was specifically conducted on customer preference for Size 49 kiwifruit or smaller kiwifruit, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience among growers about the marketing of kiwifruit. It is the view of a majority of committee members, which is made up of growers, that shipments of undersized kiwifruit have been poorly received by consumers. After thoroughly analyzing the comments received and other available information, the Department has concluded that this final rule is appropriate.
