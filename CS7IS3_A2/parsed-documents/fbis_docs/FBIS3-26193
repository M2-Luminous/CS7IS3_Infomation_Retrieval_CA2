According to information, Fu Xuezhang, deputy director of the Department of Asian Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the chief Chinese negotiator, is accompanied by a number of military representatives. The mass media here used the headlines such as "two giants in Asia to cut troops along border and further improve ties to ensure peace," when reporting on the talks. Last September in Beijing, the Chinese and Indian premiers signed the "agreement on maintaining peace and tranquility in the areas actually controlled by China and India along the border," and both sides agreed to cut troops along the border. A border dispute existed between China and India for 30 years, and a brief but fierce large-scale war broke out in 1962. It is generally believed that India currently deploys 60,000 troops on the front. Cheng Ruisheng, Chinese ambassador to India, stressed recently that "the conflict between China and India and the tense situation caused by it are now history." Both sides "are working hard to regain lost time, and relations are improving step by step." He said that "we should continue to maintain this pace." Cheng Ruisheng also disclosed that Indian Vice President Narayanan will visit China this May.
