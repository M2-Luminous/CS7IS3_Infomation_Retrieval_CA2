Although Chief Beye is away from Lusaka, the negotiators today presented their proposals. The mediator and the troika of observers today dealt with basic issues regarding the standpoint of the two sides on national reconciliation. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] was late in submitting its proposal, thus postponing the mediator's final draft. The draft was scheduled to be presented this morning. In time the government added new elements to its proposal. This pleased the troika, and local analysts regard this as proof that there is a will to tackle the issue at once. The government's pleasant mood is due partly to Chief Beye's remarks on national sovereignty. As always, UNITA wants to deal with each point of the agenda in order to gain time. The zigzag began when UNITA was late in submitting its proposal. The situation worsened in view of the need to redraft it. Sources that asked not to be named say UNITA's document contains more thorns than roses. In addition to the three key ministries, UNITA has demanded a more equitable redistribution of provincial governments, including one of the country's main commercial ports. The news media and UNITA's members being held in custody in Luanda are two other specific issues raised by the organization.
