The Bosnian Serbs have started the mass withdrawal of their heavy equipment from Sarajevo. In exchange the Russian command must transfer to Sarajevo 400 paratroopers from its battalion, which is part of the international peacekeeping forces in Croatia. Russia's initiative has already been welcomed by France and Italy. The agreement with the Serbs was achieved by Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of the Russian president and deputy foreign minister, who in these past few days has been plying continuously between Geneva, Sarajevo, Belgrade, Pale, and who today at last arrived in Moscow by plane. [Churkin] Zagreb and Skopje also need mentioning in order to attain a full picture. [Kalyagin] Zagreb and Skopje. So this is your first interview back on Russian soil. Vitaliy Ivanovich, what has been achieved is a real breakthrough. How, after all, did you manage to achieve this? [Churkin] Three elements of our proposal undoubtedly brought a decisive influence to bear on the Serbs. First, the fact that Russia made a request to them. The words, request by Russia, made a literally stunning impression on them. Second, the fact that the letter which I took with me to Belgrade and Pale was signed by President Yeltsin. And third, the fact that this letter contained an obligation by the Russian side, by the Russian Federation, to send to Sarajevo its contingent which is part of the UN peacekeeping forces, so that the Serbs could have some guarantee for their peace of mind, and the fact that the new balance which is being created in the area of the city as a result of the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from Sarajevo, which the Serbs have now promised, is not upset by the actions of the other side. [Kalyagin] Have you any misgivings that this agreement could all the same be violated by some provocation? [Churkin] There could of course be a provocation, provocations. There could be some ill-considered actions on the part of the Army of the Bosnian Government. However, for this it is necessary to monitor the situation very closely. At present global attention is already riveted to Sarajevo. Of course a fairly considerable UN contingent is already there. So that it seems to me that this danger is nevertheless not all that great. Our country is ensuring that the Serbs fulfill their obligations. The kind of obligations we received in essence signify a resolution of the crisis, the crisis concerning Sarajevo, which in the past week has disturbed the entire world. Our Western partners now must do some work with the Bosnian Government so that it also fully observes the requirements which ensue from the idea of demilitarizing Sarajevo, which we have put forward very powerfully. [Kalyagin] Could NATO strikes still take place? [Churkin] I think not. However, I know that certain NATO officials stand by the concept, which in my view is extremely dangerous, of carrying out air strikes and holding talks; that is, they believe that air strikes must be carried out without fail under whatever pretext, and that this will somehow stimulate the talks. This is a completely absurd concept, which is detached from the realities of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Actions of this kind are certain to wreck the whole talks process. I think that in the present conditions, when the Russian initiative has not only been accepted by the Serbs, but has it must be said received a very good response from many international leaders and from many parts of the world, I think that the chances of such reckless actions are not very great. I am very glad that the United States has now said it is raising its profile in the Bosnian settlement. In this way the prestige of the United States is now also at stake, and if a Bosnian settlement once again slips out of our grip, then it will also mean a loss of prestige for the United States. That leads me to think that the Americans will indeed act positively here. [Kalyagin] So a truce has been reached: What about the next step? Should we not strike while the iron is hot? [Churkin] The next step will be this. First, as far as Sarajevo is concerned, we will propose that the Security Council examine the problem of Sarajevo as a whole -- that is, we press ahead with implementing the UN administration of Sarajevo. In the package for a Bosnian political settlement, the sides have already agreed with this idea in principle. It remains for us to work out the details and to carry out UN administration for two years, as envisaged by the peace accords. Second, from the viewpoint of a general Bosnian settlement; an extremely good opportunity has now emerged to press ahead quickly toward a comprehensive political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the last few days and hours we have been in contact at the very highest levels with representatives of a host of key countries. In this respect Russia now plays a central role in this whole process, and I think that in the coming days and weeks one can expect some very important meetings and decisions in this sphere.
