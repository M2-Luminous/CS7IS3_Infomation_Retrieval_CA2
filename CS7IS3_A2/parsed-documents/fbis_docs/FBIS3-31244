"We will not leave our people -- who have always lived here -- unprotected. We have no right to do something like that and nothing can force us to abandon our people to the mercy of the fanatical Muslim units," he said. Mladic held talks today with General Jean Cot, UNPROFOR commander for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR commander for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin attended a part of the talks. General Mladic described the talks with Generals Cot and Rose as very useful. "We exchanged views and I promised them we will fully observe the cease-fire agreed on 10 February and that we are ready to discuss any contentious issues with the other side," he said. Mladic recalled that it was the Muslims who started the war against the Serbs, declaring it jointly with the Croats, and that now the Bosnian Serbs expect that "those who declared war on us should withdraw such a declaration now." "When this happens at the highest political level, then everything else will be technical detail," General Mladic said, adding that "we are offering peace to our adversaries and we will try to halt any combat activities in Sarajevo in the forthcoming period." Asked what kind of guarantees the Serb side demanded from NATO, General Mladic said he expects that "NATO will understand the trick of the Muslim side, which wants Sarajevo to ignite a new world war." "I expect all NATO members to perform their duties and threaten the Serbs as much as the Serbs are threatening them. I also told Cot that every member of the international forces and humanitarian organizations has been and will be safe on our territory. NATO should stick to its original policy -- defending the territories of those countries that created it. If I were in the shoes of the people who make decisions in NATO, I would not be transforming that organization into an international beating stick, because each stick has got two ends and does not have a part that cannot be broken," Mladic said. Commenting on the failure of the Muslim army commander Rasim Delic to attend the meeting, allegedly due to other business engagements, Mladic said that "General Delic is in fact busy with affairs in central Bosnia, where he is waging a war against the Croats." "However, for them this is only an excuse, because most probably they are not going to contact us before 21 February, expecting NATO to do their job. They are fervently hoping that air strikes against the Serb people, villages, towns, and army will take place and are doing everything for this to happen," Mladic said. Speaking about the withdrawal of the Serb artillery from positions surrounding Sarajevo, Mladic said that this could be discussed only after the signing of a peace agreement. "We will allow UN observers to be deployed at certain positions and I will not disclose any other details in this connection. I told General Cot what to suggest to the Muslim side. I believe you understand that as soon as I withdraw our forces from Sarajevo, I will leave the Serb population to be slaughtered by the Muslims, as happened on 4 May 1992," Mladic said.
