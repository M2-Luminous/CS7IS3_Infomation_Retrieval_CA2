He said: Now that the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress has completely fulfilled its agenda and the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee has elected the members, secretary, and deputy secretaries of the standing committee of the provincial party committee, we have accomplished the task of forming such a collective leading body as the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee. We also have endorsed a list of members, secretary and deputy secretaries of the provincial discipline inspection commission standing committee who were elected at the First Plenary Session of the Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission. The fact that we have been elected members of the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee shows that the broad masses of party members and people in Hubei have placed their trust in us. At present, Hubei is at an important juncture of reform, opening up, and modernization building. So the newly elected Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee has been entrusted with a glorious and arduous historical mission. We must rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus; conscientiously implement and carry out to the letter the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of both Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; mobilize, organize, and lead the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to firmly seize the current historical opportunity and vigorously press ahead with reform and opening up; carry forward our cause; forge ahead into the future; make more progress and headway; strive to open up new vistas for Hubei's work by adopting a new mental attitude and a new style; fulfill all tasks laid down by the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress; and strive to live up to the trust of the party and the ardent expectations of the people. Guan Guangfu also spelled out the following views on stepping up party building within the newly elected Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee: 1. To strengthen the study of theory. At present, Guan Guangfu said, it is all the more imperative to study conscientiously Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a view to enhancing a sense of consciousness and of resolution with respect to implementing and carrying out the party's basic line and the party's principles and policies aimed at developing a socialist market economy; scientifically, systematically, farsightedly, and creatively carry out all types of work; and study new theories, especially market economic theories and modern science and technology, in light of the new conditions. It should be noted that as we are still far from proficient in these fields, we have yet to make redoubled efforts to catch up. 2. To carry out work in a realistic and down-to-earth manner. By pooling the wisdom of all, the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress worked out a number of strategic goals and tasks for Hubei throughout the 1990s. Therefore, we should carry forward a revolutionary spirit of hard work, plain living, and selfless sacrifice in all types of work. First, we should strive to develop democracy, prudently make decisions on a scientific basis, and map out more realistic and feasible policies and measures. Second, we should combine collective leadership with division of work and responsibilities, clearly define responsibilities for major sectors, and enable cadres to assume personal responsibilities for their work. To this end, various prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures, as well as all major fronts, should firmly establish a system under which party committee standing committee members are assigned specific job-related responsibilities and are able to comprehend and tackle major issues in a timely fashion. Third, we should strengthen a sense of the overall situation and oppose selfish departmentalism. Fourth, cadres should assume personal responsibilities for their work and undertake to improve a feedback analysis system. Fifth, we should conscientiously carry out investigation and study, show more concern for grassroots work, dispatch more cadres to grassroots level, go deep among the broad masses of people as well as into the reality, acquire first-hand information about grass-roots work, personally listen to views of the masses; study new situations, and tackle new problems. Sixth, we should bring into full play the roles of various functional departments; cut down on the number of entertainment activities in which provincial leaders are involved; and reduce the number of meetings, documents, and ordinary news reports. Members of the provincial party committee standing committee should concentrate more efforts on carrying out in-depth investigation and study, and on discussing and tackling major issues. 3. To persist in a democratic centralism system. To this end, first, we should persist in and perfect a system under which the provincial party committee standing committee makes regular work reports to the provincial party committee, and under which major decisions are made after exhaustive discussions among the standing committee members. Second, we should strengthen the provincial party committee standing committee's collective leadership. After the current plenary session, we should immediately convene a provincial party committee standing committee meeting at which we will study ways and means aimed at establishing and perfecting several basic work systems for the provincial party committee standing committee, including a standing committee meeting system, an investigation and study system, a work responsibility system, a personnel appointment and removal system, a diligent and honest government system, and so on. We also should work out a number of specific, applicable, and detailed rules and regulations; improve democratic activities; carry out criticism and self- criticism; and constantly enhance unity within the standing committee. Members of the provincial party committee and standing committee should listen modestly to views from different quarters and should consciously accept supervision by the party and people. 4. To resolutely carry on a protracted struggle against corruption and build a clean government. The newly elected Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee must strive to withstand the test confronting the ruling party and the test of reform and opening up, and should make resolute and unswerving efforts to build a diligent and clean government and oppose all sorts of corrupt phenomena. In accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on opposing corruption and building a clean government, I would like to propose the following rules and regulations. I do hope that leading cadres at all levels in Hubei will set a good example in observing them: 1) Leading cadres should take the lead in observing all five regulations promulgated by the central authorities on performing official duties honestly and abiding strictly by the law; 2) Leading cadres should take the lead in carrying forward the tradition and style of hard work and plain living, and in opposing all types of extravagance and waste; 3) Leading cadres should avoid using luxury cars and taking large entourages, and should spend money and have meals according to relevant regulations whenever they go down to the grass-roots level; 4) Leading cadres should not try to build, decorate, or occupy residences in violation of relevant regulations; 5) Leading cadres should use cars in accordance with the relevant regulations and should not purchase luxury cars or replace old cars with luxury models without official approval. As the New Year and the Lunar New Year are coming, all provincial party committee members should set a good example in performing official duties honestly and abiding strictly by the law. 5. To firmly adhere to economic construction as the center, strive to deepen reform and expand opening up, take overall interests into account, strengthen coordination among all parties concerned, and make a success of Hubei's work with the support of the broad masses of cadres and people.
