Colonel Roberto Escobar Garcia, a lawyer and PCN secretary general, said yesterday that his party will support ARENA in the runoff. Even though the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not made an official announcement, there are indications that it will be held on 24 April. According to political observers, ARENA should not pursue an alliance in confronting the left in the runoff because it has enough strength to defeat all the leftist parties combined. They also believe Fidel Chavez Mena does not have the leadership to call on the rank and file to vote for ARENA.
