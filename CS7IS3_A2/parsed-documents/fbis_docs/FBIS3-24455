In her opinion, it is useful for the national-communist opposition to undermine the authority of the large television and radio company on the threshold of elections to the City Assembly in order to besmirch not just the reputation of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5, but also the reputation of the political organizations close to the company's management. According to some information, the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent an edict to all the city's rayon administrations to prevent any cases of uncontrolled pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to see that thereafter the content of pre-election broadcasts is coordinated with the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5. In Mr. Malyshev's opinion, it is precisely the RGTRK which is the only rightful broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other broadcasters (even those registered as mass information media) which use the city radio broadcast network must ask its manager for permission to prepare their programs. But it is possible that the scandals surrounding RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 are the result not so much of political as commercial grounds. According to some information, the RGTRK management is working up a variant for creating a joint stock company (with all buildings, structures, and equipment of the RGTRK transferred to it) with the participation of the American company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, which proposes to offer 49 percent of the charter capital of the future joint stock company, and of another limited partnership whose founders are as yet unknown. The documents on the joint stock company's creation were passed through by Dmitriy Mezentsev, head of the mayor's office committee for press and mass information media, and arrived on the desk of the minister of the press, Vladimir Shumeyko. However, the television and radio company's financial activity is of increasing interest to law enforcement organs. The procurator's office demanded documents on its deals with the joint stock company "Kommercheskiy tsentr TV i radio Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. Petersburg] and the joint stock company "Nevskiy Glashatay" [Neva Herald].
