Speaking after talks with Mr. Christopher, Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said he shared Washington's concern at the detention and harassment of Chinese dissidents. Senator Evans said protesting at this was not a matter of interfering in China's internal affairs or applying Western standards. But Senator Evans said Australia was against trade sanctions, except in extreme circumstances and supported continued privileges for China under the MFN scheme. Meanwhile, Mr. Christopher has repeated an assurance that Washington does not intend its trade dispute with Japan to do harm to Australia. He gave the reassurance after talks in Canberra with Senator Evans and the trade minister, Senator Bob McMullan. Camille Funnell reports: [Begin recording] [Funnell] The U.S. secretary of state told the Australians it was not the intention of the U.S. to start a trade war with Japan, but he repeated that America wanted greater access to the Japanese market. He says Australia should take heart about American assurances from the track record of U.S. President Bill Clinton. [passage omitted] Senator Evans says Australia still has legitimate concerns about the approach taken by the U.S. toward Japan and will continue to express its concern. [end recording]
