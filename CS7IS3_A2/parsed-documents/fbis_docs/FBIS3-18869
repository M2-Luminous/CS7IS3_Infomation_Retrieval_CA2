Yesterday, Judge Thierry Jean-Pierre, who on 3 December was entrusted with the organized crime issue, submitted his initial proposals to the Justice Ministry for carrying out "operation criminal networks." Thierry Jean-Pierre feels that "France is behind in the fight because there is no Mafia phenomenon proper, as is the case in Italy. The problem here is that information does not circulate well and is neither confirmed nor analyzed." In his "progress report" submitted to the ministry late last week, the judge advocates setting up 11 jurisdictions specializing in matters of major financial criminality -- suspect dealings, corruption, moneylaundering, misuse of company property -- organized into networks, like the Mafia. The cities in question would be Paris, Versailles, Lille, Rennes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Marseilles, Lyons, Strasbourg, and Orleans. He also suggests creating a "Organized Crime Suppression Squad" (BRREC) comprising policemen, gendarmes, and customs officers which would carry out investigations on the basis of "one team, one objective, one budget." In addition, he feels that all intelligence could be centralized in a "Crime Research and Investigation Department" (DEESC). Lastly, the judge puts forward the idea of being able to reverse the burden of proof, an audacious move in French law. Someone with a dubious fortune would have to prove the legal origin of the funds, whereas at present it is the justice system that has to prove that they were illegally earned. "But this idea is just a proposal," Thierry Jean-Pierre assured. Thierry Jean-Pierre estimates that the whole system will need a budget of 20 million francs [Fr]. "That is not much," he concludes, "in view of the Fr20 billion in sales made through narcotics trafficking in France." Several organizations are already in place for fighting financial criminality. Yesterday, the judge refused to go into the delicate matter of whether these would be kept in place. Nevertheless, his report is particularly harsh on one of them, the Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption (SCPC), which was set up in January 1993 when Michel Vauzelle was minister of justice. The SCPC's current secretary general, Pierre-Antoine Lorenzi, was Mr. Vauzelle's head of staff. In December, Mr. Lorenzi publicly questioned the appointment of the "paradox" Thierry Jean-Pierre. Reliable sources say that the judge concluded his report, in substance, by saying that the SCPC "is operating in an illegal manner by carrying out investigations without being entitled to do so and by keeping the results for itself instead of forwarding them to the public prosecutor's office." On the other hand, the judge is said to feel that the Central Office for the Suppression of Major Financial Criminality (OCRGDF) must be maintained, as well as the AntiMafia Intelligence Unit (URCRAM), both of which are answerable to the Interior Ministry. The Finance Ministry's TRACFIN [group specializing in intelligence and operations against underground financial networks], however, could be incorporated into the DEESC. Thierry Jean-Pierre plans to hand in a second interim report in June, and the final report in September, so that any bill that might arise from it could be put on the agenda of the fall session of Parliament.
