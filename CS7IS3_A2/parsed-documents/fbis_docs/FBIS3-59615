Heerman, chief of Siemens' Oostkamp-based Laboratory for Production Techniques, and Engineer L. Danneels: "New Structure for Electrical Appliances"; date and place of interview not given] [Excerpts] The current structure of electronic subassemblies (for example, machine controls) is not recycling-friendly. This is partly due to the fact that an electrical appliance contains several of the elements in Mendeleyev's table and, given the minute quantities of each element, dismantling and recovery is not really profitable. The research department of Siemens in Oostkamp is specializing in making processes and production methods more environmentally-friendly. It has also looked at the structure of electronic appliances. This led, among other things, to a new way of constructing electronic subassemblies. This technique will now also be marketed outside Siemens. M. Heerman, chief of the Laboratory for Production Techniques of Siemens in Oostkamp, and Engineer L. Danneels talked about the new technique. Environmentally-Friendly Production [passage omitted outlining changes in environment legislation over the past five years] The environmental charges, which have previously been paid implicitly by the government (or by nature), are now increasingly being picked up by manufacturers. Given that this has resulted in the three environmental aspects -- air, water, and refuse -- gradually becoming the focus of attention, the realization slowly grew that blithely rotating the pollution between air, water, refuse, and energy is not an environmentally-friendly mode of operation. In any event, closer analysis showed that this method was also unnecessarily expensive. Think Ecologically Materials and energy flows were then examined and an attempt was made to minimize the total of all the flows. This is taking place first and foremost in the internal production process. Within Siemens' organization, Siemens Oostkamp has already successfully carried out instructions to "make part of the production process more environmentally friendly," on several occasions, particularly in German establishments. Making something more environmentally friendly can be by better streamlining of production (which means, for example, eliminating interim storage, and simply doing away with lubricating steel tools to prevent rusting, only to clean them again afterwards). Sometimes, it can be achieved by using different production methods (for example, using sludge-free techniques such as electrolysis when regenerating treatment baths). One essential step in this process is that when new products and production processes are developed, those responsible should begin to think in terms of ecological balance sheets: The environmental impact of the entire process -- from raw material to end-of-life product. In order to make it possible to prepare these ecological balance sheets, Siemens Oostkamp has perfected a software package that can compare the ecological balance sheets of various production processes. This package is now being marketed by Siemens Nixdorf. In addition, right from the product development stage, attention must be paid to building in a certain level of "recycling potential." Modifying Product Composition Under pressure from the legislator, those in product development have also woken up to the obligation that certain products have to be taken back for recycling at the end of their useful life. Returning products was for a time restricted to packaging (and packaging refuse), but as of January 1994 electrical engineering manufacturers and distributors in Germany will also have to take back decommissioned products. [passage omitted on shortening life cycles of consumer electronics products] Companies are therefore finding themselves up against a huge refuse mountain and do not know what to do with it -- dumping is definitely not a solution the legislator will permit. The only answer is to break it up and sort it into raw materials which can be processed together, which is an expensive method of recycling material. Processing today's electrical appliances costs 3-4 German marks per kilogram if it is carried out by specialized, environmentally-conscious reprocessing companies. If Siemens were to take back all its appliances, that would mean 200,000 tonnes per year. To be profitable, these recycling costs have to drop, and this implies only one solution: Change the raw materials and the structure of the new products released on to the market so that material recycling becomes possible at the end of the product's life. `Original' Solution Siemens recognized this problem some years ago. Around five years ago, its Central Research department was therefore given the task of finding a more recycling-friendly composition for electrical products. This work was carried out by Siemens Oostkamp. Its instructions were: "Not just green, but also blue," which means not only looking at the environmentally-friendly aspects, but also making sure that the new production method is cheaper and offers technological advantages! This led to what is known as the SIL [Injection-Molded Components with Integrated Conductive Paths]. So what does this involve? A normal electrical appliance is usually built up of various printed circuits, plug-connected to a board or independently mounted in a chassis and mutually linked via connectors and cabling. This is usually surrounded by a metal shield, so that the entire unit complies with EMC [electromagnetic compatibility) standards, which is then fitted with a housing. The components on the boards are usually cooled using special cooling fins. If this construction method is examined closely, it is obvious that it is a material-greedy and expensive (labor-intensive) method. This is due to the separation of the functions of electronics, cooling, shielding, substrate, plug, and housing. Using the SIL technique, certain functions in the housing are integrated. In the housing, the functions of EMC shielding, heat removal, plug function, and conductors between connector pins will be combined. This has been made possible by the choice of a strong, heat-resistant, injectable plastic. In addition, a suitable production method was developed for applying a copper layer to this plastic, a laser-based process was used to make a three-dimensional conductor structure from it, and a process was developed enabling soldering without causing damage. Test Case Proves Viability This method is used to build the substrate of a PLC [programmable logic control] circuit. The initial advantage is the reduction in components and suppliers. The old construction required 11 individual components (housing, EMC shielding, insulation, PCB [printed circuit board] with connectors and heat removal fins, and several sets of screws and bolts) from various suppliers, all of which of course had to be transported (also environmentally-unfriendly). Now, the housing with integrated pins, holders, and securing fins are all made in one piece, using the injection molding process. The metallization layer provides EMC shielding, heat removal, and conductor connections between the connector pins of the plug connection. The second advantage is the level of recyclability of the product. The 11 functions are achieved using only two materials (plastic and copper), both of which can be recycled. Advantage number three relates to economics. The production process is simpler, as a result of the short manufacturing time and the elimination of many suppliers. The test case also proves that production itself is clearly cheaper (if sufficient numbers are made). The fourth advantage is the extremely fine laser structuring (approximately 100 micron), which means that the direct integration of SMD [surface mounted devices] or even bare integrated circuits or microengineering components is possible. However, the big disadvantage is that this is all very new and still in the design phase. All the possibilities have yet to be "discovered." Prototyping is more difficult: As with a designer housing, making a model is difficult and time-consuming. For this application, the model was cut from a solid block. Siemens Oostkamp hopes that the use of stereolithography (making pieces from a CAD [computer-aided design] design using adapted machines) can provide an answer. Nevertheless, current experience is already teaching that this method is an ecological alternative to the present, non-ecological structure. Experience has yet to be gained. Marketing has started: Siemens Oostkamp is offering its services to all electronics manufacturers wanting to learn how to integrate the new method into their products. From Central Research Department to The Outside World In the past, every major company had a large research and development section where technological development took place and, as a spin-off, improved production techniques were devised. Laser etching (writing to surfaces of resistances and capacitors, for instance, using a guided laser beam, which means the message can flexibly be adapted per component) was one of the techniques perfected by the Oostkamp plant of Siemens' Central Research department. Siemens' Central Research also financed Oostkamp's reorientation toward the development of environmentally-friendly production techniques, which started five years ago. All R&D functions -- the development of both technologies and products -- were previously seen as strategic and were developed within the framework of a centrally controlled research policy. One company, no matter how large, can no longer afford to specialize in everything and carry out all the research and development it requires. Thus, for example, the development of general production techniques is no longer considered a component of core business research. For this reason, Siemens' Central Research department is gradually being slimmed down. One of the three departments in Germany was closed and activities in the Oostkamp-based research facility -- which has already been mentioned above and which was the only foreign research team in this centralized R&D department -- were reoriented. Oostkamp is now entering the market as a technical consultancy agency. The goal is clear: subcontracting for third parties. Logically speaking, it will enter the field in which it excels: environmentally-friendly production techniques for electronic engineering. Activities also include consulting with respect to process techniques, for example, making chemical surface techniques more environmentally friendly. These techniques were demonstrated at the IFEST fair in October. Oostkamp also wants to help other electronics companies to develop products and subassemblies using a new, recycling-friendly method.
