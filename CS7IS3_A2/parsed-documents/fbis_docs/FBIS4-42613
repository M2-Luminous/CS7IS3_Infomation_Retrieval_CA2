One remembers that, in the last election campaign, i.e. in 1989, old-age pension was one of the main issues. Which explains why a newly formed party claiming greater pension fairness to be at the top of its agenda could win four parliamentary seats right away. In the meantime a lot has changed in that field, and the retirement pension has received a powerful stimulus. Although two parallel pension systems still exist in Luxemburg, a contributive and a non-contributive one, and while the abolition of this fundamental injustice, i.e. the division of a country's citizens in two classes, has to be kept in mind, the government that emerged from the 1989 elections has to be praised for taking a number of steps in the direction of harmonizing the two systems. In view of a further reconciliation of the two pension systems, for example, the contribution limit was raised to five times the amount of the minimum wage. Retirement pensions have indeed been improved. There is more pension fairness today. The retirement benefits of the civil service and the private sector have structurally moved towards each other, in part because not all wage elements in the civil service were passed on to the retirees, and private supplementary insurances were made tax-deductible. The CSV wants to have these measures put into law. While the act of 22 December 1989 regulated the transition between contributory and non-contributory pension systems, the Pension Improvement Act of 24 April 1990 implemented the goal laid out in the administration's program: to achieve more pension fairness and a gradual adjustment to the non-contributory retirement plan through structural improvements of the contributory retirement insurance. It must be mentioned that the fiscal reform realized by the CSV in 1984 against much opposition created the basis for the pension improvement. The personal minimum retirement benefit rose between 1989 and 1994 from 26,167 Luxemburg francs [Lf] to Lf35,847; the minimum widow's pension from Lf17,443 to Lf28,784. The average worker's pension was raised by 50.4 percent between 1987 and 1994 from Lf39,281 to Lf50,093; the average private employee's pension by 50.1 percent from Lf53,258 to Lf79,957; the average pension for craftsmen and business people by 52 percent from Lf32,532 to Lf49,433; and the average farmer's pension by 49.8 percent from Lf25,781 to Lf38,626. In general, benefits were increased by 12 percent. Several additional examples could be cited to prove that the government, through the CSV impulse, has kept the promise of more pension fairness it had made in the 1989 government statement. Thus the Christian-Social People's Party, upon whose initiative all major welfare legislation was passed, can be trusted when it promises in its election program that it will continue to adjust pensions to the wage and price development and that it will have retirement benefits and pensions converge more strongly. All the more after the CSV has given its welfare policy the label of "Solidarity". "We want more internal solidarity," states the CSV election program. To implement a fair pension policy is basically no more than real solidarity between the active portion of the population and those people who, for decades, have given their best for our country.
