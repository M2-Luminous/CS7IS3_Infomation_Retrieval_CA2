He explained that for this reason, the agreement suits both sides. Zatulin recalled that the agreement signed between Georgia and Abkhazia with the participation of the Russian Federation and the United Nations contains two documents: "One is related to the refugee problems, and the other concerns political settlement of the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia". Zatulin described accords reached in Moscow as "very positive, because any other solution would have threatened war".
