In a resolution passed at the end of the MWU's annual congress in Johannesburg on Wednesday, the union said it expected an increase in membership in reaction to affirmative action which would benefit blacks. White miners would in future seek the protection of a white trade union as they would be unable to voice their aspirations through political channels. The congress regretted the break-down in talks between the Freedom Alliance, the government and the African National Congress, saying a golden opportunity for a permanent and peaceful political solution had been lost.
