In the morning plenary meeting, the National Assembly continued to discuss the revised draft law on elections of the People's Councils under the direction of National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. The revised draft law includes a preamble and 71 articles in 10 chapters. The draft law amends 54 articles, supplements 10 others, and retains the other seven articles of the old law. During their discussion, the deputies expressed their unanimous views on the quality of deputies specified by the revised draft law as persons who are loyal to the socialist Vietnamese fatherland, who can represent the people in various ways, who have records of good conduct and abide strictly by the law, who are enthusiastic in protecting the interests of the state and the people, who have good general backgrounds, are competent in carrying out National Assembly activities and resolving pressing local issues, and who are trusted by the people. The deputies also discussed the composition of People's Councils and the quality of people's councilors. Some deputies suggested that candidates who failed in the first election should not be allowed to run in People's Councils by-elections, and that only new candidates should be allowed in such elections. Other deputies said that efforts should be made to ensure equality of rights between nominated candidates and independent candidates, and so forth. This afternoon the National Assembly will continue its work at the conference hall in Hanoi.
