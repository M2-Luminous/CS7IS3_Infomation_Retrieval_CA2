What is your comment on these statements? [Dragoshi] As is made known to the entire public through the Albanian mass media, some time ago the Tirana District Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal proceedings against five [as heard] minority members in the districts of Delvine, Sarande, and Gjirokaster, who are charged with ordinary and political crimes, such as the illegal keeping of arms and anti-constitutional activities. As the social danger of these criminal acts is very accentuated, we have arrested them. The investigators charged to inquire into these cases have been sent to the respective districts to carry out the investigation of criminal cases and interrogate witnesses. More specifically, these investigators have summoned 30 or more witnesses to clarify these cases. That is, the fact of summoning these witnesses does not mean that they were apprehended or arrested by the Prosecutor's Office. They are summoned only to be interrogated as witnesses and to clarify charges against the persons arrested. The announcement on the arrest of these persons, broadcast by various mass media and the Greek Government officials, is not at all true. I, once again, declare publicly that this fact is not true. [as heard] [Cico] How many arrested persons are there? [Dragoshi] The number of the arrested persons, as I mentioned previously, is only six. They are now being investigated while under arrest. To inquire into their case, we will question witnesses, consider documentary evidence, and compile expert reports, as defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
