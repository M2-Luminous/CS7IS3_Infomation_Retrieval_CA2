The region has been held up as a model of development by the World Bank and its success has led to a rethink of the way economies are managed in the recession-mired West. In its recent annual survey, the Asian Development Bank predicted the area's leading economies would continue to crackle along at close to double-digit pace for at least the next two years and perhaps until the end of the decade. With a new World Trading Order coming into effect, China emerging as the fourth global economic engine and old political boundaries to trade being swept aside, prospects for the Southeast Asian states have probably never looked brighter. But as this promise of a seemingly unending boom unveils, there are also more than a few clouds looming on the horizon. Among the flashpoints for anxiety are the political upheaval in Japan, a growing balance of payments deficits in Indonesia and the Philippines, the trade dispute between China and the United States and manpower shortages. Possibly the most entrenched problem facing all the Asean states is flagging foreign investor interest. According to a survey by Merrill Lynch International Bank released last month, 1993 data on direct foreign investment largely confirms earlier suspicions that the sub-region's attractiveness is slipping as foreign firms focussed more on China, India and Vietnam. Other than the Philippines, which reported a sharp 85 percent jump in investments to $529 million in 1993, the other three developing economies of Southeast Asia--Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia--all registered declines in approved investments for the second consecutive year. Thailand and Malaysia were the worst hit. Approvals for foreign equity fell 68.1 percent to $233 million in Thailand, and dropped by over 60 percent to $912 million in Malaysia. Indonesia experienced a more modest four percent fall in approvals to $7.72 billion in the same period. Much of the surge in foreign investment, which fuelled the Southeast Asian boom in the early 1980s was driven by the need of Japan and other nations, hit by appreciation of their currencies, to maintain export markets abroad. "With diminishing importance of low-cost labour as a key investment criteria, and the emergence of big domestic markets like China and India, Southeast Asian nations will need to develop a new set of comparative advantages to revive investor interest," the Merrill Lynch report said. Finance analysts expect the next wave of foreign investment into Southeast Asia to target the services industries if host governments are prepared to lay out the welcome mat. This would mean more conventional ways to attract investments such as more business-friendly policies, cutting red tape and ensuring a good operating climate supported by strong infrastructure, bankers say. For many foreign investors, the objective now is to seek access to domestic markets. But investment laws in most Asean nations, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, are only liberal on permissible foreign equity if the bulk of production is for export. By comparison, China and India allow majority-owned foreign ventures in a wide range of industries, and the two countries are reaping the benefits of their more liberal laws. Investment approvals for China last year rose by more than 385 percent to $58.12 billion in 1993. In India, they jumped 93.7 percent to $2.91 billion. Infrastructure Woes In addition to the requirements of the private sector there is an even greater need within the region for investment to address heavy infrastructure shortcomings if growth is to be secured, bankers and analysts say. The ADB estimates that Asia--excluding Japan--will need nearly one trillion dollars in the next decade for infrastructure such as roads and power plants telecommunications and railways to maintain economic growth. Urging the region to raise spending on basic development by 40 percent the ADB warned in its annual report that "any lag in the supply of infrastructure will undoubtedly slow down development over time, even if all other factors are favourable". Power and transport needed most new spending. Each sector required $300-350 billion in investment, telecommunications $150 billion and water supply and sanitation up to $100 billion by the year 2000. The sheer size of the amount of money needed will require governments, many who are already pressed by growing budget deficits, to look past traditional sources of capital such as the World Bank and the ADB. "It is becoming apparent that our needs will outstrip the resources of these institutions. We must turn to private capital providers," Indonesia's Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said at the recent Apec Finance Ministers meeting in Honolulu. But while regional governments are aware of the need for long-term investment funds, many fear that real flows of private capital, and in particular speculative "hot" money into stock markets will lead to instability. They argue that at the moment there are no guarantees on the nature or direction of capital flows except regulation. The investor economies, such as the United States and Europe argue that regulation does little to attract capital. Washington was particularly active at the Apec finance minister's meeting pressing Asian economies to further open their financial markets. But with financial services excluded from the Uruguay Round accord which was signed in Marrakesh earlier this month, Asian nations have won some breathing space to resist Western demands for further liberalisation. Early indicators suggest that in the interim they are cautiously taking steps to remedy the problem. Southeast Asian capital market regulators agreed earlier this month to set up a forum to evolve common procedures for tapping overseas funds and beef up enforcement of laws governing their fledgling markets. Thailand granted offshore status to 34 foreign banks in March last year. Asean countries are also looking at sources closer to home to raise capital. The Kuala Lumpur based Asean Institute, which was launched in 1991 as a private sector initiative to promote closer economic ties among the six member countries announced plans last week to launch a 1-million ringgit (US$40 million) investment fund next month that will specialize in Southeast Asian economies. Singapore, traditionally an investor in established capitalist economies, is targeting developing Asian nations for 20-30 percent of its reserve capital. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singapore would be looking at Vietnam, India and even Burma for regional investment opportunities, but primarily to China. Changing Economic Landscape While the rapid emergence of China as an economic power has diverted foreign investment funds from Southeast Asia, the Asean states are also ideally positioned to profit from the giant's growth. "China took up the slack of the stimulus from advanced countries," Lawrence Krause of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council [PECC] said at the forum's 10th international general meeting in Kuala Lumpur in March. "China's imports have grown by more than 25 percent in the last two years and a growing share of imports are coming from the PECC countries," he said. Access to the huge internal markets of China and India, which have a combined population of two billion, is expected to help maintain Southeast Asia's dynamism and reduce its vulnerability to adverse trends in markets in the industrial world. But in the short term, the rapid growth of the Chinese economy -- a world leading 13 percent last year -- poses problems of its own. China's sizzling growth is widely viewed as unsustainable and the government, wrestling with the social problems of runaway inflation and the spiralling costs of domestic investment, is expected to slam on the monetary brakes soon. Such action could lead to a drastic decline in economic activity. "With the Pacific region so dependent upon the economic outcome in China, there is much concern that an extreme cannot be avoided," Krause said. Adding to concerns about China, is Washington's threat to strip the country of preferential trade status unless it improves its human rights record. If carried through, the move would affect billions of dollars worth of exports and trigger a trade war that could shave several growth points off many of the economies in Asia. A similarly bitter dispute between Washington and Tokyo over access for US companies to Japanese markets could also have a destabilizing impact on economies in the region. Japan, already hampered by a strong yen, structural imbalances and balance sheet adjustment after declines in equity and real estate prices, is just beginning to show signs of recovery from its most serious recession since the last world war. A rupture in trade ties with the United States would be devastating to its weak recovery and damaging to its trading partners. In 1993, for the first time, Japanese trade within the region was greater than that with the United States. The US and Japanese economies are so heavily interdependent, however, that any fallout between the trading giants would have serious repercussions with its smaller trading partners. Aids and Social Problems While economic growth has spawned a growing middle class, Asia's success hides the largest concentration of poor in the world. The ADB's usual optimism was tempered this year by concern over unchecked population growth, urban poverty, environmental decline and the spectre of an uncontrolled Aids epidemic among Asia's teeming billions. The growing Aids epidemic could force nations to change their development priorities towards greater efforts to reduce poverty, the bank said. Regional bankers also note shortages in skilled and semi-skilled labour and political instability in Indonesia and Thailand as areas which could help prevent the Southeast Asian states from making their apparent date with development.
