FR940826-2-00107 FR940826-2-00055 e. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that: ``Each Bell operating telephone company shall not discriminate between any mobile service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated mobile service provider or between an interexchange service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange carrier in the: ``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards; ``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell operating telephone company's telecommunications service and facilities or in the charges for each element of service; and ``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities used to provide exchange access.'' f. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that: ``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall offer to all interexchange carriers exchange access and exchange services for such access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service provided by the Bell company or any affiliate thereof.'' Implicit in this concept and in the concept of equal access is that the price, quality and terms upon which cellular service is offered shall not vary with the customer's choice of interexchange carrier. That proposition should be affirmed explicitly: ``A Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof shall not sell or contract to sell wireless service at a price, term or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains interexchange service from the Bell Operating Company or an affiliate thereof.'' In addition, the Department believes that the same proposition should apply to the sale of interexchange service: ``To the extent that a Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof provides interexchange services pursuant to this order to unaffiliated wireless services providers or customers thereof, the Bell Operating Company shall not sell or contract to sell interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains wireless service from the Bell Operating Company or an affiliate thereof.'' Finally, in order for these guarantees to be meaningful, the Department believes that the Bell Operating Companies should be required to state separately the prices, terms or rate plans for (a) wireless services and (b) interexchange services. g. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that: ``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall not discriminate between any interexchange service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange service carrier in the: ``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards; ``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell Operating Company's or affiliate's telecommunications service and facilities or in the charges for each element of service; and ``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities used to provide exchange access.'' h. That the BOCs shall file with the Department of a mobile equal access plan, which plan shall not be effective (1) until 90 days after filing, if not disapproved by the Department, or (2) if disapproved by the Department; that there be no authority to provide interexchange services pursuant to this waiver until an equal access plan has become effective; and that the plan at a minimum contains the specifications contained in the BOC Model Equal Access Plan submitted on September 24, 1993, as modified by your letter of November 12, 1993, except in the following particulars: (1) The Department believes that it is necessary in the provision of equal access that interexchange services not be sold by the persons selling exchange services and who are required to administer presubscription (the ``cellular sales force''). It is the Department's contemplation that this restriction would apply to retail store agents and to other BOC salespersons who receive inquiries by prospective subscribers, i.e., salespersons who handle ``incoming'' prospects or requests for service. (2) Persons selling long distance services (the ``long distance sales force'') may sell cellular services and long distance services on the following conditions: (a) That the long distance sales force be a distinct group of individuals, with separate managers, from the cellular sales force and from any sales force that sells products or services of the Bell Operating telephone companies.
