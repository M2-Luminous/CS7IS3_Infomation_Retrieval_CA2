FR940725-0-00151 FR940725-0-00019 (1) The atmosphere in the space is monitored continuously, and (2) Respiratory protection and other necessary and appropriate personal protective equipment and clothing are provided in accordance with Subpart I of part 1915. As explained earlier, OSHA has decided to permit entries for emergency rescue and for short duration entries to install ventilation equipment even if the space contains a hazardous atmosphere, which in this case refers to toxic substances. The procedures required will protect employees from hazards associated with exposure to these toxic substances. The atmosphere must be monitored continuously during this limited entry to ensure that the control measures are working as intended and that the entrant is aware of any changes in conditions in the space. Final ยง1915.12(c)(4) requires personal protective equipment to protect employees from the adverse effects of exposure to toxic substances. This control measure is already required by existing Subpart I. However, OSHA believes that providing a mandatory reference in the text of the regulation will serve to emphasize the importance of the required personal protective equipment. The Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) reviewed OSHA's proposal and made several recommendations concerning new areas of shipyard employment that should be regulated in ยง1915.12 (Tr. 79&hyph;80, 90, 99; 4/25/90). These recommendations included adding requirements to address the training and duties of employees entering confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, rescue teams, and exchanging hazard information between employers. SESAC voted unanimously to include training, and overwhelmingly supported provisions for rescue teams and exchanging hazard information between employers. As noted earlier in this preamble, the notice reopening the record on Subpart B published the text of the recommended provisions and requested public comment on them. Paragraph (d) of final ยง1915.12 contains requirements for the training and duties of employees entering confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the training requirements listed in the notice reopening the record (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;4, 11&hyph;5, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their entirety. They stated that training was essential in preventing accidents and in promoting self-rescue. The Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation (Ex. 11&hyph;6) expressed this view as follows: We feel that training is essential to employees understanding the potential dangers in entering confined spaces which have not been checked and verified as being safe. We support the SESAC recommendations. No commenter objected to any of SESAC's recommended requirements. Therefore, these provisions have been incorporated into the final rule. A few rulemaking participants suggested that the final standard also include some requirements in addition to those proposed by SESAC. Three commenters recommended the inclusion of provisions requiring the training of shipyard competent persons (Ex. 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;44). Marine and Environmental Testing, Inc. (Ex. 11&hyph;10), best represented the arguments of these commenters as follows:
