The delegation of commanders, comprising representatives from each political force of Afghanistan, have initiated their peace efforts some two weeks ago to put an end to the ongoing blood bath in war battered Kabul. The commanders held a series of meetings and parleys with the warring factions, including President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Chief of HIA Golboddin Hekmatyar and discussed with them a number of proposals and suggestions to thrash out a viable and amicable solution to the decade long dispute. After thorough consultation and hectic meetings with combatants, the delegation of the commanders finally came out with an eight-point peace formula. First point being the permanent ceasefire, effective from January 20 from 6 am immediate stoppage of propaganda against each other. Other points included that warring factions would have to leave their positions by January 30 by handing it over to the commanders from Kabul province and finally, Kabul commanders would be responsible for the security of capital. All the combatant factions would abide by the peace plan. According to AIP, a four-member delegation led by Hash-matullah Mujaddodi has arrived here Wednesday [19 Jan] which would hold negotiations with high-ranking officials of the Government of Pakistan besides meeting leaders of the Afghan political forces. A member of the delegation told AIP, that "we will not agree to any proposal or suggestion which do not provide assurance regarding resignation of President Rabbani", Prof Rabbani's resignation was a must for the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan, he said. Other members of the delegation included HIA (Hekmatyar's) Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal, Abdul Karim Zarn of Gen Rashid Dostum's party and Muhammad Rasul Talib of Hizbe Wahdat. Meanwhile, the Hekmatyar led Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan issued a communique declaring its stand on the Kabul commanders' Shura. Since the proposal of the Kabul Commanders' Shura is guaranteeing the declared demands of the coordination council, therefore, "we will observe the required ceasefire from 6.00 am in the morning of Thursday January 20. However, it (Coordination Council) is anxiously awaiting the implementation of the other points of the proposals of the commanders Shura. We commend the efforts of the Kabul Commanders' Shura with regard to the cessation of hostilities and clashes and the establishment of permanent and lasting peace. We are happy that the commanders by issuing their proposal have in fact scorned the claim for jihad of Rabbani and conversely have verified the rightful stand of the coordination Council". The Coordination Council while agreeing to the spirit of the proposal of the Commanders Shura, emphasises the completion of the Commanders Council in a way which will ensure the participation of the Commanders of all parties and sides that have presence in Kabul. The Coordination Council once again declares its rightful stand as follows: 1. That Rabbani has to resign unconditionally. 2. The formation of an interim government through a Shura representing all parties and sides of the confrontation. 3. The evacuation of all armed groups from Kabul. 4. Administration and security of Kabul be assigned to the commanders Shura. And the commanders Shura be the host of the proposed decision making Shura due to be called on February 4, 1994. 5. Holding of elections and the formation of national Islamic army.
