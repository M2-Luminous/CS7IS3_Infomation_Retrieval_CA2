Quoting a senior U.S. Administration official, the newspaper said Jiang gave the word during his summit meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Also during the meeting, Jiang stressed that China does not recognize any nuclear development on the Korean peninsula. The Chinese president said that China would do what could be a plus to the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issues but never do what could be a minus to it. As a concrete measure, Jiang promised not to increase the present level of the shipment of Chinese petroleum, foods and other trade items to North Korea, the paper said. The American official reportedly added that Jiang also made it clear that China will convey to North Korea its position that Beijing cannot recognize military stockpiling of the foods China supplied to North Korea. Another U.S. official said it had been confirmed that North Korea recently offered to China to buy with cash several million dollars worth of diesel oil for use as tank fuel, but China rejected it. U.S. Administration officials said that they had received the impression that China would not obstruct it if there arises a situation in which the United States and other countries would have to take a sanction against North Korea in connection with the nuclear question.
