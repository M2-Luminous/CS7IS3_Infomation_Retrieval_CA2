The special team members called back to headquarters for support. Soon a large number of police arrived and took the situation under control. In a unit of Camp No. 33, the police seized eight kilograms of a drug, suspected to be No. 4 heroin, with an estimated value of 1.6 million Hong Kong dollars. No one was arrested. This is the largest amount of drugs the police has seized recently in the Vietnamese refugee camps. According to an initial investigation made by the police, the above location is a drug dilution and distribution center. The drug comes from Sham Shui Po District, and is sold mainly to addicts among the refugees in the camp area. The police investigation also reveals that the suspects belong to an active Vietnamese drug trafficking group in Hong Kong. Currently, the police are searching for the suspects based on the information provided by the refugees. In the past drug traffickers used to conduct small transactions, each with a small amount. The recent large dealings might be an indication that the number of addicts in the camp area has increased to such an extent that small supplies can no longer meet their requirements. Accordingly, the traffickers have taken risks to carry out large transactions. The police are making in-depth investigations to determine if this is the case. The Wang Hou Shih refugee camp area where the drugs were seized is an open camp area. All the Vietnamese living there have undergone screening before being granted the refugee status. They have been assigned to settle there and are free to go in and out. Security administration in the area is rather lax. The camp leader is responsible for maintaining the area's public order. Guards are placed at the gate. The Special Service Team of the Tuen Mun Police Headquarters kept a constant watch on the security situation in the Wang Hou Shih refugee camp area. Investigations revealed drug trafficking activities in the camps. Several searches were conducted in the past, but without marked results. About a month ago, the Special Service Team received a tip to the effect that drug trafficking had escalated in this camp area. According to the tip, a considerable amount of drugs were stored in this area, and a drug dilution and distribution center had been set up there. Upon receipt of this information, Chief Inspector Tsai Chia-shih, Inspector Li Wei-chuan, and Captain Chang Wen-sheng decided to lead the policemen to investigate the case. Recently, the team was prepared to take action and obtained a search warrant from the court. At 5 p.m. yesterday it began making final arrangements for a raid on the camp area. At 7 p.m. the team arrived in the area. When Inspector Mai Wei-chuan [name as printed] and Captain Chang Wen-sheng led policeman Lo Ssu-min and three other policemen and two policewomen to proceed to a unit of Camp No. 33, several refugees were playing cards at a nearby store. Thinking that the police had come to arrest gamblers, they tried to escape. This alerted the Vietnamese man who was keeping watch for the drug trafficking group. Suddenly, the police were obstructed and surrounded by a group of about 40 Vietnamese, some of whom threatened with homemade weapons. Fearing that the situation would become chaotic, the police asked their headquarters for support. Shortly afterward, a large number of police arrived. They dispersed the rioting Vietnamese and proceeded with the search. They tried to enter a unit, but the door was closed. They knocked at the door, but nobody answered. After telling the camp's responsible person of their mission, the police broke the door with a steel bar. No one was inside. The police found some suspicious materials in the kitchen and the living room, including some granulars contained in a dried milk can and two bags of blocks in a blue plastic bucket. It was suspected that the granulars were a dilute form of drug and the blocks were high-purity No. 4 heroin. Also found were tools for diluting drugs, including blenders and packaging tools. Since the TV and kitchen range in the unit were still on, it was believed that the drug traffickers had escaped barely before the police broke in. Presently, the police are searching for suspects. The seized drugs, totaling eight kilograms, are valued at about $1.6 million.
