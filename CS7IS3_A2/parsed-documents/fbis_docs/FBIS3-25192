Mr. Mandela was speaking today at the eighth national congress of the National Union of Mineworkers in Pretoria. He said the ANC is not prepared to conduct discussions under pressure from threats of violence. [Begin Mandela recording in English] It is our task to address the concerns of all our people, even those who regard us as enemies. We are, therefore, prepared to sit down with the leadership of the right wing in order to address these problems. Our main problem is that the right wing really does not understand the implications of their demands. If they come out with a proposal which ensures that there will be movement forward, we are still prepared to sit down with them. But we are not going to continue for years discussing the same things which we discussed last year. [end recording]
