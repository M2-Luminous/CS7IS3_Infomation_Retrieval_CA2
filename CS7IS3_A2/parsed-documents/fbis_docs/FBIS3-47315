He said: "From the point of view of improving the Japanese people's quality of life, it is important that Japan deals with economic issues voluntarily." He stressed Japan should actively promote more transparency in its market by deregulation. On the other hand, he also indicated that Japan would continue to ask U.S. companies to improve their competitiveness and exert more sales efforts, saying: "It is necessary not only for the buyers, but also the sellers (the United States) to be well-prepared."
