In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Kostikov said that "the extension of the deputies' mandates and, evidently for maintaining the political balance, the postponement of presidential elections would allow (us) to continue constructive interaction between the branches of power established after the signing of the agreement on civic accord." He believes that the future parliamentary elections can "make the country bristle up again, whip up tensions and add to the existing contradictions. This would play into the hands of only extremists and impatient politicians." "Russia is tired of the acute political fever. More than anything else it now needs to preserve peace and conditions for growing the fragile sprouts of civic peace and accord," Kostikov said. "There is one more aspect to it. We all see how difficult the process of maturing and strengthening political culture in Russia is. It will take more than one or two years to complete it. But at the same time we see that seriously thinking deputies and faction members are exerting considerable efforts in order to fight the inertia of confrontation. We see the gradual normalisation of cooperation between the president and the constructive factions of the State Duma and the Federation Council," he said. Kostikov believes that the postponement of parliamentary elections could "allow the deputies not only to gain political experience, but, more importantly, to use it for Russia's benefit." Asked about Yeltsin's possible reaction to Shumeyko's proposal, Kostikov replied that the president is unlikely to announce his position on the issue in the near future. "He values the sprouts of civic accord too much to endanger them," he added. "This is a complicated, delicate and, I would say, constitutionally contradictory issue. The most reasonable thing we could do is to subject this dilemma to thorough and comprehensive examination and discussion in parties, factions, society and the press. But most importantly, to find out the public mood," Kostikov said. "In this situation we must act only on the basis of public consensus and accord. Otherwise, the most interesting and constructive idea can prove the opposite," Kostikov said.
