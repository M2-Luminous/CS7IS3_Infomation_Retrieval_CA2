This means that a series of reforms in foreign currency, finance and tax and foreign trade structure, especially those eliminating subsidies for exports, have proved effective, said an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation here attending the opening ceremony of the Tianjin Export Commodity Fair Saturday [28 May]. According to the official, China's foreign-funded enterprises imported 11.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of products, surpassing their export volume by 2.9 billion dollars. However, the official admitted that this year's foreign trade has been affected by price hikes, resulting in the decline of export efficiency and shortages in capital and raw materials. The ministry is trying to work out an effective way to further boost imports and exports, he said.
