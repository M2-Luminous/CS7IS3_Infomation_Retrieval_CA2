President Yeltsin and his foreign minister told Rabin that Russia's deputy prime minister is now visiting Damascus and will take up the issue of Israeli POW's and MIA's. He was also instructed to promote the negotiations between Israel and Syria. President Yeltsin stressed to the prime minister that Russia will not provide Syria with new military equipment, only spare parts. Our correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that both men mentioned the danger of Islamic extremism. President Yeltsin said that this extremist movement is a danger to Russia and that his government is trying to build a belt to keep Islamic extremism away from the republics bordering on Iran. Our correspondent notes that the Russians are pressing the Israeli delegation to sign a trade agreement. Israel has several reservations about clauses in the proposals, but the agreement might still be signed. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 26 April, in a similar report by Qobi Meydan, adds the following recorded remarks by Rabin following his meeting with Yeltsin: "I understood from the meeting with the president, the prime minister, and the foreign minister that Russia, unlike in the past, is interested in assuring progress in peace, security, and stability in the Middle East, and perhaps not only in the Middle East. From my viewpoint as an Israeli, however, that was the main issue I wanted to understand about the Russian position. Russia, together with the United States, will continue to act as cosponsor of the peace negotiations with our three neighboring Arab states and with the Palestinians."]
