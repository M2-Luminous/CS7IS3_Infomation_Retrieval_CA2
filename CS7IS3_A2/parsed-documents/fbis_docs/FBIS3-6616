Touching on Japan's prolonged economic recession, Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli expressed his hope for an early economic recovery of Japan, saying: "Recovery of the Japanese economy is important for the Asia-Pacific region. I hope the Japanese Government is successful in implementing its economic policies." Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis also showed deep interest in Japanese economic trends. Liu stressed: "Japan has achieved constant economic growth, even overcoming the 1973 and 1979 oil crises and the Black Monday stock market plunge. I am very confident about Japan's economic policies." He noted that the Japanese economy had great influence on economic trends in the Asian-Pacific region, saying: "Japan's large-scale economy has great influence even when the growth rate is only 2 percent." In reply, Fujii said "we hammered out a pump-priming package of more than 15 trillion yen in February, and we hope for an economic upturn in fiscal year 1994." In his meeting with Taiwanese Finance Minister Lin, Fujii said: "It is important to deepen dialogue among finance ministers in the region. I would like to promote the spirit of harmony and cooperation, informally discussing each other's experiences of economic growth and current problems." The meeting was the first contact between the finance ministers of Japan and Taiwan as the two nations do not currently share diplomatic relations; however, their trade ministers have met three times at the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Ministers' conference (APEC). As far as Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir's boycotting of APEC summit in November 1993 is concerned, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwal stressed "we support APEC, as you know, from the fact that we came here." He then asked for Japanese yen-based loans for the New Kuala Lumpur International Airport project.
