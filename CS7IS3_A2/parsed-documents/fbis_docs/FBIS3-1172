The uproar followed the release of a report by the Goldstone Commission of the involvement by the police and the Inkatha Freedom Party in violence and arm smuggling. A spokesman from Mr. Kriel's office said the minister regarded the Goldstone findings as accusations and is awaiting the result of the international investigation team appointed by the state president.
