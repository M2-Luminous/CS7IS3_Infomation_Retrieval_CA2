Cuba terms as satisfactory the fact that the Cairo Declaration issues an appeal to end the U.S. economic blockade against the island, guarantees the Movement's continuity, and demands the establishment of equitable relations between developed and underdeveloped nations to achieve justice and equality. The 109 countries represented at the ministerial conference urged the U.S. Government to abstain from carrying out actions against Cuba if these contradict the good-neighbor policy. They also requested the return of Guantanamo Naval Base and the effective and immediate implementation of the UN resolutions on the blockade. It may be recalled that the UN General Assembly issued statements in 1992 and 1993 advocating suspension of the economic blockade against Cuba, but the United States has yet to comply with the letter and spirit of the appeal. During his so-called message to Cubans on 20 May, President William Clinton not only manipulated Cuban history with evil intentions but also reasserted that he will maintain the economic boycott against the island. The Cairo Declaration signed at the NAM's 11th ministerial conference also said the adjustment programs and the foreign debt should not affect human development programs, a concept that coincides with Cuba's views. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had emphasized before the plenary session that the NAM's number one priority is to sponsor Third World nations' economic and social development. Robaina said in Cairo that the best guarantee for a permanent and durable peace is to end hunger. He said: If we do nothing, we will be condemned to disappear, meaning two-thirds of mankind would disappear. The conference in Egypt also discussed a reorganization of the United Nations so that it fulfills the wishes and goals of the poorest countries, which represents one of the basic points in Cuba's foreign policy. The decision adopted by those gathered in Cairo to grant the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias the right to host the 11th summit of NAM leaders and heads of state also represents encouraging news, given the need to review specific problems in the region. Most of those problems are similar to the ones which prevail in Cuba, except the old Cuban-U.S. dispute. The NAM's ministerial conference, which just ended, proved Cuba's active role in the Movement and the endorsement that its proposals, views, and demands for support receive in that forum.
