[Nikolayev] The main goal we set was to prevent a decline in production. Today the republic's budget is balanced -- as we earn, so we will also live. I can say with confidence that power production, the diamond industry, gold mining and the coal industry will achieve their proper levels. We are shifting our economy to a market-based system, but in the Far North there are some industries and individual enterprises that are unprofitable for the republic. For example, a combine that mines and manufactures tin concentrates in the Arctic. Its annual output as measured in current prices established by the government of the Russian Federation is around R12 billion [rubles]. Yet our expenditures for it are R50-60 billion! We would shut the combine down as unsuited to a market economy, but we must also consider Russia's interests. Also, we mine approximately 14 million tonnes of anthracite coal, yet we consume only 4 million. We export the rest. And the more coal we mine, the more money we lose! Worse yet, our customers -- Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk and Maritime krays and Chelyabinsk -- are not paying for the shipments they receive. So we have to make up for the shortfalls out of our meager budget. Additionally, there are also strategic issues. For example, construction of a railroad. We would have to build it and equip it at our own expense. But it is Russia that really needs the railroad! We have a great many problems. If they are not solved that will be bad for Russia. It is time for us to move away from political games and toward practical action. Else it will only be words when we talk about "reviving Russia" or a "great Russia." I hope that beginning in 1994 our parliament will begin working for the good of all citizens. [Serebrennikov] How is the situation with regard to attracting foreign investment to your republic? [Nikolayev] The Sakha Republic currently has economic ties with 22 countries around the world, and approximately 30 joint ventures with foreign companies have been established. We intend to update equipment in the coal, diamond, food and local industries and in the river transportation system. However, by establishing joint ventures to solve some of our problems we divide the profits with foreign companies, i.e. we create jobs in their countries. In my opinion this problem should be resolved with the help of Russia's lines of credit, by creating and expanding internal debt. That way we could take our larger loans, using a large mineral deposit as collateral, using our gold, of which we have more than enough untapped reserves. Then we would pay back that loan in 5-10 years. [Serebrennikov] When people talk about Yakutia they never fail to mention its diamonds... [Nikolayev] In 1993 our republic's diamond industry met its plan goals in every regard, both financially and in terms of output. Shifting that industry to market-based structures has been one of the main achievements of the past year. We have established a joint-stock company called Almazy Rossii-Sakha, which hold the reins to the mining, sorting, storage and sale of diamonds and the production of gem-quality stones. This very large diamond company, which is without parallel either in Russia or anywhere else in the world, ended its first year of operations with a profit. Right now the issue is not how to increase diamond production, but rather how many diamonds we can sell. Therefore we follow this rule: we will only mine as many diamonds as we can sell. Last year six stonecutting plants opened in the republic. There are plans to start up another eight diamond-cutting enterprises in 1994. They will employ approximately 2,000 diamond cutters. It is our hope that in 1994 the Russian Federation will open a diamond exchange, the first in our country and only the fourth in the world. Why should we export our diamonds and sell them in London or Belgium? Let foreign buyers come to us! We need a real market for the sale of gem-quality diamonds. Incidentally, the first auction of gem-quality diamonds was held in Yakutsk in late December. I should add that the well-known agreement between Russia and the South African firm De Beers is being complied with 100 percent, and that the other side has had no complaints. As for diamond deposits in Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Almazy Rossii-Sakha Company is prepared to help develop them on a shareholder basis, depending on the volume of diamonds to be mined. [Serebrennikov] What is your view of your republic's future? [Nikolayev] We have many problems, but the work is interesting. The most important thing is that no one hold us back. Right now it is not inflation that bothers us, but instead mutual payments and the confiscatory tax and lending policy (with interest rates for loans of up to 400 percent!). The Far North cannot go on like this: we need government protectionism and a favorable lending and tax policy. We are currently considering establishing an International Bank for the Reconstruction and Development of the Arctic, of which we would like to be the founders. We also intend to work on establishing an academy to study the Arctic. And much is being done toward social protection for our people. Despite the difficult times we live in, our republic remains peaceful and calm. And that, I am sure you will agree, is no small accomplishment.
