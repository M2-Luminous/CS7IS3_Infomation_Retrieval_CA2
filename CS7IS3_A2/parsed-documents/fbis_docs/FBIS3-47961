"I didn't particularly get the feeling that the economy has turned brighter... from recent conversations" with various company heads, said Takashi Tanaka, chairman of the Regional Banks Association of Japan. Companies have pushed forward with "restructuring" but the prolonged business slump is now forcing them to start "labor adjustments," he told a regular press meeting. In a monthly survey of Japan's 60 regional banks released at the same time, the association said business activities in most regions are expected to remain weak over the next three months under "sluggish personal consumption and stagnant production despite expected steady home building and public works." "The degree of stagnancy particularly in production is deepening," said the survey conducted in late November. Considering the government's plan to use public funds in stimulating liquidity of the real estate market, Tanaka praised it as a "very good" option in economic measures. But he expressed caution over linking the land program to measures on nonperforming loans at banks, saying, "we see no direct relation." Tanaka reiterated his opposition to using public funds to help banks liquidate bad loans, and banks should take the "responsibility themselves." He also expressed opposition to wider disclosure of problem loans and to active liquidation in the current fiscal year even at the cost of reporting net losses or sharp profit declines. Regional banks are required to disclose only bad loans extended to insolvent customers, while Japan's 11 major commercial banks, known as city banks, are obligated to also announce loans that have produced no interests for six months or longer. On liberalization of demand deposit rates, Tanaka called for "careful" and "thorough" discussions even if an adoption this year is delayed to realize a system of government-backed postal rates following private-sector rates. The Finance Ministry, insisting on a system led by private-sector rates, is now negotiating with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
