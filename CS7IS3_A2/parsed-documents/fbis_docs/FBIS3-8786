Refugees were given shelter by as many as 111 countries and the largest refugee groups of 10,000 people are accommodated in Germany, Turkey, France, and Austria. Arif Smajkic, minister of refugees, labor, and social welfare in the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, presented the data at the press conference held yesterday at the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The figure of 680,000 refugees does not include refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina accommodated in Croatia. Exact information about the number of Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens that are still in Croatia has not yet been gathered. About 70 percent of the total number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina are Muslims, there are less Croats, and a large number of Serbs found shelter in refugee camps in Western countries," said Smajkic. Before coming to Zagreb, where he will talk to Minister Ivan Parac and Adalbert Rebic, Minister Smajkic visited many Western European countries and learnt about the status of refugees and workers staying in those countries. "The accommodation, status, and care of refugees in host countries is satisfactory," said Smajkic. Furthermore, he said that he met with representatives of international humanitarian organizations in Geneva and that they presented many programs for the return of refugees. Before the end of April, the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina will propose several models for the return of refugees, and it can be expected that Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens will soon start returning to their homes. Smajkic said that most refugees accommodated in Western countries have welcomed the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement. People will most probably first be able to go back to Herzegovina and central Bosnia, and their return will be financed by their host countries, international humanitarian organizations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and various funds. Wounded people, medical workers, engineers, and technicians, i.e., professional people important for the rebuilding of the country, will go back first. Large groups of refugees will go back only after accommodation and jobs have been secured for them. Yesterday, Minister Smajkic visited the "Kruge" refugee center in Zagreb in which, as he said, living conditions, especially hygiene conditions, are satisfactory.
