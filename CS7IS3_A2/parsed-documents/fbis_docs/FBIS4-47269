V. Korobeynikova, Technology and Organization or Production SRI, St. Petersburg] [Abstract] Means for individual protection of respiratory organs (SIZOD) are used in those cases where equipment design or other factors endanger personal safety. The basic requirement of a SIZOD is to provide air to a worker that meets sanitary norms. In the case of filtering type SIZODs this means an ability to treat incoming air in such a way as to bring it to within PDK (maximum allowable concentration) levels. An isolating type SIZOD must also provide sufficient oxygen. Thus the procedures and methods for evaluating SIZODs involve certain special considerations. In domestic standards the evaluation methods are slanted toward determining how complete the device is in preventing harmful substances from entering the respiratory organs of a human being and the extent to which the SIZOD can maintain this air quality over the period in which it is expected to be used. Therefore the following basic conditions are regulated: the space velocity of the incoming air stream passing through the SIZOD and its components; type and concentration of a control substance in the air stream; relative humidity of incoming air; nature of the incoming air stream, i.e. steady or sinusoidal (simulating breathing); number of component parts in the SIZOD subject to testing; duration of exposure during testing, the period of time during which a control substance penetrates the component; criteria for evaluating penetration, methods for determining them, and their levels as specified in the evaluation; accuracy and errors of the testing equipment. The regulations are covered in GOST 12.4.034-85 SSBT SIZOD. Some regulations of foreign countries are also presented.
