FBIS4-47657 "drafr084_a_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Leader Says Fate of Kigali To Be Settled Soon RPF Leader Says Fate of Kigali To Be Settled Soon EA3004130594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 0500 GMT 30 Apr 94 EA3004130594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Excerpts] After the death of President Habyarimana in a plane accident on 6 April, the clique in power in Kigali implemented a plan to systematically exterminate all Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development members and sympathizers, the sole party in power in our country for the last 20 years. The carnage was intended to result in the deaths of all those who do not hold the same views as the dictatorial clique. The death of President Habyarimana served as a pretext to launch organized massacres. Today, three weeks after the incident, more than 200,000 have fallen victim to these unprecedented barbaric acts, which still continue. To kill so many people in such a short time is a record in the history of organized massacres. Following the tragedy that our country has and is still experiencing, our foreign media colleagues came to cover the sad events. But they often come with their pre-conceived ideas, one such being that the Rwandan problem is an ethnic one. The dictatorial power has always orchestrated a disinformation campaign, intended to make people believe that the Rwandan problem is an ethnic one between the Hutu and Tutsi. Fortunately, Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials have consistently taken every opportunity to explain the reality of the situation to the international community. That is why, on 22 April, RPF President Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, during a visit to Kibungo Prefecture in eastern Rwanda -- a prefecture totally under the control of the RPF, just like Byumba -- met with and was interviewed by foreign journalists who were visiting the disaster-hit region. I invite you to listen to this interview, however, first I would like to inform you that the questions were put forward through an interpreter. Colonel Kanyarengwe began by recalling and confirming that the Rwandan problem is a political one, which requires a political solution. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, in case the peace negotiations fail, will the RPF be able to capture Kigali? If that happens, what are your plans? [Kanyarengwe] Concerning the negotiations, we think that the Arusha negotiations are sufficient, since they constitute a document which was the outcome of a long period of discussions and compromise between the RPF and the government. We may have to adjust the terms of the Arusha Accord. Otherwise, that agreement is enough for us. In view of the pace of events, for the time being we are taking precautions before entering Kigali. But we think that, taking into account the pressure which is being placed on the capital, things will be sorted out over the next few days. I cannot tell you the hour or day, but we are sure that over the next few days the fate of Kigali will be settled. As to the arrangement of an administration after Kigali falls, that is a question that we will discuss with survivors of those other opposition parties which were in existence before this episode began.
