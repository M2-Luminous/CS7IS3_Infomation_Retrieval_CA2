Thus, in Dajabon, a city located in the north of the Dominican Republic, the district retains $20,000 of humanitarian aid out of the $40,000 collected by the national Catholic Church. The problem here is that there is no one, there is no one [repeats] who has civil, military, or international authority, Father Regimo Martinez complains. While in Port-au-Prince the effects of the embargo have begun to be felt, the situation at the border is desperate. It is one of the poorest areas of Haiti. In the villages close to the Dominican Republic, cities like Dajabon in the north of the country and Jimani in the south, some Haitians manage to elude the vigilance of the Dominican border guards to obtain something to eat, even though it is often dried pieces of cake or simple pieces of bread. In Villa Anacaona, the last border post before the road enters Haitian territory, the military and security services control the vehicles to make sure they do not carry anything into Haiti. On a road through Haitian territory, children are seen desperately pursuing the rare vehicles that pass, begging for food. The children hurry down the hills to ask for food or money, with their hands on their stomachs to show that they are hungry. They all live in small huts with straw roofs, but without walls, on the 50 km of the nearly impassable road. At the approach to the Dominican Republic, there are a few Dominican workers repairing the road. In this area, there are four Dominican surveillance posts, each comprising two soldiers who are sent for eight days. One of the extremities on the way to its highest point is Pedro Santana, a poor village on Dominican territory, whose inhabitants sit in the doorways of their houses, commenting on the events of the day while sipping a beer.
