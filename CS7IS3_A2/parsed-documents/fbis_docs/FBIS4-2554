Economic officials said all normal exchanges will be suspended until Beijing settles the incident reasonably. They added they will suspend the review process for Taiwan applications to invest in the Mainland and will also prohibit imports of mainland goods. The officials said plans to allow the visit of mainland economists and entrepreneurs will also be put on hold. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said that the ministry will make the adjustments in line with a policy mapped out by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). Yang added that he did not know how long the prohibitions will last. Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Monday said it will suspend the approval process for imports of semi-finished products from the mainland. Since Premier Lien Chan unveiled an economic stimulus project last July, Taiwan has approved the import of 1,788 semi-finished products from the mainland, BOFT officials said. Semi-finished products approved before the suspension will still be allowed into Taiwan, they noted.
