FBIS4-23512 "drafr110_d_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Commander on UNITA, FLEC Activities in Cabinda Commander on UNITA, FLEC Activities in Cabinda MB0806101594 Luanda TPA Television Network in Portuguese 1930 GMT 8 Jun 94 MB0806101594 Luanda TPA Television Network Portuguese BFN [Text] General Jose Pedro, commander of the Cabinda Military Region, has accused the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] of jointly having murdered five civilians in the Micuma area -- two men, two women, and a child. [Begin recording] [Pedro] A few days ago we were working to establish the connection between Bucu-Zau and Belize, since the bridge over (Bungozimunu) River had been destroyed. We were reconstructing the bridge to permit the free movement of people and goods between the two districts, as well as with the city. Considering previous UNITA and FLEC activities, it is not surprising that two days ago they again discharged their fury on civilians, killing five people including a year-old child. [Unidentified correspondent] Where did this happen? [Pedro] In the Micuma Primeiro village. [Correspondent] It has been reported that UNITA forces are entering the Viede settlement near the border with Zaire, heading toward Necuto, which is described as Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] headquarters. Do you have anything to say about the issue? [Pedro] It is no news that they are entering Viede. As you know, UNITA's main bases are in the Zairian territory, and it is from there that it carries out attacks in Cabinda Province. It is only possible for UNITA to carry out operations in that area with a major cooperation of the FLEC-FAC, since without the cooperation of FLEC-FAC it is impossible for them to operate there. [Correspondent] Has the Military Front Command taken measures in view of this? [Pedro] Yes, we are taking measures, and you will be informed of them. [end recording]
