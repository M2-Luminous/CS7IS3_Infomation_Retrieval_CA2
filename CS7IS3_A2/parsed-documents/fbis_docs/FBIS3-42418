Mayatskiy: "Military Chemistry: The Reality and the Future (Report on Special Operational Assembly)"] [Text] In accordance with the operational and combat training plan for the Ground Troops a special operational assembly was held for supervisory personnel of the CBR troops and military educational institutions at the Scientific Research and Testing Institute in Shikhany from 14 to 17 June of this year. This year it dealt mainly with development of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Service and troops of the Russian armed forces: The concept for their development, their missions in peace time and time of war, their combat training, their equipment and so forth. According to plan, the first two days were designated for a scientific military conference on "Problems of Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection, and its Technical Support." Colonel-General S. Petrov, chief of CBR Troops, delivered the introduction and a report. Describing the difficulty of the transitional period and its influence upon the shaping of a new Russian army, he noted that in addition to all else, somewhat different factors are still the determining ones for the CBR service and troops. On the one hand, despite the signing of a number of significant international agreements pertaining to weapons of mass destruction, they continue to pose a potential threat to military personnel and the civilian population in case of an armed conflict involving their employment. Furthermore, there is already information on modern scientific research which does not fall within the framework of existing types of OMP [weapons of mass destruction]. These are primarily binary systems with other than traditional action, chemicals which, although not covered by the Convention Banning the Development, Production and Employment of Chemical Weapons, and on Their Destruction, put military equipment and the like out of action. On the other hand, there is a growing likelihood of accidents involving highly active toxic and radioactive substances. Incidents of recent years at industrial enterprises and in transport have convincingly demonstrated that the technogenic aspect poses no less a danger than the effects of nuclear and chemical attacks. There is yet a third circumstance of considerable importance. While the two superpowers, the USSR and the USA, were previously drawn into the arms race, a totally opposite process has now begun. Chemical disarmament, that is, the salvaging of our stockpiles of toxic substances which were to have been delivered to the CBR troops, will cost Russia 1.5 trillion dollars at current prices. The requirements of the CBR troops were then defined. First of all, they have a dual purpose enabling them to carry out missions equally effectively in peace time and in time of war. Their weapons and technical equipment must be all-purpose and highly productive. In the future the T/O of the units and subunits will be determined precisely by the capabilities of the equipment. The command and control system for the CBR troops will also undergo considerable change, since one is inconceivable at the present stage without being integrated into the overall system of command and control of the forces our specialists are supporting. Finally, the CBR troops cannot survive without the development of their own infrastructure. Many generals and other officers presented co-reports. The most diverse issues were raised. I shall mention a few of them: The participation of CBR troops in the destruction of chemical weapons and the cleansing of the environment, the specific features of the emotional and psychological conditioning of the personnel in the contemporary situation, improvement of the training system, including the training of officers, in view of the low manning level of the units and subunits and the transition to contract service, and so forth. A discussion of radiation, chemical and bacteriological protection in a battle and an operation evoked the greatest interest. Unlike chemical support, its organization and implementation will be directed toward reducing losses to a minimum and ensuring the execution of the missions assigned to them in a situation of CBR contamination, as well as counteracting high-precision weapons, weapons laying and reconnaissance facilities. It was suggested that the place and role in the overall system of troop protection and the new type of combat missions be viewed from the standpoint of the combined-arms commander and not the Chief of the CBR service. During the following two days the assembly participants, as well as Colonel-General A. Sergeyev, commander of the PriVO [Volga Military District], Lieutenant-General G. Shpak, district chief of staff, and Saratov Oblast leaders attended practical exercises. They were first shown an exhibit of Russian line gas weapons and ammunition developed for them by associates at the NIII [Scientific Research and Testing Institute]. They then inspected prospective models of CBR weapons and protective gear. A special protective suit with a ventilated space beneath the surface, all-purpose, on-board BKSO [on-board special decontamination systems] designed for use with water or solvents, and much more were demonstrated at special sites. Deserving of attention in the area of line gear for measuring ionizing radiation were new instruments for measuring dose strength: The IMD-2 with an operating range of 10-5 to 103 roentgens/hour, which can be fixed, on-board or portable; the IMD-5, which can register both gamma (within a range of 6 to 200,000 millirads/hour) and beta radiation (50-5,000 decays/minute cm2); the IMD-22, designed for measuring the radiation level in an area (10-104 rads/hour), as well the total permissible dose of pulsed gamma-neutron and continuous-wave gamma radiation (50-2,000 rads). With respect to the other types of CBR weapons and protection, many of them were also demonstrated in action after they were inspected. This was due to the fact that in view of the significant reduction in the number of exercises and drills in recent years, many combined-arms officers, particularly the specialists, have lost their skills in organizing and carrying out CBR measures. Among other things, they have almost forgotten the methods of employing incendiary weapons and aerosols, at a time when the importance of these in unit and subunit combat is continuously increasingly today. According to the international classification incendiary weapons are listed as conventional weapons. Their indisputable advantage, however, a fact demonstrated in the Great Patriotic and Afghan wars, lies in their powerful emotional and psychological effect upon personnel. The flamethrower units and subunits, the artillery and the aviation presently have incendiary ammunition. A practical exercise in a tactical setting was organized and conducted by Col I. Mukhin, chief for Combat Training of the Directorate of the Chief of CBR Troops. The flamethrower operators were the first to demonstrate their skills. With a squad salvo they destroyed an infantry group with armored equipment. They fired the rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower with different filling: a thermobaric compound and an incendiary mixture. An experimental model of a combat vehicle for flamethrower operators was also demonstrated. Theoretically, it enhances their effectiveness when operating together with motorized-rifle subunits in close combat. Institute associates have mounted a compact, 12-barrel, bank-type unit on a tracked armor chassis, which can fire the RPO-A organic flamethrower in single-fire or automatic mode at a range of 700 meters. The vehicle was designed for a squad. It will also carry spare rounds and support the flamethrowers with organic guns and machine guns. A one-shot, jet flamethrower is unique and promising. It is made in a standard RPO-A container and is loaded with a condensed liquid incendiary compound and designed for destroying targets at a range of up to 70 meters in street battles, in structures, tunnels and so forth. The aviation then took over. Two Su-24s dropped ZB-500Sh incendiary tanks on a motor-vehicle column, each containing 250 kilograms of incendiary mixture. The effect was impressive. The next pairs used aerosol counteraction substances. DAB-100-90fm smoke bombs blinded the "enemy" in his positions for a long time. An AAP-500 airborne aerosol device was used from an altitude of 100 meters to cover the fly-through route of a tactical airborne landing force with a vertical screen. The most difficult and extensive aerosol camouflage missions will still be performed by the CBR troops, however. The technical equipment for this is presently being modernized, and new models are being developed. This primarily involves on-board aerosol generators for spray trucks. The ARS-14 equipped with them is capable of generating smoke continuously for five hours, creating a 600-meter aerosol cloud with improved parameters. Improved operating modes were presented for the organic smoke machines (TMS-65D, TDA-2M, TDA-2K): pulsating or combination and directing certain free-flowing materials into a high-speed stream of dispersed aerosol-generating elements. They not only do not reduce the space-and-time features of the screen but are markedly more effective than existing ones -- in their consumption of smoke mixture, their covering of the infrared band, and so forth. Ultimately all of this will enhance the capabilities of the CBR troops for aerosol counteraction by a factor of 2-3. The assembly concluded with a class on the subject "Mopping up Following an Accident in Transporting SDYaV [Highly Active Toxic Substances]." It was also organized and conducted by combat training officers of the Directorate of the Chief of CBR Troops. Personnel of the unit commanded by Lt-Col S. Safoshkin took part. It was held at a training field specially outfitted with a rail bed and tank cars. The advance group was the first to reach the accident site. CW reconnaissance scouts ascertained the situation at the center, marked a contamination zone around the perimeter and designated the entry route. The column of Capt A. Kartashov's composite subunit soon came up. They began emergency work following brief reconnaissance. They covered the mirror of spilled SDYaV with foam and then began diluting it. The mixture was trapped, neutralized and removed to a safekeeping site. The exercise was instructive. Most importantly, however, it made it possible to demonstrate for the assembly participants the sequence and the process of all the operations involved in the system for mopping up after an accident involving highly active toxic substances at civilian facilities. In his summation Colonel-General S. Petrov, chief of the CBR troops, gave a good rating to the performance of all the personnel who helped set up and conduct the assembly. Many of them were singled out for valuable awards and monetary prizes. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 11 1993
