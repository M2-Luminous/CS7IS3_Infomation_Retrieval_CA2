FR940713-2-00128 FR940713-2-00073 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;327 and 50&hyph;328] Tennessee Valley Authority; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Notice of Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of the Tennessee Valley Authority (the licensee) to withdraw its November 18, 1992 application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;77 and DPR&hyph;79 for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee. The proposed changes would have modified the facility technical specifications pertaining to alternate steam generator tube plugging criteria that was designed to take into account the reinforcing effect that the steam generator tubesheet has on the external surface of expanded steam generator tubes referred to as Westinghouse Explosive Tube Expansion (WEXTEX) region. The new criteria was designed to reduce the need for repairing or plugging steam generator tubes having indications that exceed the current technical specification depth-based plugging limit. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the Federal Register on February 3, 1993 (58 FR 7006). However, by letter dated June 28, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 18, 1992 (which was supplemented by letter dated January 8, 1993), and the licensee's letter dated June 28, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1001 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 5th day of July 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. David E. LaBarge, Senior Project Manager, Project Directorate II&hyph;4, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
