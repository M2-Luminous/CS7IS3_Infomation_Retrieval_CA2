Iranian Ambassador to Japan Hoseyn Kazempur-Ardabili, in a letter dated Monday and received the same day, took issue with a KYODO NEWS SERVICE story Sunday that had said Japan is reportedly pressuring Iran to stop test-firing the North Korean-made missiles. The story quoted the latest edition of the U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT as saying the Japanese Government is threatening to suspend financial assistance to a 1.2 billion dollar dam project in Iran unless Tehran stops the missile testing. The envoy said the missile allegation "has been denied time and again at the highest level of my government and Japanese and South Korean officials have been amply and convincingly assured of (its) absurdity." He said that raising it at the time, with the growing tension on the Korean peninsula and concern about it in Japan, "is another attempt to undermine the friendly relations between Iran and Japan."
