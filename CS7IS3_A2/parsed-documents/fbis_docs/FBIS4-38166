If Dr. al-Majali fails to obtain a mandate from the House, a "national unity" government representing all shades of the political spectrum should be formed, the IAF said in a statement Thursday [16 June]. The IAF said the change of more than half of members of the Cabinet in the recent reshuffle left only seven ministers who enjoy "the weak mandate" the government won from the House when it sought its confidence in December, Accordingly, the government should seek the confidence of the House anew, it said. Criticising the government for changing the Elections Law and dissolving the 11th Parliament last year, the front charged Dr. al- Majali reshuffled the Cabinet instead of fully changing it to avoid a confidence session in the House. The front, which has 16 deputies in the House, also charged that the government reversed an earlier decision to exclude lawmakers from the executive authority in order to win support for its drive to conclude a "surrender" treaty with Israel. "Deputies who withheld confidence from the government of Dr. al- Majali but joined it in the reshuffle" also came under fire from the front, which questioned "how those deputies would support the policies of the government while their no confidence vote in it indicates they reject the policies?" Deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah had cast a no confidence vote in the government, but he agreed to join it as minister for state and minister of education. The reshuffle, which brought 18 new ministers to an expanded 31-member Cabinet, also portends the government's underestimation of the role of political parties as they were not consulted about it, said the front, whose deputies remain in the opposition. The reshuffle also caused confusion to the House and its blocs, which were kept out of the negotiations over the reshuffle, said the front. The front demanded that lawmakers and political parties and activists cooperate to "consolidate national unity and...prevent normalisation with the Zionist enemy." The front also urged lawmakers to work against the "marginalisation" of the role of the House. Many deputies expressed discontent with the government for failing to consult with parliamentary blocs before introducing the reshuffle and vowed to reassert the role of the legislature in the government structure.
