The brigades are made up of volunteers from the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], regular workers, members of the National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP], and Youth Labor Army [EJT] troops from 11 Cuban provinces -- Santiago de Cuba, with 20 work groups, being the most oustanding. The message from Raul states: Upon learning that you have reached the first million arrobas of sugarcane, I felt inspired to express my sincere congratulations. I know this is an achievement you repeat in every sugar harvest, but this year and the next have a special and historic value. Raul's message goes on to say that 30 years ago, in 1964, two cane-cutting brigades set themselves the goal of cutting no fewer than 1 million arrobas of sugarcane during the next harvest. That was on 15 June 1964 at the Emilio Lesmes farm in Contramaestre. Raul goes on to say: I had the privilege of participating in that memorable assembly. I understood the unprecedented and elevated goal that those work groups of fervent revolutionaries had set, and I encouraged them to make the effort to reach it. Raul continues: This idea expressing the new attitude vis-a-vis the work done by the canecutters, now owners of the cane and the sugar, organized in brigades and freed from the hard labor of cutting by hand thanks to new machinery, caught on in the rest of the country. Thus, in March 1965 the Julio Antonio Mella Brigade from Havana Province completed the first million arrobas, followed by two brigades from Matanzas. Raul says, further: On 3 March, our commander in chief presented those brigades with the first Millionaire banners bearing the image of Jesus Menendez. That year, attaining their goal, more than 100 eastern brigades reached the one-million-arroba mark. In other words, in 1994 we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the the launching of the one-million-arroba movement, and in 1995 we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of this movement. You are the worthy heirs of those forerunners. In the last paragraph of his message to the canecutters, Castro says: I hope we will remember both events in a revolutionary way: making the current harvest more efficient, working hard today and tomorrow toward the recovery of the cane crops, the planting campaign, and the weeding campaign -- all this aimed at obtaining a superior harvest in 1995. Raul concludes his letter by sending a brotherly embrace to all canecutters.
