In a hastily arranged meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Goto Toshio, Han said it's nothing short of "throwing cold water on efforts by both countries to improve South Korea-Japan relations for an incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks while the Japanese Government is championing political reform and contribution to the international community. Just-named Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said during an interview this week that his country was not an aggressor in the World War II but a liberator of Asian colonies from European imperialism. He said the mass killing in the rape of Nanjing was "a hoax." "Nagano's remarks greatly shocked the South Korean Government and the people," Han told the ambassador, "such distorted historical perspective is very regrettable." Demanding action on the incident, the foreign minister emphasized that Tokyo "would have to take appropriate measures" for the comments. Goto said he understands Han's reaction as concern shown by the South Korean Government and will report to his home government. "But I believe the comments should not end up throwing cold water on improving bilateral relations," he said.
