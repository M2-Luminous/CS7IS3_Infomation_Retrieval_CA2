The signing of this agreement grants the guerrillas the status of a belligerent force, and guarantees that the conflicts with the government will be ruled by international humanitarian law. Here is Monica Echeverry: [Begin recording] [Echeverry] With a note sent by the defense minister and the Armed Forces commander to President Gaviria, Colombia accepts the signing of the Geneva Convention Protocol No. 2 following years of all-out opposition. Thus, Colombia acknowledges that it is in a state of war. [Gustavo Rodriguez Vargas, member of the Foreign Ministry Advisory Commission] I believe it makes the conflict more real. The conflict is placed within parameters that at any given moment can be more manageable for a government. [Echeverry] In addition to this, with the signing of Protocol No. 2, a code of ethics for war is established and the rebels are given the status of a belligerent force. The rebels must now accept the humanitarian law, which involves the presence of a UN overseeing group in the peace talks. The agreement must be presented to Congress, where it will be approved. Thus, the government moves a step ahead of Samper's star proposal to advance peace, and it also opens the doors for a new peace dialogue with the guerrillas. [end recording]
