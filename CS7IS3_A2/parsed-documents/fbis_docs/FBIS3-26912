A few days ago, a number of experts spoke on four major existing problems when analyzing and forecasting the social situation in China. 1. Severe conflicts and problems have arisen in some important social and economic fields. Consequently, social lives are being markedly affected, and there are more unstable factors appearing in the social order. It has been learned that, from January to September 1993, the cost of living in large and medium cities in China reached the highest growth rate compared with the same periods over the past several years. At the same time, the unemployment rate has been increasing, and the number of all sorts of cases handled by the public security organs has also increased slightly compared with that of the same period of last year. In addition, the blind establishment of development zones became a very severe phenomenon. This kind of chaotic economic life affects the overall mentality of society and has an adverse effect on the country's political, economic, and social life. 2. Corrupt practices committed by a handful of officials have been quite severe. They have abused power for private gain and have squandered and embezzled state property, which does great damage to the image of the party and the state and corrupts social values. According to the statistics, from January to September 1993, over 5,000 party and state functionaries were involved in cases cracked by procuratorial organs throughout the country, including 20 cadres at the department and bureau levels, one cadre at the vice-minister level, and more than 1,100 judicial personnel who were prosecuted for committing crimes. During this period, over 40,000 economic cases of corruption, bribery, and embezzlement of public funds were placed on file for investigation, including nearly 24,000 large cases, each involving over 10,000 yuan, and a total of 504 officials at and above the county and department levels. 3. Not much progress is being made in readjusting various social relations. Those which are most important are: The relations between the central and local authorities are being affected by some negative factors, and the gap between the coastal developed areas and other localities is widening. The growth of investment along the coastal areas in eastern China is obviously higher than that of the areas in central and western China. As far as the investment made by state-owned units in October 1993 was concerned, investment made by 12 coastal areas in East China exceeded 43 billion yuan, registering an increase of nearly 76 percent over that of the same period last year. Investment made by eight areas in central China exceeded 16 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent, and investment made by nine areas in West China reached 8.6 billion yuan, which merely increased 20 percent. Moreover, it is still very obvious that the gap between urban and rural income is putting more and more peasants in a psychologically unbalanced state . 4. The extent of conformity in terms of social ethics and value concepts is lower; money worship has become a prevailing trend; the "blank spots" of social norms have not been filled promptly; all kinds of immoral behavior still exist even though efforts are repeatedly made to check it; and the phenomenon of lacking ethical progress is worsening. The experts have advised that real progress in the anticorruption struggle should be made this year, and a critical step should be taken to establish sound laws and systems accordingly. They maintained that the central government's authority should be strengthened to straighten out the relations between the central and local authorities and that the promotion of the divisional taxation system should be used as opportunity to establish new relations between the two. In addition, they also suggested that the media should be used to give wide publicity to the central government's policies and that it is necessary to let the people air their opinions more frequently, to communicate with them, to monitor changes in public opinion, and to promptly redress the grievances of the masses. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to strengthen the supervisory and communication functions of the media so as to purify the general mood of society and to enhance social cohesion.
