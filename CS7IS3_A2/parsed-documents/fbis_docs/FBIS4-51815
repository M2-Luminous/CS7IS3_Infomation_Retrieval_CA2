Yun Sok-ku said 18 Korean companies, including Korea Petroleum Development Corp., are exploring for oil in 18 projects in 14 countries. Korean firms have spent 1.2 billion U.S. dollars on oil development projects abroad and registered an income of 910 million dollars from them, scoring a 75-percent recovery rate. But since the regions being explored for oil are becoming more remote and deeper in the sea, the success rate has declined and the investment cost risen, he said. Yun called on the government to help boost overseas oil development by increasing financial assistance, educating personnel and building up a comprehensive information network.
