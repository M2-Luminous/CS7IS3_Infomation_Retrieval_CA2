It was concluded that an official document of the FRY Government should be prepared and submitted to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It was stressed at the session that 25,000 Bulgarians, mainly living in Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad, enjoy all the individual and collective rights that are stipulated by our Constitution and the highest international standards. The only children's magazine that is published in the language of an ethnic minority and that is financed by the federal state is a magazine in the Bulgarian language. Two-thirds of the deputies in the Dimitrovgrad communal assembly are Bulgarian. This is how Prime Minister Kontic assessed the broaching of the issue of the Bulgarian minority in the FRY: [Begin Kontic recording] Turning attention away from the problem, that is, [words indistinct] both individual and collective rights of ethnic minorities in Bulgaria -- which is a well-known problem in Bulgaria -- and focusing it on the rights of the Bulgarian minority in neighboring countries. This is a well- known method of drawing the attention of one's public to some other issue. Secondly, we believe that this is actually part of a scenario drawn up by certain outside factors, and part of an additional and planned pressure on the FRY aimed at achieving the greatest possible destabilization before the decisive negotiations regarding the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina, so that optimal results are achieved for the other side.
