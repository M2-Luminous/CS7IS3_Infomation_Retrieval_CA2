You reacted to it in the daily TELEGRAF by saying that it does not bother you at all because Russia is still the second largest power with nuclear weapons and that therefore it must be treated accordingly. Do you not think that this position of Russia's poses a threat to small states of central and Eastern Europe? [Klaus] Russia is the position that it is. It is as big as it is. It really possesses nuclear weapons. By its mere existence it both poses and does not pose a threat to countries around it and I think the way in which NATO, not us, has decided to treat Russia is simply something that apparently corresponds to the situation as it exists. The most essential thing for us is that someone else has decided the matter rather than us, and I believe strong words from us do not and indeed cannot lead anywhere. We all have stressed that Partnership for Peace is an individual program and that each country should contribute to that program what it feels it can contribute -- how much and how closely it wants to link itself to NATO. We also see that individual countries are doing exactly this. [passage omitted] Each country takes a different view and I think that strongly worded statements from us aimed against Russia do not, in my view, truly lead anywhere. [passage omitted]
