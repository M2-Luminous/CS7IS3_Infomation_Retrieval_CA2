Its planes have shot down four Serbian military aircraft while they were returning after shelling an arms factory under Muslim control in Bosnia. The shooting was carried out after Serb pilots ignored the warning to land. Six jets operating from a base in Italy were involved in the assault mission. The ban on flights over Bosnia was imposed by the UN Security Council on April 12, 1993. Since then NATO aircraft monitoring the zone detected several violations of the restriction but refrained from taking any action against the culprits. It was a serious lapse and negated the very purpose of the mandate given by the Security Council. Had force been used earlier against the defiance of the ban. It would have certainly helped in reducing the enormity of Sebian aggression and savagery against the severeign government and people of Bosnia. Meanwhile, a statement issued on Monday by the Pakistan Government rightly points out that the UN ultimatum for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo has not been fully implemented. The Serbs are still keeping their heavy arms in position at several points in the exclusion zone and these continue to pose a threat to the beleaguered people of the Bosnian capital. The Serbs are also redeploying the equipment removed from Sarajevo against other Muslim enclaves in Bosnia. The UN must act quickly and strongly to stop this criminal adventure. Further, the removal of heavy arms from Sarajevo alone will not bring an end to the misery and deprivation of Sarajevo population. The world body ought to take appropriate steps to ensure the restoration of essential services and opening of routes to and from the capital. Equally vital is the cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia in order to facilitate the process of peace. There is no denying that the international community can do a lot in settling the Bosnian conflict justly and equitably if it exercises the neccessary resolution and firmness in this regard. Much of the onus falls on the Western powers including the US. They must not hesitate any more to match their words with deeds.
