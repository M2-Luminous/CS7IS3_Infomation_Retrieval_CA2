Bulgaria will start buying coal at considerably higher prices from the Republic of South Africa which would most probably raise the prices of electricity, Mr. Shervashidze believes. He says that the possibilities for setting up a new common power grid among Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine were discussed in Kiev. Negotiations with Ukraine will continue two weeks later, during a visit to Kiev of a Bulgarian delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, the private daily STANDART NEWS reports. A commentary in the same newspaper says that if the National Electricity Company were private, the negotiations would definitely succeed. [passage omitted]
