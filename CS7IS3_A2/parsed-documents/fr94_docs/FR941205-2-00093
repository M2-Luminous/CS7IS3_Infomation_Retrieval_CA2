FR941205-2-00093 FR941205-2-00050 Applicants' Legal Analysis: 1. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of the 1.25% charge for the assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants further request that such exemptive relief be extended to Future Underwriters, a class consisting of broker-dealers who may, in the future, act as principal underwriters of the Contracts. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Underwriter are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants state that without the requested relief, exemptive relief would have to be requested for each new principal underwriter. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Applicants state that, if AUSA Life were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive additional protection or benefit and could be disadvantaged by increased overhead of AUSA Life. Applicants argue that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for the filing of redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. Both the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would, Applicants believe, impair AUSA Life's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 2. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust, its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the deposit or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself. 3. Applicants submit that AUSA Life is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% under the Contracts is a reasonable and proper insurance charge to compensate AUSA Life for assuming certain risks under the Contracts, including the risk that: (a) Annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; and (b) the Account Value will be less than the Death Benefit; and (c) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges. Thus, Applicants assert that this charge is consistent with the protection of investors. 4. AUSA Life represents that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon AUSA Life's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, guaranteed death benefits, and guaranteed annuity rates. AUSA Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the product analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative review. 5. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. AUSA Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and Contract Owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by AUSA Life at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. 6. AUSA Life also represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors of trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the company, formulate and approve any such plan. Conclusion: For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
