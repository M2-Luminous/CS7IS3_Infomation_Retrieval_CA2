April saw almost 100,000 people deprived of a livelihood "signing on" at the labor exchanges. The unemployment level for Russia as a whole stands at 1.4 percent. There are not many vacancies -- 325,000 jobs in all, of which 83 percent are intended for workers and only 17 percent for employees. The number of applicants per post, namely four people not in regular work [nezanyatyy] and three unemployed people for each one, gives an idea of the scale of the problem. However, there are regions where jobs are like gold dust. In terms of applicants per vacancy there are 255 in the Ingush Republic, 51 in Ivanovo Oblast, and 31-35 citizens without regular work in Dagestan and Chuvashia. Only 285,000 Rusians have been able to obtain work this year through the employment service, and their number also includes those who were able to receive vocational training and retraining. There has been a slight increase in the number of people who have fixed themselves up with public works jobs and improved, albeit temporarily, their material position -- they number 38,000 since the start of the year. The Russian Federation Government Center for Monitoring Economic Conditions has prepared on the basis of the employment services' data a short-term forecast of the situation in the labor market in terms of Russia as a whole and individual regions covering the next few months. It is expected that May's unemployment figure will reach 1,284,000,000, June's will increase by roughly another 100,000, while July's will reach 1.52 million. The unemployment level by mid-summer will reach 1.7 million. The highest rate of increase in the number of unemployed people continues to occur in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Pskov, and Vladimir Oblasts; the lowest rate of increase is in Tatarstan, Yakutia, Smolensk and Belgorod Oblasts, and Moscow city.
