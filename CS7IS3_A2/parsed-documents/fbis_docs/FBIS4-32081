A total of 19 Czech organizations have filed claims for $333 million. Most of the damage results from unpaid deliveries and projects. The largest claim, for $108 million, comes from Technoexport Prague a.s. Other claimants include, for example, the Zetor Brno state enterprise and Strojexport Prague, which claim $90 million each. The list of claims submitted to the UN Commission also includes the Finance Ministry's claim for $52 million. The Czech ministry (and its federal predecessor) has paid this sum to Czech organizations in order to alleviate their losses. Most of this sum was used to pay interest on loans for claims "frozen" in Iraq, Miroslav Havel, director of the State Budget Section at the Ministry of Finance, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. Money for this purpose will also be allocated from the state budget's contingency reserves this year. Within the framework of the Czech Republic's overall claims, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demands compensation of $11,000 for losses incurred by the former Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the evacuation of its staff or due to the loss of some embassy property. In the opinion of M. Havel, the compensation for damage by the UN will be a protracted affair with an uncertain outcome.
