She was speaking at a meeting of the China National Technical Import and Export Corporation. She noted that China's foreign trade companies face increasingly severe competition with the establishment of the market system and China's foreign trade reforms. China already has over 7,000 enterprises enjoying foreign trade rights, including nearly 2,000 industrial enterprises, over 280 barter trade corporations, and over 120 scientific institutions. She said that this year's foreign trade target is set to reach 200 billion U.S. dollars, which will be a painstaking task. But, she noted, reforms of China's foreign exchange and foreign trade systems will provide new opportunities. She hoped that all foreign trade companies will strive for a new breakthrough by keeping their eyes both on the domestic and overseas market, paying due attention to quality control and diversifying foreign trade markets. She said that China will expand its technical imports and exports this year, with the focus on technical imports for key national and long-term projects such as power stations and telephone systems. At the same time, China will enhance its export of equipment, high-tech products and high value-added products of machinery and electronics. She also said that foreign trade companies should try to strengthen their overseas business management, which is a key point for this year's foreign trade.
