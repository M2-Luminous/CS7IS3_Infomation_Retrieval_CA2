FR940325-1-00044 FR940325-1-00008 Brief Discussion of Major Elements of Rangeland Reform '94 The following presents the general proposals of Rangeland Reform '94 and highlights significant changes made in response to public input on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. Detailed descriptions of the specific regulatory changes being proposed are presented in the section-by-section analysis following this discussion. The Federal Grazing Fee and Associated Incentives This proposed rule presents a formula that is intended to correct the fundamental problems of the present fee. The first problem is the wide disparity between rates charged for livestock forage on private and State lands versus the rate charged on Federal lands. In many western States, the fee for grazing on private nonirrigated lands is far greater than it is on Federal lands. As the following chart shows, in 1993, the private grazing land lease rates in most western States were several times the Federal fee. 1993 Private Nonirrigated Grazing Land Lease Rates Dollars per Animal Unit Month (National Agricultural Statistics Service) Federal Fee $1.86 Arizona 5.72 California 10.40 Colorado 9.70 Idaho 9.25 Kansas 11.30 Montana 11.40 Nebraska 17.00 Nevada 8.80 New Mexico 7.55 North Dakota 10.00 Oklahoma 7.10 Oregon 9.75 South Dakota 12.60 Texas 8.75 Utah 8.90 Washington 7.80 Wyoming 10.50 There are similar disparities between grazing fees charged on State lands and the Federal fee. For grazing year 1994 the Federal grazing fee established under existing regulations in 43 CFR part 4100, is $1.98 per animal unit month (AUM). This fee compares to western State trust land fees of as low as $1.53 in Arizona to fees ranging from $4.00 to more than $20.00 in some of the western States for their 1994 grazing year. The different formulas, and the use of competitive bidding in some States, make it difficult to present an average of the State trust land grazing fees, but in the States of Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, the largest States in terms of the number of BLM AUMs authorized, the State trust land fees per AUM range from a low of $3.00 in Wyoming to $4.53 in Idaho in 1994.
