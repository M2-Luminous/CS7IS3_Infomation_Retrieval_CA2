FR940516-1-00099 FR940516-1-00006 ``Port selection'' would assist the Agency in reducing its travel costs. Recently, in the on-highway program, EPA has had requests from light-duty vehicle manufacturers to conduct port selection during SEAs. These audits were performed and ran smoothly. EPA might permit reasonable maintenance and inspections of port-selected engines to address problems that could result from long-term storage, ocean shipping, or repeated handling. EPA requests comments on the port selection aspect of the SEA program. Prior to testing SEA engines, manufacturers could operate engines to break in engine components. This break-in or service accumulation of an SEA engine family would follow the same procedures and could be up to 12 hours or the same number of break-in hours accumulated for that family's emission data engine during certification. Service accumulation would be performed expeditiously and in a manner using good engineering judgment. Audit engines would be tested using the same test cycle, either Test Cycle A, B, or C, as was used in certification; however, deviations allowed in certification from the full test procedures as described in proposed 40 CFR part 90 would not be permitted in SEAs. EPA is proposing that small SI engines will be selected for SEA testing at a rate of at least four engines per day, unless production is less than four engines per day. To minimize delays in shipment of engines to customers, manufacturers could test the first engines selected for an audit while additional engines were produced. The total number of engines tested in an SEA would be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. EPA is proposing a sequential sampling plan for small SI engine SEAs. These sampling plans have been designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) and to ensure low statistical risks of incorrect pass/fail determinations. The maximum theoretical percentage of failing engines for passing an SEA is 40 percent. EPA is proposing a 40 percent AQL for the small SI engine SEA program. EPA has used this AQL since the 1970s for the on-highway program, and EPA currently has no reason to propose a different AQL for a nonroad program. EPA is proposing that the small SI engine SEA program use the same sampling plans used for the on-highway heavy-duty engine SEA program. EPA proposes that engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales of 7,500 or greater must complete a minimum of two engine tests per day during an SEA. Engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales of less than 7,500 would be required to complete a minimum of one engine test per day during an SEA. A valid emission test or a voided test would each count as one test toward meeting the requirement. EPA requests comments on this aspect of the proposal. A test engine's pass or fail determination would be made by comparing final test results to the applicable federal emission standard. Within five working days of the conclusion of an audit, manufacturers would be required to submit a report to EPA summarizing engine test results, test procedures, and audit events such as the date, time, and location of each test, repairs to engines, and the reason for the repair. Failure of an SEA could result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that family. To have the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the manufacturer would be required to demonstrate, by showing passing data, that improvements, modifications, or replacement had brought the family into compliance. The proposed regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer to challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which tests were conducted. 20. Importation of Nonconforming Small SI Engines EPA is proposing certain restrictions on the importation of nonconforming small SI engines. Such restrictions are based in part on the existing regulations for the importation of nonconforming motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines. While EPA provides for an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) program for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, EPA is not certain that an ICI program is necessary or practical for small SI engines. For the on-highway program, ICIs are responsible for all aspects of compliance required of manufacturers (e.g., certification, testing, labeling, warranty, recall, maintaining records). EPA solicits comment on the need for an ICI program for small SI engines. Due to the uncertainty about the need for an ICI program, EPA is proposing in the alternative both to have an ICI program that parallels that of the on-highway program, and to have no ICI program in the final rule. EPA currently favors no ICI program for small SI engines; if the Agency determines not to promulgate an ICI program, the proposed regulatory language will be deleted from the final rule. This proposal includes a special provision for individuals to import a limited number of nonconforming small SI engines for personal use. EPA expects that individuals may not know of the regulations applicable to small SI engines and, without this once in a lifetime exemption, individuals may be stopped at a port of entry with small SI engines and equipment included with their personal possessions. Additionally, this exemption would relieve a significant burden on EPA and the U.S. Customs Service. EPA is proposing that, at least for Phase 1 of these regulations, individuals be permitted to import up to three nonconforming small SI engines and not have these engines brought into compliance with the proposed standards. This is a one-time exemption (for one importation) in which individuals are permitted to import these engines for personal use and not for purposes of resale. This exemption would not require prior EPA written approval. Additional small SI engines, after an individual's limit of three, would not be permitted to be imported under the proposal unless otherwise provided under another exemption or exclusion. All small SI engines imported for purposes of resale would be required to be imported and modified by an ICI. If EPA does not finalize an ICI program, such engines may not be imported for resale. EPA requests comment on this proposed exemption.
