Other approved purposes of the Range include conservation of biological diversity with emphasis on endangered and threatened species and protection and maintenance of cultural resources. This EIS provides an assessment of the affects of alternative proposals for withdrawal or exploration and development of minerals on the Range: (A) Wildlife Range Withdrawal, (B) No Action, and (C) Limited Entry. The agencies' preferred alternative is (A) Wildlife Range Withdrawal. A Record of Decision will be issued not sooner than 30-days following the date of this notice. Dated: March 17, 1994.
