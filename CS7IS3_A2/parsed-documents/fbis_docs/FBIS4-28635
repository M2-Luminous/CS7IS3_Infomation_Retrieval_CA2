During the hour-plus meeting at Chongwadae, they shared the view that a resolution on sanctions against North Korea will inevitably be adopted by the United Nations Security Council Senior Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik told reporters that President Kim and Tarnoff agreed the firm relations between Korea and the United States were easing Koreans' anxiety over the nuclear wrangling. Tarnoff said that "despite the escalating tension on the Korean peninsula, Koreans are wisely coping with it and this is impressive." President Kim offered an explanation: "Korean people are now mature enough to trust the government's security policies as the government does not exploit security issues for political power any more." "Some Americans worry about the security of Korea, but they will be relieved to see Koreans' firm security posture and maturity," the undersecretary noted. As to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's planned visit to Pyongyang, President Kim expressed some concern. "Kim Il-song is likely to utilize Carter's visit as a tactic of dialogue and smile toward the Western community," he said. Tarnoff explained President Bill Clinton believes that Carter's trip should not be an obstacle to UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea. Touching on North Korea's repeated call for direct talks with the United States, Kim and Tarnoff agreed it was a tactic designed to secure the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. Earlier in the day, Tarnoff held talks with Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku on similar issues.
