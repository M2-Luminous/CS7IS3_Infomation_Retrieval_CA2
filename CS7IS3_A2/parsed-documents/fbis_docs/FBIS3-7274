On 22 March, the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government struggled to reach Pailin from the east, that is from Phnum Srang and Suosdei, with infantry troops after being heavily attacked for many days. II. Here is the situation on the Pailin battlefield on 23 March: 1. Major communications lines of the invading forces on the north from Phnum Kon Damrei to Sala Krau were completely cut by the people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] with mines and with attacks to cut off many road segments. Trucks and tanks were bogged down due to rain. The invading forces' supplies from the north were completely cut off along the Mongkolborei River, from Kamping Puoy, and from Snoeng and Sdau. The invading forces at Sala Krau are running short of fuel, ammunition, and food supplies. Troops, therefore, have deserted the battlefield and also have been surrounded and are constantly attacked by the people and the NADK. They cannot move forward or retreat. 2. On 23 March, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the invading forces who reached Pailin deserted the town partly because there is nothing in Pailin. Furthermore, the invading forces were being surrounded and constantly fired upon by big and small artillery pieces. III. On 24 and 25 March, the new road of the invading forces from Suosdei to Pailin was completely disrupted by mines and attack groups who cut this road at many places. This road goes through dense forest. The invading troops cannot leave the road, particularly trucks and tanks. The ground is soft due to rain over the past more than 10 days. IV. Two strategic and important roads have been cut: the northern road from Phnum Kon damrei to Sala Krau and the southern road from Suosdei to Pailin. This is like cutting the throat or the arteries of the invading forces, similar to cutting National Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in 1971-74, and in particular blocking the Mekong River in February, March, and April 1975. It is similar to cutting transport roads No. 68 from Samraong to Anlung Veng in February and in early March 1994. It is similar to Dien Bien Phu and Stalingrad. V. Communications and transport routes of the invading forces have been strategically cut, first of all, by the people and the NADK. Along with this, attacking and raiding forces have been set up within Pailin perimeter and Sala Krau. Attacks have been launched at will against the enemies who are like fish caught in traps. Because rats are clever in stealing, bait has been left in traps to catch them. They are caught in the traps. Rats trapped in cages will die regardless of the movements and shrieks they make.
