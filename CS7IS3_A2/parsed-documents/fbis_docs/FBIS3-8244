For the first time since NATO was formed in 1949, its Air Force took part in a combat operation in Europe, outside the range of the North Atlantic Alliance. Another "first" -- for the first time since the beginning of the ethnic and religious conflict in Bosnia, foreign forces interfered in the conflict. Such were the initial assessments of the political observers after it was reported that U.S. F-16 aircraft belonging to NATO's allied Air Force, took off from the base in Aviano and shot down four "Galeb" aircraft in the Banja Luka region, which is controlled by the Serbs. The report marked a new date in the history of the longest and bloodiest military crisis in Europe since the end of World War II. Until now, even the famous NATO ultimatum of 9 February did not cause an escalation, however, the air action of the U.S. fighters in Bosnia crossed the border at which things become unpredictable and dangerous. One was not surprised by the explanation given by NATO headquarters. The UN Security Council resolution that envisages a "clear sky" over Bosnia, i.e. a ban on military flights that have not been authorized by the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], has been violated. The truth is yet to be established, but a fact is well-known. The three fighting sides have violated the ban on flights since the day the resolution was adopted. Periodically one of the sides accuses the others of utilizing helicopters or combat aircraft. Nevertheless, NATO's "AWACS" intelligence aircraft have not accused any of the sides of violating the resolution, nor has UNPROFOR publicly warned any of the fighting sides. Without justifying the actions of those who violated the resolution, and regardless of whether the airplanes were Serbian or not, it is obvious that NATO's operation comes at a very inappropriate moment -- precisely when the world public sighed with relief that the ultimatum did not prompt a bombardment and even directed the developments toward peace. The air operation contradicted the conclusion of the "Blue Helmets" commanders, who said that the cease-fire was generally observed, and the opinion of the political figures that the Sarajevo model of peacemaking must gradually be expanded to include all of Bosnia. The first military intervention of NATO in Europe must evoke great concern. It demonstrated that contrary to Butrus-Ghali's assurance, the commanding center of the military operations in Bosnia is not in the UN glass skyscraper in New York, but in the Pentagon, and that Washington deliberately seeks an escalation in the conflict to prompt a new division of Bosnia's territory. It is not very hard to establish that the attack against the four airplanes in the Banja Luka sky, which was peaceful since the beginning of the war, was directly related to the tripartite talks in Washington on establishing the Croatian-Muslim federation. The U.S. plan practically eliminates the EC plan on dividing Bosnia into three parts. On the other hand, it envisages a much greater territory for the future federation than the Bosnia Serbs would be willing to concede. Consequently, NATO's air fist had the important goal of demonstrating power to force the Serbs to make territorial concessions under the threat of military intervention. An unidentified Russian diplomat demanded an explanation from NATO regarding the air operation and said: "What happened is what we feared most and warned against frequently." If one adds to this alarming sensation the intention of UNPROFOR to allow the "Blue Helmets" who accompany the humanitarian relief convoys, to open fire in order to clear the way, even without informing the fighting sides about this, it becomes clear that Bosnia is heading toward a new military escalation. They say that this corresponds to the interests of the Muslims and their protectors, the Americans. This could be so. However, it does not correspond to the desire of Bosnia's population for peace and the efforts of the world community to stop this shameful butchery.
