He calls himself commander of united armed forces of Tajik Mujahideen. The appeal was printed in leaflets circulated in some residential areas of Dushanbe on Tuesday [26 April] as well as in the suburban Kofirnikhonskiy, Leninskiy and some other districts of the republic. The appeal signed by Rizvon says that the present "pro-communist government" is responsible for all social and economic evils of the Republic as well as impoverishment of its citizens. Therefore, the government should immediately step down. Leaflets spell out in detail instructions on how to organise resistance to government forces and to give aid to detachments of domestic opposition existing in the Republic. Competent Tajik bodies confirmed to ITAR-TASS the appearance of anti-government leaflets, calling them a provocation by the extremist wing of opposition, aimed at destabilising the social and political situation and thwarting the second round of the intra-Tajik talks on national reconciliation, which is to be held late in May in a Moslem Mid-East country. It was stressed that, since leaflets contained a call for an overthrow of the constitutional system in Tajikistan by force, competent bodies instituted a criminal case in connection with this action.
