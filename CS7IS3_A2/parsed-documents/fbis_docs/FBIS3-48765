The comment came as speculation continued over whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would attempt to reach an eleventh hour compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to get the measures passed before the Diet session ends Saturday. Watanabe, speaking at the Japan National Press Club, called on coalition and opposition parties to instead issue statements committing themselves to legislate provisions to crack down on electoral fraud and bribe-taking by March, and to continue discussions on changes to the electoral system. He also expressed support for a proposal to pass a law giving prosecutors' power to arrest Diet members who take bribes. He said he backed a draft bill jointly proposed by Social Democratic Party veteran Hideko Ito and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator Katsuhiko Shirakawa. "If the proposed draft bill were legislated, it alone would be able to exert a powerful effect to dissuade a Diet member from taking a bribe," said Watanabe, leader of the LDP's second-largest faction. Under the bill, a Diet member could be liable to up to three years in prison if they accepted a bribe to use their political influence to persuade other politicians or bureaucrats to favor a specific business interest. The draft bill, now being promoted by more than 50 legislators from both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, was submitted to both houses of the Diet on Tuesday.
