The United States believes that "Mr. Ozawa paved the way for breaking the deadlock on the mobile phone (portable and car phones) issue." Although the itinerary of Ozawa's visit is yet to be finalized, the government has expressed its expectation that if Mr. Ozawa's visit takes place, he "will surely bring compromise proposals" concerning objective criteria designed to measure the progress in Japan's efforts to open its markets. The U.S. Government has received information on Mr. Ozawa's visit through reports in the mass media as well as from the U.S. Embassy in Japan. According to a U.S. Government official, Mr. Ozawa will arrive in Washington on 21 March with the ostensible aim of granting a request for a speech. The same official has also said that the United States "has been sounded out" by Mr. Ozawa on his intention to meet with senior U.S. Government officials, including President Clinton, as well as congressional leaders. The U.S. Government has also been eager to improve relations with Japan since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in February. A official at the U.S. Trade Representative Office said that "Mr. Ozawa took action" under the situation. Regarding the report on Ozawa's visit to the United States, U.S. Congressmen who take a hard-line stance against Japan, including House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, and U.S. Government officials stated the following: "Mr. Ozawa reportedly plans to come to the United States to pave the way for resuming the framework talks;" and "he reportedly intends to accept the U.S. proposal for setting sector- by-sector objective criteria as endeavor indicators if the United States promises not to use such criteria for the purpose of imposing sanctions against Japan." However, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Japanese Embassy in the United States have reiterated: "We have not heard of such a plan. This is not Prime Minister Hosokawa's intention, nor is it a government policy. Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United States has not been decided." If this is true, the current reports prove that the U.S. Government cherishes excessive hope for Mr. Ozawa's visit and that the two governments have now lost most of their channels of communication. The first task of Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi -- who has succeeded former Deputy Vice Minister Koichiro Matsuura and who is scheduled to hold talks with U.S. officials in charge of the framework talks in Washington this week -- is to normalize channels between Japan and the United States to dispel such misunderstandings. The current atmosphere is such that if the channels are not normalized, the mistrust between the two countries which followed in the wake of the the summit meeting in February may worsen.
