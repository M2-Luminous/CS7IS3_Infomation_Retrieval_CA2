This has just been decided by the Council of Ministers. The government will however consult with the United Nations about the practical implementation of that decision. The Council of Ministers judges that the UN mission in Rwanda has become pointless. Because of the recent dramatic events, the peace and democatization process in Rwanda has come to an end. That is why the government urges the suspension of the UN mandate. Moreover, the anti-Belgian witch-hunt makes the work of the blue helmets impossible, the Council of Ministers argues.
