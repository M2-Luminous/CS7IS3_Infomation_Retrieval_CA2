Secession and the return of the situation to what it was before April 1990 -- a state in the north with its capital Sanaa and a state in the south with its capital Aden. 2. Internalization after the failure of the local and internal efforts to reconcile the warring factions in Yemen. Added to this is the failure of regional and pan-Arab mediation efforts by the Arab brothers and neighbors and their Arab League. Following this national and pan-Arab failure, there is a need for an "international" solution to at least stop the bloodbath and end the massacres that the two sides have been carrying out with great appetite. 3. Intervention after the sides which have an interest with this or that side and which have aligned with the south or supported the north have contented themselves with closely follow-up the situation or secretly helping this or that side during the past month of fighting. After this anticipation, caution, claim of neutrality, and non-disclosure of true positions and feelings and after the Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, the external parties -- neighbors and non-neighbors -- will find enough cover to intervene publicly and to morally and financially support the side that they believe will achieve their objectives. There is nothing better than an international umbrella which states will use as an excuse for their intervention. This is particularly so because up to the moment the Security Council resolution was issued, the parties to the dispute had embarked on a course leading to: 1. Secession. 2. Internationalization as a cover from beginning to end. 3. Active foreign intervention with politics and even with arms and forces. The race of the two leaders, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, ended in a tie. Salih fired three long-range missiles on Aden -- its mosques, houses, and inhabitants. Al-Bid responded by forming a government in the south under Haydar al-'Attas and including as members all those who can offer support in the battle for survival and existence. Al-Bid's traditional allies, his old rivals in the party and power struggle, and 'Ali Salih's foes in the north, such as 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, are all qualified to join this government. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with his missiles and his forces's activity around Aden and the roads leading to it, wanted to settle the situation militarily and from a strong position before accepting the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. 'Ali Salim al-Bid wanted to impose a fait accompli. He hoped that negotiations on an international or regional solution or settlement through mediation efforts and good offices would be held on the basis of this fait accompli, which offers two separate and disputant states--not two disputant regions within one state. Before analyzing the situation and its future possibilities in light of the UN resolution, I would like to explain Egypt's stance on the crisis. There is a mistaken feeling which has developed innocently or not-so-innocently in the Egyptian public and the Arab and world media that Egypt's stance essentially supports 'Ali Salim al-Bid and hence secession. Some consider support for secession an unforgivable sin. This mistaken feeling is translated by some inside and outside Egypt as reflecting hostility to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salim for his stand on the terrorists whom he has sheltered and to whom he has opened training centers where they plan and concoct plots under complete freedom without any restrictions. The truth of the matter is different. Cairo's relations with Sanaa -- the Sanaa of unity or the Sanaa of the north -- is very good, especially with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The reason is that Cairo has accurate data, containing numbers and names, on the size of this "presence" of "political Islam" groups on the land of Yemen. They include Egyptians, Sudanese, Palestinians, Lebanese, Algerians, Afghans, and others. Egypt knows the powers that foster, protect, finance, and nurture these activities in and out of Yemen. It knows the "influence of the state," as represented by President Salih and his men and institutions, and knows the extent and limits of its ability to control. It knows about the power of the tribes and the leaders of "political Islam," their size, influence, and scope of control. In many of its features, dimensions, and characteristics, this situation is similar to the relation between the authority of Sudanese President Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir and that of "Shaykh Hasan," or Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and his [National Salvation] front. Despite the ranks shown on their shoulders and the military medals decorating their chests, the heads of authority in Sanaa and Sudan, Salih and al-Bashir, own but do not rule, and neither al-Turabi nor al-Ahmar carry ranks on their shoulders or military medals on their chest. Cairo certainly knows what is happening on the Yemeni and Sudanese soils; it knows about the existence, the figures, the size, and the activity linked to violence and political Islam groups. What interests us today is Yemen and the "extremist" and hostile presence there. We are interested in Yemen, both its northern and southern sectors, particularly during its time of unity from May 1990 to May 1994. In the northern governorate of Sa'dah, there is a camp named Sinnarah that provides training in urban warfare, blowing up roads, and spreading armed anarchy. Among the members of this camp, there are Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese, Libyans, Palestinians, and of course Egyptians, specifically 16 Egyptians. There is (al-Raht) camp in the governorate of Lahij in the south. It belongs to the al-Jihad Organization and its training techniques focus on "sabotage" operations. Weapons, equipment, and supplies are sent directly to this camp from the capital of the north, or rather the capital of unity, Sanaa, via mountain paths across (Tawr al-Bahah). In the governorate of Ta'izz, a major northern city, lies Rawnah camp, where a number of Egyptians belonging to the al-Jihad Organization and the Vanguards of Conquest receive their training. There is also the camp of ('Ataq and Gharran) in the governorate of Shabwah, the oil-rich area of the south. In all these camps, as well as in homes and hideouts and in the areas protected by northern army brigades like al-'Amaliqah Brigade, stationed in the south, there are active Egyptian elements. These elements arrive there, receive their training, then disperse to carry out the tasks entrusted to them. Cairo knows this and knows many other things. It knows that Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and his half brother 'Ali Salim are among the major loyalists and active leaders of political Islam and its organizations, those of the "Iranian school," those led and financed by Usamah Bin-Ladin and his disciples, or those of the international organization in which Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi plays an important, powerful, and active role. A number of integrated, conflicting, and interlinked factors are involved in that blend; they move it and guarantee its existence. That blend involves the temptation of money, an abundance of it. It involves the "suspicious" connection with the elements of international collusion that seek to keep the area under control by maintaining its backwardness and infighting, or by fanning tribal or regional fanaticism or local rivalry. It also involves love for adventure and a desire to seek a certain role, even through crime and terrorism, and finally involves a twisted and erroneous understanding of Islam, its message, and essence. Ugly and serious as it might be, one thing is certain -- the fact that acting in the name of unity or partition, the central government in Sanaa exercises control only on "civilian" areas in and around big cities. Control beyond these limits is in the hands of tribes and their chieftains, who are backed by the groups and the "amirs and shaykhs" of political Islam, who are in actual control at present. In this light, Cairo has realized that backing the civilian authority -- as represented in the head of state, his foundations and institutions and, particularly, his army -- is the only way to maintain and safeguard Yemen's march toward breaking free from tribalism and imams rule. This is the only way to guarantee an end to grudges, rivalry, and infighting just to oblige the "chieftain" or the leaders or amirs of organizations that pursue violence and terrorism in the name of religion. When Cairo declared its stand through President Mubarak that unity cannot be imposed by force and maintained by bloodshed, it meant to prevent deepening the wound and meant to curb the dispute, division, and hatred caused by wars and destruction. It sought to preserve Yemen's forces, institutions, and lively and enlightened forces both in the north and the south. If the experiment of the past four years could not build unitary institutions in the army, administration and in people's minds, the path is still open and the future is still full of hope provided that ties are maintained, partition is not consolidated by wasted blood in the north and the south, and Yemen's strength and resources are preserved. That is why the contacts by the two sides of the crisis Salih and Salim with President Mubarak have not ceased. Let us go back to the beginning of the article. What will happen after the Security Council resolution to halt the fighting which, as we indicated, opened the way to internationalization, partition, and intervention? One of the strategic experts concerned with the Yemeni crisis and its developments presents three possible scenarios after the Security Council's cease-fire resolution. First, in his view, the north will declare that it has accepted the resolution, which it did. But at the same time it continues its action on the ground by striking at cities and homes, especially Aden, it completely rejects dialogue with the Socialist Party leaders, especially al-Bid and his men, and it demands dialogue with other Socialist Party leaders to be designated by itself. Through big, tempting promises, the north could impose on them its conditions and achieve the formula it is seeking which is naturally the continuation of the unity under its leadership and control. Such a scenario is not applicable and is far from being a solution and settlement. It opens the door to a painful, drawn-out war of annihilation between the north and the south and also opens the door to a sharp division within the Socialist Party ranks and leaders and the southern leaders amid the tragedies of war and the effects of bombardment and destruction with an apparent superiority of the northern forces. In second scenario, the north will accept the cease-fire through negotiations with the south and Socialist Party leaders, led by al-Bid. The conditions for this second probability are: -The south and its forces should be able to hold out militarily and prevent the northern forces from capturing Aden, Hadhramout, and Mukalla through a reasonable and firm military position. -This steadfastness by the southerners should be coupled with and backed by active, effective international pressure and sincere goodwill efforts forcing the northerners to initiate a dialogue and disengage the forces. This will pave the way for talk about unity at present and in the future or about any other formula. In the third scenario, the Security Council's resolution will be practically rejected outright and the fighting and marches on cities and important junctions will continue even if the cease-fire remained in place while the true situation is the opposite. Such a probability, as well as the blood and destruction caused by it every day and every moment and the potential foreign interventions in favor of this or that party may prompt the international community and the international organization to escalate its resolutions from a kind request for a cease-fire to punishing the violators of the cease-fire through the imposition of a blockade and economic and military sanctions and the like. Such a worsening and crumbling situation will not be accompanied by only foreign and regional interventions from the neighbors but may also prompt many countries to promote the recognition and perpetuation of a complete separation between the north and the south and may subject the two sides of the crisis to the will of the parties that provide each side with money, arms, food supplies, and political support. This picture in general reflects the situation in Yemen as it would be after the war continued and acts of destruction and shelling continued and went beyond all limits of what is prohibited, thus violating all laws. Perhaps the voice of wisdom and reason and the call of patriotic conscience may preserve the Yemeni homeland or what remains of its elements of strength and life and what remains of the dreams and hopes of unity and merger.
