Mr Botha said the intention was that the force would be prepared to maintain law and order and to protect SA citizens and their interests. He said the SA ambassador in the Bophuthatswana capital had not been able to make contact with Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope or any of his ministers. With the outbreak of attacks and looting on Thursday, South African interests were being seriously threatened. Information that right wing elements were on their way to Mmabatho had also reached the SA government. "Against this background the president, after consultation with relevant minsiters and security forces, decided that a component of the SA army should take up a position in the grounds of the SA embassy in Mmabatho during (Thursday) night. "The objective of this deployement is first to ensure that the SA representattvies and their families be protected against possible attack of any kind. Secondly it is the intention that the component should be on hand to maintain law and order and to protect SA citizens and their interests should the situation deteriorate." Mr Botha said the government would not hesitate to take similar steps in any other of the republic's nominally independent states. The Transitional Executive Council was being kept informed of developments, he said.
