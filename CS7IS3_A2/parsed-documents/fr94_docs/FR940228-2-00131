(3) Other Eligibility Related Requirements. (a) Grants used solely for the activities listed in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of Section I.E(2), ``Eligible Activities,'' of this NOFA, shall be completed within three years of the effective date of the grant. Each applicant should submit a description of the renovation or conversion to be conducted, along with a budget and timetable for those activities. Other eligible activities may be funded over a maximum five-year period. (b) Each applicant must submit a budget, timetable, and list of milestones for the five-year period (following initial receipt of funding), at least, covered by the applicant's description of supportive services. Milestones shall include the number of families to be served, types of services, and dollar amounts to be allocated over the five-year period. (c) Each applicant must demonstrate a firm commitment of assistance from one or more sources ensuring that supportive services will be provided for not less than one year following the completion of activities funded under this NOFA. (d) When a grant application is approved, the HA must receive approval from HUD to conduct renovation or conversions. Approval must be provided prior to drawing down funds. (e) If a renovation is done off-site, the HA must provide documentation that it has control of the proposed property. Control can be evidenced through a lease agreement, ownership documentation, or other appropriate documentation (see Sections III.B(3) and III.C(15) of this NOFA). F. Other Program Requirements (1) Resident Involvement. The Department has a longstanding policy of encouraging HAs to promote resident involvement, and to facilitate cooperative partnerships to achieve specific and mutual goals. Therefore, residents must be included in the planning and implementation of this program. The HA shall develop a process that assures that RC/RMC/RO representatives and residents are fully briefed and have an opportunity to comment on the proposed content of the HA's application in response to this NOFA. The HA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of the residents. The process shall include: (a) Informing residents of the selected developments regarding the preparation of the application, and providing for residents to assist in the development of the application, as appropriate. (b) Once a draft application has been prepared, the HA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office; provide copies of the draft to any resident organization representing the residents of the development(s) involved; and provide adequate opportunity for comment by the residents of the development and their representative organizations prior to making the application final. (c) Provide to any resident organization representing the development a summary of the resident comments and its response to them, and notify residents of the development(s) that this summary and response are available for reading in the management office. (d) After HUD approval of a grant, notify residents of the development, and any representative organizations of approval, of the grant; notify the residents of the availability of the HUD approved implementation schedule in the management office for reading; and develop a system to facilitate a regular resident role in all aspects of program implementation. (2) Training/Employment/Contracting of HA Residents. (a) Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3) requires that programs of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes of training and employment, the HA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i) Residents of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside within a project area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the HA that is expending the assistance; and (iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each HA and each of its contractors and subcontractors receiving funds under this program shall make best efforts to employ HA residents to provide services and renovation or conversion work. (b) For purposes of the requirements under Section 3, a best effort means that the HA shall: (1) Attempt to recruit HA residents from the appropriate areas through local advertising media, signs placed at the proposed FIC project site, and community organizations and public or private institutions operating within the development area. The HA shall include in its outreach and marketing efforts, procedures to attract the least likely to apply for this program because it includes construction/renovation type of activities, i.e., low-income households headed by women and persons with disabilities; and (2) Determine the qualifications of HA residents when they apply, either on their own or on referral from any source, and employ HA residents if their qualifications are satisfactory and the contractor has openings. If the HA is unable to employ residents determined to be qualified, those residents shall be listed for the first available openings. (3) Davis-Bacon Requirements. All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or the HA in renovation or conversion (including combining of units) on the premises of the HA development to accommodate the provision of supportive services under this program shall be paid not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a_276a&hyph;5). All architects, technical engineers, draftsmen, and technicians employed with respect to such work shall be paid not less than the wages prevailing in the locality as determined by HUD. These requirements do not apply to volunteers under the conditions set out in 24 CFR part 70. (4) Resident Compensation. Residents employed to provide services funded under this program or described in the application shall be paid at a rate not less than the highest of: (a) The minimum wage that would be applicable to the employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), if section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA applied to the resident and if the resident were not exempt under section 13 of the FLSA; (b) The State or local minimum wage for the most nearly comparable covered employment; or
