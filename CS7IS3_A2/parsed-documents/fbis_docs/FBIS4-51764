"The United States is a signatory of the Armistice and therefore will get involved in that sense," Han told reporters, "but Washington fully agrees with Seoul that the matter is for the two Koreas to resolve." North Korea will end up hindering high-level dialogue with the United States if it insists on the change, Han said. "The next round of North Korea-U.S. dialogue will not discuss this issue." Pyongyang unilaterally announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Military Armistice Commission but would keep on its commission secretaries and liaison officers. In addition, it announced that Poland, a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) member chosen by North Korea, will be withdrawn from the commission. Han said the North was trying to isolate the South in talking only with the United States and trying to "break up" Seoul- Washington relations.
