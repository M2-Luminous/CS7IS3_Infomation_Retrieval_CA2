Was this to meet with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak? [Krzaklewski] I postponed my visit to Romania because of the strike at the brown-coal mines, which is not only an internal action within the mining sector but also a protest action on the part of the entire trade union. [Kostrzewska] What was the subject of your talk with Prime Minister Pawlak several hours before the start of the strike at the brown-coal mines? [Krzaklewski] We discussed two things. First, the general ways of tackling the "popiwek" [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] act and, second, specific projects involved in decentralization of the wage-regulation system. If we do not create appropriate mechanisms in that sphere, we will never move to the stage of civilized wage control. Appropriate acts related to these solutions should be introduced with the same speed with which the popiwek act is being processed at the moment. I should also like to add here that Prime Minister Pawlak approved our proposal in our talk. Unfortunately, however, it seems that it is the chief accountant rather that the state's chief administrator who runs the country at the moment because yet another revised version of the popiwek act has been submitted for parliamentary debate. [Kostrzewska] What is Solidarity hoping for at the moment? [Krzaklewski] We expect sensible and consistent action from the prime minister. He must stress his position as head of government. I cannot imagine a situation where a prime minister hailing from a political configuration that commands the parliamentary majority would be saying one thing while deputies from coalition parties would be saying another altogether. If this is a manifestation of a lack of political cohesion or an internal conflict within the coalition, these things are bound to come to the surface soon. If, on the other hand, it is a deliberate strategy pursued by the prime minister, the consequences will soon follow. [Kostrzewska] What were your impressions from your talk with Prime Minister Pawlak? [Krzaklewski] It was a man-to-man talk. The prime minister showed considerable knowledge of the subject, which is something that does not happen too often in talks with government representatives. I can see that Mr. Pawlak has studied our project for decentralized wage-control mechanisms quite conscientiously. However, this should oblige him even more to fulfill the promises he has made to us. But it is quite obvious that, as far as the prime minister is concerned, politics and real life are two different things. On the other hand, we can judge the prime minister not only on the basis of the talks we have had with him and his public utterances, but also by the actions undertaken by his government and parliament. [Kostrzewska] Do you see a chance that your demands will be met? [Krzaklewski] Yes, in substantive terms. The system we have presented to the government and that is to replace the popiwek scheme is perfectly clear-cut, but the government regards its possible introduction as a political decision. The authorities in power in Poland now are probably afraid of the introduction of a decentralized employer-employee communication system. Officials in charge of the Finance Ministry are afraid of losing the privilege of making centralized decisions regarding wages--both in general terms and in individual enterprises. I have seen very clear indications of mounting panic in the finance sector. [Kostrzewska] How long will the strike at the brown-coal mines last? [Krzaklewski] Until it has brought results. The miners are most firmly determined, and I hope their example will make the government realize the meaning of compromise with the trade unions--that is, a will to step down part of the way and seek solutions that would lie somewhere in the middle between the most extreme positions. Until now, the government made political decisions to ensure that there would be no compromise with Solidarity. The popiwek act has come to parliament's attention, but our other demands have not even been considered--not even those the government was obliged to meet because the previous authorities in power had undertaken to meet them. Here I am thinking specifically of the agreements and acts signed within the framework of the "Enterprises Act." [Kostrzewska] Is the strike going to continue until you get results? In other words, are you going to call it off after the scheduled 48 hours, or will you carry on beyond that deadline? [Krzaklewski] We shall see. The Brown-Coal Miners' National Strike Committee can, under the terms of the approved procedure, apply to the National Protest Action Headquarters to extend the strike's proposed time span. That is why the 48 hours are not a strict deadline marking the definitive end of this particular protest action. We would like to have cut down the time of the protest action, but Mr. Pawlak must first give us a certain document. I told him myself what that document should entail; unfortunately, I cannot discuss it at this moment because I am bound by a promise I gave to the prime minister that I would not divulge the substance of our talk. [Kostrzewska] During your latest visit to Lodz, you said that the Solidarity protest action would last until your demands are met and implemented.... [Krzaklewski] And I do maintain that position because we no longer believe any declarations or compacts. First, it is announced in the TV News that the prime minister is opposed to the popiwek act and intends to reject it, and then, two minutes later, we hear in the same program that a parliamentary debate on a new popiwek project is in progress now. [Kostrzewska] Why have you come to Lodz? Is this only a stopover on your way to Belchatow, or did you have any relevant decisions to make here? [Krzaklewski] We have important experts here. We came to coordinate the union's position on the prime minister's project of the ways in which we could depart from the popiwek scheme, even though parliament is already debating the new popiwek bill without waiting for our union's opinion. [Kostrzewska] Is a meeting with the president very likely? [Krzaklewski] Our invitation is still open, and I believe that such a meeting should take place within the next two weeks. We want to explain our demands, and ways of implementing them, to the president in the obvious hope that, if we give him a sufficiently extensive clarification of our position, he will become an advocate of our stipulations. They are devised as a stabilizing influence, and, at the same time, they propose the introduction of a new system: the system of public dialogue. Our country needs the implementation of these stipulations, and I hope we will finally see the day when their provisions become the law in our country.
