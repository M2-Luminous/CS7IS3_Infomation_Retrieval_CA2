On 5 February of this year, villages in the so-called upper zone of Gali Rayon were barbarically despoiled and burned down by Gudauta militants, who arrived on 16 Ikarus buses and were armed with 10 pieces of heavy equipment. All this was carried out on the false pretext of the elimination of Georgian guerrilla units hiding in the rayon. The villages of Okhumi and Mukhuri were burned down. Some 100 residential houses were burned down in other villages. About 3,000 civilians in the rayon who represented not only Georgian but also other nationalities were driven by separatists into the surrounding woods, where the snow level is reaching one and a half meters. In effect, defenseless women and children were condemned to death from cold and starvation. In the village of Okumi, dozens of civilians were killed in a punitive raid carried out by Cossack militants. This morning Abkhaz separatists, with the active support of their North Caucasian hirelings, launched an offensive on Tsalenjikha Rayon in western Georgia, where refugees from the upper zone [of Gali Rayon] were trying to find shelter.
