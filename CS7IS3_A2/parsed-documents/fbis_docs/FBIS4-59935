[Qasim] The files that were opened recently--files that had to do with the party behind the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion--were justified by the circumstances that almost disrupted civil peace and did a great service to the Israeli enemy. We are not in a position of authority that would allow us to opens other people's files. We do not think anyone in the authority can distanced himself from these old files; once opened, these files will involve everyone without exception. I do not think that it is proper to do this at time when the civil war has ended and peace is returning. I think that there must be a distinction between a specific incident or group of incidents that pose a threat to modern Lebanon and things that happened years ago. The files of these years have been closed. Opening them would have a negative effect and will not achieve a sound result, in my view. [Correspondent] Some people say that lifting the international cover of the Lebanese Forces will also lead to lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly the Syrian and Iranian protection, because of the party's links to the foreign hostages issue. What is your reaction to that? [Qasim] The circumstances that made eyes focus on the Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause, but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free people in the Arab and Muslim worlds. Hizballah cannot be the object of a decision that some official makes behind his desk on a personal whim. Hizballah's roots at the popular and political levels, its relations at the local and regional levels, and its sincerity in confronting the Israeli enemy give it a kind of organic immunity that prevents anyone from gambling with it. We are not a bunch of isolated partisan offices; we are a deeply-rooted popular movement known to all responsible leaders in this country. As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in the past that we have absolutely no connection with that file. There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled the ramifications of that issue at the time. The files that should be opened are those hot issues that concern the citizens, including social services, preventing sedition, the right of the opposition express its views, and freedom for the media. These files should be opened instead of files from the past that could confuse things or seek to settle accounts with some people. As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the international level, because we do not tolerate the continued occupation of our lands. [Correspondent] How does Hizballah view the hangings and the recent executions in Lebanon? [Qasim] Islamic shari'ah says that a killer should be executed if he murders deliberately. This is to deter criminals. We in Hizballah back the idea of executions, of hanging premeditated murderers until the criminals are deterred and in order not to make crime an easy option. [Correspondent] Some believe that things will get worse if the domestic situation keeps on its current course. How does Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files? [Qasim] We understand the meaning of balances of rights and duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we do not understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with the guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same measures that were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have been taken against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That horrible act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have to pay the price for harming people, violating a place of worship, and terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But opening files in every direction is not an objective measure; it ruins Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public peace must be punished. But settling accounts or seeking to control things one way or another under the banner of the authority or anything else is totally unacceptable. When, after members of the Lebanese Forces were arrested on charges of blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, the Lebanese Forces party was dissolved and the decision made to suspend radio and television newscasts, we said this was a mistake and futile, short-sighted measures because taking vengeance on the audiovisual media and settling accounts with the opposition on the pretext of punishing those who blew up the church reflects a narrow-minded outlook and a domineering tendency to silence every opposition voice in the country. Such a measure can never succeed. We are the only state in the region that is accustomed to responsible and candid freedom of expression. We back any political practice that refrains from using force to impose some party's views on others. Let us all compete to win grassroots support. Whoever manages to apply the available peaceful methods assumes a certain status and plays a certain role in the service of the Lebanese citizen, provided that force is not used to disrupt security or impose one's views on others as a way of putting pressure on the masses. The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have to do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular. Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis of actual developments. These developments require an Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.
