The gathering was to be a show of support for the Zulu monarch at his planned meeting with African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela. On Thursday, the ANC cancelled the meeting, following claims of an assassination attempt on the ANC leader's life in the Inkatha stronghold of Ulundi. The ANC has requested the meeting be postponed to a later date. Meanwhile, the kwaZulu government said on Thursday that Friday's meeting would go ahead "with or without Mr Mandela". The Zulu king is expected to address thousands of his subjects outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building later Friday.
