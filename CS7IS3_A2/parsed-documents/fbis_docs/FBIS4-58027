The "Brothers" sources in Khartoum have confirmed that before his departure the major general had invited some of his military colleagues to a dinner at his house. Heading the list of guests was Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir. The sources said that the dinner invitation turned into an open dialogue between al-Bashir and the army officers, during which the latter severely criticized al-Bashir for neglecting the Army and thereby enabling the Islamic Front's cadres to seize power. The sources note that al-Bashir did not voice any objection to the officers' talk during dinner. They said that al-Bashir left the dinner party and went directly to the house of the Front's interior minister, 'Abd-al-Rahim Husayn, and told him there was a major coup plot under way by active and retired army officers led by Major General Ahmad, known as "Al-Sirr Ab Ahmad." He also told the interior minister that he personally had uncovered this plot while meeting with the officers. The sources added that the interior minister ordered the arrest of the major general and his officer colleagues. Their whereabouts remain unknown.
