The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are still holding all the positions they captured. Mutara region is under the control of the RPF combatants. The government troops never returned there. In the Byumba area, the RPF troops are doing very well. Contrary to lies that have been spread, Byumba town is entirely in the hands of the RPF troops. In Ruhengeri, the RPF combatants control many areas of the prefecture while the government troops are tired and have started fleeing. They have now resorted to seeking help from the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] and Coalition for the Defense of the Republic members, involving them in a war they know very well that they will never win.
