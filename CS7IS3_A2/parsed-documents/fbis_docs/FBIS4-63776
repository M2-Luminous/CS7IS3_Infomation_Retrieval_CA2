Within the broad framework of the Nunn-Lugar program (which provides for the Ukrainian defense industry's conversion) a pilot defense conversion project will be financed by the USA to the tune of 5 million US dollars. Besides, Westinhous will additionally allocate 20 million US dollars from its own funds. Westinhous officers are presently in Kharkov to register the jv and settle some technical problems. The jv's automated control systems are supposed to be mounted at six power generating units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants. The US partner's contribution to manufacture of the first such system will amount to 90 per cent of total costs, the last one is supposed to be financed by the Ukrainian party by 90 per cent. Meanwhile, as many an expert in Ukraine maintains, the US party has been rather sluggish in implementing the Nunn-Lugar defense conversion program. A mixed US-Ukrainian intergovernmental commission is in charge of the program's implementation. Its Ukrainian component is headed by Mr. Kazakov. Its first meeting was summoned in March 1994. The latest visit to the USA by a Ukrainian delegation led by vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov resulted, in particular, in an agreed list of 35 Ukrainian defense enterprises to undergo conversion. On 26 May the list will be published in the USA to facilitate US partner selection for joint ventures to be set up in Ukraine to assist in defense industry conversion.
