FBIS4-919 "drafr076_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC on Plans To Include IFP on Election Ballots IEC on Plans To Include IFP on Election Ballots MB1904144594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1354 GMT 19 Apr 94 MB1904144594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- A sticker with the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] name, initials and emblem will be affixed to the bottom of national and regional ballot papers, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Tuesday [19 April]. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a press conference in Johannesburg the procedure was flawed but all parties had agreed to it in Pretoria on Tuesday. The stickers will be affixed at individual polling stations before the ballot papers are brought to the issuing desk and handed to voters. Mr Justice Kriegler said the IEC had awarded the contract for printing the stickers to one firm after considering four possibilities. IFP candidate lists would be vetted no later than Friday and published no later than the weekend, he said. Mr Justice Kriegler said the procedure was flawed because parties did not appear in alphabetical order. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers, which also showed a colour picture of IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, would look different because they were printed on a white background. The ballot paper was marked. If the IFP sticker crossed the line of the political party above it, the ballot paper would be spoilt, he said. Mr Justice Kriegler could not say if this system would increase the number of spoilt votes, but said the complicated process left room for human error. The stickers would not necessarily increase the number of election result disputes, he said. Each party had accepted the system and Mr Justice Kriegler believed this agreement would lessen the prospect of such disputes. He congratulated the government, the African National Congress and the IFP on their agreement. It would make the IEC's talk of declaring the elections free and fair "infinitely easier" because all major political role players took part, he said. The IFP's participation would reduce violence caused by political frustration and resistance to the electoral process in Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler predicted. He would not disclose whose idea the stickers was. "It may even have been mine. I think it was," he joked, saying the idea had been thrown around on Saturday when he and the IEC chief director met the three political parties. IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said a team had already been sent to kwaZulu/Natal to investigate setting up an addi4ional 700 voting stations. Security at the stations was a concern and talks were being held with security forces in the area.
