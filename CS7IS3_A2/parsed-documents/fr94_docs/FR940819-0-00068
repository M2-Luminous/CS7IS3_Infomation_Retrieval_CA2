FR940819-0-00068 FR940819-0-00017 5.7.2␣ Limits. The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed as a percentage by volume and shall not exceed the maximum percent specified (see tables 1 and 1a). 5.8␣Particulates/Solids. 5.8.1␣ Method. A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids shall be determined by visual examination of the Goetz bulb prior to the evaporation of refrigerant. Presence of dirt, rust or other particulate contamination is reported as ``fail.'' For details of this test method, refer to Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 700. 5.9␣Non-Condensables. 5.9.1␣ Sample. A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerants. The solubility of air in the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders. 5.9.2␣ Method. The test method shall be gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 700. 5.9.3␣ Limit. The maximum level of non-condensables in the vapor phase of a refrigerant in a container shall not exceed 1.5% by volume (see table 1 and 1a). 5.10␣Impurities, including Other Refrigerants. 5.10.1␣ Method. The amount of other impurities including other refrigerants in the subject refrigerant shall be determined by gas chromatography as described in Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 700. 5.10.2␣ Limit. The subject refrigerant shall not contain more than 0.50% by weight of impurities including other refrigerants (see table 1 and 1a). Section 6.␣Reporting Procedure 6.1␣ Reporting Procedure. The source (manufacturer, reclaimer or repackager) of the packaged refrigerant shall be identified. The refrigerant shall be identified by its accepted refrigerant number and/or its chemical name. Maximum permissible levels of contaminants are shown in table 1. Test results shall be tabulated in a like manner.
