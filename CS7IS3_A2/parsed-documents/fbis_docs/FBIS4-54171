This is a feeble entreaty and complaint of the pitiful colonial puppet utterly forsaken by history and the people. The traitor Kim Yong-sam is very jealous of the North sitting at a negotiating table with the United States and feels very uneasy and nervous over it. The traitor most dependent on outside, flunkeyist and treacherous among the successive rulers of South Korea, is trying to squeeze himself into DPRK-U.S. negotiations without any power and capacity, and is obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks. In urging the North not to deal only with the United States, he was motivated by the sinister political purpose of putting a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks. The traitor driveled about the North-South dialogue this time. But the puppet has no elementary qualification and face to talk about the dialogue. It is an intolerable mockery of dialogue for its very wrecker to cry for its "resumption". The ulterior intention of the puppets is to create difficulties again to foil the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and proceed with the moves to stifle the DPRK in league with international reactionaries. If the tense situation is to be eased in Korea and a correct way of settling the question be found today, the United States must change its hostile policy against the DPRK and such flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from power in South Korea.
