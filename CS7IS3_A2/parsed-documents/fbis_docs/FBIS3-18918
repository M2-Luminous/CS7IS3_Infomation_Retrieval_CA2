France first and foremost, speaking through Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, had urged in favour of increasing the number of blue helmets in Bosnia. The French view is that reinforcements should be provided by the Twelve but also by the United States. Speaking to the press, Mr. Papoulias, however, refused to say whether any of the other EC countries have so far stated their willingness to actively participate in this further effort considered necessary. Mr. Juppe, for his part, pointed out that France (which already has the largest contingent of blue helmets) had "done its duty." The French Minister, moreover, launched an appeal to his European partners to reintegrate the Serbs into the peace process. "Peace will not be achieved with two parties when there are three in the conflict," he said speaking of the recent agreement reached between Croats and Muslims on the creation of a two-sided federation in Bosnia. The Twelve also stressed the growing importance of the role henceforth played by the United States and Russia in bringing peace to Bosnia while recalling that the European Union could not see itself reduced to an "inferior role" as Mr. Papoulias had stated, before going on to say that the EC is "interested" in strengthened diplomatic activity by the United States and Russia in the peace process, "but it still wishes to keep to its peace plan."
