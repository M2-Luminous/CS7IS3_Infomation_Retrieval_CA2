FBIS4-5652 "dreas071_a_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Firms Quit European Microwave Oven Market Firms Quit European Microwave Oven Market OW1204014494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0120 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204014494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. have pulled out of the European microwave oven market due to sluggish demand and will focus on the audiovisual equipment market there, spokesmen for the companies said Tuesday [12 April]. A spokesman for Hitachi said the company's British subsidiary stopped production of microwave ovens last fall and has wiped out inventories by late March. Hitachi Consumer Products UK Ltd. began production of microwave ovens in 1987 for sale in Britain and its output peaked in 1988 at 100,000 units but fell to 10,000 in 1993, the spokesman said. The subsidiary's main products are television sets and videocassette recorders and it will concentrate on these, he said. Sales of microwave ovens account for less than 10 percent of total sales of the British subsidiary, the spokesman said. A spokesman for Toshiba said the company in February sold its equity stake of some 33 percent in a microwave oven joint venture in France to its joint venture partners, AEG Hausgerate AG of Germany and TEM Electromenager of Italy. The spokesman cited sluggish sales of microwave ovens and a company strategy in Europe of focusing on the audiovisual equipment market as factors behind the move. The French joint venture, Compagnie Europeenne Pour La Fabrication D'Enceintes a Micro-Onde (CEFEM), was established in January 1986 under equal equity partnership by Toshiba and the two other companies. CEFEM's production peaked in 1988 at some 220,000 units, but had plunged to some 100,000 by 1993 due to increased competition, the spokesman said.
