FBIS3-31406 "dreeu033__a94032" FBIS-EEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Election Proposals Contrasted AU1602174294 Prague CTK in English 1657 GMT 16 Feb 94 AU1602174294 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The basic difference between the government and deputies' bills on early elections lies in the date of the elections. While the government proposes to hold early elections in June, the deputies' bill envisages them on November 11-12. Both proposals will be discussed today. The government bill proposes that parliament electoral term and the mandates of deputies elected to the now-defunct Czechoslovak Federal Parliament two years ago terminate by June 30. It justifies shortening the electoral term and calling early elections by the fact that the current distribution of forces in parliament does not allow laws to be passed, as both the government coalition and the opposition have about 75 mandates in the 150-member parliament. According to the bill, early elections would cost about 150 million crowns ($5 million). If parliamentary elections are held simultaneously with local elections the total expenditure would amount to 180 million crowns (some $6 million). About 100 million crowns would be saved if parliamentary and local elections were prepared together, according to the government bill. If the two strongest parliamentary parties -- the governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Democratic Left Party (SDL) -- failed to agree on the date for early elections and if the deputies' proposal was supported by the opposition and the government bill by representatives of the coalition (HZDS and part of the Slovak National Party, SNS) then nine votes of the "fresh dissidents" from the ranks of the HZDS could prove decisive. Speculation has also appeared that deputies from the Hungarian minority parties -- the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles (Coexistence) movement -- could support the government proposal since they are sure of support from their voters irrespective of the current political situation in the country.
