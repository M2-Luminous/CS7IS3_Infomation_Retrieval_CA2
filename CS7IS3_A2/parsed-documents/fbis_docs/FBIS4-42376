The Flemish christian democrats feel that the Maastricht Treaty is just an intermediate step. They want to go much further, because they feel that attacking unemployment, reviving the economy, making the environment healthy, and guaranteeing peace and security can only be achieved within the framework of the European Union (EU). The party's aim is not a free trade zone, but a democratic, federal, and political union with a bigger role for the European Parliament (EP). The EP must be put on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers, which must be expanded to include a second chamber. All this must be enshrined in a European constitution. In order to achieve a strong economy, the CVP wants Europe to forge an Economic and Monetary Union, with a common currency. In order to stimulate employment, the CVP advocates the reduction of labor costs and the implementation of the white paper. A powerful social policy must be followed. The social and fiscal systems of the member states must be better geared toward each other. The economy must work in an ecologically responsible manner. Moreover, the CVP wants a powerful foreign and security policy, a European approach to organized crime and drug trafficking, and a harmonized refugee policy. The CVP feels that it is more important to deepen the EU than enlarge it. [passage omitted] Socialist Party (SP): As far as Europe goes, the SP is opting for the lesser evil. The SP accepted the Maastricht Treaty since it preferred an all too liberal Europe to the threat of a nationalistic Europe. According to the social democrats, the Maastricht Treaty contains a lot more, however, than a stringent reorganization of government finances. They say that "more Europe" is needed to make unemployment fall, to close all the tax loopholes, to halt cross-border pollution and crime, and to make provisions for refugees. The SP also advocates "another" Europe: A tolerant, democratic, and federal union based on a strong EP and smoothly working European social consultation process. More attention must be paid to the redistribution of labor. This recovery plan must also be corrected in social and ecological terms. Labor must be taxed less and environmental pollution taxed more. Social exclusion and social dumping must be combatted fiercely. The SP also advocates a radical approach to fraud and more fiscal justice. At a time when the European governments are reorganizing with a view to the creation of a Monetary Union, income from capital should be regulated at European level. In addition, the SP wants an active foreign and security policy. The SP feels that the EU enlargement must go hand in hand with further deepening. Flemish Bloc (VB): The VB wants to have "great virtue" in Europe. The "pervasive meddlesomeness" and the "pressure for harmonization" of the European bureaucracy must be driven back. The broadening of the EU's powers, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, including in the areas of education and culture, must be reduced, and the EP may not receive any additional powers. The VB has adopted an anti-European stance. Instead of giving priority to economic and monetary affairs, Europe must put the emphasis on the "cultural character" of its peoples. The party, which says it favors more political respectability, wants to send "non-European guest workers back to their country of origin." Stringent measures must be taken to combat crime and drug-related crime in a Europe without internal borders. Only an independent Flanders, which should receive 15 seats in the EP, can defend Flemish interests in Europe. In order to counteract the spread of French language versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, the European institutions must disappear from the Flemish capital. Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD): For the VLD, the European elections are mainly a test case for the policy of the Belgian Government of Christian-Democrats and Socialists, who are also pulling the strings in Europe. According to the VLD, national governments should no longer hide behind Europe when enforcing unpopular measures, and Europe should be taken out of the hands of labor unions, lobbies, and pressure groups. The Flemish liberals advocate an overt administration within a federal and democratic Europe. The party wants the citizens to become more actively involved in Europe. Citizens should be given the opportunity to have their say about the policy through referendums, and to elect the leader of a European government directly. The EP should get constitutional powers, and be on a par with the European Council of Ministers. Its members should give up jobs which threaten their impartiality. The VLD wants our country to meet the Maastricht criteria, so that it can join the Monetary Union from the very outset, at the latest in 1999. In the economic field, Europe should safeguard fair competition. Economic support measures and subsidies should be done away with, even in the agricultural sector. The tax burden should be reduced. Social dumping and inequality between regions should be leveled out by providing direct support to the social security systems of member states which have underdeveloped regions. The VLD warns against the danger of the European Union (EU) being reduced to a free trade area as a result of its expansion. The VLD also urges for a European foreign, security, and defense policy, and for a European approach to environmental problems, crime, and migration. Once a year, the EU should determine how many foreigners it will admit on economic grounds. The People's Union (VU): The VU advocates a Europe in which regions and national communities can preserve their own identities. The member states' influence should be curtailed to achieve a transparent, democratic, and federal Europe. That is why the party favors a direct representation of Flanders and Wallonia in the Council of Ministers. For the VU, the Regional Committee is a prefiguration of a senate of regions and peoples, which should replace the present Council of Ministers and carry out the constitutional work along with the EP. The completion of the unified market must not be at the expense of the environment. A European social policy is urgently required, and the gap between poor and rich regions should be narrowed. According to the VU, the white paper does not go far enough. Lower taxes on labor and the reduction of working hours are indispensable for more employment. Furthermore, the EU should conduct an active peace policy, and action should be taken to counteract the spread of French language versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, and against the pressure on the real estate market as a result of the presence of European institutions.
