By means of the UN peacemaking forces, and under the thesis of Georgia's territorial integrity, Shevardnadze attempts to provide this integrity de-facto". This was the comment given to SNARK correspondent in Moscow by Zurab Achba, the Chairman of Legislation Committee in Abkhazian Parliament, while he spoke on the Georgian head visit to the USA. As Achba told, the Abkhazian leadership does not mind the presence of the UN peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. "We only object those functions which they are intended to be given. Peace forces are entitled to prevent the military actions, and should be dislocated along the confrontation line, not on the entire territory of Abkhazia", declared Achba.
