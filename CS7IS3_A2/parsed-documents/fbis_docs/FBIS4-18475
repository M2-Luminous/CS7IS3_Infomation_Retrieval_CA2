Yun, the DPRK deputy head of mission in Vienna, conducts his country's negotiations with the IAEA. He rejects accusations that his country has not met its obligations toward the IAEA. "The latest dispute with the IAEA centers around the radio chemical laboratory, a dispute we had a year ago. At that time, the IAEA test results differed from ours. This technical problem has to be solved. Then they can take new samples. "Since the installation is sealed, it is clear that it cannot have been in operation since it was last inspected." [Voykowitsch] In this case, taking samples would be harmless. [Yun] There is no reason for this, just as there is no reason for the special inspections demanded by the IAEA because of satellite photographs from the United States. The inspection agreement prohibits such photos. [Voykowitsch] The agreement does not even mention them. [Yun] Since the United States is hostile toward us, we cannot accept inspections based on such photos. We have presented all information on our nuclear installations to the IAEA. Now they are citing photographs and intelligence reports saying that North Korea has unregistered nuclear installations. [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that the two mysterious installations in Yongbyon.... [Yun] They are military installations. [Voykowitsch] What makes the United States say that Pyongyang already has two atomic bombs? [Yun] That is not true. We have stressed again and again that we do not have the capacity, nor the intention, nor the necessity for this. [Voykowitsch] How far has your nuclear program got? The United States says that your country has weapons-grade plutonium. [Yun] Our program is for electricity supply. [Voykowitsch] You do not produce any plutonium for military purposes? [Yun] Not yet. [Voykowitsch] Not yet? [Yun] No, no. The radio chemical laboratory studies reprocessing. And once, in 1989, we had an experiment with old fuel rods. [Voykowitsch] You produced plutonium? [Yun] Less than 100 grams. But we have not produced anything since then. We were only testing whether production is going all right. The installation is not finished yet. [Voykowitsch] Will it produce plutonium? [Yun] No. [Voykowitsch] If nothing unusual is going on, why then would you not let your installations be inspected? Why are you threatening war? [Yun] It is the U.S. aim to suffocate North Korea. What would your reaction be if someone tried to kill you? ...Self defense. [Voykowitsch] Suffocate? How can an isolated country such as North Korea be suffocated? [Yun] What do you mean by isolated? We have the necessary foreign relations, but our philosophy is self-sufficiency. [Voykowitsch] How could your relationship with the IAEA and the United States be normalized? [Yun] Pyongyang is always in favor of talking. Pressure only does harm.
