The communique states that the rebels will engage in dialogue with the government with the mediation of Guatemalan indigenous leader Rigoberta Menchu, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who has worked on behalf of indigenous peoples, and Julio Scherer, director of the weekly PROCESO, "whom they have never been able to silence." The document was faxed by the "Clandestine Committee of the Struggling Indigenous Peoples of the EZLN" and states that the decision to begin a written public dialogue with the government "does not imply a surrender." "We believe that these three personalities, renowned in Mexican society, could serve as guarantors of the truth and witnesses that the writings are really those of the EZLN. We would ask them to render their good offices in search of the peace and welfare of our struggling people," the note states. The alleged EZLN members, who took up arms on 1 January in the southern state of Chiapas, have asked Menchu, Ruiz, and Scherer to publicly respond to their appeal. The EZLN states that if they receive a positive response, they will ask the three individuals "to mediate the dialogue between the poor, struggling people and their hangmen." They also invite the three persons to visit the EZLN General Command in Lacandona jungle in Chiapas, "where they will always be well received and protected, to receive our document of proposals." The communique notes that the first phase of the struggle "has been carried out," although it does not state what phases will follow the armed struggle that seeks to change the government in the country. "We do not have enough quality weapons to defend ourselves without starving. We have only sticks and cunning to face the enemy," the rebels state, appealing to the Mexican people to join their movement.
