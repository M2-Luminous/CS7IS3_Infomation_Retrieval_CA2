The conference also intends to seek the way in which we all, in a responsible and civilized manner, with respect and mutual understanding, can discuss common issues henceforth, the minister told the evening television newscast, upon arriving from a successful tour of several South American countries. According to the foreign relations minister, for a long time the emigre community has been used as an instrument against Cuba. As the reality of Cuban residents abroad is expressed differently and as the reality of the country changes, steps are taken as a result of a new situation, demonstrating the audacity of our project and the country convoking it, Robaina added. The foreign minister said conditions continue to be as abnormal as before; therefore, it cannot be asked that ties with emigrants be normal. Once more Cuba, rising above these circumstances, is capable of finding a solution and its own subject in these times, Robaina asserted. Some 200 guests from over 40 countries will participate, on their own behalf, in the meeting that will run from next Friday to Sunday in this capital.
