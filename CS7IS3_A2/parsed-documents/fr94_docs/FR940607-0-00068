FR940607-0-00068 FR940607-0-00017 If a subsequent transaction that includes the advancement of additional funds does not result in the level of collateral protection being threatened, despite a change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the property, a Title XI appraisal need not be obtained. For example, a loan originally extended with a low loan-to-value ratio could be renewed and additional funds advanced above closing costs without a Title XI appraisal, even though market conditions have deteriorated, if the regulated institution, after verifying the value of the collateral, concludes that the new loan-to-value ratio will provide adequate protection. Similarly, if a borrower is refinancing a loan where the real estate collateral is located in a market that has experienced significant appreciation, the institution should ensure that the advancement of any new monies is based on substantiated appreciation in value. An institution can advance funds against an appreciated property whose future use is consistent with the use described in the original appraisal. If an institution makes a substantial advance that could possibly threaten the institution's collateral protection, it should consider the need to obtain a new Title XI appraisal. This exemption would not be available if a material change in the use of the property produces the reported appreciation, such as when property is rezoned for a different use. While a Title XI appraisal is not required for transactions that qualify for this exemption, regulated institutions are required to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the collateral in accordance with the agencies' guidelines. The level of analysis and information included in the evaluation should be more detailed as the institution's exposure in the transaction increases. Several commenters raised questions about the applicability of this exemption to loan restructurings and workouts. In such situations, the commenters contended that requiring a Title XI appraisal may impede an institution's ability to obtain additional real estate collateral to shore-up its position or to advance new funds to protect its existing collateral position. The agencies acknowledge that the time and cost of obtaining a Title XI appraisal may present barriers to institutions in their negotiations with borrowers in a loan restructuring or workout. The agencies believe that this situation has been addressed in the regulation and the agencies' guidance, such as the November 7, 1991 Interagency Policy Statement on the Review and Classification of Commercial Real Estate Loans. It is the agencies' policy to encourage lenders to work constructively with their borrowers when restructuring existing loans that have credible support for repayment. (8) Transactions Involving Real Estate Notes The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions involving real estate-secured loans, loan participations, pooled loans, interests in real property, and mortgage-backed securities. The amendment clarifies when regulated institutions may engage in secondary mortgage market transactions involving real estate loans and other interests in real estate without obtaining a new Title XI appraisal. The exemption adopted by the agencies clarifies and allows regulated institutions to purchase, sell, invest in, exchange, or extend credit secured by, real estate-secured notes or interests in real estate without obtaining a new Title XI appraisal if each note or real estate interest is supported by an appraisal that met the regulatory appraisal requirements for the institution at the time the real estate-secured note was originated. The prior exemption referred to purchases of these interests only. In addition, the agencies have changed the text of the final rule to more clearly state the appraisal requirements that the underlying notes must meet. The exemption serves federal public policy interests by helping to ensure that the appraisal regulation does not unnecessarily inhibit secondary mortgage market transactions that involve these real estate-secured loans and real estate interests. The exemption makes clear that a regulated institution need not obtain new Title XI appraisals for loans originated before the effective date of the agencies' regulations in order to buy or sell them in the secondary mortgage market. The agencies have concluded that the transactions exempted by this provision do not require new Title XI appraisals to protect federal financial and public policy interests or the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Principles of safe and sound banking practice require regulated institutions to determine the suitability of purchasing or investing in existing real estate-secured loans and real estate interests. Typically, these transactions will have a history of performance or will have been originated according to secondary mortgage market standards. The additional information from these sources, when coupled with the original documentation, permits regulated institutions to make appropriate decisions regarding these transactions. Some commenters stated that this exemption raised safety and soundness concerns because exempt transactions may have appraisals performed before Title XI appraisal requirements went into effect. Because regulated institutions will have other sources of information about the performance of these seasoned loans, the agencies believe that new Title XI appraisals are not necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of these exempt transactions. Some commenters urged the agencies to expand the proposed exemption, or adopt new exemptions, to eliminate the Title XI appraisal requirement for all mortgage-backed securities. In addition, commenters suggested that the agencies exempt residential mortgage warehousing loans (loans to residential mortgage lenders who ultimately sell the mortgages to the secondary mortgage market), transactions with credit ratings by established rating agencies, or transactions that were not subject to the agencies' jurisdiction at origination. The agencies believe that to protect federal financial and public policy interests, the underlying loans or real estate interests should have appraisals that meet the requirements that were applicable to regulated institutions when the underlying transactions were originated. For this reason, the agencies are not adopting the suggestions for exempting additional categories of transactions under this provision.
