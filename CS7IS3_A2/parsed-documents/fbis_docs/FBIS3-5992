The radical group had the world's reluctant backing and while Bangkok was aware of the Mao-inspired madness that had gripped Cambodia over the previous three years, the decision to help the group was justifiable in the service of Thailand's national interest. [passage omitted] The Khmer Rouge which boycotted the election continues to wage war against the internationally-recognized government in Phnom Penh and most of the world still believes they are receiving support from venal Thai generals. [passage omitted] Part of Thailand's image problem stems from the way the international press covered the Cambodian election. While the Khmer Rouge were belligerent and uncooperative, refusing to take part in the election, massacring ethnic Vietnamese and holding UN officials hostage, they were for the most part a sideshow. The real story was the murderous war the Cambodian People's Party was waging against Funcinpec. Nevertheless, foreign audiences, who for the most part had been introduced to the Cambodia tragedy by the 1984 movie "The Killing Fields", seemed to only want to know about the Khmer Rouge. The result was acutely embarrassing for Thailand. The military's support for the Khmer Rouge, which had been an open secret in Southeast Asia for more than 10 years, was dredged up and examined for international consumption. The close business links, the Khmer Rouge safe houses, border sanctuaries, the rapacious logging and gem mining operations, it all came out and did little to support Thai claims that it was working for peace in Cambodia. [passage omitted] The issue was rekindled once again on Wednesday when U.S. Ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson bluntly said Washington wants "the Khmer Rouge to be cut off." The envoy noted that the policy of the Thai government was very clear but, citing the massive arms cache found near the border in December, said the "implementation of that policy has been less than clear" Lambertson's comments provoked furious denials from the Foreign Ministry but it seems unlikely the noises coming out of Bangkok are going to alter the world's perception of its relationship with the Khmer Rouge -- at least as long as well-founded reports continue to come out of Cambodia of cross border incursions. In the coming days, many observers expect the Cambodian army to launch a fierce assault on the Khmer Rouge's main base at Pailin, which sits across the Thai border. The timber and gem-rich district is the main commercial center for the rebels. And for many observers it also typifies the uncomfortably cosy relationship between Thai businessmen, the Khmer Rouge and Thai military officers who oversee the border area. Army chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit has vowed to repulse any Khmer Rouge intrusions that result from the offensive if the government gives its approval. His approach is the correct one. While it is not a Thai fight, the Khmer Rouge have served their purpose as far as Thailand is concerned. They refuse to discuss peace and their presence along the border has resulted in the death and maiming of Thai villagers. Thailand helped revive the Khmer Rouge once, this time they should be allowed to perish if that is to be the order of things in Cambodia.
