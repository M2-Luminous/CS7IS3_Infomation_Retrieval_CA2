Parliament today approved the Air Corporations Bill to convert Air India and Indian Airlines into public limited companies, with the Rajya Sabha passing the measure by 63 to 29 votes in a division amidst a noisy protest by the Opposition members. The Opposition members, especially from the left parties, took exception to the absence of the Civil Aviation Minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was to have replied to the discussion. The reply was given by the Surface Transport Minister, Mr. Jagdish Tytler. Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta (CPI) (Communist Party of India) and Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist), who raised points of order in this connection, were told by Mr. V. Narayanasamy, who was in the Chair, that Mr. Azad had sought permission from the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, for leave of absence and for allowing Mr. Tytler to move the Bill on his behalf. The permission to both had been granted to him by the Chairman, he told the members. The Opposition members insisted that the consideration and passage of the Bill be put to division which showed 63 `ayes' and 29 `noes.' The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) members did not participate in the voting process, though one of them, Mr. Maheshwar Singh, moved a resolution disapproving of the ordinance promulgated on January 29. Earlier, participating in the discussion, members expressed concern at the "unequal competition" between private airlines and Air India and Indian Airlines. They also urged the Government to take steps to stop serving of liquor by private domestic airlines. Some members said the Government was changing its course midway without planning and the mixed economy was being given a go by in the name of privatisation. -- PTI
