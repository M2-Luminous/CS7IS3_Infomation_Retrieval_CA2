FR941107-2-00137 FR941107-2-00081 [Docket No. 50&hyph;277 and 50&hyph;278] Philadelphia Electric Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed no Significant Hazards Consideration, Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania. The proposed amendment would clarify the minimum reactor steam pressure required for Surveillance Requirement 4.5C.1(e). The revised Surveillance Requirement will require the licensee to verify that the High Pressure Coolant Injection pump, with reactor pressure less than or equal to 175 psig. develop a flow rate of greater than or equal to 5000 gpm against a system head corresponding to reactor pressure. The current Surveillance Requirement specifies that the test be performed at 150 psig but does not provide a range of acceptable pressures. This Technical Specifications (TS) change request (CR) is requested to be processed as an exigent TS change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6). Exigent processing is being requested because the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS) TS low pressure HPCI system testing requirements are ambiguous, and the licensee desires to accelerate the resolution of this ambiguity. The low pressure surveillance requirement (TS 4.5.C.1.e) requires that the test be performed at 150 psig. Prior to October 21, 1994, this 150 psig value was interpreted as a nominal value. During recent inspection activities surrounding the startup of PBAPS Unit 2 from refueling outage 2R010, the NRC revised a previous position and determined that this value could not be interpreted as a nominal value. The licensee could not have foreseen this event because they were conducting station activities in accordance with NRC guidance. During the 1990 Safety System Functional Inspection (SSFI, Combined Inspection Report 90&hyph;200), the issue of the HPCI low pressure surveillance testing being performed at a nominal value was reviewed (Open item 90&hyph;200&hyph;12). In response to the SSFI open item, the licensee revised an existing Plant Operations Review Committee position, to document that the 150 psig was a nominal value, and committed to revising the TS to clarify the low pressure requirement. This commitment was incorporated into the licensee's September 29, 1994 improved Technical Specifications (ITS) submittal. The NRC accepted this position and closed the SSFI open item (Combined Inspection Report 50&hyph;277/90&hyph;80, 50&hyph;278/90&hyph;80, dated November 9, 1990). The anticipated effective date of the ITS is the fourth quarter of 1995. Because of the recently revised NRC position regarding TS 4.5.C.1(e), the licensee is pursuing the attached TSCR in advance of the overall conversion to the ITS, and requests that it be processed on an exigent basis. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
