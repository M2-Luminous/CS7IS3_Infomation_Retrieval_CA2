"Overseas listing will become one of the main vehicles for China to attract foreign capital in the years to come," said Nie Weiping, deputy director of the Overseas Department under the China Securities Regulatory Committee, the country's top securities administrative body, at a symposium on public relations for China's overseas listings. He said that investors from the developed countries have begun to actively participate in trading Chinese or China-related equities after years of watching and pondering. "Their enthusiasm is a great help to us in entering the international capital market," said Nie, adding that the securities authorities are seriously considering expanding Chinese firms' presence on the world financial market to seek more foreign investment via such means as launching China funds as well as issuing convertible bonds. The significance of overseas listing, however, lies in accelerating the process of enterprise reform which aims to enhance productivity and make these firms consistently profitable. According to Nie, the seven Chinese firms already listed on the Hong Kong market have all reported remarkable improvements in management and economic efficiency. They have expanded production as they used the funds raised through stock issues to purchase advanced technology and equipment. The fund raised by the seven firms totals an estimated 10.5 billion H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars. And the yearly profits of these firms have all exceeded the projected figures in their statements for public stock offering, said Nie. The symposium, co-sponsored by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, features presentations on listing mechanisms and public relations support for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and European investor roadshows and discussions on ADRS [expansion unknown]. Experts from major world banks, investment corporations, auditing firms and public relations companies will have detailed exchanges with the 40-odd Chinese firms seeking overseas listings.
