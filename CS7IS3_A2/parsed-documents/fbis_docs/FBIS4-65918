The conference, opened by UNESCO director general Federico Mayor at the organisation's headquarters here, is the brainchild of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. It will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be signed by the end of the year for potential new candidates to the European Union (EU). Russia is respresented at the conference by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the United States by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said the summit aims to settle border and minority problems between "countries with the vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
