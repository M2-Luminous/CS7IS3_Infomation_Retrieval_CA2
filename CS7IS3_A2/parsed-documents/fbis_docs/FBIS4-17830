This is connected with the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which has analyzed the operation of the Chernobyl AES. Participants in an IAEA session discussed the Chernobyl AES on 22 April in Vienna. Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shamarov, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, spoke on the results of this representative meeting with a group of journalists. The most important result of the IAEA meeting, he stressed, was the opportunity to once again show that our young state is left virtually at the mercy of fate in dealing with the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Given all its economic difficulties, Ukraine has to earmark 14 percent of its budget to handle the consequences of the catastrophe. At the same time, we receive only humanitarian assistance from Western states. It is necessary to urgently resolve the issues of erecting a new shell over the unreliable Chernobyl sarcophagus. The cost of the project is estimated at $500 million. This issue is much more acute than all the discussions of the technical condition of the RBMK-type reactor, which was one of the reasons for the initial Chernobyl explosion. Analysis indicates that, regardless of all technical blunders, these reactors can be modernized. Sometimes, emotions make us forget that Ukraine has three such reactors and Russia -- 11. Ukrainian representatives also voiced their viewpoints on the power engineering system, which has no efficient substitute in the foreseeable future. The modernization of the entire energy network in Ukraine was also discussed. As a rule, IAEA decisions are only of technical value, however, they will certainly have an impact on the positions of (?leading) Western states during the next high-level meeting of their leaders.
