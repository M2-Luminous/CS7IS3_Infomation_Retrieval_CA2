The report was aimed at prompting people to consider this question: What should we do, as we too are masters? Li Guangnan was born to a peasant family of the Korean nationality at the foot of the Changbai Mountains. From the parent generation's bitter experience of being enslaved by the Japanese invaders and from modern China's experience of being bullied, humiliated, and carved up by foreign powers, Li Guangnan -- while still a student -- began to have patriotic thoughts and to aspire to render service to his motherland. After growing up and joining the armed forces, his patriotic consciousness was further enhanced, and he acquired a stronger sense of responsibility as a master. He often said: The Army is ours, and the country is ours; if we do not build them up and love them, who will do this? Such love for the motherland added inexhaustible wisdom and strength to Li Guangnan in rendering service to the motherland. He is an ordinary member of the ground crew in the air force, and has received only junior secondary education, but he never feels that he bears no responsibility for the motherland because of his humble position. He is deeply concerned about the destiny of the nation and has a strong sense of urgency for the times while working hard and selflessly at his own post and performing first-rate work for China's regeneration. Li Guangnan is a respectable and laudable master. To learn from Li Guangnan, we should behave like him in making painstaking efforts to study modern science and technology, and to master the skills needed for rendering service to the motherland. Like him, we should work selflessly at our own posts, thus turning our patriotic enthusiasm and aspirations for rendering service to the motherland into concrete action. Of course, the most important point is that, like Li Guangnan, we should love our socialist motherland. This is the ideological base for establishing the master spirit and increasing the sense of responsibility as a master. The party central leadership has pointed out that the ideology of patriotism, socialism, and collectivism should be the main theme in our society as a whole. Singing the main theme loudly and carrying forward patriotism are of great significance for boosting our national morale, increasing our nation's rallying force, deepening reform, expanding opening, and promoting the vigorous development of our work in all fields. At present, the reform in our country is developing in depth. Beyond any doubt, the patriotic spirit of the master should be reflected in the great practice of participating in the reform. We must give top priority to the overall interests of the reform; correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual; consciously resist the influence of money worship, hedonism, and extreme egoism. We should share the concern of the whole nation and meet the urgent needs of the whole nation as masters, and should understand the difficulties the reform faces and join hands in overcoming such difficulties by offering constructive suggestions and making positive efforts. In short, we should take reform as our own duty; only thus can we be worthy of the glorious title of the state's masters.
