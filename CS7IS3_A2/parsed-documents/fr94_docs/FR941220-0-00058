FR941220-0-00058 FR941220-0-00010 Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal involvement is expected to include the Environmental Protection Agency through the Clean Water Act's provisions for pesticide registration and waste management actions. The Corps of Engineers will consider these species in project planning and operation, and during the permit review process. The Federal Highway Administration will consider impacts of federally funded bridge and road construction projects when known habitat may be impacted. Continuing urban development within the Etowah River system may involve the Farmers Home Administration and their loan programs. The Soil Conservation Service will consider the species during project planning and under their farmer's assistance programs. The Forest Service will consider downstream impacts to habitat of the Etowah darter when planning or implementing silvicultural, recreational, or other programs in the headwaters of Amicalola Creek and the extreme upper portion of the Etowah River mainstem occurring in the Chattahoochee National Forest. It has been the experience of the Service that nearly all Section 7 consultations can be resolved so that the species is protected and the project objectives are met. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for endangered species, and 17.21 and 17.31 for threatened species set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered and threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purpose of the Act. In some instances, permits may be issued for a specified time to relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. Since these species are not in trade, such permit requests are not expected. It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range. The Service is not aware of any otherwise lawful activities being conducted by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section 9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of the Service's Jacksonville Office (see ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed animals and general inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Regional Office, Ecological Services Division, Threatened and Endangered Species, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345&hyph;3301 (Telephone 404/679&hyph;7099, Facsimile 404/679&hyph;7081). National Environmental Policy Act The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited Bailey, R.M., and D.A. Etnier. 1988.
