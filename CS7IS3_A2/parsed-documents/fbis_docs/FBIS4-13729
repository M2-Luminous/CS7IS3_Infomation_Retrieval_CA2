These are surely positive signs but they also beg the question: Where do we go from here? Perhaps we must begin by formulating key strategic questions about national security and the nuclear issue and rethink some of the basic assumptions underlying theories of our national security. This should be done without in anyway suggesting that the GHQ [General Headquarters] (which identify threats to security and formulates a response) is not aware of the imperatives of such an exercise. Nor to throw odium on the generals as did the noted Indian columnist Khushwant Singh the other day in a newspaper interview "After all a vaila (idle) soldier with a gun in his hand has no sense of responsibility". A problem with the military mind set is to militarise the realities and perceive national security only in terms of the number of army divisions, air force squadrons and naval frigates and submarines. It rarely occurs to the brass that if such were the dynamics of national security then smaller nations would not have existed alongside larger neighbours. For generals, air marshals and admirals the response to challenges of national security is gun for a gun, bullet for a bullet, bomber for a bomber and submarine for a submarine forgetting other vital elements of state power such as human development, social cohesion, national integration and people's participation in the shaping of their destinies. Did the Soviet Union not disintegrate because of its criminal neglect of the social and human dimensions of survival and development? Related to it is another characteristic peculiar to the military mind. A former three star general confided with this scribe the other day, "we in the army know only how to spend, not how to earn. Wherefrom the money comes, he said, is the concern of some Sartaj Aziz or a Mahboobul Haq or a Jaffarey. Beg, borrow or steal but give us money for weapons. This is the military's logic. That is why the caretaker prime minister Moin Qureshi -- a crusadar of human and social development -- once said during his brief stint what lengthy discourses would not be able to convey. "Curtailing military budget" he warned in Peshawar, "would amount to playing with fire". It was no idle warning. We must begin to ponder over a few strategic questions. Answers to these questions are essential to correct our bearings and chart out our future course in a vastly changed world when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, a superpower has disintegrated, economic rather than military prowess has become the determinant of inter state relations and with the end of the Cold War, the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation have come to the centre stage of international relations. Here are the eight basic and fundamental strategic questions: -- FIRST: Will our security be enhanced or undermined by open acquisition of nuclear weapons and brandishing them too as we have been doing in the past? Will our acquisition of nuclear weapons deter or provoke India to do likewise and in that event whose security would be more undermined -- India's or Pakistan's -- keeping in view India's vast scientific, technological and nuclear infrastructure and geographical advantages? -- SECOND: Is the overall cost of nuclear weapons development bearable for a country like Pakistan -- cost not simply in terms of fabricating a crude device but also in terms of constantly improving and upgrading it, building delivery systems apart from the intangible cost iof diplomatic and political isolation, lost opportunities of International cooperation in the development of nuclear power plants for power generation and the suspension of economic and military aid? -- THIRD: Can a weapon of ultimate resort like the nuclear weapon be used in any eventuality? Since World War II it has not been used. Former US president Nixon has recalled how on five different occasions he came close to deciding about using a nuclear weapon -- thrice over Vietnam -- but each time after debate and reconsideration, decided not to. Should a weapon which cannot be used be made at all and that too at such an exorbitant cost? -- FOURTH: Does the so called theory of deterrence still hold good or it needs reexamination. [sentence as published] The post Hiroshima history begs the question: what if a nation is not deterred? Vietnam was not deterred by the US. Afghanistan could not be deterred by the mighty nuclear arsenal of the USSR. And more recently, Iraq was not deterred by US nuclear weapons even though it was routed in the end by superior conventional military technology. Is there any sound basis for our presumption that in case of India, it will be deterred and not provoked by a nuclear Pakistan? -- FIFTH: Granted that India is our enemy, is immoral and wicked. But is India also so fanatic to expose itself to unacceptable damage by starting a nuclear war with Pakistan? -- SIXTH: "In the event of a first strike", claimed General Beg recently in Karachi, " India's conventional capability will be wiped out". Sounds pleasing to the ears. But what if India strikes first, or absorbs the first strike and retaliates? Will we be able to withstand it. -- SEVENTH: In spite of universal clamour for a complete ban on nuclear testing, Britain and France are reluctant because they still consider testing of a nuclear weapon essential for inducting it into the war machine as a reliable weapon. This is because a battlefield nuclear weapon is vastly different from a nuclear device (which may have more propaganda but little strategic value). Pakistan's alleged nuclear device remains untested. What if it turns out to be a dud and the bluff is called? -- EIGHTH: We seek to link the resolution of Kashmir with Pakistan's nuclear capability. But Kashmiris are now on their own, fighting their own battle of liberation. How can we take Kashmiris for granted in a nuclear bargain with the US? What if tomorrow the Kashmiris demand the third option of independence and reject the Pakistani price? These are only some of the strategic questions and answers which are unlikely to come for discussion behind closed doors in the GHQ or in the semi-lit corridors of the Foreign Office. Answer to them may be found by tearing apart the shroud of secretary around theories of national security and initiating an open public debate. When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the brass at the National Defence College last month the "problems of security and development need an integrated approach" she was only making an understatement because perhaps she too does not want to play with fire. It will be a pity if the nuclear roller coasters kept their eyes shut to the realities. They must remember that the stern dynamics of nations' survival and development seldom pause for pity.
