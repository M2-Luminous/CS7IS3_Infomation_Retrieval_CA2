FR940428-2-00116 FR940428-2-00053 Abnormal Occurrences for Fourth Quarter CY 1993 Dissemination of Information Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, requires NRC to disseminate information on abnormal occurrences (i.e., unscheduled incidents or events that the Commission determines are significant from the standpoint of public health and safety). During the fourth quarter of CY 1993, the following incidents at NRC licensees were determined to be abnormal occurrences (AOs) and are described below, together with the remedial actions taken. The events are also being included in NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 16, No. 4, (``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: October-December 1993''). This report will be available at NRC's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555 about three weeks after the publication date of this Federal Register notice. Other NRC Licensees (Industrial Radiographers, Medical Institutions, Industrial Users, etc.) 93&hyph;11‚ê£ Medical Branchytherapy Misadministration at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic dose that results in any part of the body receiving unscheduled radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence. Date and Place _January 7, 1993 and February 26, 1993; Washington University Medical School; St. Louis, Missouri. Nature and Probable Consequences _On January 7, 1993, a Nucletron Micro-Selectron low-dose-rate (LDR) remote afterloader unit ejected a radioactive source without being programmed to do so and without a guide tube and applicator attached to the channel. The unguided source lay at an approximate distance of 3 centimeters (cm) (1.2 inches [in] from the nearest skin surface for approximately 5 minutes. The licensee estimated that less than 0.1 centigray (cGy) (0.1 rad) of additional dose was delivered to the skin surface. On February 26, 1993, a very similar incident occurred at the same facility. The incident involved a different patient and the same remote afterloader unit. The device again ejected the same strength and type of radioactive source without being programmed to do so. However, in this case, the source lay near the patient's leg for approximately 60 to 75 minutes, at an approximate distance of 5 cm (2 in) from the nearest skin surface. The licensee estimated the additional dose to the patient's leg to be approximately 3.5 cGy (3.5 rad). In both cases, the treatment of each patient was completed on another LDR remote afterloader unit in another room of the medical center. Cause or Causes _After the first incident on January 7, 1993, a manufacturer service engineer, who studied the device malfunction, was unable to identify the cause of the failure during his repair visit. The licensee's staff subsequently tested the device for 20 hours without discovering the cause of the failure, and concluded that the device was acceptable for use. This decision was based on the fact that they could not reproduce the malfunction. The remote afterloader was put back into service. On February 26, 1993, the device failed again when a second unprogrammed source was ejected by the afterloader. After this incident, which resulted in the second misadministration, the manufacturer provided a different field engineer who correctly diagnosed the problem as a failure in an operational amplifier. A previous recommendation made by the manufacturer to store unused sources in the auxiliary storage safe, instead of the remote afterloader's mobile storage container, may have contributed to the incident. The second field engineer indicated that some of the safety features which prevent sources from being erroneously ejected were not in effect or were not monitored by the device for the unprogrammed channels containing the unused sources. Actions Taken To Prevent a Recurrence Licensee _The licensee informed the NRC that use of the two Micro-Selectron-LDR remote afterloader units will be discontinued and a new model LDR afterloader will be installed. NRC has also asked the licensee to address the manufacturer's recommendation for storing the sources and the removal of some of the safety features, and any resulting corrective actions. NRC _The vendor has now revised the device's operating software to monitor and generate error messages and audible alarms for unprogrammed (unused) channels. The NRC has sent a letter to the licensee identifying the two events as misadministrations and requesting that the licensee ensure the required notifications to the referring physicians and patients have been made. (Letter from Roy J. Caniano, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC Region III, to Robert J. Hickok, Assistant Vice President for Medical Affairs, Washington University Medical School, forwarding inspection reports No. 030&hyph;02271/93001, 030&hyph;31205/93001, 030&hyph;15101/93001, Docket No. 030/02271, 030&hyph;31205 and 030/15101, License No. 24&hyph;00167&hyph;11, dated January 12, 1994.) During an NRC safety inspection conducted from November 15 to 18, 1993, the inspectors focused on these two incidents in addition to other inspection areas. The results of this inspection are still under review.
