He told a news conference in Moscow on Friday that the same day part of the newspaper's staff had decided to continue cooperation with the Greek company Stilight Holdings Ltd., fire Linnik and replace him with acting editor Aleksandr Ilyin. Linnik said the majority of the staff did not recognize the decision, since most of those present at the meeting where it was taken were members of the Greek company. He said only 76 people of PRAVDA's staff of 233 had attended the meeting. "One may say a split has occurred within our staff," he said. Linnik said Stilight Holdings insisted that all rights to the newspaper be handed over to PRAVDA International, where the Greek company holds the controlling interest, 55 percent of shares. But the editorial board and most of the staff of PRAVDA wished the controlling interest in the paper to be owned by a Russian corporation, he said. Linnik said PRAVDA had already started talks to that end with one of the financial groups. As the first step, the PRAVDA staff, late in December, decided to make the paper a public-stock company called the PRAVDA Concern. He said Stilight Holdings had been dissatisfied with it, appealing to court against the decision of the PRAVDA staff to reregister the paper and organizing Friday's staff meeting.
