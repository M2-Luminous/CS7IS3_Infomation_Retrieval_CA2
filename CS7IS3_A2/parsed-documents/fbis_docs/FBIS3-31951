At 1100 (1700 GMT) there has been scarce voter turnout, and the election centers are half empty, although the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) trusts "voter affluence will increase later." It was confirmed in a downtown polling station that the number of voters was not over 15 percent four hours after the polling station opened. In addition, Carolina de Reobordelo, president of the Electoral Board of Quezaltenango, the second largest city, has told reporters voter turnout has not even reached 10 percent, but she said "it will increase after mass." Other interior reports note that voter turnout has been less than in previous elections, making it appear that voter abstentionism might exceed 60 percent. The National Police has reported the explosion of "a small propaganda bomb" but did not report where or who was responsible. A police spokesperson has said that despite this incident, the referendum is being held normally and under strict security. The polling stations will close at 1800 (0000 GMT), and preliminary returns will be known a few hours later. It is expected that the final result of the referendum will be known before midnight.
