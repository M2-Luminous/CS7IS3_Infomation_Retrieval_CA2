FBIS4-982 "drafr075_d_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Government Troops Said `Enjoying Clear Upper Hand' Government Troops Said `Enjoying Clear Upper Hand' MB1804212094 London BBC World Service in Portuguese 2030 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804212094 London BBC World Service Portuguese BFN [From the "London Last Minute" program] [Text] [Words indistinct] in the direction of the principal positions occupied by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in oil-rich Soyo District, in northern Zaire Province. As expectable in a climate of war, the rebel sources have not shown any signs that their forces have been withdrawing from positions they have held in northern Angola. Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, reports: Independent observers in the Angolan capital are increasingly convinced that a qualitative change in the correlation of forces is occurring on the battlefield and that the government forces are enjoying a clear upper hand. [Words indistinct] confirming these unofficial reports doing the rounds among Luanda-based international journalists. The government is said to be placing the UNITA forces in northern under unprecedented military pressure and to be making some noteworthy advances concerning the implementation of its strategy which, curiously, carries the official name of active defense. Angolan media reports that last week the UNITA forces in Soyo were reinforced with 2,000 special forces from Zaire, including Zairian and Angolan soldiers, in addition to other reports, can only confirm that increasingly fierce clashes are under way between the two sides and that they are using all available conventional war weapons, including the navy and the air force. In fact, various sources in Luanda said today that, when it comes to the evolution of the military situation in this country, the great novelty is likely to come precisely from oil-rich Soyo area. Other reasonably reliable sources have reported that the government forces are increasing their military pressure on neighboring Uige Province, notably around the provincial capital and strategic Negage Air Base, some 30 km from the city of Uige. Clashes for the more easterly area of Cafunfo, in diamond-rich Lunda Norte Province, also seem to providing the government with successes. However, today we received reports that UNITA launched a successful counterattack that is said to have alleviated the intense pressure the government forces had been applying on the area. However, UNITA official sources have accused the government of using South African mercenaries in Lunda Norte Province and other areas. They have already reported the deaths of more than 12 South African mercenaries, and this appears to be confirmed by the letter that -- we have learned from diplomatic sources -- the South African representative in the Angolan capital has just sent to the Angolan Foreign Affairs Ministry asking for information concerning the whereabouts of at least seven South African citizens whose families believe they are in Angola. Observers in Luanda believe that fighting in Angola could reach unprecedented levels now that international attention is centered on South Africa and its upcoming elections. Meanwhile, Portugal's LUSA news agency quotes an Angolan Government source as saying that N'dalatando has been under the control of government for the last week. It also reports that clashes in Cuanza Norte Province are now occurring between Malange and N'dalatando. The government forces are trying to take Lucala.
