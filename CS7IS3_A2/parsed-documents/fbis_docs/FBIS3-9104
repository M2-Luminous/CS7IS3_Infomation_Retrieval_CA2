However, the new head of government is confident that there is time enough to convince the Slovak population of its work. It was not primarily a rejection of former Prime Minister Meciar that united five former opposition parties but, rather, a common political concept, Jozef Moravcik pointed out. [Moravcik] All five political parties see the need to accelerate the process of economic transformation and to press ahead with European integration. All five want to develop a political culture that is based on the principles of democracy adopted by the November revolution in 1989. This political culture will help us in our communication with our partners in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. [Radzyner] In the sphere of domestic policies, these new principles mean, above all, Slovakia's recognition as a society with different ethnic groups, in which the members of the Hungarian minority will become Slovak citizens with equal rights. Still, Moravcik has not appointed a representative of the Hungarian minority as a Cabinet member. Was he afraid of Meciar? Meciar has already denounced the new government as the traitor of the true interests of the true Slovaks. [Moravcik] It is true that we took this into consideration. After all, we do not want to trigger a new wave of nationalism. This would be in contradiction with our political goals. [Radzyner] Moravcik claims that he has excellent relations with Czech Prime Minister Klaus, who was the last Czechoslovak foreign minister. In Budapest, the new tones regarding the Hungarian minority will certainly initiate good relations.
