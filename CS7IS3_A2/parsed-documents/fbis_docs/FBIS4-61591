Colonel Rezvan Maliyev, chief of police in Terterskiy Rayon, informed a correspondent of the [name indistinct] NEWS AGENCY that the objective was to create fear in Azerbaijan's military units. Despite their efforts to direct psychological pressure on our units, the Armenians suffered many casualties. They have lost 32 tanks and large quantities of grenade launchers, mortars, and other types of arms since the beginning of their onslaught against Terterskiy Rayon on 16 April. They have also lost 100 men a day. Asked how many Armenians have been taken prisoner during the past few days, Maliyev said: The Armenians kill their colleagues to prevent them from being taken prisoner. A special military detachment has been created in Armenia for that purpose. The commander of a group of 24 troops recently contacted Azerbaijan's military positions by field radio to inform them that they were ready to surrender as long as they were guaranteed safe travel to Russia. The Armenian command center monitored what they said. The 24 troops were shot and killed. Another 64 Armenian troops who wanted to surrender were shot and killed in the south of the front line.
