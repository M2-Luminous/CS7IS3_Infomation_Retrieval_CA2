According to preliminary information, these maneuvers could take place in the Volga Military District in the summer. The idea put forward by U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of holding maneuvers in Germany, which was discussed during their recent meeting in the FRG, did not, to put it mildly, find support among the Germans who, according to the officer's account, are not at all keen on having Russian and American tanks rumbling under the windows of their homes as in 1945. It is expected that the U.S. Army's 3d Mechanized Infantry Division and the Russian Army's 27th Motorized Infantry will take part in the maneuvers. However, according to the latest information, each side will send only 500-700 servicemen to the maneuvers. The very small number of participants in the proposed exercises is due to the Russian military department's difficult financial situation. "However, high-ranking military officials are today discussing a compromise solution whereby the Americans would assume the bulk of the cost," the officer stated. At the same time, according to the officer's information, General Staff analysts are seriously concerned that the top Russian military leadership could face serious protests from the population of the Volga region and find itself the focus of unprecedenteed conflict in connection with the preparation of the exercises. According to information being received by the Russian General Staff, the idea of joint maneuvers in the United States has had a mixed response. Off to the States in High Spirits According to unofficial information, more than 200 Russian generals and other officers visited the United States in 1993. Short courses, seminars, symposiums, and conferences make up a far from complete list of the aims of their visits. Even according to the roughest estimates, it cost the U.S. Department of Defense a considerable amount of money to look after the Russians. Many Russian generals frequently visit the American continent in circumvention of the law forbidding representatives of leading state organs to travel abroad at the host side's expense. Staff in the appropriate agencies who had initially informed the Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU] about secret Pentagon plans to work with top Russian Armed Forces military staff eventually gave up. It is impossible for ordinary operational staff to fight against generals, even those violating the Russian president's edict. The Sick Serve in the Army As reported by a high-ranking officer from the defense minister's immediate entourage, members of the Russian Federation Security Council who attended the 19 January Security Council session were misled when informed that Pavel Grachev was absent because he was "carrying out a task for the president." In actual fact, according to this officer's account, Grachev was in a military hospital on the outskirts of Moscow. It is noted that this is not the first time that the 46-year-old army general, who always gives the appearance of being hale and hearty, has had health problems. Subordinates recall in this regard one of the minister's favorite phrases: "The sick don't serve in the army." It is noteworthy that often Grachev's indisposition is carefully covered up in the Defense Ministry and coincides with his reporting to the top organs of state power. Russian Defense Ministry Press Secretary Yelena Agapova denied the report of Pavel Grachev's illness. At the same time the likelihood of Grachev's removal from the post of minister in the near future is remote, according to information stemming from circles close to the Russian president. Remember Afghanistan, Comrade? As reported at the press service of the CIS Joint Armed Forces High Command, Colonel Viktor Timofeyev, commander of the 201st Russian Motorized Infantry Division, which is stationed in Tajikistan, was recently removed from his post. The reason for this was not reported; however, sources in the military department suggest that Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the CIS Coalition Peacemaking Forces in Tajikistan, played a considerable role here. In the opinion of those sources, it was not difficult to find a formal reason for Timofeyev's removal from his post: Discipline in the division has not been not brilliant, to put it mildly, the vaunted contract personnel's actions are unpredictable, and several serious incidents connected, among other things, with drunkenness among the personnel have occurred of late. However, it is thought that one of the main reasons for the conflict lies in the differing approaches to the peacemaking forces' actions in Tajikistan. Timofeyev, who comes from Leninabad Oblast and has a pretty good knowledge of the language and customs of the local population, advocated maximum neutrality on the part of the division and noninterference in the internal affairs of an independent state and was also opposed to expansion of the Russian military presence there. Pyankov, however, is regarded as a supporter of a tougher approach, and his stance could be summed up by the phrase: "If we have signed a treaty with the present government we should stop any incursions by gummen." Such a standpoint was typical of Soviet generals in Afghanistan. Announcement! It is no secret that Russia has drastically cut back on its arms sales in recent years, and as a result earns a lot less hard currency -- $1.9 billion in 1992 as opposed to $21.2 billion in 1982. Perhaps there is not enough advertising? That is why the first issue of VOYENNYY PARAD/MILITARY PARADE -- a Russian military-industrial complex magazine -- appeared in January. Printed in Italy, the magazine is as good as any of its Western counterparts. Information about the latest Russian weapons and their specifications and performance characteristics is given in English and Russian. The first issue presents the pride of the Russian military-industrial complex, ranging from the Ka-50 "Black Shark" helicopter to the "Tor" air defense missile system and the "MSTA-S" self-propelled howitzer. The magazine has some pretty good writers -- the greetings message to readers is penned by Viktor Chernomyrdin. We were pleased to see that the publishers took a photograph of one of the latest pieces of equipment from KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Anecdote? The military carries out a nuclear explosion. The next day a general holds a press conference. A Western journalist asks: "General, why did you announce yesterday that the yield of the explosion was 5 kilotonnes when it was actually ten times greater?" The general scratches his head: "We ourselves thought it was 5 kilotonnes, and then there was this big bang..."
