Camacho Solis' latest communique was sent in response to the communiques released 25 January by the EZLN's Indigenous Revolutionary Committee -- communiques in which Commander Marcos demanded that the government clearly state the degree to which it recognizes the EZLN. Commander Marcos made the demand in an effort to assess the value of any guarantees he might receive from the government during the dialogue process. In his communique, Camacho Solis says a proposal that will be released on Thursday will formalize the terms for an honest, serious, and responsible meeting. Camacho Solis says the groundwork is being laid for a cease-fire, and he assured the EZLN that the government is giving humanitarian assistance to the communities that require food and health care. Finally, he said the communities, society, political parties, and institutions are all working to find more respectful ways of achieving the pacification demanded in Chiapas by way of a national commitment toward democracy, justice, and freedom.
