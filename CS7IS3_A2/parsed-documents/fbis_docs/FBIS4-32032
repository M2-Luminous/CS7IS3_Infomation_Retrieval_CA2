Sarinic said he was not satisfied with items the Serbs had included in the agenda of the talks. He also objected to Krajina's insistence on lifting United Nations Resolution 820, a move he said would make Krajina completely independent. Sarinic said the Serb side was interested in discussing partial issues, such as the restoration of water supplies, while Croatia wanted to negotiate not only economic, but also political issues. He said the problem of Krajina-Croatia telephone connections was politically important, reiterating Croatia's demand that telephone numbers in Krajina bear the same area code as Croatia. The Croatian reaction to the cancellation of talks between the Krajina and Croatia indicates that Croatia's demands for increasing the press quota for Croatian reporters was merely a tactic to avoid holding the talks at all. The talks scheduled to take place in Plitvice were cancelled when Krajina permitted Croatia to bring only the same number of reporters to the talks as the Serb side had been allowed at the Zagreb talks in March. The Krajina Serbs were allowed to bring two reporters to the earlier talks. Responding to a Serb request that Croatia pay up on the outstanding pensions due to Serb retirees now living in Krajina, Sarinic rejected Serb estimates of 57,000 such retirees, saying the total was only 34,000. Sarinic also said Croatia would only pay the smaller number of pensioners in the new Croatian kuna currency unit. The kuna was first introduced as Croatia's currency in the fascist independent state of Croatia, a Nazi-sponsored puppet state that existed only during World War II. The Croatian Government reintroduced the kuna last month. The Republic of Serb Krajina was established in 1991 on Serb ancestral lands in Croatia after Croatia seceded from the former Yugoslav federation. Krajina was placed under United Nations protection in 1992 and has since suffered three military offensives from Croatia. International conference on former Yugoslavia representatives Kai Eide and Geerd Ahrens have pledged their assistance in trying to resume the stalled Krajina-Croatia talks.
