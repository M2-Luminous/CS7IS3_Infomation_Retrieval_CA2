ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: RSPA is proposing to revise the regulations pertaining to infectious substances, including regulated medical waste (RMW), based on petitions for reconsideration and comments received following issuance of a final rule in December 1991, comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued in March 1993, and agency initiative. RSPA is proposing to clarify that RMW is a subcategory of infectious substances; allow RMW to be offered for transportation and transported if it conforms to certain requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; add provisions for transporting RMW by aircraft; and make other changes to clarify the regulatory provisions applicable to infectious substances. The proposed changes are intended to ensure the safe transportation of infectious substances, provide relief from certain requirements of the hazardous materials regulations in those instances where other Federal agency regulations achieve an acceptable level of safety for transportation of RMW, and clarify provisions which were adopted in the December 1991 final rule. RSPA also is announcing a public meeting to solicit comments on the proposals contained in this document. DATES: Comments. Comments must be submitted on or before March 21, 1995. Public Meeting.
