That is part of the achievements of the Beijing Postal Administration last year. Officials said that Beijing's postal services were greatly updated during 1993. Eight new post offices were built and another 23 enlarged and renovated, expanding the number of post offices to 447. In addition, an in-city express mail service, an instant telegraph service and a system of ordering newspapers by telephone were all added to the list of services available in Beijing. Registered mail has been able to reach Taiwan since last year after years of trying to arrange this. Officials said that fixed assets investment totalled 260 million yuan last year in such projects as a postal hub capable of handling 110,000 pieces of mail each day, which was completed last year. Zhou Huan, director of the Beijing Postal Bureau, told XINHUA that this year Beijing will build more postal outlets and other working sites with government funds and capital scheduled to be imported from abroad.
