The ball certainly is rolling again. If it actually is established that fake studies were ordered in order to illicitly channel public funds to political parties, the political world is heading for a "fasten your seat belt" operation. The Agusta case led to the resignation of three ministers, but that is not the end of the story. Not only is the investigation still going on, the reputation of the political establishment was also badly damaged. More than ever before, transparency is needed in the financing of political parties and in the unsavory affairs which keep cropping up. After the Agusta case, in which the relevant ministers created the impression they would rather cling to power than aim at full openness, politicians can certainly no longer afford to cover up their suspicious affairs. An agitated SP Chairman Busquin denied all guilt yesterday, and suggested that the time now has come to pry into other parties' business. Busquin obviously is offended because, of all parties, it was the SP which was attacked twice in a row. Is it a coincidence or a maneuver by party-political opponents? Other parties are not likely to be any more innocent than the SP. There is certainly a good chance that other affairs will crop up in other parties, or that slandering campaigns will be fought. Anyway, this is no reason not to unravel the Uniop case to the bone, not even if consequences can be far-reaching. In the case, the names of the few remaining SP leaders are mentioned: Busquin himself, the man who kept the party in shaky balance when the three Guys disappeared, and Moureaux, who stood up as the party's moral conscience in the Agusta case. If these two politicians also are discredited seriously, or if the parties start to unveil each other's unsavory affairs, things will be out of control. The politicians' credibility already has reached an all-time low, and the citizen is not eager to witness yet another wave of scandals. If governments were to fall or if elections were fought over the issue, with all resulting protest votes or political instability, chaos would be complete. However, if this is the inevitable consequence of the uncovering of illicit practices, then so be it. If the search for honest political ethics means, that the political establishment must first be cleansed, then it must be done. The politicians, the people's representatives, owe it to themselves. Certainly now that, as a result of the previous affair, there is a growing awareness that something must change, as shown by the new mentality with regard to the regulations on party financing. In Italy, things also had to go very badly for the political establishment, before the situation cleared up.
