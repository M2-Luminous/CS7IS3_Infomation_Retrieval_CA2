FR940414-0-00031 FR940414-0-00010 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION 29 CFR Parts 2606, 2616, and 2617 Rules for Administrative Review of Agency Decisions; Distress Terminations of Single-Employer Plans; Standard Terminations of Single-Employer Plans AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On August 24, 1993, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') published an interim rule with request for comments amending certain of its regulations (Administrative Review of Agency Decisions and Standard Terminations of Single-Employer Plans) to permit the PBGC's Executive Director to grant relief from deadlines in the event of a major disaster. The PBGC is now adopting these amendments as a final rule and also is amending its distress termination regulation in order to give the Executive Director the authority to grant relief similar to that given in the interim rule for standard terminations. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold J. Ashner, Assistant General Counsel, or Renae R. Hubbard, Special Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 24, 1993, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') published an interim rule with request for comments amending its regulations on Rules for Administrative Review of Agency Decisions and Standard Terminations of Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR parts 2606 and 2617, 58 FR 44738; as corrected, 58 FR 48680, September 17, 1993). The interim rule provided that, when the President of the United States declares, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, 5122(2), 5141(b)), that a major disaster (such as the 1993 flood disaster in the midwestern United States) exists, the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) may grant relief from certain regulatory deadlines by which persons are to submit filings to the PBGC or take other actions. The PBGC received no comments and is adopting the interim rule as a final rule without change. Before the interim rule was published, §§2606.33 and 2606.53 of the PBGC's administrative review regulation (29 CFR part 2606) provided deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal of an initial determination, and §2606.4 provided for extensions of those deadlines for good cause shown and only if requested in writing by the applicable filing deadline. The PBGC concluded that, when a major disaster like the 1993 midwestern flood is declared, the above deadlines do not serve the agency's objective of making timely review available to aggrieved persons. As amended, §2606.4 provides that the deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal may be extended by the Executive Director (or his or her designee) when a major disaster is declared. The extension may be for a period of up to 180 days and applies to any aggrieved person who resides in, or whose principal place of business is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration or appeal is within a designated disaster area. Similarly, as amended §§2617.25 and 2617.28 of the PBGC's standard termination regulation (29 CFR part 2617) include an exception to the deadlines (1) for filing the standard termination notice with the PBGC (§§2617.3(b)(2) and 2617.25(a)) and, consequently, for issuing notices of plan benefits to participants and beneficiaries (§§2617.3(b)(3) and 2617.23(a)) and (2) for completing the distribution of plan assets (§2617.28(a), (e), and (f)). As in the administrative review regulation, the Executive Director (or his or her designee) may extend these deadlines for a period of up to 180 days when a major disaster is declared. The extension applies to plan terminations with respect to which the principal place of business of the contributing sponsor or the plan administrator, or the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to issue the notices of plan benefits or file the standard termination notice, or to complete the distribution of plan assets (as applicable), is within a designated disaster area.
