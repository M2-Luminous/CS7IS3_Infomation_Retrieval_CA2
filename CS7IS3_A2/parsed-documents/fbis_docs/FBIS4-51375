FBIS4-51375 "drchi103_p_94014" FBIS-CHI-94-103 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Central-South Region Visiting Hubei Secretary Meets German Saarland Leaders Visiting Hubei Secretary Meets German Saarland Leaders HK2605095194 Wuhan Hubei People's Radio Network in Mandarin 1000 GMT 20 May 94 HK2605095194 Wuhan Hubei People's Radio Network Mandarin BFN [Text] On the morning of 17 May, at the invitation of Germany's Saarland Parliament and Saarland Government, Comrade Guan Guangfu [provincial party committee secretary], leader of the visiting Hubei Provincial Economic Delegation, held talks with Saarland Parliament Leader (Helwig) [he lu yi de] and Saarland Governor (Larsonden) [la song dan] on separate occasions. The two sides held discussions on issues relating to continued bilateral cooperation in an extremely friendly atmosphere. Comrade Mei Xiaorong, Chinese ambassador to Germany, was also present during the talks. During his talks with the Saarland Parliament leader and the Saarland governor, Comrade Guan Guangfu said: The Three Gorges Project, a world-renowned project being built on the Changjiang, and the 1,065-kilometer-long Changjiang Gold Channel, a project being built in Hubei, have created new opportunities in Hubei. Now is the best moment in Hubei's economic development, as Hubei is becoming one of China's most dynamic regions for foreign investment. Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Hubei's new train of thought for reform and opening up is as follows: To consolidate the existing relations of cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan and expand relations of cooperation with Europe, the United States, and Japan. At present, Hubei is attaching the greatest importance to closer relations of cooperation with West European countries. This is primarily due to the following four reasons: 1) Europe, the United States, and Japan are the most economically developed countries and regions in the world. Only by strengthening relations of cooperation with the most economically developed countries and regions will we be able to learn more new things; 2) Europe, the United States, and Japan are known for their enormous funds as well as advanced science and technology. Nevertheless, these countries and regions are now bogged down in an economic quagmire. If they choose to make investments in and transfer technology to China, both sides will benefit; 3) Developing economic cooperation with Europe, the United States, and Japan has remained to date the only way of accelerating China's reform and opening up and linking China's economy with the international economy; and 4) International economic development and civilization are always an objective reality independent of man's will. The interdependence among various countries and regions is the motivating force for development worldwide and progress, which are constantly propelled by hi-tech development and speedy information proliferation. Governor (Larsonden) and Parliament Leader (Helwig) agreed with Comrade Guan Guangfu, saying: Your friendly visit is bound to further promote more substantive bilateral cooperation between Hubei and Saarland. There are still many areas in which Hubei and Saarland can complement each other; for example, Hubei is much better than Saarland in respect of using inferior coal to generate electricity and in manufacturing auto spare parts. We are very willing to cooperate with Hubei in this regard. Governor (Larsonden) also laid special emphasis on cultural and artistic cooperation and exchanges between Hubei and Saarland. Hubei Province and Germany's Saarland signed an economic and technological cooperation agreement in 1986. Over the past eight years, the two sides have carried out some exchanges and must do more in this area in the future. The two sides pledged to join hands in opening up new vistas for more substantive bilateral cooperation in economic, technological, and other fields after the visit.
