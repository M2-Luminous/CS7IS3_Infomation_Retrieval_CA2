"I am paying too high a price for my firm commitment to the peace process," he asserted. The shooting of around 50 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in Hebron on 25 February was like a hammer blow for the veteran leader, weary of bloodshed and tired of seeking a peace which persistently evades him. Caught between Israeli intransigence and the growing opposition to his conduct in his own ranks, 'Arafat has gone on the defensive and has ceased to exude that tremendous confidence which used to be sensed around him and which made him more a hero than a leader of the PLO. The legend is beginning to show his feet of clay, and to some extent he is aware of this. Yet perhaps at the same time he increases his human stature in this way. This eventful interview has suffered the consequences of the instability surrounding the Palestinian leader. When I asked him about the division in the PLO, reflected by the fact that when he convened the Executive Committee, only eight of its 18 members attended, 'Arafat went wild and tried to call off the interview. Fortunately, it was resumed later. When I asked him about the disagreements within the PLO, the 64-year old Yasir 'Arafat went wild and demanded that I tell him who had given me that information, which, however, he did not deny. He said that this was not an interview but an investigation, called off the appointment, and asked his bodyguard to remove the tape from my recorder. Marwan Kanafani, the man in charge of his appointments, and another adviser who was present, were as astounded as I. When I was outside the room, they asked me to return today, but I told them that it was better for them to try to calm him down and for us to continue the interview. Half an hour later, 'Arafat received me again, but when he learned that Marwan had asked the bodyguard to return the tape to me, he ordered him to take it away from me again. Later, when we said goodbye, I recovered it, but erased. Hence the first part of the interview is a reconstruction. [Higueras] Have the talks with Israel been broken off or postponed? ['Arafat] We are awaiting the UN Security Council resolution. [Higueras] But do you believe right now that the dialogue has been broken off? ['Arafat] We must wait and see. [Higueras] Will this time be used to secure greater consensus on the peace process? ['Arafat] The peace process has lost all its credibility, and this is a result not only of the Hebron massacre but also of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's tricks. He promised me when we signed the Cairo accord (12 December last) that we would meet within 10 days in order to set under way the process of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank. Eighty days have elapsed, and I am still waiting, but now nobody -- neither Palestinians, nor Israelis, nor Americans, nor Europeans -- believes in the peace process. Moreover, the Army is ultimately responsible for the massacre. [Higueras] Do you hold Rabin responsible as Army chief? ['Arafat] No, certain units. [Higueras] 'Abbas Zaki, a member of the Standing Committee of Fatah -- the PLO faction which you head -- stated in Amman Monday that the truce in armed actions against Israel has been broken. Is this true? ['Arafat] He is speaking for himself. [Higueras] Do you mean that the cease-fire to which you committed yourself, although you did not officially declare it after the Washington accord, will continue to be observed? ['Arafat] I am saying that this is not Fatah. This is a democracy. Everybody can say what he wishes, but they have nobody behind them. [Higueras] You convened the PLO Executive Committee Sunday, but only eight out of the 18 members attended. ['Arafat] Where did you get that information? Who told you that? What do you know of the PLO? Tell me who told you that. You are conducting an investigation -- not an interview. We have finished. ['Arafat ends] When I came in again, I tried the interview from another approach. 'Arafat was calm but even more distant than he seemed to me at the outset. The questions did not matter to him. As in a refrain, he blamed Rabin again and again for blocking the peace process, and stressed that he had been waiting for him for 80 days. [Higueras] The Arab-Israeli talks began in Madrid and, among other places, continued in Granada. Will the final agreement be signed in Toledo? ['Arafat] What must be clear to everybody is that we are working for peace -- not just in Madrid. Before and afterward, we have also accepted various peace initiatives, although the Israelis were putting us in a very bad position and offering us nothing. Rabin promised to return in 10 days -- and not only to me but also to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak -- and he did not do so. We have been very flexible, but what was the price? This horrible massacre. [Higueras] But if an agreement is finally reached, do you, as Rabin says, want it to be signed in Toledo? ['Arafat] The Israelis say one thing and do another. Six months have elapsed since the Washington accord (13 September 1993), and none of what was agreed has been put into practice. They are not serious about building peace. What they have offered following the Hebron massacre is nothing; much less than what is required. When Rabin telephoned me to offer me his condolences, I explained to him that the Army is involved, because entering the mosque with weapons is not allowed, and Israeli troops are the one who guard the mosque. [Higueras] Do you believe that there are many Baruch Goldsteins in Israel? ['Arafat] It is not only I who say so; even some members of Rabin's government do. We all know that some of those fanatics are real time bombs. [Higueras] Do you believe that the Israeli Government is strong enough to disarm the settlers? ['Arafat] The decision is theirs -- not mine. If they have an opposition, so do we, but we are ready to implement what we have signed and they must do so too, especially now when the majority of the Israelis are opposed to what has happened. Now they have a very good opportunity to adopt strong and specific measures in order to prevent such a thing from happening again. [Higueras] Who do you believe is in the more difficult position -- Rabin or yourself? ['Arafat] I am. [Higueras] Why? ['Arafat] It is clear and simple; because I am struggling for peace, and so far peace has not been achieved. Rabin is maneuvering, not working for peace, and that is why it is I who am paying the price of peace. I am paying too high a price. The latest is that of the massacre. Nobody can imagine what is happening, and it is we who are paying. [Higueras] Since the massacre, the Palestinians have increased their criticisms of you for committing yourself to this peace process. ['Arafat] And they are right. None of what was agreed has been put into practice, but it is the Israelis' fault. The peace process has lost its credibility worldwide. [Higueras] Do you feel isolated? ['Arafat] This is not the first bad situation that I have had to face. Before Hebron, there were many other massacres, such as the Jerusalem mosque massacre and the Sabra and Shatila massacre. There have been other massacres, and all of them committed by Israel. [Higueras] But do you feel isolated? ['Arafat] I have already answered you. [Higueras] You are demanding international protection for the Palestinians. Would it be enough for the Security Council to vote in favor of sending unarmed blue helmets to Gaza and Jericho? ['Arafat] Unarmed civilian observers will not resolve the problem. How will they protect themselves? Who will protect them? We already have UN observers. What we want is something to protect our people. [Higueras] When do you believe you will set foot in Jericho? ['Arafat] After what has happened, there is no answer. [Higueras] Are you pessimistic or optimistic? ['Arafat] I am realistic. I work with facts and realities. ['Arafat ends] The interview had ended, and with the tape recorder off, 'Arafat asked me again about the open secret of who attended Sunday's and Monday's meeting. He stated that the Executive Committee no longer has 18 members, because five have resigned, but he did not explain that, since their number has not been formally changed, the quorum is still nine. Nor did he mention that four of those who did not attend the meeting live in Tunis. He stated that he convened not the Executive Committee but the PLO leadership, comprising the members of that committee and another 10 leaders of the occupied territories, and perhaps it was in his frenzy to make me understand the facts that he let it slip that "over 13 were sitting at this very table."
