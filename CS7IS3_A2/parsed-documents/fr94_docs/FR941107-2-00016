FR941107-2-00016 FR941107-2-00006 [A&hyph;570&hyph;832 and A&hyph;570&hyph;833] Notice of Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determinations: Pure Magnesium and Alloy Magnesium From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Goldberger or Louis Apple, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4136 or (202) 482&hyph;1769, respectively. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATIONS: We preliminarily determine that imports of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (``LTFV''), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of these investigations on April 20, 1994, (59 FR 21748, April 26, 1994), the following events have occurred. On May 16, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that industries in the United States are materially injured by reason of imports of pure and alloy magnesium from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value. On June 13, 1994, the Department sent the antidumping questionnaire to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemical Products, and seven PRC companies. (The antidumping questionnaire was divided into three sections: section A requesting general information on each company; section C requesting information on, and a listing of, U.S. sales made during the period of investigation (``POI''); and, section D requesting information on the production process, including specific amounts of each input used in manufacturing pure or alloy magnesium). We requested MOFTEC's assistance in forwarding the questionnaire to all exporters and producers of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium and submitting complete questionnaire responses on their behalf. On August 8, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determinations in these antidumping duty investigations until October 27, 1994 (59 FR 42200, August 17, 1994). On August 10, 1994, the Department provided interested parties with the opportunity to submit published, publicly-available information for the Department to consider when valuing the factor inputs. Petitioners and respondents submitted information on September 7, 1994. In August and September 1994, we received responses to the questionnaire from Min He Magnesium Smelter (Min He), a producer and exporter of the subject merchandise. On September 1, 1994, the Government of the PRC advised us that Min He was the only exporter of the subject merchandise during the period of investigation (October 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994). As Min He's Section A response indicated that it made no sales of alloy magnesium during this period, on September 2, 1994, we requested all PRC exporters, through counsel, to provide information concerning sales of all magnesium for the 12 months prior to the six-month period of investigation (POI) in order to reconcile the small number of reported sales with the much larger number of magnesium entries from the PRC reported by U.S. Customs. The PRC exporters replied to this request on September 9, 1994, identifying several sales of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium between April and September 1993. These sales were made by Xiamen Xing Xia Company Ltd. (Xing Xia) and Xiamen Jinda International Trade Associated Corp. (Jinda). Accordingly, on September 16, 1994, the Department expanded the POI to encompass the twelve-month period April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994, and requested supplemental questionnaire responses for that period. On October 5, 1994, counsel for the PRC companies advised us that the information in its September 9, 1994, letter was in error and that all additional magnesium sales were made prior to the twelve-month POI. The exporters noted in the letter that their sales of alloy magnesium were pursuant to sales contracts for pure magnesium, but were classified as alloy magnesium by U.S. Customs upon their entry into the United States. On October 13, 1994, we again expanded the POI for alloy magnesium to a nineteen-month period of September 1, 1992, to March 31, 1994, in order to cover the most recent sales of magnesium entered into the United States as alloy magnesium. On the same date, we advised the PRC companies to provide questionnaire responses for alloy magnesium based on this POI. During October 1994, we received a supplemental questionnaire response from Min He, and a questionnaire response from Xing Xia, as well as a statement from Jinda that it did not make any sales during the POI. Postponement of Final Determinations Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on October 19, 1994, the PRC exporters which account for all of the exports of the subject merchandise in each investigation requested that, in the event of affirmative preliminary determinations in these proceedings, the Department postpone the final determinations to 135 days after the date of publication of the affirmative preliminary determinations. Therefore, we are postponing the final determinations until the 135th day after the publication of this notice in the Federal Register .
