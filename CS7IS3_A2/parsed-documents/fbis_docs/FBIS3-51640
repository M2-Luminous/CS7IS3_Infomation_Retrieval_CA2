At the conclusion of three days of debates and works in small committees, gathered at the National Theater, about 100 delegates representing the nine geographic departments of the country demanded the formation of this government consisting of Notary Public Raoul Kenol; industrialist Charles Plaisimond, and Cap-Haitien Court of Appeal Judge Louis Toussaint. This government's mission is to normalize conditions, promote national reconciliation, and restore the authority of the state. The congress, which was held on the initiative of the Great North citizens group, calls for general concerted action and condemns the embargo ordered against Haiti. The delegates brought their principal voted resolutions to the office of the Chamber of Deputies in the hope of enforcement as a matter of urgency.
