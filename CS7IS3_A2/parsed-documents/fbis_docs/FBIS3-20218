The spokesman, who was commenting on a Cyprus radio report on the matter during his daily briefing with the press, further said that the authorities were continuing investigations into the crime. Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, 37, president of the Cypriot Committee for Solidarity With Kurdistan and a father of three, was shot five times at close range outside his home earlier this month. Replying to a remark that the international denunciation of Yeoryiadhis' cold blooded murder was behind schedule, Kasoulidhis said it would be accompanied with evidence. The spokesman also reassured that the Republic's authorities and the National Guard continue to take all the necessary security measures to counteract the infiltration of Turkish intelligence. Referring to press reports claiming that Turkish Cypriots who work in the island's free areas may be spying on the National Guard, Kasoulidhis said the authorities were aware of certain activities but were taking all necessary steps. He said that the government was aware of the existence of a Turkish occupation service, responsible for electronic warfare, and was again taking all the necessary measures. Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's areas.
