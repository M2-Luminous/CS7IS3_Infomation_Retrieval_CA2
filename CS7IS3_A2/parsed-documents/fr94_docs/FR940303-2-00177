FR940303-2-00177 FR940303-2-00093 During MYs 1980 through 1993, CAFE levels for light trucks in the 0&hyph;8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight (GVW) class increased, beginning at 18.5 mpg in MY 1980 and reaching 21.7 mpg in MY 1987 before dropping to lower values in MY 1988 through MY 1993, as average weight, engine size, and performance increased. During these years, light truck production increased from 1.9 million in MY 1980 to 4.6 million in MY 1993. Light trucks comprised nearly a third of the total light duty vehicle fleet production in MY 1993, almost double its share in MY 1980. Figure II&hyph;4 illustrates that the light duty fleet (passenger cars and light trucks together) average fuel economy steadily increased in MY 1987, but subsequently has been below the MY 1987 level (see Table II&hyph;6). Light truck average fuel economy also declined, but the passenger car average fuel economy remained relatively constant for MYs 1987&hyph;1993. The overall decline illustrates the emergence of light trucks in the light duty fleet. BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M E:GRAPHICSEN03MR94.005 BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;C
