The international upswing is also affecting the domestic economy. The Economic Research Institute (Wifo) predicts an increase in the GNP by 2 percent in real terms, while the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS) is more cautious and forecasts a 1.6-percent increase. "We were in a position to clearly revise our predictions upward," Wifo head Helmut Kramer stated. "The upswing has become stronger and should continue in 1995." Wifo expects an increase of 3 percent and the IHS a growth of 2.4 percent for 1995. Private consumption, exports, and investments support the upswing. The German economy, which is lagging slightly behind, is a factor of insecurity, which might have an impact on Austria's tourism. "The weak economic situation and declining air fares might make other destinations more attractive," IHS head Bernhard Felderer pointed out. Both institutes based their predictions on Austria's membership in the European Union [EU]. According to Kramer, no calculations were made for a different scenario but "it would certainly have a negative impact on the investment climate." Yet one should not expect too much from the "integration effect" because Austria has already been integrated to a large extent. A disintegration effect, however, would have a much stronger impact. The opportunities for Austria are good: At a rising utilization of the capacities, prices will decline. According to Wifo, the economic growth should be sufficient to stabilize the situation in the labor market. Yet the reduction of jobs in the industry will continue. Approximately 10,000 industrial workers might lose their jobs this year and another 4,000 next year. The unemployment rate is expected to remain largely unchanged because more employment and jobs will be available. A decline of prices resulting from membership in the EU might cause the increase in the consumer price index to drop to below 3 percent. "A 2.8-percent increase is quite possible," Kramer believes and foresees another decline to 2.2 percent for 1995. The IHS predicts an increase of consumer price index by 3.1 percent for 1994 and a 2.8-percent rise for 1995.
