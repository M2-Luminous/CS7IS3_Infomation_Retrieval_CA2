In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, he stressed that his country seeks to extend its hand to the neighboring Arab and non-Arab countries to coordinate their policies in the interest of the peoples, noting that this desire is at times rejected and at other times remains confined to contacts, as is the case between Iraq and Qatar and Oman. Responding to a question on the reasons why Iraq refused to recognize Security Council Resolution 833 that defines the demarcation line and border posts between Iraq and Kuwait, al-Sahhaf said that this resolution did not include a provision requesting Iraq to recognize it. If it had included such a provision, we would not have hesitated to recognize it. He added: We agreed to and complied with Security Council Resolution 687 that outlined the conditions that must be met to lift the blockade. We have met all the conditions, as the ad hoc committee and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] have recognized. There is now a majority in the Security Council demanding that the embargo be lifted. Al-Sahhaf said: Generally speaking, the Security Council requested Iraq to abolish the resolutions regarding Kuwait. We indeed abolished all the resolutions, including the one on the 19th Governorate. This revocation was outlined in official letters to the Security Council, which accepted them. Commenting on Iraqi President Saddam Husayn assuming the post of prime minister in the recently formed cabinet, al-Sahhaf said: This decision was made in accordance with a proposal by the Revolutionary Command Council to help the Iraqi people deal with their suffering. Responding to a question on the possibility of partitioning Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: Even if all other countries were to be partitioned, Iraq would never be partitioned under any circumstances because its social, economic, and cultural fabric have survived for more than 7,000 years. The best proof of this is the failure of the Kurdish gangs in northern Iraq to achieve the schemes drawn for them. Regarding the future of the Nonaligned Movement, al-Sahhaf said: We agree with the view President Husni Mubarak proposed at his inaugural speech. We believe that there is a need to activate the movement and strengthen the bonds among its members to face the present and the future, particularly after the demise of the Soviet Union. A dialogue should be held between the Nonaligned Movement members and the countries of the north to prevent accumulation of the causes of conflict. Responding to a question asking if Iraq seeks dialogue and respects its neighbors, why it does not respect international legitimacy, al-Sahhaf said: International legitimacy has substance and is not slogans. The firm substance of the international legitimacy is international law and the UN charter. Anything else is not international legitimacy. Replying to a question on Iraq's position on the Yemeni war and on reports of Iraqi pilots' participation in the war, al-Sahhaf emphasized that there is no Iraqi pilot or soldier taking part in the Yemeni war. Anyone who says this has to prove it. Regarding the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: In fact, there is no POW problem but a problem of missing people. Kuwait has 611 missing people and Iraq has more than 60,000 missing. We maintain that this humanitarian issue should be addressed in accordance with the Geneva agreements. The files we received from Kuwait through the Red Cross Committee affirm that they are missing. Every file that the Kuwaiti Government submitted has the word missing written on it. This issue will take a long time. We must not forget that the Americans still have missing personnel in Vietnam.
