A group of journalists who visited the Serb infantry units on the front line had the opportunity to see the extent of the deception used by Muslim radio in Sarajevo and the Western media, which insist that Gorazde is in flames and ruins. There is a clear view of Gorazde from the Biserna hill on the right bank of the Drina river about 800 meters from the town center. On the river's left bank several floors of the Gradina Hotel are burned down. Several windows on one of the highest buildings in the town center are blackened with smoke. The glass roof on the sports hall is broken. Roofs on several buildings have been damaged. Minor damage, most likely from gunfire, can be seen on some buildings, and that is all. True, there are very few people in the streets and people run when crossing the bridges. But there is no evidence of any corpses in the streets, as reported by Muslim radio and the Western media that has been using it as its source. [Passage omitted]
