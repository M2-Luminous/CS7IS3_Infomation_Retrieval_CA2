FR940526-2-00031 FR940526-2-00022 Use of Funds These awards may be used for personnel services, supplies, equipment, travel, subcontracts, and services directly related to project activities. Project funds may not be used to supplant State or local funds available for disabilities prevention, for construction costs, to lease or purchase facilities or space, or for patient care. Continuation awards beyond the first budget year will be based on the availability of funds and on the satisfactory progress of recipients in achieving project goals and objectives. Purpose The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to develop State capacity to reduce the incidence and severity of primary disabilities and secondary conditions. These awards are being made to establish and maintain State leadership through the development of basic State core capacity and conduct of special prevention projects in targeted disability groups. Targeted disability groups are categories of primary disabilities and their associated secondary conditions. These include selected developmental disabilities, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, and selected adult chronic conditions. States may conduct special prevention projects in one or more of these targeted disability groups. Core capacity activities should include appropriate collaborations with State and community agencies, advocacy organizations, schools of public health, and other academia/universities including minority institutions. State-based projects must provide technical assistance and increase the knowledge base necessary to design, implement, and evaluate surveillance and interventions that prevent disabilities. State-based projects should become model disability prevention programs capable of replication in other States. Program Requirements Applicants must indicate how their programs will meet this basic state-level core capacity for disabilities prevention. State projects must include strong public health management, a representative advisory council and strategic planning process, access to sound epidemiologic and public health surveillance capacity, and competence in guiding the conduct of community intervention and health promotion activities. To that end, applicants must propose an office of disabilities prevention that includes a full-time manager/coordinator position with the authority to carry out project requirements. The applicant should describe those project resources and staff necessary to meet basic core requirements while also coordinating core-related functions and other activities that reside outside of the office of disabilities prevention. Applicants should describe the organization structure and placement of the project and how this approach can maximize the State's capacity to promote State policy and priority setting. The CDC prefers that State offices of disabilities prevention have a program title that conveys their state-level coordination functions and responsibilities. However, applicants may integrate this office into an established agency organization. Applicants should describe how they will meet both the requirements for basic core capacity and the implementation of special prevention projects. Applications will be reviewed and ranked separately for basic state-level core capacity and for special prevention projects. Special prevention projects will be funded only in States receiving basic core capacity awards. Special Prevention Projects The following special prevention projects will be considered for funding. Other projects similar in scope considered important by applicants should be included as basic state-level core capacity and presented in that section of the application. The special prevention projects on this list must be completed prior to the start of the last quarter of the project period. 1.
