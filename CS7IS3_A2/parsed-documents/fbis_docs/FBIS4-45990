"This vividly shows that Japan's much-touted `three non-nuclear principles' are a `screen' for stepping up nuclear armament in full scale while keeping a large amount of plutonium in hiding and that the noisy row Japan has raised over the fictitious `nuclear issue' of the DPRK, taking the van in the intrigues to stifle it, is a petty trick to conceal its own nuclear armament and divert the public attention elsewhere", the spokesman says. He urges the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency to pay due attention to this problem in compliance with the principle of impartiality. "The United States which has abused the `nuclear issue' of the DPRK for its sinister political purposes, talking about a `cooperation system' aimed at `stifling' the DPRK in league with Japan, a nuclear criminal, can never evade its responsibility for this case," he says, and goes on: "The Japanese authorities must declare to the international community the exact total amount of plutonium they keep in hiding nationwide and immediately stop their nuclear armament. "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality. "We call upon the governments of all countries in the world, international organizations and anti-nuke organizations to exert unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development from our planet and, in particular, to take a joint action against Japan's nuclear armament which is being accelerated recklessly with the ambition to become a military power, a nuclear power."
