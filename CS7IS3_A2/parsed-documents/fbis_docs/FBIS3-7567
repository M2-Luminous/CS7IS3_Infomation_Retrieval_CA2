Tax system reform has been finalized under the condition that a 6 trillion yen tax reduction is to be effected first, with the problem of sourcing funds to be discussed and settled later, and a related law enacted within this year. Prime Minister Hosokawa's original proposal was to abolish the consumption tax and to introduce, three years later, a 7-percent welfare tax. However, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] strongly opposed the idea, going so far as to threaten to withdraw its cabinet members. So, Prime Minister Hosokawa had to withdraw his proposal that a tax increase and reduction be effected at the same time, agreeing instead that tax reduction be effected first. With the change in policy, the SDPJ was awash with victory, saying, "We won, we won." However, such an attitude is considered extremely irresponsible for a government party. Its mentality has not changed at all from the time when the party was permanently in opposition. If a 6 trillion yen tax reduction per year is effected for three years, it creates an 18 trillion yen deficit in finances. According to a tentative Finance Ministry calculation, the amount of tax revenue procured by the 7-percent consumption tax--we may call it either a consumption tax or national welfare tax--is 9.5 trillion yen. Of this amount, we obtain a surplus of 3.5 trillion yen after deducting 6 trillion yen as the source of funds for the tax reduction. Concerning this figure, certain people claim "the Ministry of Finance intends to earn 3.5 trillion yen by taking advantage of the consumption tax increase." However, this opinion is a miscalculation. To raise the consumption tax to 7 percent, 0.8 trillion yen is needed as the cost for reviewing social security expenses. Also, another 1.3 trillion yen is needed to cover the 7-percent consumption tax to be assessed on goods to be procured by the government. Thus, only 1.4 trillion yen is to be left as a source of funds to cover the revenue deficit. If we repay the 18 trillion yen with this 1.4 trillion yen, it will take well over 10 years for repayment of the principal alone. A longer period is needed if we include repayment of the interest. What the government should do is to judge, taking into account the financial situation 10 years from now, whether the 7-percent consumption tax is enough, and if there is any surplus left, whether it is possible to further reduce the tax using the surplus as the source of funds. Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to explain these figures, saying that the 7 percent was a "rough figure," and was accused of being unreliable. However, even if we try to give a detailed explanation by piling up accurate figures, it will be impossible to definitely show a picture of future financial conditions as economic conditions change every second, and drastic administrative reform may take place during the period. A flexible attitude "to start with the 7-percent increase for the time being, and to review the figure as the situation changes" is considered necessary. It may be the prime minister's expression to say that the figure was "a rough figure." The shoes (the finances) are to be made to fit the feet (the economy), and it would be an absurd argument to ask the feet to fit the shoes. The Hosokawa government compromised with the SDPJ's proposal, giving priority to avoiding the collapse of the coalition government. However, the SDPJ's argument has virtually carried over the discussion as to who is to be held responsible for the tax system reform. Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa asked: "Is the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax itself? Is the party opposed to raising the consumption tax rate? Is it opposed to raising the tax rate now?" However, the SDPJ has not adequately answered these questions. The party may be hoping to repeat its past wonderful experience of creating the [Takako] Doi [former SDPJ leader] boom by saying "what is not good is not good." At first, the SDPJ proposed "[the tax system] will be reviewed two years later." It must have been the SDPJ's expectation that, by so doing, the party could fight the House of Councilors' election to take place in the summer of next year with the slogans "The consumption tax should be abolished," or "The tax rate should not be raised." In that case, the election is going to be a ridiculous election [with the parties] flattering the masses. For that reason, it has been agreed, with both Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito strongly supporting the idea, that a conclusion [about the tax system reform] be reached within this year. The LDP Has Become an Irresponsible Opposition Party It was because the people were too ignorant about indirect tax that the Doi boom occurred. At that time, the people were not even familiar with the difference between direct tax and indirect tax. When the Takeshita cabinet forcibly introduced the consumption tax, many people felt "they were cheated." Although the SDPJ availed itself of the situation, bringing about victory at the House of Councilors election, the good luck did not always repeat itself. Presently, public opinion survey shows that the ratio of the people who admit to the necessity of indirect taxes is as high as 60 percent. The balance of national bonds issued has exceeded 200 trillion yen. In addition to repaying the principal and the interest of the national debt, the government has to procure 18 trillion yen to cover tax reduction. If we were living in a baby boom era, we might expect the younger generation to shoulder the burden. However, from now on, our society is aging rapidly. The big debt is to be shouldered by the working generation whose numbers will decrease in the future. If the existing tax system remains the same, it is inevitable that the heavy pressure will become unbearable. Immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa government, Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the opposition LDP's Policy Research Council said, "If the new government intends to raise the consumption tax rate, we should also seriously deal with the problem." I was impressed by his comment, thinking that an opposition party ready to take responsibility was born. However, he recently changed his opinion that "the problem should be reviewed deliberately together with the problem of social security and the problem of pension financing." When the Hosokawa government was born, everyone thought it would have a short life. Hashimoto must have speculated that, since the LDP would return to power sooner or later, it would be appropriate to let the Hosokawa government take care of such a troublesome task as increasing the consumption tax rate. However, the Hosokawa government is assuming the aspect of a long-lasting government. At any rate, the Hosokawa government has settled the problem of political reform which had been pending for six years, and has brought about a conclusion to the rice negotiations at the GATT's Uruguay Round (multilateral trade negotiations) which had been pending for eight years. The government also started to reform the tax system, although tax reduction was effected first. While each of the three problems can be regarded as a serious task for a cabinet, the government has settled as many as two and a half of the problems in six months. After finishing all the domestic tasks the LDP had left undone, the Hosokawa government is about to grapple with policy tasks of its own, such as deregulation, administrative reform, and decentralization. Each of the tasks is closely related and should not be regarded as a separate task. Moreover, each of the tasks was an unsolved problem under the LDP government because the zokugiin [Diet members having strong influence over a particular ministry or agency] were involved in the process. The main reason behind the creation of the zokugiin was the medium-sized district system. The reason for the existence of zokugiin has also been removed through election system reform centered around the introduction of the single-seat district system. In short, the Hosokawa government is ready to start remodeling the state. If so, what points of issue will be advantageous to the LDP in fighting the next general election and the House of Councillors' election? There seem to be many LDP members who are of the opinion that it is advantageous for the LDP to fight the elections by opposing the consumption tax increase. At a meeting of the LDP's Research Commission on the Tax System held immediately before the budget for 1994 was drawn up, Chairman Tatsuo Murayama tried to coordinate opinions within the party along the line that "in order to operate the state of Japan, it is inevitable to raise the consumption tax rate to cover tax reduction." However, opinions were expressed one after another to the effect that "there is no need to dare to take the risk," that "it is better to have the coalition parties take care of the matter," and that "there is no need for an opposition party to take the responsibility by being involved in the problem to that extent," et cetera, finally making it impossible for Murayama to coordinate the opinions. This incident shows that, similar to the former SDPJ, the LDP has also become an irresponsible opposition party. Under these circumstances, former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe, who advocates the necessity of "politics based on real intentions," expressed his pet theory on 10 February at a meeting of an "Economic Policy Study Group" sponsored by Toshio Yamaguchi and Takeo Nishioka that, "When it comes to economic problems, it does not matter whether the party is a government party or an opposition party. Consumption tax is the only source of funds to cover the tax reduction. I do not agree to making the consumption tax an objective tax." His attitude may be regarded as a desirable attitude for a politician. Not only the SDPJ, but the LDP as well, are intently aiming at obtaining a popularity among the masses. The only way to disappoint such speculations is to settle the problem of tax system within this year. Prime Minister Hosokawa Maintains a "Resolute Attitude" It is an urgent task to change the ratio of direct tax and indirect tax, that is, to correct the ratio between direct and indirect taxes. While the necessity of making the correction had been recognized since the time the LDP was in power, the LDP was actually not able to propose the correction because of its bitter experience of suffering a crushing defeat in the House of Councilors election in 1989. Though both the Kaifu and Miyazawa cabinets recognized the necessity of tax reduction, [they knew] it was inevitable to touch consumption tax if they wanted to effect a tax reduction. For this reason, they both carried over the problem saying "My cabinet does not intend to raise the consumption tax rate." Though people say Prime Minister Hosokawa's proposal was made abruptly, the prime minister clearly expressed his intention to reform the tax system as soon as he assumed office. In his policy speech on 23 August, immediately after his inauguration, he stated that he was to "check the conformity of the existing tax system" with the needs of the aging society and with the change of the socio-economic conditions, and declared that "structuring of a tax system keeping balance between income, assets, and consumption" would be studied. After giving his speech, the prime minister asked the Research Commission on the Tax System (Hiroshi Kato as chairman) to study "an ideal form of tax system." Also, in his policy speech given at an extraordinary Diet meeting on 21 September last year, he stated that he asked the government Research Commission on the Tax System to study "a total reform of the tax system such as correction of the ratio between direct and indirect taxes, and other issues including reduction of income tax," and expressed his intention to "grapple with tax system reform" as soon as the commission came up with its conclusion. When we look at the Hosokawa politics during these six months, we notice that, though the pace fluctuates, he never avoids what should be done. When he announced, before daybreak, his intention to introduce a "7-percent welfare tax" the mass media and the SDPJ criticized his announcement as too sudden or too abrupt. However, they thought the announcement was made abruptly simply because they failed--being absorbed in the big problems of rice and political reform--to realize that discussions about tax were underway. In the meantime, the government Research Commission on the Tax System submitted its report as scheduled, revealing that discussions were being made concurrently. Why is it an urgent task to correct the ratio between direct and indirect taxes? According to the settlement of accounts for 1992, the ratio of income tax, corporation tax, and local inhabitants tax (direct tax), and consumption tax, liquor tax, and tobacco tax, et cetera (indirect tax) was 70.7:29.3. We may roughly grasp the ratio as 7:3. The ratio of direct tax is the highest, and the ratio of indirect tax is the lowest among the 24 OECD member countries. The ratio between direct and indirect taxes in the OECD member countries averages 49.6 percent and 40.3 percent respectively. The remaining 10 percent is being covered with taxes on assets. Incidentally, the ratio of assets tax in Japan's total tax revenue is 13.7 percent, which is lower than that of England and the United States. A reader opposed to the consumption tax increase once claimed in the reader's column of a newspaper that "examples in foreign countries should not be referred to." However, in reality, such a claim does not hold true. Let me illustrate an international comparison of the minimum taxable ceiling and the rate of income tax. The minimum taxable ceiling in Japan is Y3.277 million [yen], whereas the ceiling in the United States is Y1.934 million (conversion rate: $1=Y124). In other words, low-income earners are also paying income tax [in the United States]. Among advanced countries, Japan's minimum taxable ceiling is the second highest after France. This fact may be attributable to the strong influence of the SDPJ as an opposition party which claimed that low-income earners should be taken into consideration when it comes to reducing tax. That the minimum taxable ceiling is high, that is, the lower income classes are exempted from tax assessment, means that the higher income classes are to be assessed additionally for the exempted amount. Now, comparison of the highest tax rates shows that, while the total rate of the national tax and the local inhabitants tax is 65 percent in the case of Japan, the rate is approximately 47 percent in the case of the United States. I used the word approximately because, while the rate of national tax is being fixed at 39.6 percent (the rate is 50 percent in the case of Japan), the rate of local inhabitants tax varies by state. If you live in a state where a lower rate of the local inhabitants tax is applied, the rate of your tax will be only about 40 percent. There Are Signs That People Are Losing Their Will To Work Why do not golf player Ayako Okamoto and Nobel prize winner Professor Susumu Tonegawa come back to Japan? Though it may be partly because of a more comfortable environment for playing golf or for studying, these persons have to pay an additional 20 percent or 25 percent tax if they come back to Japan. An Osaka businessman with whom I am acquainted (the name of his company is familiar to everyone) the other day moved to the United States and is "paying tax in that country." He moved to that country because the U.S. tax law becomes applicable to him if he stays in the United States for more than 180 days. It means, therefore, that, if a maximum tax rate is applied, our country is to lose extremely capable people and also the tax they are supposed to pay. If international exchange of goods, money, people, and services is further promoted, Japan will not be allowed to stick to its own tax laws. The same thing can be said about corporation tax. The rate of corporation tax in Japan, with both national and local taxes totaled, is 49.98 percent, which is the highest next to Germany. The rate is 41.05 percent in the United States, and 33 percent in England. Because of the higher rate of corporation tax, Yaohan Department Store Co., Ltd., moved its head office to Hong Kong, where a lower rate of corporation tax is applied. Recently, even the Japan Communist Party [JCP] stopped arguing in a stereotyped way that "taxes are supposed to be assessed on large enterprises." Raising the corporation tax will bring about an emasculation of industry. With the 6 trillion yen tax reduction effected recently, the government not only failed to reduce the maximum rate of income tax, but even limited the maximum amount of income tax reduction to Y2 million, and the maximum amount of local tax reduction to Y200,000. In other words, the benefit to be received by high-income earners through the income tax reduction to be effected this time will be a maximum of Y2.2 million yen. Under such circumstances, Okamoto, Tonegawa, and the businessman from Osaka will not feel like paying tax in Japan. If the situation remains the same, highly capable persons in every field will flow out to foreign countries one after another. Concerning the government's failure to reduce the maximum tax rate, Michio Watanabe severely criticized it, saying "it is a wrong idea to set an upper limit to the income tax reduction to avoid criticism that rich people are to be treated well. The depression cannot be overcome with an irresolute attitude." If Japan is to face the aging society without changing the 7:3 ratio between direct and indirect taxes, it is inevitable that the burden on workers' households will become unbearable. The pension system is being operated in the form where workers ranging in age from 20 to 64 years support people over 65. While 8.5 workers were supporting one aged person in 1970, this structure had been changed by 1990 so that 5.1 workers had to support one aged person. A severe situation will be created by 2020 when 2.1 workers will support one aged person. The ratio of the aged population in 1992 was 13.1 percent in Japan, 14.6 percent in France, and 14.0 percent in Germany (the figures about the latter two countries are as of 1990). In the very near future, Japan will outpace France and Germany, and by 2020 will rise to the highest among the advanced countries. Presently, the ratio between direct and indirect taxes is about 5:5 in France, and 6:4 in Germany. Japan should change its ratio between direct and indirect taxes to a closer level to that of France and Germany where the percentage of the aged population is similar to that of Japan. Otherwise, it is evident that the direct taxes to be borne by the workers will become heavier. The ratio of tax burden and social security burden against national income is called the national burden rate. In 1992, this rate was 38.1 percent in Japan, 51.3 percent in Germany, 62.1 percent in France, and 52.2 percent in England. An excessively high national burden rate is supposed to spoil the will to work. In Sweden, a state with high-level welfare and high-level burden, the national burden rate is as high as 77.4 percent, which means the largest portion of salaries is being taken away as tax. It is doubtful such a social system taking the form of high-level welfare and high-level burden is welcome to the people. In 1981, immediately after the Doko-rincho [provisional administrative research council headed by Doko] made its start, a study was made "seeking an ideal form of tax burden." A study group was also sent to Europe. A tacit conclusion reached at that time was that "society becomes sick if the national burden rate exceeds 50 percent." The loss of the people's will to work, which used to be called the English disease or the West German disease in those days, is supposed to become apparent about the time the national burden rate exceeds 50 percent. Based on this supposition, the rincho proposed that Japan should keep its national burden rate "within 40 percent for the time being." Following the rincho, the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform also proposed that "the national burden rate should be below 50 percent" even in 2020 when the aging society reaches its peak (18 April 1990). Are Pensioners Weak People? In order to maintain balance with the international community, to reflect the maturity of the aging society [to the social welfare system], and to maintain social energy, it is indispensable to correct the ratio between direct and indirect taxes. For this reason, Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his straightforward policy "to correct the ratio between direct and indirect taxes" which had been regarded as a taboo by the LDP government. Originally, to reduce the tax by 6 trillion yen, it was thought to be enough to raise the consumption tax by about 3 percent, making the total 6 percent. However, it became necessary to take into account the problem of countercyclical measures. An ideal form of tax system reform is to take a "neutral way" with tax increase and reduction to be made for an equal amount. However, business conditions are not stimulated that way. For this reason, the raise of the consumption tax rate was postponed for three years. In that case, the government has to suffer a large deficit of 18 trillion yen--6 trillion yen times three [years]. To cover this deficit, it is not enough to raise the [consumption tax] rate to 6 percent and, therefore, the government had to come up with the unexpectedly large figure of 7 percent. Yet, 7 percent is still the lowest among the advanced countries for the rate of the value-added tax (consumption tax) of all the European countries is around 20 percent. Although the SDPJ and Chairman Yamagishi of Rengo expressed their opinion that "it does not matter whether [the source of fund is to be procured] by the deficit financing bonds or by other means," it should not be allowed to take such a reckless, negligent, and desperate attitude. Though the SDPJ and Chairman Yamagishi may think they are speaking for the benefit of the workers, it is the younger generations who are to pay the bill caused by issuing the deficit financing bonds. If the bill is to be paid by direct tax alone, the national burden rate will rapidly break the danger zone of 50 percent. If indirect taxes are raised, the burden will be directly borne by the lower-income earners who are not paying tax. However, it should be endured as, originally, the minimum taxable amount in Japan is too low. There is an argument that the lifestyle of pensioners will become harsh. Yet, no trouble is likely to be created because, if commodity prices rise due to the rise of the consumption tax, the amount of pension is to be raised automatically for the same proportion of the commodity price rise. In the first place, it is wrong to think that people living on pensions are the weak people. It is an old idea. We may say that, presently, Japan's pension system is the most satisfactory among the advanced countries. Comparison of the wages of the working generations and the amount of pension paid to the aged generations shows that, while the monthly take-home pay after tax of the working generations (a standard household) is Y244,512, the amount of pension paid to pensioners (a couple) is Y195,492, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the wages earned by the working generations (source: "Suggestions on the Pension System Reform" by the Ministry of Health and Welfare). According to a survey of the actual situation of aged people conducted in 1973 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, as many as 55.3 percent of people over 65 answered a question about their "real feeling of life," that "I cannot make a living." However, the ratio dropped to 14.5 percent in 1986. According to a life-consciousness survey by age group (in 1991 on householders), 7.9 percent of the aged people in their sixties answered, "It is very hard to make a living," and the ratio was 8.9 percent for people in their seventies. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the situation of these groups when the consumption tax rate is raised. The SDPJ argues that the consumption tax should be made an objective tax, and Chairman Hashimoto of the Policy Research Commission says that "we should hold overall discussions including the problem of social welfare and all other problems." However, neither of the arguments appeals to me. If the consumption tax is made a tax to cover the pension, there will be no way to check the expansion of welfare, and Japan might become a high-welfare and high-burden type state just like Sweden. I wonder whether or not the people really want Japan to become such a state. The problem with the existing pension system is that the amount of pension is raised automatically in proportion to the rise of commodity prices. In the 1960's, Italy introduced, based on the Socialist Party's proposal, an automatic pension slide system called "Acala mobile." However, this system, which proved to be merely an inflation accelerator, accelerated inflation and completely destroyed the Italian financial system, and the country had to suspend the automatic slide system when the Socialist Party took power in the latter half of the 1980's. Presently, pensions in Japan are financed in an undesirable form with pensioners receiving their pension from the fund paid by the generations in active service, and not from the fund they themselves accumulated for their old days. They do not withdraw money from their own deposits, but are receiving money from their children. It is for this reason that the government is planning to change the age to receive pensions from 60 to 65 to improve the pension financing system. Yet, under the existing system, it will be inevitable that, in the future, Japan will repeat the same failure as Italy. Being used to the high economic growth after the war, we have been taking it for granted that "the pension and the commodity price are supposed to rise." That is why the automatic slide system has been introduced to the pension system. If that is the case, it is a matter of course that the pension should also be reduced automatically with the decline of commodity prices. However, it has never been considered that wages and commodity prices might decline. From now on, we should change our way of thinking. Hosokawa Politics About To Display Its Essence The future annual rate of growth of the Japanese economy, which has grown so big, will by no means exceed two or three percent. If affluence is to be pursued in this situation, politics should, first of all, make it its major objective to reduce commodity prices. The deregulation policy presented by Prime Minister Hosokawa is a very adequate policy as a first step toward creation of an affluent life. According to the result of a commodity price survey announced in 1993 by the Economic Planning Agency, price index in Tokyo was 131 (New York = 100). According to a survey conducted around the same period by "International Economic Forum," a private organization in Switzerland, the price index at major Japanese cities averaged 159 (excluding house rent) (New York = 100). In other words, commodity prices in Japan were 30-60 percent higher than the international level. If commodity prices are as high as 160 percent in Japan, goods and money are supposed to rush into Japan from all over the world. While it is the principle of economy that if supply increases prices decline, it is strange that prices do not decline in Japan. Why? In the first place, because of the regulations, it is difficult [for goods and money] to come into Japan. Also, if goods and money come into Japan, the price does not decline because of the disturbing factors involved in the distribution system. In Japan, the industrial fields which produce 40.8 percent of the gross domestic product are being placed under the regulations, whereas the ratio is only seven percent in the United States. In the United States and Europe, the market is free in principle, with regulations placed as exceptions. In Japan, however, a net of regulations is being stretched over a huge area. There are 42 laws and 68 systems providing for exemption of application of the Antitrust Law. The U.S. and European markets are being operated based on the philosophy that economic activities shall be free and, if evil influences take place such as monopoly, collusion, and price cartel and others, then such actions shall be severely punished by the Antitrust Law. In the case of Japan, on the other hand, it is hard to say that free competition is taking place in the market in view of the scandals involving the general contractors, the large banks' collusion in setting interest rates, and the practice of price cartel often exposed in the field of the sealing material industry and paint industry. The Antitrust Law should be applied more strictly. The distribution market in Japan remains undeveloped because of the law called Large Retail Store Law. While distribution revolution took place in Europe and the United States 50-60 years ago, the revolution is about to take place in Japan. In short, Japan is 50 or 60 years behind Europe and the United States in the field of antimonopoly and distribution. Japan being a late starter in capitalism, there are so many regulations in Japan with undesirable aftereffects. During the war and during the postwar period of reconstruction, the Japanese Government and the private sector cooperated with each other to effectively operate the state. However, this cooperative line between the government and the private sector should have been liquidated as long as 20 years ago with Japan becoming a superpower. Presently, far from being cooperative, the collusion between the government and the private sector seems to be at its peak. The Clinton administration has come up with the comprehensive economic framework talks based on its understanding that Japan is a heterogeneous state. It is because the United States does not regard Japan as a free market similar to Europe and the United States that it requests that "import targets by area should be shown." Against this request, Prime Minister Hosokawa claims that, since he is going to remove the administrative guidances and regulations, "it is not my intention to set up import targets which means that administrative guidance and regulations are strengthened." The Japan-U.S. talks having broken off, which is an unusual case, the only way left for Prime Minister Hosokawa is to show actual results by removing the regulations and establishing a fair market. If deregulation is promoted on a large scale, it will finally necessitate administrative reform and decentralization which is the prime minister's pet project. If a free market is formed, there will be no trade friction and the nation's lifestyle will become affluent. If commodity prices decline by 30 percent, it means that wages are raised by 30 percent. With political reform having been realized, politics is ready to follow. The Hosokawa politics is about to display its essence. The LDP government showed a typical form of bureaucracy where politicians, bureaucrats, and business circles maintained collusive relations, yet, the bureaucrats actually took the initiative. Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership is to be tested by whether he can control the bureaucrats.
