If EPA receives significant adverse comment on a permit, EPA will withdraw the direct final issuance of that permit and simultaneously repropose the permit. Such reproposal will provide an opportunity for public comment and requests for a public hearing. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans [sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act]. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below, EPA approves for 1995&hyph;1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996&hyph;1999 in the draft permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated to each unit for 1995&hyph;1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft permits. The additional allowances discussed below are a one-time only allocation pursuant to the settlement. Upon activation of conditionally-approved plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect. EPA issues the following permits: Northport in New York. Port Jefferson in New York. Big Bend in Florida. F J Gannon in Florida: No change for unit GB01; 4,581 substitution allowances for each year and 9 additional allowances to unit GB02 upon activation of substitution plan; 7,003 substitution allowances for each year and 437 additional allowances to unit GB03 upon activation of substitution plan; 7,570 substitution allowances for each year and 450 additional allowances to unit GB04 upon activation of substitution plan; 10,295 substitution allowances for each year and 520 additional allowances to unit GB05 upon activation of substitution plan; 16,107 substitution allowances for each year and 377 additional allowances to unit GB06 upon activation of substitution plan.
