FR940303-0-00052 FR940303-0-00014 Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Economic Assessment and Certification This proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The safety zone will only be in effect 5 hours of one day, February 11, 1994. Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
