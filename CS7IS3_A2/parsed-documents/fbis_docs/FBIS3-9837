The agreement comes into effect on 4 April and the withdrawal of the forces of the warring sides begins on 7 April. Hence, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], which will now have full inspection rights and freedom of movement, will be able to move into the cordon sanitaire created in this way. The agreement stipulates that heavy weaponry will be withdrawn 20 km from the current front lines. Thus, for example, the heavy weapons of the Croatian forces will be located in Sibenik and Stari Grad and perhaps in some other place, while Serb heavy weapons will be located in Gracac, Beli Manastir, and other places. Admiral Rakic stressed that the talks were very difficult because both sides had to relax their demands and give up some pieces of territory in order to reach agreement. In this way, it was said, the Peruca hydroelectric power station, Miljevacki Plato, part of Maslenica, and Zemunik airport will remain under the control of Croatian forces, while Skabrnja near Zadar was returned to the Croatians. By way of compensation, the RSK has recovered the Ravni Kotari villages of Islam Grcki, Smokovic, and Kasic, and Croatian forces are also to withdraw from part of Velebit, which is exceptionally important in view of the position of Obrovac and the return of people and life to this town on Zrmanja. Teslingrad and Jasenovac, the status of which the Serb side did not wish to discuss, have remained on the Serb side. The [two] police forces, assisted by UNPROFOR inspection teams, will enter the cordon sanitaire -- in which some Croatian as well as Serb villages remain -- once the armed forces of both sides have withdrawn from this area. In the opinion of Assistant [RSK] Interior Minister Aleksandar Draca, a member of the RSK delegation, the agreement means the end of the war and the beginning of peace, and the very important return of the occupied Ravni Kotari villages to Krajina. The cease-fire agreement makes possible the continuation of the negotiating process on mutual cooperation and the resolution of many crucial problems in the field of infrastructure, transportation, communications, and other questions of mutual interest to Croatia and Krajina. The talks on this so-called economic and humanitarian basket will probably begin in about two weeks. It is only when these by no means easy problems have been resolved that the negotiations should enter their third, final, and most difficult phase -- the resolution of political relations between the RSK and Croatia.
