[Al-Maqdah] Israeli withdrawal? What is happening is a deployment. Rabin was very explicit when he said that "redeployment in Gaza and Jericho by 13 April will need a miracle." We feel that even if the Palestinians enter Gaza and Jericho under the Israeli thumb to form a beachhead for the Arab homeland, this would only last a certain period, not more than a year. In the past we said that Yasir 'Arafat had entered a dark tunnel but today we say that he is entering Hell. He can neither retreat nor advance. As to what is happening in Gaza and Jericho, we are against this return. We have stated our position on the Oslo agreement and what has followed it. All that has happened is treachery. Everyday we hear comments here and there that there is progress in the negotiations or a delay. Why is this so surprising? The Jews do not honor pledges or promises. They will continue to prevaricate for years to come and 'Arafat will continue negotiations but he will not even "smell" Gaza or Jericho. [passage omitted] [Marun] Are there still contacts between you and those who oppose the peace negotiations in the Arab world? [Al-Maqdah] Of course. We have recently stepped up these contacts. "Fatah" is large and is everywhere, not only in Beirut's streets, as you can see. Fatah is the Fatah of the armed struggle, of the Katyusha, and of Dalal al-Mughrabi. [Marun] There is increased talk on the part of the Lebanese regime that the time to apply security measures to everyone is coming. [Al-Maqdah] The economic and non-economic siege against us continues. Threats to remove or absorb the refugee camps are intensifying, but we continue the struggle. We will not lay down our arms (he said this three times with great determination) until they give us our political rights. We are not demanding anything more than our political rights so we will not be treated like temporary guests, as in Syria. Our rifles are for resistance and for the revolution. They are the rifles of tens of thousands of martyrs, and not for blowing up churches, killing old people and children, or disturbing peaceful towns. We have had enough of them telling us who can do what and when. Our camps have gates and we welcome anyone who visits us. [passage omitted] [Marun] It is known that Syria holds the "Hizballah" card in Lebanon. Who is holding the "Palestinian" card? [Al-Maqdah] Our position in the Middle East is bolstered by the firm Syrian stand, which does not go along with everything the United States wants. The Syrians cannot abandon the territories or the principles laid down since 1947, which it has followed to this day, especially under President Hafiz al-Asad. This man does not tire; he is silent and patient; and he knows how to lead the battle in the field. He holds all the Middle East cards in his hand, and this reassures us deeply. There is not a single Arab country on the map that is not frightened, except Syria. Many of the Arab countries have succumbed; only Syria stands alone in the arena despite the pressures and threats to it. [Marun] Does this mean that Syria is holding your card and that is why you are continuing your opposition? [Al-Maqdah] I did not ask anyone's permission when I chose to oppose [the Oslo agreement]. I was convinced, as were all those who agreed with me, that the course pursued by 'Arafat would result in Palestine being sold out. I have not met with any Syrian officials to this day. We feel the Syrian stand is sacred. We have said, and I reiterate, that our rifles are at the Syrian army's disposal because time has proved the credibility of this stand, which is honorable for the Arab nation. [passage omitted] [Marun] How are you living under the siege imposed on you? [Al-Maqdah] We called on our contacts when all the humanitarian organizations stopped helping us. The "Palestinian Martyrs' Foundation" (an Iranian organization under Tabataba'i) was the only one that supplied us with what we needed. It built the huge "al-Ma'shuq" hospital in the camp and also gave monthly allowances to the martyrs' families. This aid is not limited to the Palestinians in Lebanon but also goes to those in the occupied territories. [passage omitted] [Marun] What do you think 'Arafat's fate will be? [Al-Maqdah] 'Arafat's traits are unique. Only 'Arafat enjoys strong support from European and reactionary Arab countries, and all the Palestinian people's funds are in his own name. Following the martyrdom of [senior Fatah officials] Abu-al-Hawl, Abu-Jihad, and Abu-Iyad, I believe that if 'Arafat were killed, Arab regimes from Egypt to Algeria would collapse and there would be trouble in Tunisia. All the U.S. desires to protect 'Arafat's life, the great Egyptian support for him, and the major Western financial support for him would suffer from 'Arafat's death and not only with regard to the Gaza-Jericho plan. I believe that his demise is imminent and our return to Palestine is not that far off. "They see it far off but we see it close," God willing. [Marun] After what you have just said, if 'Arafat were killed, then you would be the first to be accused. [Al-Maqdah] This is a great honor for me. We know well the fate of every traitor. 'Arafat's removal means return to the Palestinian home, to collective decisions, to Arab coordination, to the "Fatah" home, and to the Palestinian charter. There will be great and numerous achievements when he disappears. Money will be of no use when the day of reckoning comes. [passage omitted]
