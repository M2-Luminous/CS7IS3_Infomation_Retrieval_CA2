FR940425-2-00061 FR940425-2-00046 1. Urinary Incontinence in Adults 2. Acute Pain Management: Operative or Medical Procedures and Trauma Process for Determining Need for Guideline Updates Information regarding the need for a guideline update will be obtained from several sources. 1. Not later than 24 months following the release of an AHCPR-supported guideline, the Office of the Forum will arrange for a survey of subsequently published scientific literature in the topic areas addressed by the guideline. The purpose of this survey is to determine the volume of new scientific evidence, its quality, and the likelihood that such information would cause a change in the guideline's recommendations. 2. The AHCPR is required by section 914(a) (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;3(a)) to publish annually in the Federal Register a list of guideline topics under consideration for development. This annual notice will also include a listing of those guidelines which have been published by AHCPR and for which updates are being contemplated. Comments will be solicited from the public regarding the availability of new scientific evidence or new technologies that may warrant the updating of a clinical practice guideline. 3. Other information relevant to the updating of guidelines may be obtained from evaluation studies conducted to examine the implementation or effects of the guidelines; from development and use of guideline-derived medical review criteria, performance measures, and standards of quality; or from other related activities. 4. When sufficient data are obtained from the above sources to indicate that a guideline update may be needed, a public meeting to address the need for and timing of an update will be convened. This meeting will provide an opportunity for interested parties to contribute relevant information and comments, including new scientific evidence not available at the time the guideline was written. The Office of the Forum will review all the information and scientific evidence obtained in steps 1 through 4 above. When the need for a guideline update has been established, the Forum will recommend the update and the timing of the update to the AHCPR Administrator. Following administrative approval, and as allowed by available resources, AHCPR will arrange for the development of the guideline update by a panel of private sector experts and consumers or a contractor assisted by such a panel. Request for Comments Written comments on the process are invited. The AHCPR will not respond to individual comments, but will consider all comments in determining future modifications to the guideline update process. Comments, in writing, should be submitted by June 24, 1994, to: Linda K. Demlo, Ph.D., Director, Office of Program Development, AHCPR, suite 603, 2101 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. All comments will be available for public inspection at the Office of Program Development, telephone (301) 594&hyph;1457, weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. For Additional Information Additional information on the guideline development process is contained in the AHCPR Program Note, ``Clinical Practice Guideline Development,'' dated August 1993.
