Hospitals have also developed innovative contractual arrangements with other providers. Some rural hospitals, for example, have dealt with declining population bases and the inability to provide high-technology services to the communities they serve by setting up rural networks or establishing telemedicine or computer information linkages with large urban hospitals and other providers. Such linkages have changed the configuration of the rural hospital. Financial pressures have also stimulated the growth of managed care, which has substantially altered the nature of relationships between hospitals and insurers. For example, hospitals may assume more financial risk under a capitated payment system. Types of managed care arrangements differ substantially, however; the degree of control over physician and other providers decision making_and this utilization_consequently differs. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in particular attempt to control expenditures primarily by reducing the use of inpatient hospital care. Staff and group model HMOs exercise more control over their employees than do independent practice associations or preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
