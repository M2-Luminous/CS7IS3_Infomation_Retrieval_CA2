FR940513-0-00163 FR940513-0-00034 One comment basically agreed with the proposed reporting requirements, but urged the Commission to minimize the burden of annual reporting. 258 Four commenters contended that the NPR underestimated both the number of affected models and the time required to prepare required reports for each model. 259 Three of these commenters stated that annual submissions are unnecessary and overly burdensome and recommended that the Commission develop a reporting procedure jointly with DOE. 260 One comment stated that manufacturers are prepared to report test reports for basic models of lamps if basic models are described in terms of performance rather than labels or brand names. This comment urged that reporting requirements be imposed only once with respect to any model with particular performance characteristics. It urged the Commission not to require date-coding, because manufacturers do not routinely label each lamp type with serial numbers or date codes and such a requirement would be very costly and disruptive to manufacturers of certain types of lamps. 261 258 Panasonic, G&hyph;7, 2. 259 GE, G&hyph;16, 1&hyph;2; Osram, G&hyph;15, 1&hyph;2; Philips, G&hyph;14, 1; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 28&hyph;29, 33, 43. The specific burden estimates contained in these comments are discussed in Part VI, below. 260 Osram, G&hyph;4, 3, G&hyph;15, 1&hyph;2; Philips, G&hyph;5, 1, G&hyph;12, 4; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 28&hyph;29, 33, 43, 50. 261 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 50 (manufacturers may produce many versions of lamps with common performance characteristics, differing only in brand name, distribution channels or packaging). The reporting requirement in EPCA is concerned primarily with ensuring that the Commission has sufficient information to determine whether ranges of comparability for major appliances should be changed annually. Because the lamp labeling rules do not require disclosure of ranges of comparability, the Commission has determined that it does not need complete annual reports from lamp manufacturers. To minimize burdens imposed on manufacturers, therefore, the Commission is requiring that reports contain only the following information: (1) Name and address of manufacturer; (2) all trade names under which the lamps are marketed; (3) model or other identification numbers; (4) starting serial number, date code, or other means of identifying the date of manufacture (date of manufacture information must be included with only the first submission for each basic model or type); and (5) test results for the wattage and light output ratings of each lamp model or type and, in addition, for each model or type of covered fluorescent lamp, test results for the color rendering index, measured according to the DOE test procedure. 262 The reports will be due on March 1 of each year, coinciding with the due date for reports on fluorescent lamp ballasts, beginning March 1, 1996. Although reports must be submitted each year, to further minimize the burdens imposed by the reporting requirements, the Commission will accept subsequent annual reports that identify the reporting entity but provide only data about new, changed, or discontinued products, without repeating information on products that have not changed since the earlier report. In addition, the Commission will accept manufacturers' reports in any format that contains the necessary information. These could be catalogs with cover letters, industry directories, copies of reports to DOE or other federal or state regulatory authorities, or original reports, as long as the required information is included. 262 Lamps differing only in matters not relevant to the specified ratings ( i.e. , color, brand name) may be grouped as a basic model. Because DOE has not yet issued test procedures for any lamp products, however, the Commission is staying the reporting requirements pending DOE's issuance of test procedures. No reports will be due until after DOE issues test procedures for any of the lamps covered by the labeling rules. Once DOE has issued test procedures, the Commission will publish a notice announcing when the initial reports will be due. See §§305.8(a)(3) and 305.8(b) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 3. Submission of Product Samples to Designated Laboratory In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring that manufacturers, upon request by the Commission, submit at the manufacturer's expense, a reasonable number of products to any laboratory designated by the Commission. The Commission proposed including this requirement in the labeling rules so that manufacturers would be aware of their duties and responsibilities under EPCA, which requires manufacturers to do this. Under EPCA, however, any charge levied by the laboratory for testing will be paid for by the Commission. 42 U.S.C. 6296(b)(3) (1988). One comment agreed with the proposal, which allows the Commission to determine whether required disclosures are accurate, but urged that care be taken to minimize the expense of spot-check testing. 263 Two commenters stated that the tests should be performed in a NVLAP accredited laboratory. 264 One of these commenters added that the testing should be performed based on the procedures outlined in NIST Handbook 150&hyph;01. 265 263 Panasonic, G&hyph;7, 2. 264 Philips, G&hyph;5, 3, G&hyph;12, 3 (all testing should be performed in NVLAP accredited laboratory); NEMA, G&hyph;3, 49 (regulation should require compliance testing only at NVLAP certified laboratories). 265 Philips, G&hyph;12, 3. See NIST Handbook 150&hyph;01, C&hyph;17. The current Rule repeats the standard specified in EPCA, i.e. , manufacturers, upon request by the Commission, must submit at the manufacturer's expense, a reasonable number of products to any laboratory designated by the Commission. 266 Any charge levied by the laboratory for testing will be paid for by the Commission. The Commission has determined that this requirement is sufficient for lamp products and, therefore, is not amending the Rule in this regard. See 16 CFR 305.16. 266 Although the labeling rules do not require the Commission to use NVLAP accredited laboratories, as suggested by some comments, the Commission will select labs for testing services that have appropriate credentials to conduct the required testing and will consider using labs accredited by NVLAP, when appropriate. V. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Commission stated in the NPR that the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requiring a regulatory analysis were not applicable to the proposed amendments because they would not have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The Commission stated that it believed any economic cost imposed on small entities are primarily statutorily imposed and the proposed regulations would impose few, if any, independent additional costs.
