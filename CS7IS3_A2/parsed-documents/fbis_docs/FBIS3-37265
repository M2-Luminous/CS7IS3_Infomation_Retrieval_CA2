Has Been Prepared at the Level of Treason"] [Text] [IBERIA] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Boris, could you briefly tell us about your organization? [Kakubava] The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia was set up on 6 December 1991 on the basis of the council of the Abkhazian National Movement. This council is an organization elected by the Georgian population in Abkhazia that has been expelled from Abkhazia by the existing authorities there. Our aim is to secure the return of the 250,000 refugees to their permanent places of residence. [IBERIA] How do you plan to achieve your aim? [Kakubava] We intend to achieve our aim by political means. The authorities are currently conducting negotiations via those people who believe that Abkhazia is not a part of Georgia. It is precisely as a result of this that Abkhazia has been granted the status of a state subject in the world. However, we, the Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia, declare that a separatist grouping is currently functioning in Abkhazia that cannot be granted the status of a state. We are the sole body that is able to conduct negotiations in Geneva and that has found a way to get the refugees back. The Georgian people have the ability to defend their motherland. Negotiations are not the only policy -- war is also a policy! True, we are unable to conduct expansionist wars, but we will always have the strength and military potential to protect our motherland. It is an insult to the nation to say that we have lost the war against the Abkhazians. The world should see that we are struggling not against 1 percent of the Georgian population, but against the Russian regular army with its military hardware, aviation, and fleet. Georgia lost Abkhazia as a result of Gamsakhurdia's stupidity while the inaction of the present authorities is contributing to the formation of Abkhazia as an independent state. Those issues regarding the fact that Georgian land bearing the name of Abkhazia should be part of Georgia, that the jurisdiction of the Republic of Georgia should extend there, and that the invading army should be withdrawn from its territory should always stand at the forefront of the negotiations. The Georgian authorities should stop proceeding along a criminal path and give us the opportunity to raise these three issues and make the world understand what has happened in Abkhazia. Our organization unites 250,000 refugees. We are a semi-paramilitary organization. Each one of us is ready to return to his home with weapon in hand and, if another way is not found, this is what will indeed happen. We will not permit Jaba Ioseliani to take charge of the negotiations in Geneva and Abkhazia's interests to be defended by Ada Marshania, an Abkhazian woman who said in an interview that Abkhazia was independent and that we should grant it statehood. The Geneva communique on a settlement of the Abkhazian conflict signed on 13 January, which was presented to the people by the authorities as the result of great work, has been prepared at the level of treason. The Georgian authorities should immediately stop deceiving the people. The commission should be changed for the next round of talks and the work of the present commission should become a subject for discussion. Otherwise, if the government is not willing to hear what we have to say, we will raise the question of its resignation. [IBERIA] How realistic is it to talk about the return of the refugees given the current situation? [Kakubava] As regards the return of refugees to Gali rayon, I believe that whoever raised this question is far removed from politics. This means that we are dispatching the Georgian population as emigrants onto that territory that is under Abkhazian jurisdiction and where they can expect to be shot by separatists. It is written in this Geneva agreement that the Abkhazian authorities are entrusted with ensuring the return, reception, and protection of the refugees. However, this signifies our recognition of Abkhazia's statehood. Until Georgian jurisdiction is restored in Abkhazia, it is a crime to speak about the return of the refugees; the people are being deceived! We do not want to be in opposition to the Georgian Government but, if the authorities do not listen to us, we will try to apply pressure in every way (I do not have in mind demonstrations as the situation in Georgia is tense enough already) since the road to Abkhazia does not pass through Geneva. [IBERIA] Finally, what is your attitude toward the Union of Georgia's Citizens? [Kakubava] The Union of Georgia's Citizens is a recently restored communist organization. It is an attempt to resurrect the Bolshevik-communist structures and will not bring the people anything good.
