According to official statistics, the nation's 1993 gross volume of computer imports and exports was US$2.139 billion, of which imports amounted to $1.05 billion and exports to $1.088 billion. This first trade surplus for the 30-odd-year-old domestic computer industry indicates that this industry has entered the development phase of a benign cycle [between economic activities]. While exports of computer hardware parts and boards continue to form the bulk of China's computer exports, a growing percentage comes from application software and other kinds of software. Analyzing the reasons for the nation's first computer-industry trade surplus, Yang Tianxing [2799 1131 5887], director of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's Computer Department, commented that the dominant position of China's computer industry in terms of labor, talent, and technology is gradually coming into play amid international market competition, and that the production scale of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises is gradually growing -- both reasons being critical factors for foreign-exchange-earning exports.
