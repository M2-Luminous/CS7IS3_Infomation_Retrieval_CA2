In a speech at UN Security Council consultations today, Chen Jian, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, gave a full account of China's stand on finding a political solution to the Korean nuclear issue. Chen Jian said: On the Korean nuclear issue, China's consistent two aims are denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the safeguarding and maintenance of peace and stability in the region. Therefore, every action the international community takes ought to be conducive to these two aims. Practice has shown that the three bilateral dialogue and negotiations involving the four parties represent the fundamental way for settling the Korean nuclear issue. Any threat or pressure would only intensify contradictions and thus have a destructive effect. He said that thanks to the concerted efforts of all the parties concerned, many positive factors emerged earlier in regard to the Korean nuclear issue. Of late, some new difficulties have appeared concerning the issue of inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. These are difficulties amid continuous progress. So long as the parties concerned remain calm and patient, the problems can be solved properly.
