Time: 1130 hours, Sunday. Mustafa Sari is careful. Instead of his private address, he has given only a telephone number -- if we miss each other. The man is chain-smoking. Mustafa Sari, 45 and holder of a diploma in economics, is nervous. His hands shake, he talks without interruption. The topic: the Turkish intelligence service, MIT for short. Sari reports how the MIT gave him a grilling. Changing places, a hotel in Bonn. Loud music in the piano bar, understanding each other is difficult. Nevertheless, journalist Fatih G. repeatedly lowers his voice when he talks about the Turkish National Information Agency -- which is the official name of the MIT. The topics are dubious figures, blackmail, and dirty tricks in a friendly country. One does not joke about the MIT; it is best to have nothing to do with the MIT. For the 2 million Turks in the FRG, the MIT is as sinister as the Stasi used to be for GDR citizens. Germany is the number one area for operations: Here, in large cities like Berlin and Cologne, the Turkish surveillance apparatus sees the invisible frontline in the war against militant separatists. MIT agents are spying on the supporters of the terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). However, they also intimidate other opposition members and, for instance, threaten asylum-seekers with reprisals against relatives in Turkey. The MIT does not do anything obvious. The German authorities have kept silent for years. The reason: The MIT is classified as a friendly intelligence service of NATO partner Turkey. The result: If the spies from Ankara become too active, "one slaps their wrists at most instead of making everything public," as is casually noted in Bonn security circles. Hartmut Ferse, director of the Hesse Office for the Protection of the Constitution, is an exception. In the discussion about Kurdish demonstrators he frankly accused the Turkish intelligence service of illegal activities on German soil. The Bonn Interior Ministry, which officially does not want to say anything about the MIT, also knows quite well what Ankara's agents are doing in Germany. One example: Employees of the Turkish Consulates in Hamburg and Stuttgart wanted to recruit spies from Turkish opposition circles in 1990. The alleged diplomats, who were uncovered as MIT agents by the constitutional protection office, threatened and blackmailed their would-be spies -- this is clearly proved by monitored telephone conversations. As a result, 15 Turkish intelligence agents were silently -- as is usual among NATO partners -- expelled from the country -- an icy period between Ankara and Bonn. At the time. By July 1992 at the latest, everything had been settled again. State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, coordinator of the intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution President Eckart Werthebach, and Federal Intelligence Office (BND) chief Konrad Porzner went on a secret visit to central Anatolia. There, while tea, pastries, and good raki [Turkish liquor] were served, new oaths of loyalty were sworn on cooperation between the German and Turkish services. Cooperation has always been intensive. The Berlin Administrative Court was convinced that an asylum procedure (file VG 19 A 329.82) clearly proved that the BND from Pullach near Munich regularly passed on information from the files of Turkish dissidents to Ankara. The result: After returning to Turkey, rejected asylum-seekers are arrested and confronted with their statements made in Germany about political persecution in Turkey. "If the Turks had their way, we would have to arrest and deport 100 Kurds per day," an official of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) describes the zeal of the German MIT section. However, even without energetic help the Turkish intelligence service manages perfect surveillance. The listening posts are the approximately 700 state mosques in Germany. According to research done by FOCUS, the imams, who are paid by the consulates, are obliged as spiritual leaders to write a detailed report about the inner workings of the Turkish communities every four months. In case of "matters pertaining to internal security," the operation, codenamed Prosperity, demands that the respective consulate is to be notified immediately. The MIT is taking the offensive in time: Via the daily HURRIYET of 29 September 1992, teachers and doctors who live in Germany were called upon to take secret photos of suspicious Turks and to send three copies of the pictures to information attache Ulvi Yavuz in Ankara within 15 days. If national security is involved, the Turkish intelligence service does not stop with Germans, either, according to reliable information obtained by FOCUS: Dossiers are painstakingly compiled about journalists, who, in the view of MIT, report all too critically about the government in Ankara. The secret files about Ankara's alleged enemies in Germany are kept in a safe place. The mosque in Venlower Strasse in Cologne is considered to be the MIT headquarters in the FRG. About 30 controllers of agents pursue their covert work on the second floor there. The MIT residency in Berlin has an equally perfect cover -- from the fourth floor of the state agricultural bank, Ziraat Bankasi, the scene in Kreuzberg is being spied on. The Turkish intelligence service, which is always looking for new unofficial employees, is able to take its pick in Germany. Many desired candidates speak German better than Turkish, work at banks and airlines, in travel agencies and offices. Most of them are more familiar with Hamburg-Altona or Cologne-Ehrenfeld than Istanbul. The intelligence service already takes advantage of that when it recruits people. Any young Turk, regardless of whether he was born or grew up in Germany, is drafted into the military service by Ankara. For a sum of at least 10,000 German marks, he can, quite legally, reduce his military service from the actual 20 months to four to eight weeks until his 38th birthday. Several FOCUS informers report concurrently that at Burdur barracks near Antalya young Turks from abroad are gathered together and approached by the intelligence service. Economist Mustafa Sari, who came to Burdur at the age of 31, remembers his first MIT contacts: "We were about 1,200 soldiers in the barracks. One day we got questionnaires. We were told to write down which Turkish groups we knew and who is against the government. We were supposed to give names, blacken people." Journalist Fatih G. also learned that the young recruits were thus writing their first spying reports. Back in Germany after the brief military service, the MIT does not loosen its grip on them. Anyone who wants to get out is intimidated. One does not get his passport extended for staying in Germany, another is suddenly suspected of supporting terrorist circles -- which might lead to arrest in Turkey. Beatings on order in Germany come from the fascist Gray Wolves, who, according to constitutional protection findings, are clearly controlled by the MIT. Mustafa Sari, who publicly pilloried the MIT practice in lectures after his military service, is convinced that he was subjected to the toughest measures: During a visit to Ankara an unknown man fired at him -- the bullet injured two innocent people in the street. An MIT operation might also be behind the sudden disappearance of Turkish opposition members from Germany -- such incidents had been hitherto unknown. According to investigations by FOCUS, four members of Devrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left), a party that is persecuted in Turkey, requested political asylum in Stuttgart and Frankfurt in 1982. In 1986 MIT agents lured the opposition members into a trap. During a dinner in Stuttgart among alleged comrades, the four Dev-Sol activists were reportedly anesthetized and taken to Ankara on a passenger flight of Turkish Airlines. Relatives say that only in 1988 did they receive any indication that the missing persons were still alive. They were in the feared Mamak military prison in Ankara; according to official reports, they had been arrested during a raid in Turkey. The sentence: 17 years in prison for each of them. Two men have meanwhile been released from prison. Hakan reportedly squealed to the MIT about his comrades. Ibrahim was no longer fit to be in prison -- Mamak prison caused him to end up in a wheelchair.
