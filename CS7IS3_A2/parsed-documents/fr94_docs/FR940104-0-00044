Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or Educational Purposes Commercial and Recreational Fishing In 1991, NMFS consulted with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) pursuant to section 7 of the ESA to evaluate the potential effects of the proposed Pacific Ocean Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) on winter-run chinook salmon. A biological opinion was issued to the PFMC on March 1, 1991, that concluded management of the salmon fishery under the Pacific Ocean Salmon FMP was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. An incidental take statement was also issued with the opinion that authorized a limited incidental take of winter-run chinook salmon by the ocean fishery (NMFS 1991b). NMFS has also consulted with the Council concerning implementation of Amendment 4 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP. The opinion issued by NMFS concluded that implementation of the FMP would not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon as a result of incidental bycatch of salmon in the fishery. NMFS will continue to consult internally and with the PFMC, as appropriate, to ensure that ocean salmon and other fishery management actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. Since 1987, the CDFG has implemented seasonal fishing closures in the upper Sacramento River and monitored the recreational salmon catch. In 1990, the California Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations that prohibited the retention of salmon in the Sacramento River when adult winter-run chinook salmon are present. This closure has virtually eliminated the taking of winter-run chinook salmon by recreational fishermen. NMFS will continue to coordinate with CDFG concerning in-river fishing restrictions. Scientific Studies In 1991, NMFS issued an ESA section 10 scientific research permit to the FWS to conduct several scientific research studies on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The FWS's Northern Central Valley Fishery Resource Office published a report in early 1993 summarizing their 1992 activities under the permit. The results from the juvenile monitoring program, the hatchery propagation program, and the temperature tolerance experiments are expected to significantly contribute to NMFS efforts to protect and recover winter-run chinook salmon. CDFG and FWS also conduct annual spawning distribution surveys of winter-run chinook salmon in the upper Sacramento River and develop estimates of the annual spawning run size based on counts of fish passing the dam. CDFG conducts aerial surveys each year to count winter-run chinook spawning redds and determine their distribution in the upper River. The FWS also counts winter-run chinook salmon redds in an index area in the vicinity of Redding. In March 1993, NMFS modified the FWS's scientific research to authorize the directed take and sacrifice of coded-wire tagged winter-run chinook juveniles produced at Coleman National Fish Hatchery and collected during monitoring studies in the Sacramento River, the Delta, and at the State and Federal water export facilities in the southern Delta. The purpose of the study was to determine growth rates of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon produced at the hatchery and released into the wild, and to help verify the size criteria developed by CDFG to separate and identify juvenile chinook salmon by race. Under the terms of the May 1988 Ten Point Restoration Plan for winter-run chinook salmon, the FWS agreed to fund and implement a winter-run chinook salmon propagation program at the hatchery. Prior to 1991, this program was unsuccessful. However, in 1991 the FWS was able to successfully hold and spawn six female winter-run chinook salmon despite the low numbers of fish available (only 22), and produce and release about 11,000 juveniles into the Sacramento River near Redding, California. In 1992, the winter-run chinook salmon spawning run size was substantially higher (1,180 fish), more adults were collected for broodstock use, and a total of approximately 28,000 juvenile winter-run chinook salmon with tags were released into the upper Sacramento River in late January 1993. The FWS continued this program in 1993 using approximately 17 wild adults and is currently rearing in excess of 20,000 juveniles at the hatchery. The surviving juveniles will eventually be tagged and released into the upper Sacramento. This marking program is expected to provide information on the timing of winter-run chinook salmon outmigration and growth. In addition, marked fish that return to the upper Sacramento River to spawn in the future will be easily distinguishable from wild fish, thereby allowing the FWS to assess the effectiveness of this supplementation program and ensure that hatchery produced adults are not mated with each other. The marking program may also provide additional information concerning the ocean harvest of winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS is currently conducting a section 7 consultation with the FWS to address the long-term effects of this propagation program, as well as a proposed captive broodstock program, and other existing propagation programs at the hatchery, on the wild winter-run chinook salmon population. NMFS expects to conclude consultation and issue a biological opinion to the FWS before the end of 1993.
