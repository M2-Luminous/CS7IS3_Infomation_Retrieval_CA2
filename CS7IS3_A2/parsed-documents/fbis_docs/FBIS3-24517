Dotsenko, Marine Hydrophysics Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.466.81] [Abstract] The existence of vertically spaced local maxima of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N(z), playing the role of waveguides for IW, usually leads to the appearance of anomalous frequency dispersions (AFD). This problem is examined using data for a region of the Atlantic to the northwest of Great Britain where the upper waveguide corresponds to the seasonal pycnocline and the lower waveguide to the principal pycnocline. The existence of several pycnoclines and extended layers with quasiconstant N(z) values is characteristic of the North Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Black Sea. An anomalous frequency dispersion of IW is expressed in the appearance of local extrema of group velocities in the range of relatively large wave numbers. This is attributable to the characteristics of vertical density stratification in the ocean. The characteristics of such dispersion in an ocean with several pycnoclines are examined. Its influence on the vertical structure, evolution and generation of wave fields is analyzed. Manifestations of the anomalous frequency dispersion of internal waves in real wave processes are discussed. Among the aspects of the problem examined are: energy exchange between waveguides, BKW approximation for internal waves in ocean with two pycnoclines; cluster character of dispersion; Airy wave packets; IW generation.
