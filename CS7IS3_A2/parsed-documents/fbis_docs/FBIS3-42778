Some call them the "eye of the state," while others, remembering bygone times, call them "party organs of the Central Committee." At one time Nikolay Travkin, speaking from the parliamentary rostrum, promised "to inform" on himself every Wednesday if he is spared such representatives of the president. According to available information, speaker of the Federation Council Shumeyko is disposed to a radical resolution of this problem. In all probability the near future will show how reliable these assumptions are. But in the meantime a new representative of the president, Kondrat Yevtushenko, has been appointed representative of the president in Khabarovsk Kray. Only one thing identifies Kondrat Yevtushenko, the new representative of the president in Khabarovsk Kray, with Vladimir Desyatov, his predecessor: Both came to politics on the crest of the democratic wave, and both supported its radical wing. The similarity ends here. Yevtushenko thinks that the self-isolation of the representative of the president from the administration of the kray and the local democrats was the reason for his dismissal. In this respect, Yevtushenko is the complete opposite of his predecessor. Being a people's deputy of Russia in the last convocation, he used his personal capabilities to the maximum to resolve the kray's problems. This ensured Yevtushenko the support of Viktor Ishayev, head of administration, who half a year before this appointed Kondrat Mikhaylovich manager of the executive branch of Amurskiy Rayon. The opinion exists that the surgeon-traumatologist did not make it as an administrator and business executive: For example, in autumn he bought potatoes at an exorbitant price in Siberia instead of getting them right there from his own farmers. Important entrepreneurs are unhappy with the absence of support. However, he himself thinks otherwise: In this half year the city has become cleaner, asphalt has appeared, and they have started to build a waterline and finish building purification installations that were abandoned by the defense industry. As for production, he considers one of his unquestionable services the output of linoleum at one of the converted enterprises and the preparation of bus assemblies at another. Yevtushenko thinks that the results of the elections to the State Duma, for which he submitted his candidacy, speak in his favor, although he did not become a deputy. Four-fifths of the people supported Kondrat Mikhaylovich in three rayons of his electoral district, and he surpassed his opponent by 13,000 votes in his native Amursk. However, Komsomolsk preferred not a doctor democrat but a professional entrepreneur. He started work in his new capacity with an accounting of state money expended on maintenance of the apparatus. His predecessor, with two representative offices--in Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-na-Amur--worked three days in each. Yevtushenko immediately eliminated the office in Komsomolsk and also curtailed the position of deputy. There are also dangers concealed in the position of representative of the president. For example, if he defends the interests of the kray "at the top" too actively, he risks bringing down on himself the displeasure of the immediate leadership apparatus and the president himself. If he is too cautious--the example of his predecessor also rings clear. In general, as the representative of the president attests, he clearly recognizes this situation of being between the hammer and the anvil, and treats it calmly. Yevtushenko is convinced that there are no poor decisions of the president, inasmuch as they are based only on the Constitution, but there are poor local authorities who execute them poorly for various reasons. Well, it is a novel idea. However, a certain continuity is still seen. Kondrat Mikhaylovich began his contact with this journalist with a request that the article be submitted to him for approval. Desyatov also always started this way...
