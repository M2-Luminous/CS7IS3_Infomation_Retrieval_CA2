The meeting was chaired by President Ilyas al-Hirawi. At the outset of the meeting, President al-Hirawi discussed the Israeli aggression against Lebanon on the morning of 'Id al-Adha when the Israeli enemy staged a commando operation and abducted Lebanese citizen Mustafa al-Dirani from his hometown in al-Biqa'. The defense minister then submitted a detailed report on the Israeli act of aggression. He explained the practical moves made by the Lebanese Army to confront this operation. The foreign minister presented a report on lodging a complaint with the UN Security Council and the contacts Lebanon has held on the subject. The cabinet then discussed the Israeli aggression and stressed the importance of bolstering the domestic unity and the legitimate security forces with all available means to continue to perform their role in safeguarding the homeland's security. The cabinet decided to have the foreign minister hold preliminary contacts for a meeting of the UN Security Council to debate the Lebanese complaint and condemn the Israeli aggression. [passage omitted] [Question] Did the cabinet discuss the proposals from the UN secretary general [words indistinct] Lebanon and Israel regarding al-Dirani? [Samahah] Lebanon regrets very much this stance by the UN secretary general. The United Nations is required to implement its resolutions instead of offering to mediate on an issue that requires implementation of international law and UN principles. It is impossible to equate the case of one who fell in Lebanon during an aggression against Lebanese territory and that of a Lebanese citizen abducted from his home on Lebanese territory by an Israeli force that violated international laws and Lebanon's sovereignty. Lebanon demands that this citizen be released immediately, along with all Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails and in detention camps in occupied Lebanese territory in the south. [Question] In light of the information available, what in your views was the goal of the Israeli operation? [Samahah] The operation is designed to complement the Israeli plan manifest in the recent bombings, specifically the bombing of Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and of the Phalangist Party headquarters. In this case and in those cases, the Israeli enemy sought to sow division and doubts within Lebanese society and in the people's unity and their state's capabilities. The president, the prime minister, and all ministers stressed that there is no room for leaving the Israeli links that act in various ways to strike at Lebanon's unity and to confuse the Lebanese people's trust in their legitimate establishments, especially the security forces and the Army and their unity in confronting the Israeli enemy. Lebanon will confront all Israeli operations at this time when our country is facing important challenges, primarily the peace negotiations and Israeli attempts to bend the will of the Lebanese and Arabs, particularly Syria at this stage of the negotiations.
