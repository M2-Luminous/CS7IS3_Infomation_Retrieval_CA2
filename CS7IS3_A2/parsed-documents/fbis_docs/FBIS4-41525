The measure follows the country's dwindling oil exports which almost completely dried up in May, President of state Munaigaz holding company (production, refining and marketing of fuel) Bulat Yelemanov said in an interview with the Kazakh Panorama newspaper. Kazakhstan whose annual oil output runs at about 17 million tonnes has no direct access to export pipelines or sea ports having to export crude oil via Russian territory. Experts say the project will cost some $500 million to implement. Yelemanov said that a 7 km-length pipeline to be commissioned by the end of 1996 had already been laid down. He accused Russia of blocking all outlets for Kazakhstan's oil exports. Yelemanov said Russian oil agencies offer too high prices for pumping oil through Russian territory or refer to overcapacity on export pipelines. Worse still, Russian oil refineries which handle Kazakh oil now refuse to accept it because of glut. Officials in Alma-Ata [Almaty] maintain that Russia does not want to honor its obligations. It has now agreed to handle only one million tonnes of Kazakhstan's crude oil instead of three million tonnes as provided under the contract. Experts say the country exported only 285,500 tonnes of crude via Russia in the first quarter of this year, which is 75 percent of last year's level.
