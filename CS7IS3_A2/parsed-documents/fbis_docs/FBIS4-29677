Overseas short-term financial markets are flooded with high-tech financial instruments such as swaps, but the Tokyo offshore market deals only in the trading of limited capital instruments. It is said that "foreign banks cannot even deal in bonds or commercial paper." The unofficial U.S. Government itemized listing of requested deregulating actions made public in the latter part of May included a request for further deregulation of the offshore markets. Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials display an air of calmness, saying, "We have not received any specific requests," but they are unable to conceal a bit of bewilderment at the sudden surfacing of the topic of deregulating offshore markets. This is obviously a case where the wishes of U.S. banks in Tokyo have been conveyed to the U.S. Government. An offshore market is defined as one in which the procurement and management of capital by nonresident entities such as foreign governments and firms is allowed. In December 1986, an offshore market in the format of an international banking facility (IBF), separate from domestic transactions in Japan, was established. Offshore transactions are exempt from the burden of reserve deposits as well as withholding taxes. Such features provide for capital transactions that are appealing because of lower costs. Offshore transactions are used to fill overseas investor needs for yen capital. According to MOF International Finance Bureau officials, they were initiated with fanfare given to the goal of "globalizing the yen and nurturing Tokyo into an international market." As far as residential entities such as Japanese firms and individuals are concerned, only foreign exchange banks can participate in the offshore markets. Further, because of the fear that domestic transactions will be routed to offshore transactions since the latter are not subject to tax withholding actions, Japanese banks are required to establish special accounts to handle offshore transactions. Specific methods prescribed to segregate domestic and offshore transactions include 1) measures to prevent excess receipts on a monthly basis on the domestic side on disbursements and receipts of capital between offshore and domestic transaction accounts, and 2) limiting the daily amount of capital gathered from offshore markets into domestic transaction accounts to 10 percent of the average operating balance for nonresident entities in the prior month. In the offshore markets of New York which have required similar segregation of domestic and offshore transactions, the only requirement is an obligation to establish a reserve account even if capital is gathered into domestic accounts. There are no quantitative limitations such as in Japan, placing Tokyo in a category where strict regulations still exist even from an international perspective. In reality, the Tokyo offshore market is plagued by slow growth. It grew at the rate of $200 billion a year for three years after initiation based on asset balances reflected in Japanese banks' offshore accounts, but growth since then has been very slow. Recently, yen-denominated transactions have grown faster than dollar-denominated transactions and dollar-denominated assets have grown because of the strong yen, but according to city bank sources, the real situation is such that "markets have hardly grown at all." The Tokyo offshore market is notorious because of a proliferation of restrictions, but there was a time when regulations were relaxed. Limitations on daily capital gathered into domestic accounts were doubled in 1989. However, that action did not lead to a subsequent expansion in market scale. The foremost goal of foreign capital in the area of deregulation is the abolishment of segregation in capital flow. There are those who claim that Bank of Japan [BOJ] manipulation of financial markets will not be completely effective unless capital transactions are segregated, but many foreign banks point out that "BOJ methods for market manipulation are sophisticated to the degree where there should be no adverse impact from abolishing capital segregation from offshore markets." Even within the BOJ, there is the view that "there is no need to insist on capital segregation." In fact, the MOF's Tax Bureau opposes the direct abolishment of regulation. It fears that "such a move may lead to talk of abolishing tax withholdings on domestic capital transactions and there is the atmosphere that they don't even wish to discuss the matter because of a serious situation being confronted in the form of inadequate tax revenues. Failure of the Tokyo offshore market to grow symbolizes the stalemate in the globalization of the Tokyo market. Deregulation of offshore markets is indispensable in the stimulation of markets. It is only a matter of time before foreign pressure increases, even if strong resistance is posed by supervisory authorities such as the MOF. Success or failure of further market opening actions can be considered as serving as a test in determining whether Tokyo markets can respond to another demand for globalization.
