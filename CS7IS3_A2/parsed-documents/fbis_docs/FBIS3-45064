In addition, as adjustments in the price of grain purchased in line with this particular state policy may increase urban residents' cost of living, the problem will be solved by increasing urban workers' wages. The source said that the central leadership required central and local financial departments to play a leading role in establishing a grain risk fund after prices are adjusted in light of market forces in order to promote agricultural production and guarantee peasants' interests. The central authorities will allocate 2.8 billion yuan to various localities to set up grain funds. At the same time, local authorities are also required to allocate funds from their own financial resources to set up grain risk funds. The source said: The recent sharp increases in the prices of grain and cooking oil were caused by psychological factors, speculation, and temporary factors on the whole. Concretely speaking, the price hike occurred first in Guangdong, and then spread to other coastal areas. Because the law of marginal returns has played its role, the area of land sown with grain crops in Guangdong has decreased substantially. Now, as the grain market has been opened, if the price of imported grain was affordable, people would eat imported grain; as the price of imported grain was too high, people competed with each other to buy domestic grain. As a result, the price of grain was driven up. In fact, our country reaped a good harvest of grain crops in 1993, and stocks are also adequate. The transportation of grain was also in a normal condition. Therefore, it is completely possible to overcome the incorrect ideas of some local and departmental leaders who regard the price hikes as harmless, remove people's misgivings and misunderstandings, and rapidly bring grain prices under control and back to a normal condition. The source quoted a central leader as saying that the grain price is the basic price in the market so it is necessary to bring it under control as it has a bearing on the national economy, the people's livelihood, and social stability. This is also common practice in all countries practicing the market economy, and is the main point in our domestic macroeconomic control. Therefore, the central authorities will be thoroughly responsible for this. This source also said that the central authorities had worked out a scheme for raising urban workers' wages in order to offset the impact of grain prices on the cost of living. The basic monthly wage of 200 yuan will be increased by 30 percent so that grain price increases in 1994 will also be offset. The central authorities plan to keep the rate of grain price increases in 1994 to below 10 percent.
