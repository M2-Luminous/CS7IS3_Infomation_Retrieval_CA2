First deputy chairman Peter Weiss told the deputies who were present that parliament chairman Ivan Gasparovic had left the parliament building together with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar immediately after the unsuccessful talks held by the representatives of parliamentary parties this morning. According to TA SR [Slovak news agency], this meeting had in effect ended after the prime minister refused to join the talks because Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, was present at the meeting. Vladimir Meciar does not recognize Milan Knazko as an elected parliamentary representative. Because the representatives of parliamentary parties refused to accept Meciar's request that Milan Knazko should leave the meeting, Vladimir Meciar said, according to parliament deputy chairman Ludovit Cernak, that the meeting was not legitimate and was anticonstitutional. Immediately after that, Vladimir Meciar left the room.
