It was stopped at the initiative of the strike committee and the management of the Bilibino AES because it is owed a considerable amount of money for the electricity supplied to consumers. The station itself owes approximately 6 billion rubles to its employees and partners, while consumers' debt to the AES amounts to 8 billion rubles. If the strike continues, most of the biggest enterprises in Yakutia and Magadan Oblast could come to a halt in the next three days.
