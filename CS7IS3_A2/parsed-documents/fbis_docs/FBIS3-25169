This aggression, perpetrated by unidentified individuals, took place at the southern entrance of the Bacongo area, one of the areas most affected by fighting between militiamen of the presidential group and the opposition in the past few months. According to a military source, this attack "may have been perpetrated by forces hostile to the return of calm in the capital; but this will not jeopardize the ongoing peace process engaged by the parliamentarians," with the signing of a cease-fire accord on 30 January by deputies of both the presidential group and the opposition. This attack is the first violent incident recorded in the southern areas of Brazzaville since the cease-fire is in force.
