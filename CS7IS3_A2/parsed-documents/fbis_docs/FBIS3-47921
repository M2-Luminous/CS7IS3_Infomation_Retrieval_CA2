Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief of the government panel holding preliminary talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) said the planned peace talks will continue despite the ABB threat. The ABB over the weekend threatened to assassinate criminals and corrupt government, police and military officers allegedly involved or members of crime syndicates. According to Dee, the ABB, which belongs to the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] breakaway group Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, had already declared autonomy from the Netherlands- based NDF leadership headed by Jose Maria Sison. He however hinted that the government is ready to talk with the "revisionist faction [breakaway groups]" of the local communist movement should the talks with the Sison faction of the NDF collapse. The ABB threat "will not affect the peace talks in itself but it could be a subject that will come out in the course of the peace talks," Dee said. [passage omitted] Dee said the exploratory talks in Vietnam, should they push through, will only lay the grounds for the formal talks. He said the exploratory talks in Vietnam are expected to take place within the first quarter of the year while the formal talks are expected to last for about three to six months. "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said.
