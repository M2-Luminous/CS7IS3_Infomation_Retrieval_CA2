He told Interfax that China had not repaid Russia the 80 million Swiss franc credit, extended to it for the construction of a railway (1 dollar equals 1.4 Swiss francs - Interfax). According to the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, in 1990 the Soviet Union borrowed 0.5 billion Swiss francs and in 1991 - 1 billion Swiss francs from China (Russia is the Soviet Union's legal successor). Moreover, Russia's debt to China for supplies on a clearing basis exceeds 800 million Swiss francs. Shokhin said that the sides had not yet evaluated all of the mutual debts and claims, and that this work was to be done during the next few weeks. To quote Shokhin, "in order to retain an equal attitude to all creditors, given the current financial problems and other considerations, Russia will have to ask Beijing to put off the repayment of the debt on terms similar to the ones advanced by the Paris Club. Although China is not a member of the Paris Club, if Russia repays its debt to China on more favorable terms, Moscow will find itself in a difficult situation on the eve of the talks with the Paris Club," Shokhin pointed out. "Without a departure from the barter scheme, which allows a couple of Chinese companies to dictate prices and choice of goods, we shall fail to keep trade with China on a proper level," he continued. He also said that China had promised to give Russian exports broader access to the Chinese market.
