Is all set at the National Registrar's Office to meet this new challenge? [Osorio] Yes. We had said that, because of the short time, we should suspend preparations for the runoff elections in case it proved unnecessary. But we will continue to work along the same lines, making preparations for the runoff election. [Garcia] Is this the first time this has happened in Colombia? [Osorio] Well, it is the first time there is an election by qualified vote. Consequently, a runoff election will be held.
