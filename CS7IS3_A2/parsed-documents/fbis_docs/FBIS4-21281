FBIS4-21281 "jptdd018___94039" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 20 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA HONDURAS Congress President Supports Review of Military Treaty With Congress President Supports Review of Military Treaty With U.S. PA2004175894 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 20 Apr 94 p 56 PA2004175894 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA Spanish BFN [Text] Although National Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores has explained that any action involving the military treaty signed with the United States in 1954 concerns the president of the Republic, he stated on 19 April that it is important for the treaty to be discussed, because it may no longer reflect the current situation. Flores revealed that so far he has only received unofficial information regarding the intention of General Discua, commander in chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, to seek a rejection of the treaty. Flores said, "The president is the one who has jurisdiction and responsibility for negotiating international agreements and treaties, and any action in this regard concerns him." Flores explained that the matter is being discussed by the executive branch and will not be taken up by the legislative branch until the executive reaches a decision and informs Congress officially. He also said the correct term in this case is to reject [denunciar] the treaty -- an action that includes discussing possible disagreements and conveying any criticisms to the other nation. Flores added: "The Armed Forces are part of the executive branch, and any idea must be discussed with the constitutional president and other branches such as the legislative branch." Asked whether the treaty is truly obsolete, as argued by Gen. Luis Alonso Discua, Flores replied that circumstances that prevailed years ago no longer exist. Flores noted: "In the past decade, Central America was subject to different pressures, conflicts, and domestic problems. Governments outside the realm of de jure states, political disputes, and related situations no longer exist at this time, because all of the governments have been elected by popular vote." He concluded: "The situation has changed radically."
