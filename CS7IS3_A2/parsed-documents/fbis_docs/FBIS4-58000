But we have determined everything that refers to the implementation and schedules contained in the final document of the GATT's Uruguay Round." This was said by Pedro Saravia, our country's livestock, agriculture, and fisheries minister, when he evaluated the 14th [Cairns Group meeting], which ended on 20 May in Montevideo, as "very positive." It is his opinion that "there are a series of signals throughout the world that indicate that the group must continue its functions," in addition "it must have the capability of answering immediately" because "the first Cairns Group meeting took place after the signing of the Marrakech document." Saravia reaffirmed: "The work that was carried out was very important as an element of pressure, and it was a way in which criteria were unified, thus we can convey to the major powers a very different position from the one they already have." But the Cairns Group's functioning "is informal and has its limitations." The minister considered: "The illegitimacy that world trade, meaning subsidies and dumping [preceding word in English], were some of the factors on which we have had to work, and in one way or another they now are being felt." Undoubtedly these are not the only elements, "but the world and the great powers have had to cede some things, including the fact that they have had to sit down and discuss new budgets, and even though the dismantling will take place within 10 to 15 years, it can be considered very positive." Saravia stated that even with these ups and downs, the Cairns Group "countries have played a very important role." The minister, who was the meeting's host, said that during the meeting "the code of conduct was not debated, but everything pertaining to honesty and loyalty regarding procedures was debated." Although it has no legal status and does not have the means to act as a referee in controversies that can crop up in the trade sector, "the positions that emerged within the group's 14 member countries are a counterweight when there is a business deal with distortions."
