Police escorting the Royal Rhapsody cruise boat fired back but the gunmen escaped along the Nile River near the Islamic militant stronghold of Asyut, 360 kilometers (216 miles) south of Cairo, security services said. The tourists were sailing from Suhaj to the capital Cairo. For the past year police have escorted tour boats in rubber dinghies in a broad effort to protect tourists targeted by militants seeking to sabotage the Egyptian economy and bring down the secular government.
