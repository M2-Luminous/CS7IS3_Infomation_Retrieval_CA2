FR940922-2-00069 FR940922-2-00043 [CA&hyph;065&hyph;04&hyph;4333&hyph;05] Closure Order for Motorized Vehicle Use, South Park Canyon Bridge, P142, Panamint Mountains, Inyo County, California AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Vehicle Closure on the South Park Canyon Bridge on BLM Route P 142 in South Park Canyon, Panamint Mountains in Inyo County, California. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that a 1/2 mile section of BLM Route P 142 in South Park Canyon is hereby closed to motorized vehicle use. ORDER: Effective immediately a 1/2 mile segment of BLM Route P 142 in South Park Canyon from the intersection of BLM Route P 142 and the Thorndike Mine Road to a point approximately 1 mile east of the intersection of BLM Route P 142 and the Suitcase Mine Road in Section 30, Township 22 South, Range 45 East, Mount Diablo Meridian, is closed to all motorized vehicle use. No person may use, drive, transport, park, let stand, or have charge or control over any motorized vehicle in this area. Exemptions to this order for reasonable access for mining or other purposes are by written authorization of the Ridgecrest Resource Area Manager only. This closure order decision will be implemented with full force and effect due to the potential for the loss of person or property should this bridge fail. EFFECTIVE DATE: This closure is effective September 9, 1994 and will remain in effect until rescinded by the authorizing official. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Area Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Ridgecrest Resource Area, 300 South Richmond Road, Ridgecrest, CA 93555, (619) 375&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The road segment in South Park Canyon closed through this order is located on a steep canyon wall over 100 feet above the canyon bottom. Rockslides have removed a section of the roadbed and rendered the road impassible to motorized vehicles. In March 1994 a makeshift bridge was constructed across this chasm without BLM notification or authorization. The road segment and bridge will remain closed until the structure can be inspected and repaired to ensure it meets the standards prescribed by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM). If the bridge cannot be modified to meet these standards, it will be removed. The purpose of this closure order in South Park Canyon is to protect persons and property on an impassable mountain road in a remote desert area. South Park Canyon can still be adequately accessed via P 142 from the west and from the east by a road network accessed from P 82 in Pleasant Canyon. Maps showing the affected area are available by contacting the Ridgecrest Resource Area Office. Signs will be installed at the closure points and the affected area will be posted with public notices and standard motorized vehicle closure signs. Authority for this closure is granted in 43 CFR 8364.1 (a). Violation of this order is punishable by a fine, not to exceed $100,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Dated: September 9, 1994. Henri R. Bisson, District Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23405 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;40&hyph;M
