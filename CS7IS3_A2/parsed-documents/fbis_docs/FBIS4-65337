This was said by Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], in an interview with the APA. At the same time, Fasslabend pointed to the numerous advantages of EU membership in terms of security policy. The emergence of a European security system must not automatically imply the renunciation of neutrality, the minister said. Nevertheless, the question arises of how to evaluate neutrality. Even now, neutrality "has undoubtedly no longer the function it used to have," the defense minister said. In the current situation, a few weeks before the EU referendum, it is better to avoid a discussion on the issue. One should at a later stage deal with all security policy issues, including NATO's Partnership for Peace, following the example of Sweden and Finland. In this connection, Fasslabend pointed out that the Federal Government had already decided that EU accession should be combined with an observer status in the Western European Union, the EU military arm. Outside Help This would offer Austria the possibility to "participate in the field of security policy and, in 1996, to have the opportunity for active participation in a future European security system," the defense minister said. Fasslabend believes that the following advantages in terms of security policy would go hand in hand with EU membership: an "undoubtedly diminished likeliness of a direct attack against our country, the certainly quicker and more efficient help if such a direct attack should still take place;" the increased readiness to provide outside help for possible outside dangers, such as a threat through missiles; and, most importantly, the possibility of direct cooperation in crisis prevention, which could influence the emergence and spreading of developments as in Yugoslavia. Fasslabend emphasized that EU accession would not be linked to the creation of a professional army. After all, most EU member states have compulsory military service, just like Austria.
