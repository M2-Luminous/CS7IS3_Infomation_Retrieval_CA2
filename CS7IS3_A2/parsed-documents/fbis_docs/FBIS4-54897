On 3 May, the same newspaper on page 3 carries a 600-word Viera Urbanova commentary criticizing the "escalating attacks" on former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, with special emphasis on President Kovac's speech in Cadca. The TA SR report includes the following passage: "President Kovac said that he came to the Kysuce region to get to know the region's problems on the spot and to gain a better understanding of them. He also explained some of the reasons that led to the recent change in the Slovak Government. According to his words, many of the former government's practices had long signaled a discrepancy between its proclamations and actual deeds. The prime minister's autocratic method of government, the suppression of different views, defamations, not saying the whole truth, and the scandalization of people from other political entities were the main reason for the government's loss of favor and support even among some of its own deputies, the president added." The Urbanova commentary is entitled "Meciar Persecution Mania--Remedy for Unemployment?" The author observes that the new government coalition, "which is pledged to pursuing civilized policies without confrontational tones," is doing the exact opposite, and its "attacks" on the former prime minister "are even escalating." In this context, she says: "The president, who, as head of state, should be, first and foremost, a moral authority, should stand above matters, and should apply the same yardstick to anyone, has not managed to step over his shadow of a provincial politician. During his visit to north Slovakia, Michal Kovac defied everything of which he wants (and should) be a safeguard: calm and peace, which Slovakia needs the most. In Zilina, he spoke about reconciliation, and, in neighboring Cadca, he once again fully exposed his Meciar persecution mania, which he finds so difficult to conceal. If the head of state wants to get to know the problems of a region, why does he have to lower himself to calling the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia names? It is very doubtful whether this attitude of the president will resolve unemployment or calm down passions among people. It seems that tolerance, statesmanlike wisdom, and foresight still have not made it to our latitudes, while the discrepancy between proclamations and actual deeds is thriving here."
