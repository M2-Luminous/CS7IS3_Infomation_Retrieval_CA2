The Health and Welfare Ministry and the Justice Ministry will permit those who have been infected with the human immunodeficiencey virus (HIV) to come into Japan to attend the conference, the first in Asia of its kind. However, if attendants are proved to have once had a hand in prostitution, the ministries will refuse them entrance, the sources close to the ministries said. About 1,000 AIDS patients and HIV carriers are expected to take part in the 10th International Conference on AIDS to be held from August 7 to 12 in Yokohama. Organizers expect over 10,000 people from more than 140 countries to attend. Japan's immigration law grants the government a right to refuse entrance to those who are infected with a virus and run a risk of spreading the virus among people. The ministries, however, decided to allow HIV carriers to enter the country because their purpose of participating in the conference is clear, the sources said. The law also enables the government to stop the entrance of those who have a background of prostitution even if they are to make speeches at the conference. However, they can apply for special permission for entrance with the Justice Minister if they wish, they said. Nongovernment organizations overseas have urged Japan not to shut the door to participants who have engaged in prostitution. All previous conferences were in Europe or North America, but the organizers hope for greater Asian input next year because statistics shows AIDS cases will explode in Asia toward the end of the decade. In Japan, there are currently over 3,000 people with AIDS, or infected with HIV, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.
