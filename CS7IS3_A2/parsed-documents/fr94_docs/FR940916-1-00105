FR940916-1-00105 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.203. This section contains the general qualification requirements for train brake system inspection and test personnel. FRA believes that individuals performing train brake system inspections or tests do not require the depth of knowledge required of those individuals performing train brake system maintenance. FRA proposes several general requirements that are aimed at ensuring that individuals performing brake system inspections and tests must, at a minimum, be able to perform the specific tests or inspections required by Federal regulations on the type of brake systems for which they are responsible. Broad performance-based qualification requirements for ``mechanical inspectors,'' ``electronic inspectors,'' and ``qualified train crew members'' are set forth at §§232.207, 232.209, and 232.211, respectively. Section 232.205. This section contains the qualification requirements for train brake system supervisors. The first-line supervisor of personnel responsible for train brake system inspections, tests, and maintenance must provide much of the quality control exerted over this work. This makes the train brake system supervisor a central player in the scheme to ensure the safe operation of trains. The supervisor performs this quality control function by performing spot checks of the work done by subordinates. To perform effective spot checks, the supervisor must have an extensive background in the inspections, tests, and maintenance required for train brake systems for which the supervisor is responsible. Consequently, FRA believes that, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train brake system supervisor, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training and experience guidelines: (a) Have a minimum of two years' experience testing, inspecting, and maintaining the type of train brake systems for which he or she is responsible. (b) Have successfully completed 24 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years on the Train Brake System Safety Standards. ``Successful completion'' means that the supervisor has been able to pass an examination on the Train Brake System Safety Standards conducted by the railroad. (c) Have successfully completed 80 hours of training, including 40 hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years, and an intensive technical course on the operation, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems typical of those installed on the type of equipment for which the supervisor has responsibility. ``Successful completion'' means that the supervisor has been able to pass an examination covering inspection, test, and maintenance of the specific brake equipment with which the employees supervised work. This test shall be conducted by the railroad. (d) Have a thorough knowledge of the employing/operating railroad's procedures and policies on train brake system inspection, maintenance, and test. Section 232.207. This section addresses the qualification requirements for brake system mechanical inspectors. The ``mechanical inspector'' is not necessarily qualified to perform only mechanical inspections. For the purposes of these regulations, the mechanical inspector is considered to have the knowledge and skill necessary to maintain the mechanical components of train brake systems as well as to perform brake system inspections and tests. The proposed specific training and experience guidelines represent what FRA considers the minimum necessary for the mechanical inspector to be effective. Several sections of these new regulations propose incentives for railroads who use qualified mechanical inspectors to perform train brake system mechanical work. Consequently, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train brake system mechanical inspector, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training and experience guidelines: (a) Have a minimum of two years' experience testing, inspecting, and maintaining the type train brake mechanical subsystems on which he or she is assigned to work. One year of experience as a train crew member inspecting and testing brake systems may count toward one year of the required experience. However, at least one year of experience is required that includes hands-on maintenance of train brake systems. (b) Have successfully completed 24 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years on the Train Brake System Safety Standards. ``Successful completion'' means that the Inspector has been able to pass an examination on the Train Brake System Safety Standards conducted by the railroad. (c) Have successfully completed 80 hours of training including 40 hours of hands on training within the past three years and an intensive technical course on the operation, test, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems typical of the type of equipment with which the Inspector works. ``Successful completion'' means that the Inspector has been able to pass an examination covering inspection and maintenance of the specific brake equipment with which the inspector works. This test shall be conducted by the railroad.
