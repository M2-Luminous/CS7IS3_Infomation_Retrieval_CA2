Quoting an unnamed State Department official, the Associated Press said Christopher called Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and asked him "to use his influence with the Serbs." The official said Christopher made the telephone call before Kozyrev left to Belgrade, capital of the Serb Republic. "He told the foreign minister that, given the situation on the ground in Bosnia, it was quite likely that NATO would have to respond to a U.N. request for 'close air support,'" the official said. "And he urged Foreign Minister Kozyrev to use his influence with the Serbs to keep this from being necessary." Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed by Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake on the Bosnian situation. A British warplane was shot down today over Gorazde, a Bosnian town mainly populated by the Muslims and was on the verge of being taken by the Serbs. The plane was trying to retaliate against a tank that reportedly fired directly into Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe area" for the Bosnian Muslims, NATO said. The pilot ejected as the plane exploded.
