Although the elections have been officially declared valid because the statute on this organ of representative power adopted by the oblast soviet enables it to start work with any quorum, the assembly's viability with only half its members seems extremely doubtful. Even in rural districts the voter turnout has sharply decreased. As regards the city, it can be said that Lipetsk boycotted the elections en masse. Because of the low turnout of city inhabitants at polling stations (between 11 and 24 percent), they were not valid in a single one of the oblast center's districts. Not a single deputy was elected to the city organ of representative power.
