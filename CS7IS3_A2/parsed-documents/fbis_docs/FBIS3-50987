This is how Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas responded today when he said that "we already know Europe's position." The meeting was summoned by the EU Executive Commission Agriculture Directorate to try to reach an agreement in the commercial dispute, which originated with restrictions on Latin American banana purchases, effective since July. Latin American countries will meet in San Jose on 13 January to try and reach a consensus regarding an EU offer to assign quotas to each producing country and 70 percent of the import licenses. Most Latin American banana countries object to this European initiative. "There is no need for a meeting with the EU, because Costa Rica already knows what it will be told," Rojas stated through a spokesman. Costa Rica, together with Colombia, has begun negotiations regarding the EU initiative and has represented Latin American interests before GATT, which was lodged with a lawsuit nearly a year ago.
