In a telephone interview with QUDS PRESS, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, member of the PFLP Political Bureau, denied reports about an upcoming meeting between 'Arafat and Habash. Malluh said these reports are groundless. Palestinian sources close to Fatah had spoken about a meeting to be held between the two Palestinian leaders who arrived in Amman to attend a Yemeni reconciliation meeting. Malluh said the PFLP still thinks there is no political common ground to hold such a meeting. He said: Our dispute with Yasir 'Arafat -- over the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached in Oslo and the Cairo agreement on implementing the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho -- precludes any common ground for a meeting with him, as Malluh put it. The PFLP is opposed to a self-rule agreement struck between the PLO and Israel and signed in Washington on 13 September. Like other opposition factions, the PFLP refuses to hold any meeting with the PLO leadership before annulling this agreement and subsequent accords.
