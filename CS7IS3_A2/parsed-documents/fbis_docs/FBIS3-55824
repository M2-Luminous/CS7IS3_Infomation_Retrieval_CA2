Zhirinovskiy's godfathers are Gaydar, the International Monetary Fund, and monetarists of the Geoffrey Sachs type." This view was expressed in an interview with Interfax by the Director of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies, Dr. Georgiy Arbatov. According to Arbatov, he fears that during his visit to Moscow U.S. President Bill Clinton may fail to realize the need for "great changes in Russia's economic and social policy that could lead the country toward stabilization." Such changes alone are capable of turning Russia into a "normal country posing no threat to the rest of the world," Arbatov said. According to him, stability in Russia did not increase after December's parliamentary elections. On the whole, he said, the "shock therapy" hit science, culture, education and health service most of all. "A horrible de-intellectualization of society" is in evidence. "Gaydar-style reforms are a road to the third world. Many people, and not only in this country, began to realize this after the success scored by Zhirinovskiy," Arbatov declared. He believes that "Russia must rely primarily on its own strength." "As a matter of fact, the Americans have never given us tangible material aid, but they did us a disservice by recommending Gaydar-style reforms - the 'shock therapy'. The greatest aid they can give us is to stop giving bad advice," Dr. Arbatov said. Arbatov said he hopes that after his visit to Moscow the U.S. president will acquire "a new insight into Russia's economic problems and tasks." "I would be very glad if precisely this happened," he said. According to Arbatov, Russian-American relations today can be described as "normal on the whole." "There are neither serious breakthroughs, nor sharp deteriorations in them. When the 'cold war' ended, Russian-American summits lost their dramatism. It's obvious that such summits will become routine with the passage of time," he concluded.
