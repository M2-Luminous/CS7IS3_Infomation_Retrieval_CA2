Regulatory Flexibility Analysis C. Regulatory Impact Analysis D. Paperwork Reduction Act I. Authority These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002, 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9007, and 9009 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991a, 6991b, 6991c, 6991d, 6991e, 6991f, and 6991h). II. Effective Date This rule will be effective on February 28, 1994, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). This rule may be made effective immediately because it extends an existing compliance date and there is good cause to make that extension immediately effective within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (3). III. Background On October 26, 1988, EPA promulgated financial responsibility requirements applicable to owners and operators of underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum (53 FR 43322). To meet the requirements, owners and operators must demonstrate that they can pay for the costs of cleanups and third-party damages resulting from any leaks that may occur. In the final rule, EPA established a phased compliance schedule for owners and operators of petroleum USTs. The principal reason for adopting the phased compliance approach was to provide the time necessary for providers of financial assurance mechanisms (including private insurance companies and states intending to establish state assurance funds) to develop new policies and programs or conform their policies and programs with EPA requirements. See 53 FR 43324. When devising the phased compliance approach, the Agency wanted to achieve the best balance between the need to demonstrate financial responsibility for UST releases and the time necessary for owners and operators to obtain assurance mechanisms. The Agency attempted to establish compliance dates that were as early as possible, considering the type of assurance different types of facilities were likely to obtain. Petroleum marketers owning or operating 1,000 or more USTs and non-marketers with more than $20 million in tangible net worth were required to comply by January 24, 1989, based primarily on their ability to qualify for self-insurance. Petroleum marketers with 100 to 999 USTs were required to comply by October 26, 1989. These marketers were estimated to be relatively more likely to be able to obtain insurance; some of them were also expected to qualify as self-insurers. Petroleum marketers owning 13 to 99 USTs at more than one facility were originally required to comply by April 26, 1990. However, on May 2, 1990, the Agency published a rule (55 FR 18566) extending this compliance date to April 26, 1991. These marketers were thought to be less likely to be able to obtain insurance than members of the October 26, 1989, compliance group. Petroleum marketers owning fewer than 13 USTs at more than one facility or owning only one facility with fewer than 100 USTs, as well as non-marketers with less than $20 million in net worth and local governments (including Indian tribes) were originally required to comply by October 26, 1990. This group was expected to rely primarily on state assurance funds for compliance. (State assurance funds provide money for cleanups to owners and operators in their states. Owners and operators in states with assurance funds are deemed to be in compliance with financial responsibility for the amount covered by the fund once the state submits the fund to EPA for approval unless and until EPA disapproves the fund.) On October 31, 1990, EPA extended the compliance deadline for one year for small marketers (with fewer than 13 USTs or fewer than 100 USTs at a single facility) and small non-marketers (with less than $20 million in net worth), otherwise known as Category IV. This extension was based on the need for additional time for state assurance funds to be developed. In addition, EPA extended the compliance deadline for local governments and Indian tribes until one year after publication of a final rule with additional self-insurance mechanisms for local governments to use to demonstrate compliance. This rule was published on February 18, 1993 (58 FR 9026).
