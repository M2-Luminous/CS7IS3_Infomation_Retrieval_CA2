Rusinov] [Text] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an absolute theocratic monarchy, occupies a large part of the Arabian Peninsula. It formed within existing boundaries in 1932 by the unification of several principalities. Possessing significant oil resources and finances, Saudi Arabia attempts to play the predominant role among the Muslim and especially Arab countries. Its leadership was the main initiator of the formation of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf[.sup]1[/] in 1981, bending great efforts to transform it into a military-political alliance. The development of the military-political situation in the Near East and Persian Gulf in the last three years has shown that the United States and its western allies attach special importance to Saudi Arabia, giving it considerable aid in Armed Forces organizational development and technical outfitting. This is explained above all by the country's important military-strategic position, enormous oil reserves and leading role in the regional organization of monarchic Arab states. While maintaining close cooperation with the United States in all areas for a long time, the country's leadership declined American demands to present its territory for building foreign military bases. But the appearance of Iraqi troops on the Saudi border as a result of Kuwait's occupation in August 1990 forced King Fahd, the head of state, to decide to present the country's territory for the first time for deployment of a grouping of armed forces of other states, above all the United States. As a result, the territory of Saudi Arabia was a springboard for delivering the multinational forces' attack on Iraq. Considering the instability of the Near Eastern situation and danger of the outbreak of new armed conflicts, the leaders of Saudi Arabia activated measures for developing and upgrading the national Armed Forces in the post-crisis period. Special attention was given to reoutfitting the army with new kinds of weapons and military equipment by purchases abroad, above all in the United States, Great Britain and France; upgrading the troops' organizational structure and combat training; and increasing their numbers sharply. Thus, while the numerical strength of personnel of all branches was 67,500 and that of the National Guard 35,000 in 1990, it reached 102,000 and 55,000 respectively in 1993. Supreme military command and control entities (Fig. 1). The King is supreme commander of the Armed Forces. He exercises overall leadership of them through the Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation as well as through the Chief of the General Staff. The consultative body is the Defense Council, which includes the King, Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation, ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance and National Economy, and Communications, Chief of the General Staff and Commander of the National Guard. Fig. 1. Saudi Arabian Armed The Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation directs the Armed Forces via the General Staff. He is responsible for their status, combat readiness and organizational development. The General Staff is an operational leadership entity which includes four directorates (operations and combat training, intelligence, personnel, logistics), a Finance Service and a Medical Service. Leadership of the Armed Forces is wholly in the hands of the royal family. The posts of Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation, commander of the National Guard, their deputies and even commanders of individual subunits are held by the King's relatives. The Armed Forces organizationally consist of the Army, Air Force, Air Defense Force, Navy and National Guard. The Army (69,000) is the principal and largest branch of the Armed Forces. Its order of battle includes two armored brigades, five mechanized brigades, one airborne brigade, a Royal Guard regiment, two motorized infantry brigades and four infantry brigades of the National Guard, and five separate artillery battalions. The brigade is the highest tactical unit. The armored brigade has three tank battalions, an artillery battalion, AAA battalion, and logistic support subunits. It has over 100 tanks and other weapons and military equipment in the inventory. The mechanized brigade includes three motorized infantry battalions, a tank battalion, artillery battalion, AAA battalion, antitank battalion, and support and service subunits. It has up to 40 tanks, over 40 field artillery pieces and mortars, ATGM launchers, air defense weapons, APC's and motor vehicles in the inventory. An infantry brigade consists of three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, antitank battery, AAA battery, and logistic support subunits. There are field artillery pieces, mortars, air defense weapons (including shoulder-fired SAM systems), APC's and motor vehicles in the inventory. The airborne brigade includes airborne battalions, artillery and mortar subunits, and antitank weapons. The Army has a total of around 700 tanks (up to 400 M60A3 and 300 AMX-30), 235 combat reconnaissance vehicles, around 700 IFV's, 1,700 APC's (including vehicles of their own production, Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), up to 400 field artillery pieces (105-mm, 155-mm and 203.2-mm), 70 MLRS, around 400 mortars (81-mm and 106.7-mm), around 800 antitank weapons (TOW, Dragon, HOT and Vigilant ATGM's and also 90-mm and 106-mm recoilless guns), over 500 air defense weapons (Redeye and Stinger shoulder-fired SAM systems and Vulcan self-propelled AA guns), and around 30 army aviation helicopters. The Air Force (18,000) has combat (fighter and fighter-bomber) and auxiliary aviation in its makeup. The squadron is the main organizational unit. The Air Force has a total of 19 squadrons: six fighter-bomber (52 F-5E and 45 Tornado aircraft, Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]), five fighter-interceptor (78 F-15 and 24 Tornado aircraft), three transport (40 C-130E and H, 35 C-212), three training (BAC-167, Hawk, Cessna) and two helicopter squadrons (AB-205, -206 and -212). For basing aircraft Saudi Arabia has bases and airfields whose overall capacity, in the assessment of foreign specialists, fully satisfies the needs of the national Air Force. The main bases and airfields are Riyadh, Dhahran, Jiddah, Taif, Tabuk and Khamis Mushayat. The Air Defense Force (4,000) was removed from the Air Force as an independent branch of the Armed Forces in late 1986. It has 16 Improved Hawk SAM batteries (128 launchers) and 17 Crotale (Shahine) SAM batteries (68 launchers). The Navy (11,000) organizationally consists of two commands, Western (Red Sea) and Eastern (Persian Gulf). The Navy has around 60 ships and craft of various types, of which there are 4 corvettes equipped with Harpoon antiship missiles, 4 frigates with Otomat antiship missiles, 9 missile craft (Fig. 4 [figure not reproduced]), 3 torpedo boats, 20 patrol craft, 6 minesweeper/hunters, and 8 landing craft. The Navy also includes a Marine regiment (1,500 persons) and 24 Dauphin 2 helicopters. The main naval bases and basing facilities are Jiddah, Al Jubayl, Ras Tanura, Dammam, Yanbu, Qatif and Ras al Mishab. The National Guard (55,000), established in 1958, is an independent force element and holds a special place in the Armed Forces system. Its basic purpose is to protect members of the royal family, government establishments, oil fields and so on. It has two motorized infantry brigades (four battalions each), four infantry brigades, a ceremonial squadron and support subunits in its makeup. Its inventory includes around 1,100 Commando APC's, 30 105-mm howitzers, mortars, TOW ATGM's, recoilless guns and Vulcan self-propelled AA guns. Armed Forces manpower acquisition is accomplished by the volunteer enlistment principle. Basic military training of the rank and file is conducted at training centers and that of NCO's and specialists in military schools of branches of the Armed Forces. Training of officer cadres is conducted in Saudi Arabian military colleges and that of higher officer personnel and of equipment and armament operation and maintenance specialists is done abroad, chiefly in the United States, Great Britain, France and other countries.
