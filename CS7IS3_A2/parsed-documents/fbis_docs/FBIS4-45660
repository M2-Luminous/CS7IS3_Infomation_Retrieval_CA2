About 25 million German marks [DM] will be spent on developing and testing reclamation processes for use on heavily contaminated soil at the former Buna chemicals combine, the Ilsenburg copper mill, and the Zichow hazardous waste dump. Approximately DM19 million are earmarked for the Buna project, where the main emphasis is on dealing with high concentrations of mercury contamination. In addition to developing and testing analysis and surveying methods for use in hazard assessment, the team will work out environment-compatible, economically viable methods for demolishing the buildings and machinery. A representative quantity of contaminated material and soil will also be reconditioned in the course of the project. The second pilot project is the Ilsenburg copper mill, which is contaminated with a high level of heavy metals, dioxins, and furans, as is the area surrounding it. An initial DM4.2 million will be spent in the first stage on developing reliable processes for decontaminating factory buildings that cannot be demolished in the normal way. The third site is the "Great Zichow Hollow," a sink still in use as late as 1989 as a hazardous waste dump for solid, viscous, and fluid waste. As it has no underseal, it poses a hazard to the groundwater and the surrounding drinking water conservation area. In addition to securing the sink to avert this danger, the first phase of the project will draw up a strategy for decontaminating the solid and fluid waste. The second phase will cover a partial reclamation of the dump by a combination of various methods.
