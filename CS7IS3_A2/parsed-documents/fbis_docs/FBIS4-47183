Landsbergis: `Elections in the Spring are the Way Out of the Crisis'"] [Text] At a press conference at the Seimas yesterday, V. Landsbergis, the leader of the rightist opposition, stated that a crisis has gripped the country's current government and that this crisis is very "evident in debates dealing with the fate of the government." According to the professor, the various discussions indicate that the ruling party itself comprehends that the government is not coping with its tasks, and this was why it was looking for someone to blame. The non-party ministers, justice minister J. Prapiestis and finance minister E. Vilkelis, could become these "scapegoats." The LDDP, with no younger members in its ranks and therefore without a future, is rushing about looking for a way out and for personnel who could be nominated for positions in the government. Alas, the LDDP reserve ranks consist of only the old nomenklatura. Can another government be formed from the same resources, could it work better with such a majority? "It is clear that this would not be worthwhile," Landsbergis said. However, it seems that there are reserves in other parties, and the opposition could without a doubt form a government, although there is no purpose in doing so with the kind of majority that currently exists in the Seimas. And the LDDP will not fool very many people by changing ministers in the current government. This is why the theoretical discussion initiated by the LDDP on a party-based, political-based, or competence-based government does not make much sense either. Here you have continual contradictions "which are outlined particularly exhaustively in the article by Mr. Kirkilas in TIESA." The professor analyzed and commented upon this article (which appeared on 21 May) in some detail; he also drew quite a few conclusions. One of these was that the composition of the new government would be deliberated "not by the entire LDDP convention, but rather by some kind of politburo." The president would not be a participant either, but rather, it appears, would only execute the decisions. Also, the statements made by the president himself are quite contradictory: in speaking all the time about the stability of the government he says that a fundamental renewal of the government is required. "It seems that stability applies only to the very top or to the confirmation in the Seimas of the same personnel who are already in the government, in order to create the illusion that the government is new, and that it should not be criticized for a period of time. Or maybe this is simply avoiding responsibility," V. Landsbergis said. In that same article by G. Kirkilas, there is "an unclear offer of coalition to those who are unnecessarily issuing interpellations," according to the professor. Obviously the LDDP comprehends that the burden of governing is not after all so simple. This is why the "old gimmick" was again being used, namely, that the opposition had refused to cooperate. This was not true, because the opposition had refused only after "being kicked": it had offered on a number of occasions to reach agreement reasonably on some very concrete issues. But the ruling party had not accepted a single proposal, because it is convinced that it alone has a mandate to govern the country. The results are plain to see: internally, great damage resulting from the governing of the LDDP, and abroad, time has been wasted in many areas learning some elementary things. The only good thing is that the LDDP is already beginning to understand that it is necessary to be more oriented toward the West. So the only "democratic and civilized" way out of the current crisis is to hold new elections next spring, in the opinion of the leader of the opposition. The Seimas itself could make such a decision. V. Landsbergis called the initiative by the Nationalists for early elections correct, but said they had not quite started in time. For this reason, the initiative might be unsuccessful.
