FR940228-0-00061 FR940228-0-00014 Authority: Secs. 4(i), 4(j) and 220 as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j), and 220 unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 32.22 (a), (c), (d), and (f) is revised to read as follows: §32.22 Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation. (a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences which would be considered material for published financial report purposes. Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or credit entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any calendar year over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax temporary differences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be included in the following accounts: 4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes; 4110, Net Current Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes; 4340, Net Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income Taxes; 4350, Net Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes. In lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company shall treat the increase or reduction in current income taxes payable resulting from the use of flow through accounting in prior years as an increase or reduction in current tax expense. * * * * * (c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph (a) of this section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The amount recorded in the subsidiary record should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is likely to be realized. (d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify the nature of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and credits to the individual accounts. * * * * * (f) The tax differentials to be normalized as specified in this section shall also encompass the additional effect of state and local income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the provision for deferred state and local income taxes for book/tax temporary differences related to such income taxes. * * * * * 3. Section 32.103 is amended by adding account 32.1437 to the list of accounts to read as follows: §32.103 Balance sheet accounts for other than regulated-fixed assets to be maintained.
