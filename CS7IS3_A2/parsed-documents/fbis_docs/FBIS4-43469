Why have we reached this deadlock situation when, at the last Clinton-Yelstin summit in Moscow, everything seemed to be going smoothly and in the right direction? In my view, we should see in this much more the effect of Russia's domestic policy than any misunderstanding about the case of the ultimatum and the air strike in Bosnia. Everything changed in Russia after the first free parliamentary elections on 12 December last year, which were clearly fair and which saw the victory of the extremists (right and left) over the center. Indeed, the new Duma (Russia's national assembly) contains a slight majority of right-wing extremists (Zhirinovskiy and other nationalists) and left-wing extremists (Communist Party, "Women of Russia," and agrarians). It is they who immediately decreed the release of Rutskoy and Khasbulatov, the defeated parties in last October's confrontation between President Yeltsin and the Assembly, which saw the White House, seat of the assembly, shelled and stormed. It is they who oppose President Yeltsin's policy of rapprochement between Russia and the United States, between Russia and NATO. These political forces, nationalists of all kinds, harking back to Greater Russia and the empire to be rebuilt, form a constant threat for the president, which he is forced to take into account. Hence his vacillations and about-faces, and those of his Foreign Minister Kozyrev. Anything is a pretext for glorifying Russia, placing the emphasis on the humiliation it has suffered at the West's hands. For these people, NATO is the 45-year old enemy, which triumphed over the Warsaw Pact and with which no compromise is possible! The situation of the Russian minorities in the Baltic countries, NATO's alleged exclusion of Russia during the bombing raids around Gorazde, the Ukrainian claims to Crimea, anything is a pretext for attacking the government, calling for Mr. Kozyrev's resignation, and planning the 1996 presidential campaign against Yeltsin. This is the situation. We are perhaps on the eve of the reawakening of imperialist Russia, taking up, through the CIS, the USSR's hegemony over its neighbors. Nationalist Issue Belarus, which has never formed a state in the past, is already returning to the Russian fold. Ukraine, a country bigger than France inhabited by 50 million people, is floundering in economic depression and is close to disintegration, with the west (the former Westernized Galicia) opposing the east (Kharkov region, inhabited by Russians), and not to mention Crimea given to Ukraine by Khrushchev, himself a Ukrainian, which is inhabited mainly by Russians and which Russia is claiming. The division of the Black Sea Fleet is raising apparently insoluble problems and is accompanied by the Russians' desire to occupy Sevastopol as a naval base within a network of some 20 military bases in the nearby CIS countries. The disparity in power between Russia and its CIS neighbors is such that it is difficult to see how the first can fail to collect its stake quickly and peacefully, unless Ukraine alone is reluctant. Russia has asked the United Nations to give it a peace-keeping mandate in the countries of the former USSR, thus behaving toward the former Soviet republics, and especially Central Asia, in the same way as the mandate which could be given to NATO in Central Europe. Partnership for Peace Russia, this very big country which remains a superpower with its 30,000 or so nuclear warheads and its 2 million men under arms, regards itself as a "Eurasian" power and not simply as a European power. Zhirinovskiy, who received 25 percent of the votes in December 1993, and 75 percent of the Army's votes, dreams of conquering the south and of access to the Indian Ocean. Others aspire to regain a foothold in the Baltic from Kaliningrad and bases in Latvia; yet others are looking toward Poland and Romania, via Moldova. In short, Russia is in turmoil and, although it is true that the people are primarily concerned with feeding themselves and coping with the numerous problems of everyday life, the standard of living being only the equivalent of around 500 francs per month, the politicians are working to ensure respect for Russia and demanding for it preferential status in Europe in face of the Atlantic alliance. This confrontational attitude merely strengthens the malaise and fear of the countries on the European fringes, former satellites of the USSR, which are now enjoying the taste of freedom. We should not be surprised at the fact that the former Communists, now back in power in Bulgaria and Poland, are demanding, like those of Romania and Slovakia, or like the moderate leaders of the Czech Republic or Hungary, immediate or almost immediate entry into NATO. As president of the NATO Assembly, I have met with them and they have all begged me to ensure that the Partnership for Peace, which they immediately signed, should be the first step leading to full integration into NATO, which Russia obviously does not want at any cost. Scarcely five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe is once again facing its old demons of extreme nationalism, xenophobia, wars of religion, ostracism, and rivalry based on the desire for power. Bosnia, this terrible sore on the flank of our continent, will poison interstate relations for a long time. West Europe's inability to take action when there was still time, the spectacle of Europe's squabbling over Maastricht and expansion, mean that Europe is likely to remain a dwarf on the international chessboard and that, once again, as was the case for 45 years, the decisions are made in Washington and Moscow. I draw two conclusions from that which strike me as crystal clear. The first is that, in this dangerous world fraught with many threats, France is right not to drop its military guard and to propose a Military Programming Law which strengthens our defense and our ability to intervene. The second is that France is right to make every effort to ensure that the European Union, on the basis of the Franco-German tandem, asserts itself economically, politically, and militarily and is capable of imposing itself as a factor of stability and security in Europe.
