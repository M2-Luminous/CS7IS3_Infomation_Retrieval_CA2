He said so at Monday's conference with the heads of local government bodies. This does not mean a change in the general political course, he explained. According to him, some provisions and concepts adopted earlier are untenable and illusory, and the real developments in the country's political and economic life make it necessary to alter objectives. He continues to be in favor of democracy, Akayev pointed out, but real life has proved that democratic methods are ineffective, that they hinder the endeavors to reach tangible results on the road to reforms. Under the circumstances a strong state power has no alternative, since "The people are not prepared for democracy," Akayev stressed. He will resolutely dismiss those people who will hinder the implementation of government resolutions or stand in the way of carrying out the program for economic restructuring to be accomplished in the next three years. On the other hand, Akayev noted that "we could establish an authoritarian regime, as other CIS states did, the more so as many want it, but this will be unproductive." The passion for parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan has led to the fact that the Supreme Council engaged in politically-motivated criminal investigations, not in normal legislative activity, taking up the duties of the national security committee, Interior Ministry and courts of justice, which scared the potential investors away. "Many people in Kyrgyzstan viewed parliament as the apotheosis of democracy," Akayev stressed. "In the meantime the activity of the present legislature hinders the country's movement on the road of reforms and creates the reputation of a scandalous country for Kyrgyzstan."
