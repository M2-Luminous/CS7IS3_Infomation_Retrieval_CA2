The shelling of Sarajevo has ceased, and all thanks to American diplomacy, NATO bombers and British generals. Our television screens will no longer see this nightly pollution. At last we have done something well in Bosnia. Hurrah for intervention. Now let the peacemakers of the air move on to Tuzla and Gorazde, to Maglaj and Bihac, to the ratruns and sewers of Mostar. As so often with Bosnia I must rub my eyes in disbelief. The one truly significant event of the week has been the arrival of Russians in the Bosnian stew. The Serbs were never going to capture Sarajevo. Their guns were merely securing a status quo partition of the city. Had NATO planes tried to bomb those guns, they might or might not have pulled back. What is sure is that a wider guerrilla war against aid convoys and foreign troops would have ensued and the Russians would have ended any UN consensus. This would have been disastrous for everyone -- a point Douglas Hurd has pleaded in vain in Washington and Paris. In the event, Boris Yeltsin has saved the West from its own recklessness. The Serbs have been given cover for a tactical withdrawal from Sarajevo -- to concentrate on fighting Muslims elsewhere -- with a guarantee that the Serb positions would not come under Muslim counterattack. Mr Yeltsin also warned NATO not to try any bombing threats elsewhere in Bosnia. He marched his troops into the cheering Bosnian Serb capital of Pale, and with good reason declared a triumph for Slav solidarity. Perhaps the Bosnian civil war can now end happily and soon. Perhaps the coming of the Russians will dissuade the Muslims from a spring counteroffensive: good news for desperate civilians caught on the front lines. Perhaps Bill Clinton will find some other outlet for America's periodic craving to bomb foreigners. Perhaps Lord Owen will even persuade the Muslims that they must sooner or later live under UN protection surrounded by a new Croatia/Serbia, and may as well do so now. Perhaps the internationalisation of this war will stop. Perhaps pigs will fly. Only the most deluded could see the events of the past week as other than a victory for Russia and Serbia. Certainly the Sarajevo government is not cheering. It said, with rare realism, that NATO had entrenched Serbia's aggression and pre-empted any new Muslim offensive. The siege guns may have fallen silent; as at Srebrenica, the price is the silence of the besieged. Sarajevo is now to become the playground of international statesmen, another Berlin or Beirut. Lord Owen said yesterday that the time had come for everyone, "both the Americans and the Russians, to become more heavily involved." God preserve the place. Into Sarajevo's green lines and enclaves will pour superdiplomacy, supercharity, prestige and unctuous concern. As Tweedledum remarked, let's fight until six then have dinner...and then perhaps fight again. In asking Russia to commit soldiers to Bosnia, NATO this week put a bullet in its revolver, spun the chamber and placed the barrel at its head. Slav revanchism in Yugoslavia was the final horror against which the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, jokingly warned the West a year ago. With troops committed to a Slav civil war -- forget their blue berets -- what Russian politician will dare withdraw them short of victory? What then if some foolish European politician (such as Malcolm Rifkind last week) goads America into sending troops to help lift the Serbian sieges? If America believes the bombing threat changed everything in Sarajevo last week, why not go further? Why not see if the Russians are bluffing? Drop a few bombs to test them. Send a few troops. After all, it was only a handful of advisers that Lyndon Johnson sent to Da Nang in 1965, after 150 bombers failed to convince the Vietcong of America's commitment. What we are seeing in Bosnia is a crucial turning point in the course of an intervention. The NATO/UN forces are no longer obeying their original objective of escorting humanitarian aid. They are plainly seeking a war aim, a shift in the military balance of a civil conflict. This is the shift against which every strategist warned two years ago. The magnetism of war distorts rules of engagement. Escorting convoys becomes returning fire in self-defence. Mediating skirmishes becomes drawing maps and negotiating ceasefires. Protecting enclaves becomes aiding combatants. Delivering supplies becomes taking sides. And as you sink into this mire, you beckon frantically for others to join you, even Russians. The media have invented a new tense in which to advocate these risky adventures: the unfulfillable future conditional. In Somalia American forces were encouraged ashore but only "if they leave behind a new political and security framework." So said a unanimous British and American press. There was no chance of this condition being met, but the armchair strategist was neatly off the hook. He could accuse the non-interventionist of cowardice, yet blame the eventual fiasco on "failures of implementation." Similarly, Sunday's relief of Sarajevo is hailed as a vindication of air power, but only if the Serbs can show themselves magnanimous towards the Muslims and not simply shift their guns and soldiers elsewhere. (In which case NATO will have cynically abetted Serb aggression.) Again, the condition will not be fulfilled and the media and opposition politicians will heap scorn on governments for not "giving the UN the tools for the job." A month ago, John Major was being asked in the Commons when he was going to pull out of Bosnia. Yesterday MPs demanded to know which city he would relieve next. Foreign intervention is a whimsical affair. I believe that for two years the outside world has contrived, however messily, to do the right thing in former Yugoslavia. It has offered two services to a nation for whose factionalism it is not remotely responsible: a conciliation forum in Geneva and huge charitable relief. The UN's one mistake was to support that relief with soldiers -- unlike in Ethiopia or other recent civil wars. It thus gave each side the opportunity to plead with the soldiers for help and taunt them for their impotence. Both services lost their point at least a year ago. As Lord Owen and others have recently admitted, intervention is almost certainly prolonging the conflict. The Muslims are rearming and recovering some lost ground. Mercenaries are everywhere. Rural communities are looting food, money and presumably weapons meant for the besieged. Each side can blame outsiders for their misery, while denying their leaders any negotiating manoeuvre. A month ago UN troops seemed on the brink of being withdrawn from Bosnia. Barely a quarter of relief supplies were reaching their intended destination. UN soldiers were dying. Yet it was apparent to the Geneva negotiators that no side was exhausted enough to sue for peace. The French were reluctant to pull out, trapped by domestic politics, but Britain was ready to leave, as were the Dutch. The Bosnians might at last have been left to find their own path to peace, and the aid agencies left to do the best they can unprotected. The mortaring of Sarajevo market on February 5 -- by whom is still unclear -- put paid to that. There is no more powerful magnet to military escalation than foreign corpses on American television and a talented (rather than a whining) general on the ground, in the form of Britain's Sir Michael Rose. Withdrawal suddenly became unthinkable. That fell phrase was heard, "NATO's patience is exhausted." The gods of war put on the clothes of peace and banged their drums. Convoy assistance was no longer the objective. Ceasefires had to be enforced. Bosnia now faces the Tolstoyan fate of being a land over which foreign powers will test their strength. We are back to square one. Satellite reconnaissance plots new Serbian targets. Battalions go on standby. Those not yet committed, the Americans and the Germans, are shown the white feather. Behind the strident editorials can be heard the strains of "Oh What a Lovely War." We have lifted the siege of Sarajevo as we lifted that of Mafeking. Which siege next, Mr Major? Are you a man or a mouse? So what if the Russians are really on the other side. We have dealt with their like before. Now is no time to cut and run. Come on in America. This is where your president can find his glory. To war! I wish we would all get out of Bosnia and leave it to finish its own dreary business on its own. We are not helping. We congratulate ourselves for Sarajevo. For what? For showing how good we are at prolonging other peoples troubles.
