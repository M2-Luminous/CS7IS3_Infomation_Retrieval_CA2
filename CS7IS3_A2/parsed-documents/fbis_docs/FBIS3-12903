French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe recently said it is highly likely that Iraq will soon resume its oil exports. A French source said Iraqi-French negotiations on developing oil investments have been conducted on a regular basis in Baghdad. The talks were moved this week to Paris where an Iraqi delegation, led by the Oil Ministry undersecretary, has arrived. Moving the talks to Paris indicates the extent of the progress made and France's desire to restore relations with Iraq. The visit was made at the invitation of France. This means French diplomacy will act to lift the embargo. The two French oil companies have shown interest because Iraq has the world's second largest oil reserves. Commenting on this development in Iraqi-French ties, British sources in London said Iraq will likely become, once the embargo is lifted, an arena for competition among French, Italian, German, British, and U.S. companies. Officials from these companies have been frequenting Baghdad for months to win contracts with Iraq, especially in the field of food agriculture and pharmaceutical items not included by the embargo. They are awaiting major deals worth tens of billions of dollars, as was the case in the seventies and eighties, once the embargo is completely lifted. Even if the embargo is partially lifted, this would constitute progress, since the Iraqi economy has high production capabilities and rich resources.
