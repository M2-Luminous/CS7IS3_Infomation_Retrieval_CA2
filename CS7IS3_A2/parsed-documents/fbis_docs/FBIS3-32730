Applying the Law on Venue Dispute -- a law promulgated today by the executive branch -- the high court ratified its earlier ruling by voting 3-2 in favor of the military court handling the case. The Supreme Council of Military Justice and Lima's 16th Criminal Court have been informed of the decision. Going against the opinion of the Constituent Democratic Congress, the attorney general, distinguished attorneys, and Amnesty International, the Criminal Branch of the Supreme Court finally ruled on the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta case by applying Law 26291, which went into effect today. Following the suspension of a public hearing convened by ruling Justice Carlos Giusti Acuna -- a hearing held at 1100 to allow the parties involved to make oral statements -- the decision from the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court was released to journalists without comment from Supreme Court President Luis Serpa Segura or Criminal Court President Moises Pantoja. The document applying Law 26291 upholds an earlier ruling on the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta case. Justices Pantoja, Iberico Mas, and Montes de Oca Vegazo voted in favor of the military court hearing the case, while Justices Almenara Bryson and Sivina Hurtado voted in favor of the civilian court. The decision has been reported to the Supreme Council of Military Justice and Lima's 16th Criminal Court.
