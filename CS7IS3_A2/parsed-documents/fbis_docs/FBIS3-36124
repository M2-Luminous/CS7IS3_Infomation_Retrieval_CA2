The government will supplement the budget incomes with 30 million lats of Bank of Latvia's profit payments and cut the administrative reform's fund by 1.2 million lats, Gailis said. The group also confirmed a plan to form a working party for free trade talks with the European Union and passed for Saeima [parliament] consideration a bill on Latvia's signature to international labor conventions. The Cabinet failed to accept a resolution on social guarantees for parentless children and regulations on easier public transportation tariffs to certain categories of residents, said government spokesman Sergei Ancupov.
