He answers questions from economic commentator Soichiro Tawara at the Asahi Television studio in Tokyo. Yamagishi is first asked how he rates the performance so far of the coalition government. He says: "I would give it 70 percent." To get higher marks, he adds, the need for the government to discontinue bureaucrat-led politics. He says: "At this juncture, the ruling coalition has no choice but to implement large-scale income tax cuts. But they should not carry out both the cuts and a consumption tax hike at the same time as one package, as the Ministry of Finance (MOF) proposes." He believes, like the leaders of the ruling coalition parties, that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also hopes to separate the income tax cuts from the consumption tax rise and implement large-scale income tax cuts. He notes, however: "Bureaucrats in the MOF are preventing the government from doing so." He thinks differences within the ruling coalition on tax reform are also hampering Hosokawa's attempts to make a decision. Tawara points out that disunity among members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) is an obstacle to the formation of a consensus on political reform within the ruling coalition and asks Yamagishi how the party should act. He refers to speculation the SDPJ might split or leave the ruling coalition following its party convention on 11 and 12 January. Yamagishi says: "I do not think this will happen. I do not think the SDPJ would do anything so ridiculous." Asked what he thinks of moves to form new groups within the SDPJ, Yamagishi says: "I think that would be acceptable. The party will not be able to cope with the second phase of political realignment if it sticks to its current organization." Yamagishi then begins to discuss his idea of a two-party system composed of a conservative party and an non-conservative party and notes the need for the SDPJ to lead the non-conservative forces. Tawara asks Yamagishi what he discussed with Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi when he met him on 20 December. Yokomichi is considered likely to play a pivotal role in strengthening the unity of the SDPJ in the future. Yamagishi says: "We shared the same views on the idea of realizing a two-party system composed of a conservative party and an non-conservative force, not a two-party system composed of two conservative parties. We agreed that the SDPJ, as a non-conservative party, should join with centrist, liberal, and other forces to form a large political party." Asked whether Yokomichi intended to enter the national political arena, Yamagishi says: "I feel he will be ready to return to the national political scene once his tenure as governor expires in April 1995. This was only an impression, though, because he did not say so." During discussions on Rengo's hopes for the non-conservative force Yamagishi is asked about tax reform. Yamagishi says: "I strongly oppose the idea of implementing income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike as one package, but I do not oppose raising the consumption tax. It is just that I do not see it as necessary to have a timetable for its implementation. Turning to the issue of economic recovery, Tawara asks Yamagishi what he thinks the government should do to stimulate the economy. Yamagishi says: "I think the government has no alternative but to implement large-scale tax cuts worth about 10 trillion yen separately from raising consumption tax." Yamagishi is then asked to comment on Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers' Associations) Chairman Nagano's remarks that his group would this year try to secure employment by not pushing for wage rises. Yamagishi approves of the idea of securing employment, but notes the need for Nikkeiren to try to increase wages as well as secure employment. The interview ends at 0214 GMT.
