The conference is designed for exchanging information on Japanese auto parts makers hoping business in China and on Chinese products and factories which may interest Japanese companies. Some Western automakers, including Volkswagen of Germany and Chrysler of the United States, are taking part in Chinese national projects on automobile development but Japanese companies are far behind in this field. Under such circumstances, MITI decided to pave the way for Japanese companies' advance into the growing Chinese market. MITI has already started listing domestic parts manufacturers that want to set up production strongpoints in China, aiming at promotion of joint ventures in the auto industry. The conference will be organized by officials of the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association and Chinese auto and auto parts makers. They will meet periodically to accelerate bilateral cooperation through exchanging information on definite plans for business tie-ups. The formal accord is expected to be concluded in May, when Chinese State Planning Commission officials visit Japan. China's automobile production counted 1.4 million units in 1993, and production has doubled in the last three years. Some estimates say the figure will reach 3 million in 2000. While Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki are participating in China's national automobile projects, no major Japanese automakers are involved in. In general, Japanese automakers' ties with China is weaker than those of Western automakers. The Chinese Government is attaching importance to developing its own auto parts industries, and it called for Japan's assistance to the national policy when a Japanese automakers' mission visited Beijing in the fall of 1993. In response, Nissan's affiliated Kinugawa Rubber Industrial Co. Ltd. established a joint venture company in Tianjin. Also, Yazaki Corporation and Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. have subsidy companies in Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively. Some auto parts makers are conducting feasibility studies on operations in China, and the "cooperation conference" is expected to accelerate moves toward technological assistance and joint ventures. About 4,000 auto parts factories are reportedly conducting business in China, but only 20 are subsidies of Japanese auto parts makers. In the ninth Five-Year Economic Plan starting in 1996, China intends to improve productivity of auto parts makers through mergers and large-scale management.
