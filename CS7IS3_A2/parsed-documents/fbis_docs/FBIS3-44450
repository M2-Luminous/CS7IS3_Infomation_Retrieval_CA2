Mentioning the Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping said: Britain is stirring up certain political trouble [gao xie zheng zhi feng bo 2269 0067 2398 3112 7364 3134] to probe our reaction and this is what we have long anticipated. It would be strange if the British did not do such things and in the remaining time, they will continue to do such things. Britain is unwilling to see the disappearance of its political and economic influence [shi li 0528 0500] in Hong Kong. However, the British Government should be aware that the Chinese Government and the Chinese people will not sit idly by and allow Britain to do such things. The timetable for recovering Hong Kong is determined by the Chinese Government. The sources also said that Zeng Qinghong, director of the CPC Central Committee's General Office, told Deng that in two opinion polls in some major mainland cities, 99 percent of the people supported the Central Government's policy on the Hong Kong issue. However, some people thought that the central government was not tough enough toward Britain and still cherished unrealistic "illusions." Some people even criticized the central government for being "rightist" on this issue. Deng said: I do not think there is any rightism. We should give time to Britain to perform. The Preliminary Work Committee should now quicken its work and should work in a down-to-earth manner. Britain's political attempts will not succeed because Hong Kong belongs to China. According to sources, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu recently gave separate speeches on the situation in the Sino-British talks and the central policy on the Hong Kong issue to various central departments, commissions, offices, and military academies. Jiang Enzhu also answered questions raised by cadres in the Ministry of National Defense and its affiliate institutions. Li Lanqing said: In addition to playing political tricks, Britain also tried to undermine Hong Kong's economy, including Hong Kong's financial conditions. The central authorities were prepared against this in 1990. When talking with British Foreign Secretary Howe on 31 July 1984, Comrade Xiaoping expressed the hope that the British Hong Kong authorities would persuade British companies not to take the lead in transferring funds out of Hong Kong. However, if the British decided to withdraw their funds, we would not try to keep them from quitting; if they tried to reenter Hong Kong later, we would not hold a welcome meeting. If some people want to quit, it is certain that other people are willing to come. The key lies in China's political stability and vigorous economic development, with the policy toward Hong Kong remaining unchanged. Britain is trying to stir up trouble and undermine the Hong Kong economy in order to prolong its colonial rule. Britain's attempt to foster a pro- British and anti-China force, which attaches itself to foreigners, to disrupt Hong Kong's smooth transition and disrupt the work of the future special administrative region [SAR] government will not succeed. The central government has the ability and strength to ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and development. We shall not only protect local-funded enterprises but also foreign-funded enterprises in Hong Kong and we shall create more favorable conditions for foreign investors. The Hong Kong stock market has been soaring in recent months and many foreign investments are long- or medium-term ones. Foreign investment in China was almost twice as much as that in the same period of last year. This shows that the troublesome events in Hong Kong only had a temporary impact on the situation and it was China's policies that played a decisive role in maintaining Hong Kong's development. Even if disorder occurs in Hong Kong, the unrest will not last long. The central government will adopt resolute measures to solve the problem. Li Lanqing also said: In the future, China will give full consideration to the foreign companies and businessmen who have made substantial contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, and have sincerely cooperated with the Chinese Government, will be given more favorable consideration regarding their interests and development space in China. The Chinese Government acts in good faith and greatly cherishes friendship. Jiang Enzhu said: When holding talks with the British Government on the convergence of Hong Kong's political structure before and after 1997, the Chinese Government did not give up its principles. It was the British side which deliberately stirred up trouble to undermine the talks but the decision of the Chinese Government to hold the talks was still correct. In the 17 rounds of talks, the British side fully laid bare its sinister purpose of stirring up political trouble in order to prolong British colonial rule or the influence of the British colonialist ideology. This was a good thing. Jiang Enzhu added: Because Britain violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Joint Declaration has lost its function and value. Britain went as far as to flagrantly negate the existence of the agreements reached by the Chinese and British Governments. This is rarely seen in international relations. The statements and agreements between the two countries and between the two governments must be jointly observed and implemented by the two sides. If one side seriously violates the agreement and insists on continuing such violation, or even negates the existence of such statements and agreements, then the statements and agreements will lose their binding force on the other side. Jiang also said: On the Hong Kong issue, Britain even interfered in China's internal affairs and challenged China's sovereign power. It was natural that Britain's practice was rejected by the Chinese Government. Jiang said: The central government still does not endorse the demand of some localities, departments, institutions, and schools to stage demonstrations in front of the British Embassy and consulates. Such a form of expression is not suited to our country's current political environment but this idea cannot be regarded as a wrong one. Reportedly, since early December, more than 40 institutions, schools, and organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Guangzhou have applied to stage demonstrations to protest against Britain's behavior in trampling upon the Sino-British Joint Declaration but their applications were not approved by the authorities.
