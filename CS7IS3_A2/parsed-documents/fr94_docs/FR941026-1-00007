FR941026-1-00007 FR941026-1-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;17] Proposed Establishment and Alteration of Jet Routes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposal would establish new jet routes and modify existing jet routes in the Miami, FL, area. Establishing new jet routes and realigning existing routes are necessary as a result of the commissioning of the Virginia Key, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range and Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME). DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, ASO&hyph;500 Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;17, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, GA 30320. The official docket may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 916, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the office of the Regional Air Traffic Division. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255.

Availability of NPRM's Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;220, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3485. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and to alter various jet routes in the Miami, FL, area. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative. The Biscayne Bay VOR was a navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently, several of the jet routes previously based on the Biscayne Bay Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range had to be realigned with other navigational aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to support the air traffic operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational aid will necessitate the realignment of existing routes. Additionally, the establishment of several new jet routes is necessary to provide additional support for air traffic operations in the Miami area. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. ICAO Considerations As part of this proposal relate to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices. Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve the safety and efficiency of air operations. The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for the safety of civil aircraft. Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10854.
