Nothing is said in their applications that they are resigning because they do not agree with the policy pursued by heads of the ministry," Public Health Minister Eduard Nechayev told ITAR-TASS, commenting on the resignation of First Deputy Minister Aleksey Moskvichev and Deputy Minister Vladimir Starodubov. New candidates to the posts have already been found, a ministry spokesman told ITAR-TASS. They are doctors of medicine and, in the opinion of senior officials, they are skilled professionals. According to the same source, the two resigning deputy ministers will quickly find employment for themselves. Starodubov will probably continue to work at the medical institute. He combined that job with working as deputy minister.
