The Bosnian Serbs are said to have laid down conditions for the release of this Netherlander UN observer. The Defense Ministry inferred this from a telephone conversation with General Bastiaans, head of the UN Military Observers (UNMO's). The conditions which the UNMO must meet are not known. The Defense Ministry assumes that Van Baal will serve as "bargaining chip" for better relations with the UN troops.
