A combined infantry force of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam based in and around the Old Microrayan housing estate attacked pro-Rabbani troops across the Kabul River in an attempt to establish a foothold there. "The enemy's morale was too weak to sustain an infantry attack so they used their heavy weapons," frontline commander Sabor of the defending pro-Rabbani troops told AFP. Speaking from his base in the new Microrayan housing estate facing the Uzbek opposition dug-in no more than 100 metres across the Kabul River, Sabor said three of his men were wounded while he had received a report that at least 10 of the attacking force had been killed. The 30-minute exchange of small-arms fire was the most intense witnessed by locals for several weeks. Even to the rear of the combat zone in Wazir Akbar Khan residential area, incoming rounds smacked against houses like rain-drops on a tin roof. Pro-Rabbani troops based in the apartments of the new Microrayan housing estate have converted what were once bedrooms and sitting-rooms to frontline bunkers with firing slits protected by massive walls of sandbags. Even so, from the heights of the Uzbek-occupied Maranjan Hill behind Old Microrayan, direct hits by Dostam's heavy artillery gunners have broken up the steel-reinforced concrete walls of these four-storey apartment blocks like they were lumps of dry cake. On Wednesday, delegates said to be representing 15 peace organizations met at the Intercontinental Hotel and proposed a unified draft aimed at ending the factional fighting in Afghanistan. In 11 articles which rehash previously tried and failed proposals, the Unified Draft of the Afghan Joint Reconciliative Assembly calls for a ceasefire and the convening of a national Grand Assembly to elect a parliament and new Afghan leader. While considerable thought has been given to the mechanics of selecting delegates to the National Assembly, the establishment of a ceasefire -- a necessary prerequisite for an election -- is mentioned only in passing. The prospects of immediate peace in Kabul can only be advanced by a sincere reconciliation between the two main rivals, Rabbani and Hekmatyar, who until now have refused to come to terms with each other, observers said.
