Addressing the delegation, President Aliyev said that Azerbaijan supports a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict within the framework of the UNO and the CSCE. "Though all previous attempts by the CSCE to settle the conflict resulted in failure, we still hope that the Minsk Group will continue its efforts regarding the settlement of the conflict". President Aliyev mentioned that Azerbaijan's conditions remain the same. Armenia must withdraw its troops from all occupied territories and only after that can we begin negotiations concerning the status of Nagorno Karabakh. Jan Eliasson mentioned that the "settlement of the conflict must be just and based on the principles of international norms". Eliasson said that when preparing for his mission, he visited Ankara and Moscow and discussed the steps on the settlement of the conflict there as well. In addition, he said that "we have to move step by step. The first step is a cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops from occupied territories and the resumption of communication and beginning of talks concerning political settlement".
