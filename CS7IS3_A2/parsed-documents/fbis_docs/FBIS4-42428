The move is in line with an agreement signed by the prime minister and President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin last February 15 which involved a thousand Russian missiles and about 160 British weapons. The United States and Russia also stopped targeting each this week. An MoD [Ministry of Defense] spokesman said the computers which guide British weapons "no longer routinely hold targeting information." The weapons were detargeted on May 30. Targets which were "held in readiness for insertion into the missiles" will be points in the open ocean, he added. The MoD described the move as a "positive demonstration of the developing cooperative relationship between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation."
