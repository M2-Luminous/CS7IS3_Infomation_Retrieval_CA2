Under pressure from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the meeting decided to postpone a decision and to set up a working party. This is to devise an alternative plan for the future of the Bundeswehr, based on Ruehe's proposals. Foreign Minister Kinkel expressed his opposition to the planned reduction of the armed forces to 340,000 men.
