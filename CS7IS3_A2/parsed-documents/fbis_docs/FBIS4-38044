The commission found the Israeli military, Government, and settlers not guilty, and held Baruch Goldstein solely responsible for the carnage. If the not guilty verdict had been so cut and dried, why did it take the commission so long to reach its conclusion about an outrage in which Goldstein was aided and abetted by the Israeli settlers and military? We could even have guessed the exact wording in which the verdict was going to be phrased. All the crimes and massacres committed by the Israelis and their Haganah, Stern, Aragon, and Kach gangs over more than half a century have either been whitewashed or blamed on deranged individuals. We need not recount the massacres in which Israel's history abounds. Whoever wants to look at Israel's history of terror, on which Israel was founded, need only refer to UN and Security Council files. The exoneration of the Israeli Government and military from responsibility for the Hebron Massacre, all the evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, is significant in more ways than one, and carries untold risks to the Palestinian Arab people and the peace process. The commission's findings, in effect, give the go-ahead to the settlers and the Israeli military to perpetrate further atrocities against the Palestinian people. The findings make of the settlements veritable time bombs and a permanent threat looming over the Palestinian people and the entire peace process. Israeli Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has said that he cannot rule out a recurrence of the Hebron massacre. In effect, Baraq is encouraging settlers to commit further massacres against the Palestinians and is encouraging the Israeli military to look the other way or even participate in future outrages, just at it did in the Ibrahimi Mosque case as shown in evidence ignored by the Rabin government's report. The Arabs cannot forget that Israel owes its existence to a string of massacres committed in Palestinian towns and villages -- from Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Lod, and Ramlah, to Qafr Qasim and Sabra and Shatila, to name but a few. Systematic terror has been state policy for successive Israeli Governments. Attacks against south Lebanon and acts of piracy on land, at sea, and in the air, and the abduction of individuals are prime examples. More ominously, what Israel is doing, under the international community's very nose, is not being met with the firmness and resoluteness it deserves. Israel is thus encouraged to persist in its aggression and terror in broad daylight and to imperil the peace process and to keep the region as a flash point threatening world peace and security. The findings of the Israeli state commission of enquiry cannot absolve the Rabin government or the Israeli military of culpability in the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Nor can they cut any ice with the international community. Even assuming a segment of the international community is convinced that no blame should be attached to the Rabin government or the Israeli Army in the Ibrahimi Mosque episode, it cannot but judge as terrorism Israel's acts of aggression and abductions in south Lebanon and its conduct in the Golan Heights and in the occupied Arab territories and in detention centers. This makes the international community all the more responsible for the safety of the population in the occupied Arab territories and the success of the peace process.
