FBIS4-16136 "drsov072_v_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Lithuania Two Candidates Apply To Fill Vacant Seat Two Candidates Apply To Fill Vacant Seat WS1304151694 Tallinn BNS in English 1806 GMT 13 Apr 94 WS1304151694 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS - Only two potential candidates submitted their applications to the Chief Election Commission [CEC] for participation in a by-election to the Lithuanian parliament. Liudvikas Sabutis, member of the previous parliament, nominated by the Conservative Party, and Albinas Visockas, leader of the recently founded extreme-leftist Socialist Party, intend to compete for a vacant seat left by President Algirdas Brazauskas. Although the Socialist Party is not yet officially registered, this is unlikely to prevent Visockas from being registered as a candidate because he collected the necessary 1,000 signatures in his support. The CEC is scheduled to discuss registration of candidates Thursday. The by-election in the Kaisiadorys district, where Brazauskas was elected to the parliament, is scheduled for May 15. This will be the third attempt to elect an MP in this district. During earlier by-elections in the same district last summer and fall, none of the candidates received the necessary amount of votes. Sabutis held the lead in fall, but nevertheless failed to enter the parliament.
