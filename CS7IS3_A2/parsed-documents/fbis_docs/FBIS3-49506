Madeleine Albright and head of U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili. The U.S. project Partnership for Peace has been formulated in such a way, Baudys said, as to offer an almost unbelievably wide choice from "zero cooperation to the closest possible cooperation," allowing bilateral adaptation between the Czech and NATO armed forces. "Under the project, we want to achieve a maximum number of concrete military steps," Baudys said, adding that he believed this would make "all NATO members see that the Czech Republic is capable of accepting its share of responsibility for the European security."
