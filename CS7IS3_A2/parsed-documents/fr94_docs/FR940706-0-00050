ACTION: Recision of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Central Aleutian District (CAD) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to fully utilize the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 4, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the CAD was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for Atka mackerel was closed on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29964, June 10, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of June 11, 1994, 2,201 mt remain unharvested. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for Atka mackerel in the CAD has not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the June 7, 1994, closure and is reopening directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the CAD, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., July 4, 1994. Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 29, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
