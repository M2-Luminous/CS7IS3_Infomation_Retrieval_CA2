Dear Mr. Conway: The Department of Energy accepts the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 94&hyph;3, Rocky Flats Building 371 Plutonium Storage Safety. An implementation plan is being prepared which will respond to specific recommendations and will describe the integrated planning for development of the safety basis for Rocky Flats Building 371 plutonium storage. The Department agrees in principle with your assessment of the unique safety importance of the projected storage mission. The implementation plan will describe the systems approach to the preparation of the documentation needed to support the facility mission, including determination of cost-beneficial design upgrades. The evaluation of seismic hazards will include assessment of the facility's seismic margin. Safety analysis will consider consequences of ``beyond design basis accidents''. We will work closely with you and your staff to develop a responsive implementation plan. That plan will be forwarded to you in accordance with 42 U.S.C. section 2286d. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Hazel R. O'Leary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29198 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
