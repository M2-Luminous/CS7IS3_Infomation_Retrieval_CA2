Makeyev: "Limiting Antisubmarine Activity as a Factor of Strategic Stability"] [Text] Limiting antisubmarine activity may be viewed as an important part of the overall problem of finding ways to reduce military activity in the world ocean. The end of the Cold War, elimination of former conflicts between the East and the West, and a number of other new factors bringing on positive shifts in international relations are making inclusion of the naval "component" in negotiation processes even more important. There is no doubt that arms reduction and reinforcement of mutual trust in military affairs must be comprehensive, embracing all of their forms. In this aspect navies possessing enormous firepower, mobility, independence, and a significant ability to resist the enemy can in no way be an exception, all the more so because in the last few decades they have become an important means of offensive military activities, including against objectives on land. If we ignore this, a shift of the arms race to the sea would not be excluded. Not only might this be an obstacle to lowering the overall military balance to the level of defensive sufficiency desired by all, but it may also act as a powerful destabilizing factor in this process. In this case although unilateral steps to reduce the composition of the fleets doubtlessly do limit the arms race at sea to a certain degree, they cannot produce a decrease in the overall military balance, and, consequently, strategic stability in the world. If the state of the fleets is disregarded, such reductions will actually be unsupervisable, and they will doubtlessly be accompanied by a desire to improve naval forces qualitatively and to raise their combat effectiveness. This is why the inclusion of sea armament in the negotiation process together with other forms of armament is an objective reality. Considering the differences in the approaches to this problem in different countries, it would appear suitable to approach its solution gradually, in stages. In this aspect I can propose three stages of its resolution. First--creating and strengthening measures of trust at sea, upon which both collective and unilateral actions of the agreeing parties need to be oriented. Their goal is to reduce the danger of military confrontation and tension, and to avert conflicts resulting from misinterpretation of one another's actions. While these are not measures of real disarmament per se, and while they do not have an effect on either the structure or the effective combat strength of the fleets, they will nonetheless create a climate of trust between states, and promote reinforcement of international peace and security. These measures should include agreements on preventing incidents at sea, on the creation of a system of notification regarding major exercises and maneuvers, on launchings of ICBMs and SLBMs, and on the concentration and relocation of naval forces, and other measures that may significantly reduce the probability of chance conflicts at sea. In the second stage we need to reach agreement on measures to limit especially dangerous naval activities, and to reduce the possibility of creating conditions for a surprise attack from the sea and for initiation of offensive actions there of a major scale. Prohibiting or limiting activities of naval forces in the patrol zones of missile submarines, and later on in regions where the greatest concentration of naval forces is observed today, as well as in international shipping lanes, in fishing zones and so on, should be included among such measures. In the third and final stage we could raise the issue of balanced reduction of the composition of fleet forces, with regard for the effectiveness with which they can carry out offensive missions in agreed regions. Today, productive negotiations are being conducted only within the framework of the first stage, as outlined above. As for the second, I feel that it should begin with talks on limiting antisubmarine activity. It should be clarified here that antisubmarine activity is a multifaceted concept. It penetrates into all aspects of naval functions, and it is represented by an entire complex of measures directed at detecting and destroying enemy submarines with the purpose of preventing strikes by their missiles and torpedoes against ships (vessels) and coastal objectives, and at preventing them from carrying out reconnaissance, laying mines, and carrying out other tasks. As we know, antisubmarine warfare is accomplished by special antisubmarine forces and resources. In this case, ship and aviation antisubmarine warfare [ASW] forces rely upon extensive networks of permanently stationed sonar systems, on space and air reconnaissance, and on command, control and communication resources, which in their integration make up a global system for monitoring the underwater situation in vast regions of the world ocean. Naturally, it would be hard to accept disturbance of any links of this system, which ensures the safety of naval forces and allows them to carry out their missions at sea effectively. This is the principal argument offered by the American side whenever the discussion turns to limiting antisubmarine activity. However, there are links in this system, after all, that can and must be viewed as objects in relation to which the second stage of negotiations on reducing military activity at sea should begin. I am referring to limiting antisubmarine activity not in general, but only in regions of possible covert patrolling by strategic submarine forces, which, together with other strategic nuclear forces, are deterrent forces that provide strategic stability and maintain a potential readiness for a retaliatory nuclear strike against an aggressor. It is fully understandable that the capability of these forces for carrying out this mission depends not only and not so much on parity of nuclear resources, regarding which the corresponding agreements already exist, but also on their ability to resist the enemy in the event of enemy actions. After all, in a crisis one of the sides might use its ASW forces for preemptive strikes against the other side's SSBNs in order to achieve strategic superiority both for the purpose of military and political pressure and in order to weaken a retaliatory strike as much as possible. It is precisely in order to exclude such a situation and to increase survival of SSBNs, and ultimately to reinforce strategic stability, that it appears suitable to prohibit search operations in regions of possible combat patrols. In this case I am not asking the sides to reveal the specific areas of combat patrols by SSBNs: Keeping such areas secret is absolutely natural, and disclosing them is even unsuitable from the standpoint of raising their ability to resist the enemy in the event that one of the sides violates agreements. What I am asking for is to determine particular zones in the seas and oceans where such regions may be located, and into which access by ASW forces should be limited. However, when we work out such measures of prohibition we need to study a number of questions, the absence of answers to which made such an initiative on the part of the USSR futile in the past. Are such restrictions on antisubmarine activities possible in the operational, technical, and legal aspects? Won't they be detrimental to other antisubmarine missions carried out by fleet forces? And finally, can compliance with such restrictions be supervised? It seems to me that negotiations on this subject are possible and suitable because they significantly fill in the omissions in strategic arms reduction treaties. On the other, hand agreements reached in this case would not preclude other antisubmarine activities associated with defending warship formations, transporters, assault landing detachments at sea, naval bases, and so on. After all, the specific (unique) features of actions to seek and destroy SSBNs in their patrol regions make it possible to quickly distinguish them from other antisubmarine activities, and, consequently, effective supervision over compliance with agreements is possible. In fact, in contrast to other missions of antisubmarine defense, struggle with naval strategic nuclear weapon carriers requires early deployment of forces for finding them and for keeping them under observation in order to prevent a surprise nuclear missile strike from the sea. Today, the possibility for destroying missile submarines at the onset of war before they launch their missiles has vitally important significance to both of the warring sides. All subsequent actions at sea following a missile launch, including actions against nuclear-powered submarines, would not be able to prevent or even reduce the damage suffered by the side that had lost the initiative and allowed the enemy to purposefully employ his fighting potential, no matter how effective these subsequent actions might be. On the other hand, effective and timely strikes against missile submarines are possible only when maneuvering naval forces (aviation, surface ships, and submarines) interact efficiently with reconnaissance forces (sonar, space, air, marine radiotechnical etc.). This is why the actions of maneuvering ASW forces are the subject of negotiations to limit antisubmarine activities in regions of possible patrolling by SSBNs, and why deployment of such forces in these regions would be limited. In this case, there is no need for detailed examination of the actions of these forces. Within the scope of the content and the orientation of this article it will be sufficient to dwell on the basic means of using ASW forces to reveal hostile intentions against SSBNs, and, thus, illustrate the possibilities of supervising compliance with an agreement. A detailed examination of the specific issues regarding search operations in regions of possible patrolling by SSBNs is a matter for experts at negotiations. On our part, we will limit ourselves to the most general forms and means of their actions only for the purposes of illustration. Shore-based patrol aviation occupies the most important place today in search operations against missile submarines. It possesses high mobility and maneuverability, a large radius of operations, a significant search potential, including by means of the latest nontraditional detection resources, and it is less dependent on weather conditions than ship-based ASW airplanes and helicopters. Therefore, presence of shore-based airplanes in the combat patrol regions of SSBNs is subject to strict regulation. In addition, their activity depends on the surface area of the region to be searched and on the particular search resources employed in this case, and, consequently, it is rather specific, and it cannot be lumped together with actions by ASW airplanes carrying out other ASW missions. Surface ships, which remain the principal antisubmarine defense forces of carrier formations, convoys, and assault landing detachments, can also be tasked to fight SSBNs. Sonar stations equipped with low-frequency towed antennas of considerable length, possessing a range of submarine detection that is an order of magnitude greater than the operating range of stations with onboard antennas, are now the preferred resource for seeking SSBNs. In this case the nature of maneuver of both lone ships and ship groups, including ones employing ASW helicopters, and their appearance in stipulated regions for a period of time greater than that needed for antisubmarine support to the passage of ship detachments or formations, provide the grounds for concluding such actions to be a violation of agreements reached regarding the given region. ASW submarines are one of the most effective and covert resources for finding and destroying SSBNs in their regions of maneuver. The modern polyfunctional sonar complexes they use, which operate predominantly in passive modes in combination with high-speed automated target classification and indication systems, make such submarines the most dangerous enemy to SSBNs, and a resource that is hardest of all to reveal in such a region. But even their actions are distinguished by certain specific features in this case, associated with the need for lengthy shadowing of a detected submarine, for classifying it as an SSBN, and so on. In addition, there are certain means of monitoring their presence in a given region, implemented both by the SSBN itself and by other naval forces supporting such monitoring, which carry out such tasks with the needed periodicity in different regions determined by agreement so as not to reveal the specific patrol zone of the missile submarine. In general, shadowing of a submarine by any maneuvering ASW forces differs from observation and reconnaissance in the given region in that they must maintain prolonged contact with the submarine, with their weapons ready for immediate use. And, although the means of such shadowing will vary (covert and overt, continuous and discrete, by lone objects and their groups, by homogeneous and heterogeneous forces), the specific tactics and the nature of maneuver immediately reveal their essence. They could of course be concealed by other actions of ASW forces in contiguous zones and regions, but concentration itself of these forces in a given zone is a major factor disclosing the true intentions. Thus, these and a number of other specific features of the activity of antisubmarine forces searching for missiles submarines (the order of transfer of contact from certain forces to others, the particular features of radio exchange, build-up of these forces in a time of danger, an so on), which we will not discuss here, make it possible not to require, at negotiations, the total absence of ASW forces from the indicated regions, which is not to the liking of the American side today. The goal of an agreement must be their quantitative restriction to a certain pre-established level. A certain permissible probability of their detection of SSBNs in the corresponding region may be used as a criterion of this level. This approach does, of course, require complex justifications accounting for the dimensions and the hydrometeorological characteristics of the region, as well as the performance characteristics and means of use of ASW forces. While this approach should be based on state-of-the-art computerized procedures, a simple procedure based on an algorithm characterizing the probability of detection of a submarine in a given region may be used for tentative and approximate assessment of the maximum permissible strength of antisubmarine forces in a certain region. Equation where d[.sub]det[/]--range of the detection equipment of the ASW forces; V[.sub]_r_[/]--relative speed of ASW forces searching for a missile submarine on patrol; n--number of units of searching forces; t--time allocated to surveying the region; S--area of surveyed region. By some simple manipulations we get: Equation Given certain assumptions, we can use this formula to approximately determine the nature of the ASW forces (homogeneous or heterogeneous) to be used in searching for SSBNs in prescribed regions with a prescribed P[.sub]det[/], and, consequently, introduce quantitative restrictions on antisubmarine activity in regions in which naval strategic forces may operate with the purpose of ensuring their ability to resist the enemy. The calculation procedure might be as follows in this case: 1. Determine the boundaries and total areas of prohibited regions: (S[.sub]1[/], S[.sub]2[/], S[.sub]3[/], ...S[.sub]k[/]); 2. Determine the average ranges of detection resources (d[.sub]det[/]), the searching speeds (V[.sub]ASW[/]) and the time of operation of different ASW forces in each subregion (t), in relation to specific hydrological and hydrometeorological conditions of the region, and calculate relative speeds V[.sub]_r_[/] with regard for the patrolling speeds of the SSBNs; 3. Calculate the search potentials of ASW forces that may operate in the given region: aviation--SP[.sub]av[/], surface ships--SP[.sub]ss[/], submarines--SP[.sub]sub[/], using the known approximate formula SP[.sub]i[/]=D[.sub]deti[/]V[.sub]_r_i[/]. After this, determine the overall search potential of ASW forces (SP[.sub]total[/]) as the sum of the potential of all participating forces; 4. Determine the areas of the zones of operation of different branches of ASW forces (aviation--S[.sub]av[/], surface ships--S[.sub]ss[/], and submarines--S[.sub]sub[/]) in proportion to the search potentials using the known formula S[.sub]i[/]=S(SP[.sub]i[/]/SP[.sub]det[/]). We assume with accuracy sufficient for tentative assessment that ASW forces will interact only within the zones of their operation in the search area; 5. Use formula (2) to calculate the number of units of different ASW forces which may not be exceeded in the given region. Because of difficulties in monitoring ASW submarines stationed in the region, when the calculated quantity of other ASW forces is present in the region, detection of just one submarine there would have to be treated as the limit. Moreover, vessels intended for long-range sonar reconnaissance would be categorically prohibited from entering the region. The listed features of the operations and quantitative composition of ASW forces searching for SSBNs in a particular region cannot go undetected. Therefore, the appearance of unidentified submarines and of a certain number of ASW ships and shore-based airplanes in this region, carrying out some or all of the actions serving as indicators of SSBN search operations, is sufficient grounds for the conclusion that the corresponding side is violating agreements. In conclusion, it should be noted that limiting antisubmarine operations, carried out by strategic deterrent forces, is legal from the standpoint of international law, inasmuch as it raises strategic stability at sea, it yields to control, and it does not undermine the principles of antisubmarine defense provided in all other spheres of naval activity. Reaching agreement on this issue would be a substantial step on the road to also limiting other forms of military activity in maritime regions in support of the mutual state interests of the agreeing countries, and, ultimately, it may open the road to the beginning of productive negotiations on disarmament at sea. On the other hand, stubborn rejection of this approach would be an indication of a certain lack of interest in successfully resolving this issue, which would then require implementation of other adequate measures.
