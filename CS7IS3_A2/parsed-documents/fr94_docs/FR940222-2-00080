The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased after a specified period prior to the redemption, which is expected to be six years, or on CDSC shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares. In addition, no CDSC will be imposed on shares purchased prior to any order granting the requested exemption. 15. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or the time of redemption. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that redemption is made first of shares or amounts representing capital appreciation, or reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Other shares or amounts then would be considered to be redeemed in the order purchased, unless the Fund chose to redeem in another order that would result in a lower sales load. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. In all cases, the sum of any front-end sales charge, asset-based sales charge, shareholder services charge, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 16. No CDSC will be imposed in connection with an exchange privilege whereby an investor exchanges CDSC shares of a Fund for CDSC shares of another Fund. All exchanges would be effected in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3. 17. The Funds request the ability to waive the CDSC in connection with (a) redemptions by officers, directors, trustees, and employees of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, and any of its affiliates, and such persons' immediate families, (b) involuntary redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum account balance set forth in the Fund's then-current prospectus, and (c) total or partial redemptions made in connection with the following distributions permitted to be made under the Internal Revenue Code (``Code'') from an IRA or other qualified retirement plan: (i) Any redemption in connection with a lump sum or other distribution following retirement, or, in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan or a custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2; and (ii) any redemption that results from a tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee (see sections 72(m)(7) and 408(f)(3) of the Code). As an alternative to waiver category (c), and if the trustees of the Fund determine to adopt this alternative, the Fund could waive the CDSC with respect to any partial or complete in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred retirement plan or attaining age 701/2 in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan, or custodial account resulting from the tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA. 18. Applicants also could provide a pro rata credit paid by the Fund's distributor for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment effected within a specified period after the redemption. To effect this credit, the distributor would purchase additional shares for the account of an investor who reinvests the redemption proceeds on which a CDSC was paid, in an amount equal to the CDSC charged on the redemption. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants requests an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that, by implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, or increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund.
