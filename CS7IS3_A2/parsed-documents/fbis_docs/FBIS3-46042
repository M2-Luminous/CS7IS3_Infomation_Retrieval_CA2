Alain Peyrefitte, president of the France-China Friendship Society of the French National Assembly and former minister with the government of General de Gaulle, made the remarks in an interview with XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and the French-language monthly magazine "CHINA EXPRESS." The former minister praised General de Gaulle who moved to establish diplomatic relations in the 1960s with the People's Republic of China and recognised it "as the representative of the Chinese nation." China has offered many trade favors to France since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1964. And France has become the third biggest trade partner of China by 1992, only after the U.S. and Japan. However, France's share in the Chinese market has diminished after it decided to sell arms to Taiwan, for which France has lost business contracts of estimated six billion francs (1.2 billion U.S. Dollars) in China. "After the normalization of relations between France and China, the French industries will invest again in the market at full steam," said Peyrefitte. He noted the Chinese are ready to make "a big jump towards market economy" and their economic development has great potentials. Peyrefitte said France can make use of its "considerable advantages" in transport, telecommunications and energy in cooperation with China and expand its export and investment in other Asian countries through joint-ventures and transfers of technology. In conclusion, he said, "all foreign investors are actively involved in China's modernization drive, and it is in the interests of France to join them." The former French minister is leaving for China Wednesday to participate in the ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and prepare for the coming visit by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
