FBIS4-27383 "dreas105_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea Seoul `Prepared for Any Emergency' Seoul `Prepared for Any Emergency' SK0106032594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0300 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0106032594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- While President Kim Yong-sam is away from the country on state visits to Russia and Uzbekistan from June 1-7, Chongwadae [presidential offices], the Office of the Prime Minister and the Foreign, Home and Defense Ministries are prepared for any emergency. Because the president is abroad when the North Korean nuclear dispute is facing a critical moment, these national security- and public order-related agencies are on alert against anything that might happen during his absence. Tension on the Korean peninsula is mounting as the UN Security Council has taken up the nuclear issue. Concerned about this development, President Kim instructed security-related ministers to prepare fully for any abrupt North Korean action in a meeting he himself presided over Sunday. On Monday, he invited Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku to breakfast at Chongwadae and told them to preserve national security and public order during his absence. Stressing that the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program is entering a critical phase, Kim said the government should remain on around-the-clock alert so that South Koreans can go about their business without feeling a sense of crisis. He also called for all- out efforts to prevent major accidents. Prime minister Yi, giving a briefing on the cabinet's determination to hold the fort during the president's absence, said all cabinet members would fully support Kim's summit diplomacy in Russia and Uzbekistan by maintaining national security and public order and taking all possible precautions against accidents. On Monday morning, President Kim called President Bill Clinton, who was about to fly to Europe to attend ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion, to ensure close Korea-U.S. cooperation in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue and to explain about his trip to Russia and Uzbekistan. The hot-line conversation with Clinton ended Kim's official schedule prior to his departure for Moscow on Wednesday. On Monday afternoon, Kim personally checked the agenda for his summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the speeches he is to make in Russia and Uzbekistan. Chongwadae virtually adopted an emergency stance under Chief of Staff Pak Kwan-yong's control Monday. As Senior Foreign Affairs and Security Secretary Chong Chong-uk, Senior Economic Secretary Pak Chae-yun, Senior Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik and Senior Administrative Secretary Hong In-kil are to accompany the president to Russia and Uzbekistan, all remaining senior secretaries -- Chief Secretary Pak Kwan-yong, Senior Political Secretary Yi Won-chong, Senior Government Affairs Secretary Yi Ui-kun, Senior Petition-Information Secretary Kim Yong- su and Senior Education-Culture Secretary Kim Chong-nam -- will take turns serving as Chongwadae duty officer. Chongwadae is also maintaining around-the-clock communication with the traveling president. Prime Minister Yi is in charge of state affairs during the president's absence, and this is his first experience as prime minister. His office is thus prepared to help Yi carry out his duties during the president's absence by maintaining close cooperation with Chongwadae and national security-related agencies. The Foreign Ministry is working 24 hours a day under Vice Minister Pak Kun-u, as Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is a member of the president's entourage. The Home and Defense Ministries implemented an emergency work system Wednesday, while the armed forces are on high alert to increase surveillance of North Korea's military movements. The police have strengthened their posture against crime nationwide to maintain law and order while the president is away.
