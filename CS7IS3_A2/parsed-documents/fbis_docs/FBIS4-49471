Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee and director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, pointed out here today that setting up a human rights commission clashes with the Basic Law. In a discussion meeting with National People's Congress Hong Kong deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Hong Kong members, Lu Ping said: This commission, as they see it, will not be a normal consultative body but a body of power. Yet it is neither an executive, or legislative, or a judiciary organ as laid down in the Basic Law. Setting up such a human rights commission obviously clashes with the Basic Law and will undermine the power structure established by the Basic Law. Lu Ping believed that the people recommending such a human rights commission "had some other things in mind." As a power body, the human rights commission is bound to weaken and affect the powers of other bodies and destabilize Hong Kong society. As regards the proposition that after 1997 the Chinese Government should report periodically to the UN Human Rights Commission on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Lu Ping said: As China did not join either of the two international human rights conventions, it does not have any responsibility or obligation to report to the UN Human Rights Commission on human rights in Hong Kong. Lu Ping said: Hong Kong is not a polity and does not have the authority to make reports to the UN Human Rights Commission. The Basic Law states very clearly: The parts in the two human rights conventions that have been applicable to Hong Kong in the past must, after 1997, be implemented through the local laws of Hong Kong. In other words, the two human rights conventions cannot be directly applied to Hong Kong. There was consensus on this point when the Basic Law was drafted. Lu Ping said that Hong Kong people will enjoy extensive rights after 1997 and the Basic Law provides full legal safeguards in this respect. During the discussion, Lu Ping characterized the Foreign Affairs Select Committee's report as "very good teaching material" because it bluntly admitted a fundamental change in Britain's 1989 policy on the problem of Hong Kong from cooperating with to confronting the Chinese Government.
