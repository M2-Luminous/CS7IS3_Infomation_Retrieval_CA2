"Foreign Ministry officials are seeking possibilities through various channels, but there seems to be no clear direction yet," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news conference. But he reiterated that substantial progress has been made in insurance which his ministry is in charge of negotiating among the three priority areas under the framework talks. Other areas are automobiles and auto parts, and government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. In a related development, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United States in late May or early June for talks with U.S. officials on ways to resume the framework talks. "I hope that working-level talks will be resumed by the Middle of this month," the official, who declined to be named, told reporters. The official said Kakizawa hopes to meet with U.S. leaders to discuss other delicate issues such as the suspected nuclear weapons development program by North Korea. The official also said Kakizawa is likely to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Paris when they attend a ministerial session of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) opening June 7.
