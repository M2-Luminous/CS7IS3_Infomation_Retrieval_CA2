In theory, it turned out that he was right, but it seems that what was gained or lost cannot be easily evaluated. At the 5th Congress of the Latvian Green Party (LGP), which was held Saturday, the present day Latvian Way-"farer", Dzintars Abikis did not participate (this does not mean he was not mentioned -- in both a positive and critical light). After re-registration of the party members as a political organization, the number of united Greens has declined from approximately 300 to 128 members, which is not that significant, considering that many parties, even the more popular ones, are in the same situation at present, numerically speaking. But, just as last year, the main question for the Congress was how the Greens, without losing their identity, could save their ability to influence the process and defend their interests, which is only possible through government structures. As we know, in the municipal elections, the Green party, in the majority of cases, is running together with the national forces, and even in the Riga council elections, it has joined the ballot with the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM), and the Greens have 11 seats there -- they did not even want any more. Latvian Green Party Co-Chairman Peteris Jansons said that the situation and the goals are different now, bringing the national political forces closer together. As far as we can remember, the union of national forces was formed primarily to support Latvian interests with respect to the citizenship law, and now it is also protesting against the initialed documents of the Latvian and Russian talks. And these are matters, as we learned at the Congress, that the Greens are entrusting to their coalition partners. But the question concerns something else: by approaching and assimilating with other national forces, will the Greens lose the ability to voice their own principles in a sufficiently loud manner? This is also the concern of the longtime party Co-Chairman, Juris Zvirgzds, who reminded everyone that only and by itself can the Green Party create political security for all priorities related to its work and the environment. And therefore, two matters cannot be confused -- Greens do not join with nor enter into another political power, but, instead, they work together with it as an equal partner. "I am for working together according to the principle of partner relationships, but I am against the case where a Green changes colors or allows environmental questions to be postponed to another time, some time later. We know that `later' never comes", said Juris Zvirgzds. Maybe there is no need to be afraid, because the partners, according to the assessment of Indulis Emsis, respect Greens precisely for their convictions, and have also studied their principles. But, for this same reason, according to Indulis Emsis, a "green line" must be defined, which, when it is crossed over, will cause the LGP to leave the partnership and drop out of the game. It should also be respected that the realization of Green ideas requires a long period of time, and therefore it is unnecessary to make exaggerated attempts at become a ruling political power, but rather, to focus on such politics that the Green standpoint is mentioned by all political forces, said Emsis. He also mentioned the party's financial situation, because it is no secret to anyone that influence in a power structure can be gained only by those parties who have money. Greens do not have money, but in looking for it, they should continue to be on the alert, because there are more than just a few who would be willing to provide financial support for the party, but only on the condition that it renounces the Green lines and principles in specific instances. Even though the question -- of whether to go alone or together with others -- started some arguments, which, it seems, still remain unresolved, this did not, in any case, show signs of a split among the Greens. Maybe this was because there weren't that many of them -- not quite fifty. And maybe because, as Anna Seile concluded, this was a meeting hall where everyone could speak in a quiet tone, without microphones, and everyone understood and listened. And it is true that no calls to come to order were heard in the Green Congress, although when the candidates for party co-chairmen were proposed and characterized, an attendee summarized this process afterwards, asking: "Out of five angels, how can we select just three?" Yes, the Green Party still maintains the principle of electing, not one leader, but three co-chairmen to adopt their colleagues' resolutions, and so that the party is not called the Zvirgzds or Emsis party. This also has its minuses, which could be noticed also in the review period, because, since the functions are not precisely divided, it is also difficult to divide the responsibilities. It should be noted that none of these co-chairmen earn their living through being co-chairmen. All three former party leaders -- Juris Zvirgzds, Olegs Batarevskis and Peteris Jansons -- were also nominated for the position this year. The bulletins also included the names of two more candidates -- the Environmental Protection Committee Vice President Pavils Raudonis, and Kuldiga rayon Council Chairman Janis Klavins. Most votes in the Congress were received by the former party "prime mover", Juris Zvirgzds, head of the ecology laboratory at the Zoological Garden. Next was Janis Klavins, who could be considered as the surprise of this Congress. Klavins joined the party only one year ago, and ran as a Green candidate in the Saeima elections (in Kurzeme, as the very first). But the public began to notice Klavins when all attention was turned to Skrunda, which is in Janis Klavins led Kuldiga rayon. Like Olegs Batarevskis -- the third co-chairman -- he was born in 1951. O. Batarevskis works as State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. The Central Council elected at the Congress will include Jekabs Raipulis, Leons Magelis, Inese Eihvalde, Indulis Emsis, Janis Baltvilks, Gunars Lakutis, Skaidrite Albertina, Pavils Raudonis and Karlis Gudermanis (Peteris Jansons withdrew his candidacy). The delegates at the Congress also adopted one resolution, requesting the President of the nation to proclaim the first week of May as clean-up week. During this week, according to the document, "let's wash windows -- the eyes of Latvia, clean up courtyards and entryways."
