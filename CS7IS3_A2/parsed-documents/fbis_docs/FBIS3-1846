Party and government organizations should be strictly forbidden to engage in business activities. With "the administration maintained by regular revenue," the high salary system for bureaucrats should be introduced. Whether or not officials should live on government pay or should "do business" or be allowed to "earn extra income" is a controversial issue. We believe officials should only live on government pay. They should never be allowed to "do business" or "earn extra income" under any pretext. It is imperative to "maintain the administration with regular revenue." "Maintaining the administration with regular revenue" means the government collecting compulsory taxes and then paying the salaries of government officials and other personnel in the form of fiscal outlay. In developed industrialized countries, this pay is considered "bureaucratic pay" and a "high salary system" is in operation. Normally, the average bureaucratic pay scale offered by the public sector is higher than, or equivalent to, the average pay scale offered by the private sector. The pay scale for central government officials is even higher, because more skills, higher educational qualifications, and richer experience are required of these officials than employees in the private sector. On the one hand, the high salary system conforms to the theory of human capital investment returns and attracts a constant flow of outstanding members of society into the government bureaucracy to help improve the quality of that bureaucracy. On the other hand, "high salaries foster honesty in official conduct." When bureaucrats enjoy relatively handsome and stable salary income and decent living standards, the temporary gain obtained through corruption and embezzlement will have to be greater in order to make it worthwhile because of the risk of losing the income of "bureaucratic salaries" for ever. This will check the impulse for corruption among bureaucrats to a great extent but if the low salary system is operating, it will cause many outstanding members of the bureaucracy to leave and the quality of the bureaucracy to go down. On the other hand, because the officials are paid less than their human capital input and the worth of the work they contribute, they will certainly seek illegal means of income to obtain new self-compensation. All kinds of practices to "make extra money by official means," with or without disguise, are a form of legally acceptable compensation; while seeking personal gain by abuse of power is another form of compensation, which is illegal. There is no essential difference between the two and both practices give officials a strong rent-seeking incentive [xun zu ji li 1416 4436 3423 0536]. Some scholars believe that being in a relative state of pauperism has left the social status of party and government cadres in a polarized state and the highest political status and lowest economic status necessarily induce the impulse of party and government cadres to compare their incomes with others and pursue high income for the sake of a mental equilibrium. Therefore, one can say that low salaries necessarily arouse party and government officials' impulse for corruption. What needs elucidation here is that, at the moment, officials are under the low salary system on the one hand and, on the other, are enjoying "hidden incomes," such as invisible housing subsidies and entitlement to transport in exclusive cars and aircraft. With the ill-defined public and private incomes and ambiguous rules and regulations, many officials have learned to "hitchhike." The openness of the administration [shi zheng 1395 2398], the clarity of the regime, and the well-defined demarcation between the public and the private will reduce the incidence of "hitchhikes" and to some extent check corruption among officials. For this purpose, we offer the following suggestions: --We should introduce a high salary system for bureaucrats and significantly raise the average pay scale for cadres in government organs, so that it is higher than the average wage level for workers in the whole country and reaches or exceeds the middle income level. The average pay scale for cadres in the central government organs should be even higher. The pay scale for cadres at and above the level of ministers should be equivalent to the high income scale and should be decided and announced by the National People's Congress Standing Committee on a yearly basis. --All kinds of invisible subsidies granted to officials, such as housing subsidy, car subsidy, and medical and medicine subsidy, should be scrapped and directly included in their salaries. All the special supply avenues and special services at preferential rates or free gratis should be removed. The incomes and properties of officials should be made transparent. They should collect all income by producing their ID cards. The incomes collected should be transferred, paid, recorded, and monitored by the bank, step by step. In the meantime, they should deliver personal income tax and property tax according to law. When necessary, the incomes, properties, and tax payments of leaders can be publicized from time to time. The judicial and tax authorities are entitled to verify and examine them. --It is necessary to reduce the number of levels of government administration and the size of staff, which should be cut by at least one-third. The administrative organs at the prefectural level should be removed. All industrial ministries and their subordinate regional industrial bureaus should be replaced with trade societies. The trade societies, whose role it is to strengthen the ties between enterprises in specific trades and the government, constitute a third control mechanism besides the market mechanism and state intervention. While they represent the interests of their own trades and influence the government policymaking and legislation, they also bear the responsibility to support the government's formulation of macropolicies. Party and government organs should be strictly prohibited from engaging in business and running any kind of company. All existing companies should be disconnected from their parent organs. Activities for "making extra money" organized by government organs and various kinds of nonprofit institutions in all sorts of names should not be encouraged. --Cadres at and above the level of provincial or ministry leaders cannot assume full- or part-time positions in any type of companies after retiring from their official positions or their work. --The children of high-ranking cadres should be firmly prohibited from engaging in business. The decision made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989 should be reiterated, that is: The spouses, children, and children's spouses of the members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat and of the members of the State Council standing conferences [chang wu hui yi 1603 0523 2585 6231] may not engage in business activities in the circulation field and may not take up full- or part-time posts in companies in the circulation field. This stipulation should apply to the spouses, children, and children's spouses of retired CPC Central Committee and State Council leaders. What needs to be explained here is that, even with the introduction of the high salary system for bureaucrats, a small number of officials may still become corrupt and they will not be satisfied with just 80,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan. They must be punished and sternly handled according to law. 5. The Army should be strictly forbidden to engage in business and it is necessary to "maintain the Army with regular revenue." Whether the Army should feed on the revenue or "engage in business" is not a question for debate in a modern country. But it has been a controversial point in China. We believe the Army should only feed on the revenue and should never "engage in business." It is necessary to "maintain the Army with regular revenue." National defense belongs to public goods that cannot be divided up or sold on the market. It must be provided by the government (mainly the central government). In a modern country, the government should provide public goods, especially national defense expenditures, through public spending with compulsory taxation. "Maintaining the Army with regular revenue" is an international practice. The international experience indicates that to allow the Army to engage in business means giving the "green light" to corruption in the Army. Since the beginning of the 1980's, the Chinese Army has been deeply involved in large-scale business activities. It has gone so far that at present, all the three armed services, the General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, the General Logistics Department, all field armies, and all provincial military districts are, without exception, involved in running companies and making extra money to compensate for the serious shortages in the military budget. As a result, the commercialization, localization, and corruption of the armed forces has accelerated. Cadres in the Army have been quite critical of this but the central financial power is very low. Though China's GNP has more than doubled since 1978, it is still incapable of feeding an army of 3 million. The central government, unable to do anything about it, keeps asking the Army to hold out and allows it to engage in business and find unofficial sources of income. This is a sign of serious neglect of duty on the part of the central government and a very shortsighted measure that could destroy the Great Wall and sow a seed of turbulence and unrest for the future China. Some leaders became aware of the severity of this problem a long time ago and do not agree with these practices. In view of this, we would like to offer the following suggestions: --The army should be strictly forbidden to engage in business. All kinds of companies owned or co-owned by the army, including the army's own farms, should all be removed and their assets transferred or auctioned off. The Army should not take part in any kind of profitmaking economic activities of localities and the troops stationed in a place may not accept any kind of donations, contributions, or living subsidies from local authorities. --It is necessary to raise military expenditure by a big margin and "maintain the Army with regular revenue." The ability of the central treasury to absorb revenue must be energetically improved to feed the Army, then the police, and finally, officials and professors. All military expenditure should come from allocations by the government treasury which should cover the spending on routine army operations in peacetime, i.e., ensuring that the growth rate of the actual income of army personnel is slightly higher than that of the average income of the residents in the whole country; ensuring the maintenance of weaponry and equipment; accelerating depreciation compensation; updating equipment; covering the expenses of combat training; and making up for the shortages in military funds by way of special withdrawals during wartime. The measure of "maintaining the Army with regular revenue" can be implemented in two stages. The first stage is "maintaining the regular army with regular revenue," i.e., strictly banning business activities in field armies and navy and air force combat units, which should be maintained with central government funding. The second stage is a strict ban on business activities in the whole army, which can be called "maintaining the whole army with regular revenue." In our opinion, even if it means having to invest in fewer big projects and cut several hundred development zones, we should still maintain the Army. In fact, the phenomenon of "relaxation" in China's taxation system is serious and a large amount of tax is uncollected. In 1992, the percentage of revenue in the GNP of Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces was, shockingly, only 8.3 percent and 9 percent respectively. Taxation is like squeezing a sponge and the water (money) can be squeezed out by strict tax collection to compensate the serious shortage of military expenditure. --Some of the national defense public goods can be produced by the market. As one of the most important public goods, national defense must be provided by the central government. However, some of the national defense public goods, such as army provisions and foodstuffs, medicines and medical apparatus, military uniforms and military supplies, airports, roads, some buildings, equipment and instruments can be produced by the market and manufacturers. The military can place orders for competitive bidding and the manufacturers produce the requested products, so the Army does not have to be "self-sufficient" and take care of everything it needs. The General Logistics Department is just a big buyer and decides what to buy from the market, rather than what to produce, except for facilities and equipment which involve military secrets. It is most effective to let the market produce some national defense goods and it will also save a considerable amount of management spending and national defense expenditure. --Most of the ordnance industry enterprises should be separated from the system of the regular armed forces to reduce the size of the noncombatant elements of the army. Only an extremely small number of core enterprises in the ordnance industry having high security ratings can be kept. The scientific research units in the ordnance industry should follow suit. A ministry of ordnance industry should be formed on the basis of the State Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense, reporting to the State Council. It should specialize in the development and production of weapons and equipment and enter into a buyer-seller relationship with the military. The new mode in the context of the market economy in future is that the central government provides money to maintain the Army, the military places orders for goods, and the ministry of ordnance industry produces the goods. As to equipment other than weaponry, the military can invite bidding from society at large and place orders with the winner. --The tasks of the Army should be redefined and nonmilitary expenditures which pose a burden on the Army should be cut down. In the revolutionary period, the Army played multiple roles and had to perform various functions. The army was not only a combat force but also a production force. Under the objective circumstances of that time, the Army would not have been able to survive if they had not "used their own hands and supplied themselves with ample food and clothing." But, in modern society, it is inappropriate to give the Army too many functions, too much responsibility, and too heavy a burden. Its important function is protection of national defense. It is a combat force but not a production force. An army is an army. It is not an industrial army nor the main body of economic operations. It should not take part in any market economic activities, such as market-oriented productive activities and operations, let alone activities that make staggering profits or illegal activities, such as smuggling cars, reselling arms and ammunitions at a profit, running deluxe hotels, and speculating in real estate. It should not participate in local economic construction as unpaid or cheap labor, which poses additional financial burden on the Army and undermines the Army's spending on military training. It should not undertake social service functions, such as running nurseries, primary and middle schools (except on islands and military bases), shops, post offices, and community compounds. Naturally, however, helping with rescue operations and relief provisions during natural calamities is one of the functions of the Army and this is true with the armed forces of all countries. This is one public service that the Army renders to the society on behalf of the government. This service does not cost the society anything but the government must give the Army appropriate compensation out of disaster relief expenditure. Of the abovementioned five major reform measures, the last two demand the consumption of large amounts of government resources and the premise to them is to enhance the state's ability to absorb revenue, i.e., raising the percentage of the government revenue in the GNP and raising the percentage of the central government's income in the total treasury revenue. The second and third recommendations for the structural reforms do not require the consumption of large amounts of government resources and will only cause a certain reduction in the tariff revenue. But, because they will stimulate technical importation and promote the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, greater benefits can be obtained. By breaking trade monopolies and ensuring fair competition, the social transaction costs can be greatly lowered. The first reform measure will bring considerable returns. When the credit interest rate is closing ranks with the market interest rate and bringing huge profits for commercial banks, the government can obtain a rather large amount of resources through such avenues as profit and tax collection. Whether or not we can put an end to corruption is a yardstick of whether or not a political system is institutionalized and efficient. We believe that eradication of corruption by creating new systems depends not only on the progress of the economic structural reform but also on the progress of the political structural reform and the development of socialist democracy and politics. In view of the fact that China's political development is lagging behind economic development and the political structural reform is lagging behind the economic structural reform, carrying out the political structural reform in a vigorous and steady manner should be the key point in the design of reform proposals for the next stage. This will involve other major reform measures, such as the division and balance of political power; the division and definition of political functions (including those of the central government and local governments); the streamlining and reorganization of government organs; introduction of the civil service system and improvement in the quality of officials; strengthening of the supervision system and formulating "dogmas"; strengthening of the judicial system and its independence; improvement of the legal system and related rules and regulations; and materialization of the role of media supervision. Postscript What is most worrying is that corruption has become the greatest social pollutant in today's China. It is the most likely element which can ruin all the achievements made so far in China's reform and opening up, terminate China's economic takeoff, and delay China's modernization process. This is the ultimate reason why we wrote this report. This report is not commissioned or sponsored by any organization and is purely a product of the conscience of Chinese intellectuals and their concern for the long-term interests of the Chinese nation. Obviously, the legitimacy of the third-generation leadership lies in whether or not they have the courage to combat corruption, whether or not they show efficiency in combating corruption, and whether or not they will truly honor their promise to a population of over 1 billion. The people are watching! The people are waiting! The people are making a choice! This report sets forth an important approach to the eradication of corruption by way of creating new systems and a tentative package of five major measures for making innovations in the systems. We are fully aware that each of these major measures directly touches some special interest groups and will bring adjustments to the existing interest pattern. Regarding special interest groups, we should recognize them, restrict them, and standardize them. Naturally, however, the anticorruption operation, be it an institutional one or an ethical one, is bound to encounter opposition and obstruction from various quarters. Nevertheless, the anticorruption operation is now like a "boat sailing against the current which must forge ahead or it will be driven back." To think about what others are unwilling to think about and to say what others dare not say is one of the signs of maturity of the new generation of Chinese intellectuals. In this report on the national conditions, we look at the worst possibility and sound a warning about the worst possible result: If we fail to check the ever-deteriorating corruption tendencies, the Communist Party may break down, not because of external factors, but because of an internal factor, namely, institutional corruption, thus once again terminating China's modernization process. As China's scientists, we do not wish to become successful prophets and are willing to make unremitting and painstaking efforts to stop this worst possibility from coming true. We wrote this report with heavy hearts. Being concerned about the country and the people is the nature of Chinese intellectuals. As early as over 2,000 years ago, Confucius said: "Scholars are bent on the Great Way." His disciple Zeng Can developed and enhanced this idea of his, saying: "A scholar cannot be without breadth of vision and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course long. Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain -- is it not heavy?! Only with death does his course stop -- is it not long?!" We are fully aware of the arduousness of our mission and the length of our course but, we have no choice! The challenge facing the Chinese nation is extremely grim and the development opportunity we have is almost the last one and there is only one way out left for us. Seeking development through reforms and ensuring the success of reforms by combating corruption is the road that China must take in its effort to become a strong nation in the world.
