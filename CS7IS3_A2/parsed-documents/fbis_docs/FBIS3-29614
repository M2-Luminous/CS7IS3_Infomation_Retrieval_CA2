Japanese officials want to confirm with their G-7 counterparts an earlier agreement that erratic movements in the foreign exchange market are undesirable, and will request their cooperation in intervening to prevent such moves, the sources said. The upcoming G-7 meeting brings together finance ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The themes of the G-7 talks will be considered when deputy finance ministers of these countries get together in Washington on Sunday. The sources said they expect the G-7 discussions to deal with, among other things, aid to Russia and policies to stabilize the currency market. The Japanese currency rocketed upward against the U.S. dollar in the wake of the failure last week between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton to reach an agreement on trade talks at their summit meeting in Washington. Speculation that the U.S. will strengthen upward pressure on the yen, after what in effect was a breakdown of the bilateral "framework" trade talks, spurred frantic buying of the yen in the currency market. Although the yen has given up some of its gains due to the Bank of Japan's dollar-buying, yen-selling market interventions, the threat of the Japanese currency jumping up again still exists. Japanese officials will likely tell the G-7 finance ministers that a higher yen has the danger of delaying recovery of Japan's economy as it could offset the benefits of the government's recently announced 15.25 trillion yen economic package, the sources said. The officials will probably assert that not only will a strong yen put a brake on the Japanese economy and work against efforts to reduce the country's trade surplus, but that it would also run counter to the policy of the G-7 countries to strive together for a global economic recovery, they said. Japan's assertions may not be easily accepted, however, amid the country's rift over trade talks with the U.S. Although Europe supports Japan's stance of refusing U.S. demands to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japanese markets, the breakdown in trade talks has already put the Japan-U.S. relationship in a hostile tone. On aid to Russia, the G-7 countries will hear from Russian officials the progress of economic reforms in that country, the sources said. It will consider whether the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can offer Russia the second part of their financial package started in April last year. In July 1993, Russia received 1.5 billion dollars of the 3 billion dollar package, but the remainder of the IMF aid has been withheld since conditions such as improvement in the Russian economic situation have not been met.
