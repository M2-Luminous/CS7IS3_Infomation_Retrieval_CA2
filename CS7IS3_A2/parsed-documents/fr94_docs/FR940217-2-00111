For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on November 15, 1993 at 58 FR 60219. Written Comments: The Department received one written comment and no requests for hearing. The comment was submitted on behalf of the applicants Penn Mutual, PTC and ICMI. The issues addressed in the comment and the Department's responses are summarized as follows: 1. The applicants request that the first sentence of Section I. Covered Transactions section of the Exemption be revised to include the following phrase at the end of subsequent (2) and (3) ``or in connection with a non-benefit withdrawal from the Fund,''. The applicants represent that the added phrase is intended to reflect the fact that it is contemplated that there may be sales of assets of a Fund which form a part of the Stable Asset Trust to Penn Mutual in connection with a non-benefit withdrawal from the Fund by a participating plan. Such sales are authorized in section 5.6(e) of the declaration of trust for the Stable Asset Trust. In accordance with the applicants' request the Department has included the above-referenced phrase at the end of subsections (2) and (3) of Section I of the final exemption. 2. Paragraph 1 of Section II of the proposed exemption states that the decision to invest in a Fund will be made by a plan fiduciary who is responsible for and knowledgeable regarding the investment of plan investments in GICs and similar investment products. Similarly, paragraph 15(a) of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed exemption states that the applicants represent that investment of a Plan's assets in a Fund will be made and approved by a plan fiduciary who is responsible for and knowledgeable regarding the investment of plan assets in guaranteed investment contracts and similar products. The applicants wish to clarify that this condition will be satisfied by an express representation that will be required to be made by the Plan's independent fiduciary under the Independence Stable Asset Trust Participant Investment Agreement. 3. The applicants have noted two factual errors in paragraph 1 of the Summary of Facts and Representation section of the proposed exemption. The correct name of the affiliate listed in the proposed exemption as ``Penn Assurance and Annuity Company'' is ``Penn Insurance and Annuity Company.'' Secondly, as of December 31, 1992, Penn Mutual had $6.9 billion in consolidated assets and not $46.9 billion as reported in the proposed exemption. 4. Paragraph 10 of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed exemption includes a description of the non-benefit withdrawal provisions of the synthetic GIC product. The description includes statements to the effect that the withdrawing plan would be subject to a surrender charge and that there would be a credit against the amount of the surrender charge owing based on the excess of the market value of the units of the Fund held by the Plan over the Plan Account Amount as of such date. The applicants represent that there may be cases where no surrender charges will be applied with respect to non-benefit withdrawals and also there may be circumstances where surrender charges will be applied and will not be subject to any offset. Thus, the word ``would'' as noted above should be changed to ``may''. These provisions, in each case, however, will be determined and approved by the Plan fiduciary at the Fund's inception. 5. Paragraph 11 of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed exemption includes a reference to paragraph 12, which does not appear to relate to the substance of that paragraph. The Department notes that the paragraph labeled ``12'' was incorrectly identified in the Federal Register and the designation for paragraph 13 omitted. As corrected, paragraphs 12 and 13 read as follows.
