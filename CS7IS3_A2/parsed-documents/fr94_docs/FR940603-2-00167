FR940603-2-00167 FR940603-2-00092 Priority 4: ADA education for staff of legal services offices, legal aid societies, and public interest law centers. For a person with a disability, access to technical assistance and good legal advice about the ADA is severely limited by the lack of public interest lawyers trained in the requirements of the ADA. The right to legal advice and their right to file private lawsuits is a critical component of the ADA. According to the latest census data, over 20% of the 12.9 million people of working age reporting the presence of a work disability have family incomes below the Federal poverty threshold. Because of this, people with disabilities are consistently being referred to public interest law centers, legal services offices, and legal aid societies for affordable legal assistance, and yet the vast majority of staff at those offices have not been even minimally trained on the requirements of the ADA. For the high percentage of individuals with disabilities who rely on low-cost or free legal services, it is critical to the successful implementation of the ADA that these lawyers receive training on the ADA. The goal of Priority 4 is to develop and conduct a nationwide training program for staff and boards of legal services offices, legal aid societies, and public interest law centers about titles II and III of the ADA. Priority 4 is an ADA project to educate legal services, legal aid societies and public interest law centers that shall include the following major components: _Develop and conduct a minimum of five regional ADA training seminars; _Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities; _Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including legal groups serving racial and ethnic minority communities; _Develop innovative approaches to reach the widest possible audience with funds available; _Identify and select for training staff and board members of public interest law centers, legal services groups, and legal aid societies from throughout the United States. The following factors should be considered in the selection process: geographical representation from the 50 states; representation from urban, suburban, and rural areas; representation from legal groups serving citizens with minority backgrounds; _Develop a plan for publicizing the availability of the training, using, to the extent possible, existing dissemination mechanisms for legal services and public interest law centers including publications, professional journals, local, state, and national meetings, etc.; _Develop training materials and activities appropriate to public interest lawyers, utilizing existing federally approved materials to the maximum extent possible; _Provide training to selected staff and board members of public interest law centers, legal aid societies, and legal services groups on title II and title III of the ADA and on recent policy developments; _Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; _Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience. Priority 5: ADA education and pilot project for professional mediators. The ADA encourages the use of means other than litigation to resolve ADA disputes. Professional mediators provide an alternative forum for complainants and respondents to resolve their misunderstandings or disagreements about the ADA's requirements. Effective use of professional mediators trained to mediate ADA cases can help bring about compliance with the ADA, while saving both parties from the high costs, delays, and inconveniences often associated with litigation. The goal of Priority 5 is to train a select number of professional mediators nationwide about title III of the ADA, refer title III cases to these mediators for mediation, monitor the outcome of mediation efforts, and evaluate and disseminate the evaluation of the project to mediators and other interested parties nationwide, so that the project can be effectively replicated in other areas of the country. Priority 5 is an ADA education and pilot project for professional mediators that shall include the following major components: _Work with and through one or more national organizations representing professional mediators to assist in publicizing the project to mediators who may participate in the project, as well as to assist in disseminating the final evaluation of the project to mediators and other interested parties nationwide;
