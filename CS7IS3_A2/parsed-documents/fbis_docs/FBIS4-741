South Africa's Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard Visser said it was no longer dangerous to visit the Lesotho capital, where a minister was shot dead and four others were kidnapped on Thursday. Troops occupied a hill overlooking Maseru on Friday morning and sporadic rifle fire was heard, but the city was otherwise calm. The reason for Thursday's revolt could not yet be determined, but it was reported the soldiers who took part in the insurrection bore a grudge against Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo, who was killed on Thursday, and Justice Minister Kelebone Maope. The two ministers earlier this year took part in talks at which rationalisation of the Lesotho Defence Force was recommended.
