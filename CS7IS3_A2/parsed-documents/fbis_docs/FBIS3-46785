(SINOPEC), a company spokesman said Tuesday. A team from Yukong and a Luoyang design company have begun a feasibility study for the project, worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, the spokesman said. The study is scheduled to end in March, and if the result is favorable Yukong will apply for joint-venture approval from the Shenzhen authorities and begin construction in the second half of the year for completion by late 1997, he said. Yukong and SINOPEC agreed to form a locally incorporated joint venture capitalized at 375 million dollars, or 25 percent of the total estimated investment of 1.5 billion dollars. If the refinery is a success, Yukong hopes to build a plant to manufacture petrochemical products with the naphtha it produces. SINOPEC and Yukong will put up 60 percent and 40 percent of the capital, respectively, and borrow other funds on the international financial market using the refinery as collateral, the spokesman said. Of the petrochemical products, 80 percent will be sold in China and 20 percent exported to Southeast Asia.
