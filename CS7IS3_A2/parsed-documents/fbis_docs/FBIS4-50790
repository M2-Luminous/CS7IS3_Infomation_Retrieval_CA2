They held cordial and friendly talks. Verplaetse extended a warm welcome to Li Ruihuan's visit to Belgium, and enthusiastically commended China on its major achievements in reform and opening up. He said: China's rapid and sustained economic development has made China "a model of economic miracles in the Far East." CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan indicated: Since carrying out reform and opening up, China has truly made satisfactory progress in developing its economy. However, it has also encountered some problems in the process. To resolve these problems, China needs to not only establish and improve laws and regulations and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, it also needs to improve qualities of all the Chinese people and to enhance all its nationalities' adaptability. Li Ruihuan said: China is a country with a lot of people and it has a very arduous task to develop its economy. Therefore, while facing the need to import advanced Western technology and equipment, it also needs to learn from Western countries' experiences in regulating and controlling the market. He expressed the hope that Sino-Belgian bankers will increase bilateral exchanges and promote economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
