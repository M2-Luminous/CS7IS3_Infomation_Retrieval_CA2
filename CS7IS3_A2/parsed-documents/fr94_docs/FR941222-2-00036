SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 C.F.R. 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $3,657.84, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to September 30, 1981 and April 27, 1982 Remedial Orders. In the Remedial Orders, the DOE found that, during periods beginning August 1, 1979, the firms each had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The OHA has tentatively determined to distribute the funds obtained from the firms in two stages. In the first stage, we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from the firms who may have been injured by overcharges. The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of the Proposed Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the number of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Ed's Exxon or Ron's Shell. If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be provided prior to the acceptance of claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20585. Dated: December 14, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
