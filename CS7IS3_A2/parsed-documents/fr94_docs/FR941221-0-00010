FR941221-0-00010 FR941221-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;19] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Georgetown, KY AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment establishes Class E airspace at Georgetown, KY. A VOR/DME RWY 3 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Georgetown Scott County-Marshall Field Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface (AGL) is needed to accommodate this SIAP and for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The operating status of the airport will change from VFR to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, March 30, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ralph C. Bixby, Airspace Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, Georgia 30320; telephone (404) 305&hyph;5589. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Georgetown, KY, (59 FR 43308). This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at Georgetown Scott County-Marshall Field Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace areas designated as a surface areas for an airport are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL at Georgetown, Ky, to accomodate the VOR/DME RWY 3 SIAP and for IFR operations at the Georgetown Scott County-Marshall Field Airport. The operating status of the airport will be changed from VFR to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
