In addition to President Luis Alberto Lacalle, Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas; Gustavo Licandro, the Economy and Finance Ministry under secretary; Javier De Haedo, the Planning and Budget Bureau director; and Ernesto Talvi, the Central Bank economic policy manager and a Central Bank adviser, participated in the meeting at the Punta del Este official residence. The sources noted that Lacalle and his economic team reviewed last year's main achievements and confirmed the main guidelines for the 1994 program. The sources said these policy decisions are aimed at having the inflation rate meet the monetary and foreign exchange rate projections and achieving strict compliance with the expenditures policy in order to "again" achieve the fiscal balance target. In addition, official projections estimate that "for the fifth consecutive year" the net debt levels will be reduced, an approximate 1.5-percent economic growth rate will be achieved, the Central Bank reserves will grow again, and a deficit-laden [as published] trade balance will be achieved. The program keeps a 33 percent ceiling for the public sector's salary increases in 1994, including an additional 2.7-percent increase for the settling of accounts and 9-percent adjustments in May and September. Spending Constraints The sources explained that the implementation of a number of measures was confirmed given the 1993 salary adjustments and the loss of some financing sources prompted by tax reductions. These measures will allow the government to achieve a fiscal balance during its last year of administration, thus closing a $270 million fiscal gap, involving about two percentage points of the GDP. The aforementioned measures include limiting current expenditures to 90 percent of those actually incurred in 1993, cutting back on investments in central administration and public enterprises, adjusting for lower unbudgeted expenditures, and increasing ANCAP [National Administration of Fuels, Alcohol, and Portland Cement] and UTE [State Electric Power and Telephones] rates by another 10 percent. The 10-percent increase in ANCAP and UTE rates already has been partially implemented through the November and December adjustments.
