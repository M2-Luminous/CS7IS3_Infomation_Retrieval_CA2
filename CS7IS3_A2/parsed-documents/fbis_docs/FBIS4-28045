Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan once had close relations with Vietnam. "They contributed greatly to helping the Vietnamese people fight invading imperialist forces" for national defense. "Following great political upheavals, which climaxed with the crumbling of the Soviet Union, the relations of cooperation between Vietnam and CIS member countries have become stunted somewhat because of the great difficulties encountered by these friendly countries. But the status of the friendships and the progress of international relations of cooperation in conformity with the epochal trend have become an indispensable demand of the peoples of our country and these friendly countries. "We are very pleased to note that inheriting the traditional relations between the former Soviet Union and Vietnam, the Russian Federation has officially reestablished it diplomatic relations with Vietnam since January 1992. It has continued to help us complete the construction of various projects left unfinished by the former Soviet Union. Its relations of cooperation under the new format and new situation have been expanded to many new areas. The Vietnam-Russia Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Cooperation has been established and it has held three annual meetings. The two sides have signed a number of important documents such as the agreement on cooperation in the areas of communications, transportation, civil aviation, and maritime; the agreement on investment cooperation between the two countries; the agreement on investment protection and avoidance of double taxation; and the protocol on cooperation between the two countries' state banks and trade ministries. "Russia has carried on the work of the former Soviet Union at the Vietsopetro oil joint enterprise and the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. It has helped upgrade various power plants. Direct relations of trade exchanges and economic cooperation under various forms such as partnerships and joint ventures between various localities of the two countries have also enjoyed favorable conditions. Now in Vietnam there have been many partnership enterprises and joint ventures between the two countries, whose status of operations is very satisfactory as it meets the needs, aspirations, and new conditions of each country. "His Excellency Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yarov said in his recent visit to Vietnam that through its economic cooperation with Vietnam, the role of the Russian Federation in Southeast Asia has been asserted. And it is this cooperation that has contributed to consolidating peace and spurring cooperation between the Russian Federation and other countries in the region." Vietnam and Ukraine have official established diplomatic relations since 23 January 1992. Many delegations from various echelons and sectors of the two countries have since exchanged visits to share views on various possible areas of cooperation. "During these visits, many cooperative agreements have been signed such as the agreement on exemption of visas for travel by citizens of the two countries, the agreement on the establishment of the Vietnam-Ukraine Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Cooperation, and so forth." During his visit to Vietnam last April, the Ukrainian foreign minister expressed the fine sentiments of the government and people of Ukraine to Vietnam. He said: "Ukraine is very keen to develop its relations of cooperation with Vietnam." As for the Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan, it shares some similar features with Vietnam. Vietnam and Kazakhstan have established their diplomatic relations since 29 June 1992. "The two sides have exerted efforts to promote relations of cooperation in areas from which they have advantages such as the production of light industry goods, the cultivation and processing of tropical farm products, and the manufacture of spare parts for some machine tools." It can be said that the first visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan has been long expected by the three peoples. All the people assert that the potential for the development of relations of friendship between Vietnam and these countries is very great. It is their desire to jointly exploit this potential for their common, mutually-beneficial goal of contributing to the consolidation of world peace. "It is because of this that the friendly visit of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will be of great significance as it will open up a new page in the relations of friendship among Vietnam, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan."
