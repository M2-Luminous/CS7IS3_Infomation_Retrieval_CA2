In regard to turnover tax, the uniform industry and commerce tax was levied on foreign-funded and foreign enterprises in accordance with the Provisions for the Uniform Industry and Commerce Tax of the People's Republic of China (Draft) which was adopted in principle by the 101st meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1958 and which was promulgated and put into effect on a trial basis by the State Council. On the other hand the product tax, value added tax, and business tax were levied on domestically funded enterprises in accordance with the relevant draft tax regulations promulgated and put into effect on a trial basis by the State Council in 1984 with the NPC Standing Committee's authorization. In 1993 our country comprehensively reformed the industry and commerce tax system, promulgating provisional regulations on the new value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax. At the same time, the fifth meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee decided: "Beginning on 1 January 1994, the provisional regulations on the value added tax, provisional regulations on the consumption tax, and provisional regulations on the business tax promulgated by the State Council will be applicable to foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises," and "the Provisions for the Uniform Industry and Commerce Tax of the People's Republic of China (Draft) will be abolished at the same time." In this way turnover taxes levied on domestically funded enterprises and foreign-funded and foreign enterprises have been unified. This reform is sure to play a positive role in enhancing economic exchanges between our country and other countries, in expanding the opening to the outside world, in utilizing foreign capital to a greater extent, and in promoting the development of foreign-funded enterprises. The new tax system has created a favorable taxation environment for foreign business investment in China. 1. Levying a uniform value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax has evened out tax burdens on domestically funded enterprises and on foreign-funded enterprises. The uniform industry and commerce tax rates for 94 of the 141 industries and product categories subjected to the previous uniform industry and commerce tax were higher than the rates of the product, value added, and business taxes levied on domestically funded enterprises; in some cases the differences were substantial. For instance, in the case of beer, the uniform industry and commerce tax rate was 40 percent, whereas the product tax rate was only 25 percent; in the case of cotton yarn, the uniform industry and commerce tax rate was 23-26 percent, whereas the previous value added tax rate was 14 percent, with an effective tax burden of around 5 percent; in the case of electronic watches and quartz clocks, the uniform industry and commerce tax rate was 20 percent, whereas the previous value added tax rate and the part-of-price tax rate were 14 percent, with an effective tax burden of around 5 percent. In addition, some industries granted tax-break preferences to domestically funded enterprises; for instance, domestically funded flour mills and feed-processing plants were completely exempted from taxes, whereas foreign-funded flour mills and feed-processing plants had to pay a 10-yuan or 5 percent uniform industry and commerce tax. After the reform of the tax system, the value added tax, business tax, and consumption tax are levied on domestically funded enterprises and foreign-funded and foreign enterprises in a uniform manner, thereby eliminating unfairness in tax burdens. 2. Tax burdens created by most of the products produced by foreign-funded enterprises have been reduced or remain unchanged. According to a survey of 1,253 enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Dalian, tax burdens on 70 percent of the enterprises have declined somewhat or remain unchanged after the tax reform. The products which create reduced tax burdens mainly include: beer, refrigerators, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, videocassette recorders, electronic clocks and watches, wrist watches, electric fans, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. 3. The value added tax has eliminated the previous uniform industry and commerce tax's problem of duplicate taxation. A common feature of the previous industry and commerce tax and the new value added tax is the levying of tax on every phase of production and business operation. That is, if a commodity has to go through the production, processing, and marketing carried out by five independent enterprises before finally entering consumption, taxes will be collected five times. However, the previous uniform industry and commerce tax was levied on the total sales revenues; the more phases of production, processing, and circulation a commodity has to go through, the heavier the tax burden will be. The value added tax is levied only on the value added at each phase; the amount of tax burden created by a commodity is directly related to how much value has been added, but is not significantly related to the number of phases of production, processing, and circulation. This is conducive to the specialization, coordination, and socialization of production. 4. Conducive to foreign-funded enterprises' production of products for export. In order to encourage the entry of their own countries products into the international market and to enhance the competitiveness of their own countries' products on the international market, most countries follow a no tax policy toward products for export. Since the start of the opening to the outside world, our country has all along followed a policy of exempting exports produced by foreign-funded enterprises from the uniform industry and commerce tax. As the uniform industry and commerce tax was levied on the total amount at each phase, it was not clear how much tax on raw materials used for producing exports was collected; consequently exports had to be exempted from the final round of taxation. The provisional regulations on the value added tax promulgated in December last year stipulate that the tax rate for exports be zero. It is also stipulated that "in exporting goods for which the applicable tax rate is zero, taxpayers may apply for the refund of tax paid on the exports at taxation agencies on a monthly basis by showing the relevant certificatory documents such as customs declaration forms, after going through customs formalities for exports." That is: there can be a refund of the value added tax collected at all the phases, from that of raw materials to that of finished products, which exports have to go through. The implementation of this policy will doubtless enhance the competitive position of products produced by foreign-funded enterprises on the international market, and is therefore conducive to foreign-funded enterprises' production of products for export. 5. Foreign businesses' vested interests related to their investments in China will be protected. The idea behind the design of this round of reform of the tax system is that reform should neither increase burdens on enterprises nor reduce the state's fiscal revenues, keeping the overall tax burden at the preexisting level. Nevertheless, because of changes in the structure of the tax system, simplification of tax rates, and reform of the arrangement regarding the phases on which taxes are levied, a small number of foreign-funded enterprises will still see increases in their tax burdens despite the fact that tax burdens on most foreign-funded enterprises will be reduced or remain unchanged. In order to ensure that foreign-funded enterprises will not suffer economic-interest losses because of the reform, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee has decided to adopt appropriate measures to resolve the problem of likely increases in tax burdens on foreign-funded enterprises. That is: if their tax burdens are increased because of the change into levying the value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax, those foreign-funded enterprises which were approved and established before 31 December 1993 may receive the refund of the additional amount of tax paid because of the increase in their tax burdens for the approved period of operation, after their relevant applications are approved by taxation agencies; they may receive such tax refunds for a maximum period of five years. A value added tax in kind and, under the existing regulations, the mining-area use fees will be levied on the crude oil and natural gas recovered by offshore oil-exploiting enterprises, but the resource tax will not be levied on them for the time being. The value added tax rate will be 5 percent. 6. The foreigner-involved tax preference policies formulated by the state since the start of reform and opening up will, in principle, all remain unchanged. The Income Tax on Foreign-Funded Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises Law of the People's Republic of China adopted by the NPC in 1991 will still be applied to foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises. A reduced income tax rate of 15 percent will be applied to enterprises in the special economic zones and foreign-funded production enterprises in economic and technological development zones; a reduced income tax rate of 24 percent will be applied to foreign-funded production enterprises in coastal open economic regions and open cities; foreign-funded production enterprises will be exempted from the income tax for two years, and will enjoy an income tax rate which is reduced by half for three years, beginning in the year in which they start to make profits. All the preferential policies on the enterprise income tax will continue to be followed. With regard to turnover tax, the preferential tax policies regarding the uniform industry and commerce tax which were formulated by the state previously, such as those of exempting machinery, equipment, and parts imported by foreign-funded enterprises within the confines of the total volumes of investment from the import-phase turnover tax, of exempting the raw materials imported for the purpose of producing exports from the import-phase turnover tax, and of granting tax preferences to the bonded zones, will all be continued. All this shows that the new tax system has not increased tax burdens on foreign investors but rather created a fair, relaxed, and favorable taxation environment for foreign investors, and that thus it is sure to induce even more foreign businesses to invest in our country.
