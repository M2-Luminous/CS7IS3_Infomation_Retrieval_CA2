On that date the Lentransgaz Association will halt gas deliveries to all the city's power stations. The reason is the usual one--debts. This year the Lentransgaz joint-stock company has not received 60 billion rubles. With sums like that, the system of mutual accounts is no longer working, the Lenpromgaz [as heard] chief engineer said today in an interview to the Sankt-Peterburgskiye Vedemosti Agency. A cardinal solution has to be found. Simply patching up the budget will just lead to the water and light problem returning closer to winter.
