This was reported by the British Defence Ministry Information Service. The consignment consists of 10 of the promised 250 special containers. Moreover, 20 armored trucks will be sent to Russia to transport specific loads such as nuclear warheads. London is helping Moscow to safely transport withdrawn nuclear weapons with a view to accelerating their dismantling and destruction. The British Government has allocated 35 million pounds for this purpose. This was stipulated in a 9 November 1992 bilateral agreement. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the British report. Moreover, it said that we had already received not 10 but 48 supercontainers, which arrived the other day on a British commercial vessel at the port of St. Petersburg. Admittedly, they were not all handed over to the military -- six containers are being kept by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, which is the main recipient of such foreign aid in our country. Apart from the supercontainers and the armored trucks, Britain has promised to supply us with five reserve prime movers. One of them has been being tested on our roads for a year now and, I was told by the military, has proved to be quite a reliable vehicle, able to meet the technical demands made of it. The people I spoke to at the military department refused to show any photographs of the British equipment or to give its performance. They stated that confidentiality on these matters is a requirement of the joint memorandum and one of the conditions for the safe shipment of nuclear weapons from their bases to the railroad and the recycling plants. Nonetheless, they said that the supercontainers are outwardly almost indistinguishable from the ordinary 10-cubic-meter containers used for shipments by rail and sea, and the armored trucks are almost no different from international refrigerated trucks. Except that their off-road capability and engine power are far greater than those of ordinary vehicles, and the armored cab is capable of protecting the nuclear weapon from bullets and grenade fragments in possible acts of terrorism or sabotage. The supercontainers are also protected against fire. Even if a major fire is raging around them, the air around the warhead does not reach a critical temperature. Apart from Britain, the United States, Germany, and France are also giving us help in getting rid of our surplus nuclear weapons, and an accord exists with Italy -- an agreement has been signed but has not yet come into force. The U.S. Government has allocated $400 million for these purposes. The German leadership contributed 10 million German marks [DM] last year for Russia to ensure the safe shipment and temporary storage of nuclear weapons and to draw up plans for processing and recycling weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. This year it has provided another DM9 million, some of which will go to Ukraine. But, the military told me, not a single cent, penny, or pfennig has crossed the CIS borders. All the money is still in the United States, Britain, France, and Germany. Naturally so. In helping Russia and the other former Union republics that still have nuclear weapons on their territory to get rid of their surpluses, Western governments are at the same time securing major orders for their own firms and providing work for their own plants. Of course, the people I spoke to said, we could get by without their help, but then it would take many a long year to get rid of the nuclear weapon overhang. Whereas previously we would transport up to 20 nuclear weapons a year with many natural precautions and in conditions of heightened secrecy, now, for instance, more than 2,000 such warheads have to be withdrawn from Ukraine in the space of three or four years. In the two months since they began to be evacuated, 180 warheads have already been withdrawn on three trains. This is not only very labor-intensive work but is also very costly. Incidentally, foreign aid has not yet been used for these shipments, while the cars intended for the nuclear weapons have been in service for 15-20 years already, new cars have not been built for years, the track on which they will run has also not been repaired for a long time, and if it were not for Western aid it is not clear where all the funds would come from. The military budget could not afford it. At the same time, my interlocutors stated that Western aid accounts for just a few percent of the total volume of work that is being done and will have to be done by Russia itself and its military and civilian specialists. Back in 1991 a special 20-year federal program was drawn up for enhancing the security of nuclear weapons, recycling surplus weapons, and burying the fissionable material. It required expenditure of 240 billion rubles in 1991 prices. Today the figure would be quite different. Perhaps this is why the program has still not been ratified by the Russian Government, although it has not been rejected.
