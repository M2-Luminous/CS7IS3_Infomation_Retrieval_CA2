In an appeal that was signed by Amnesty International and Pax Christi, among others, the Federal Government is asked to discuss with the guest the serious human rights violations in China. Li Peng is responsible for the Tienanmen massacre five years ago, the appeal further notes. By hosting an official reception for Li Peng, the government is proving "how little it cares for human rights when it can expect profits."
