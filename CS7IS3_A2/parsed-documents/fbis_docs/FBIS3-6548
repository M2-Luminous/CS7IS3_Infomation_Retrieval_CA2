Japan should not take an action to appease its own people under pressure from foreign countries as it has done so far, but it should adopt a policy of voluntarily and independently doing what it has to do. However, after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken off, Japan stated with composure: "With the breakdown, the relationship between the two nations has matured." This justification is based on a quite incorrect understanding. It is too optimistic a view that economic issues can be separated from political and security issues. If Japan holds such a view, its national interests may be hampered. Japan has not seriously realized that there are great differences in views as well as in national interests between Japan and the United States. There is a possibility that Japan will in the future become aware that Japanese-U.S. relations will have worsened irreparably. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should take the initiative voluntarily in preventing the Japanese-U.S. relationship from deteriorating further. The Clinton administration also has its problems. The leader that should bear responsibility for the world is unable to make a decision from a broad viewpoint and is instead adopting a policy of emphasizing domestic affairs. The United States can be described as a daimyo who holds a fief which yields 1 million koku [1 koku equals 180 liters] of rice but who acts as if he is daimyo with a fief which yields only 100,000 koku of rice. That country should clearly define the place of the Japanese-U.S. relationship in the world order. There is a concern that Japan revisionists [nihon ishitsu ronsha], who express dissatisfaction with Japan through business dealings with Japan, are at the center of the Clinton administration and that they surround the President. The economic framework talks, which have been at an impasse as the Japanese-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks were before, look like salesmen's negotiations as would be found in the private sector. Because deregulation and the expansion of domestic demand are issues that concern Japan itself, while at the same time they are of benefit to the entire world, Japan needs to take a drastic approach to them. Now that GATT's international trade rules have changed, Japan should at first propose a new Japanese-U.S. structure which includes political and security issues and which takes the new world order into account. To that end, it is appropriate for not only government officials but also learned men who represent the two countries to hold thorough discussions without time limits being set for these.
