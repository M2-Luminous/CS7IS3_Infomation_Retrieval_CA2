The following are the new rules for adjustment of salaries: Private sector salaries will be adjusted by the average value of the past four months. The value in URV's may not be lower than the February payment. Only the basic salary will be adjusted, excluding fringe benefits and additional holiday payments. The minimum salary will also be adjusted by the average value. It will stand at about $64 at the end of March. On the date of actual payment, this amount will correspond to approximately 58,000 real cruzeiros. Anyone hired less than four month ago will have his salary adjusted by the value paid to employees at the same level. The same adjustment rule will apply to public servants' salaries, while in addition they will obtain an increase of 5 percent which will apply for February only. Paychecks will be issued in URV's, while income tax discounts will be calculated in UFIR's [reference fiscal units]. The FGTS [Severance Pay Fund] will be calculated in URV's, to be converted into real cruzeiros on the day it is deposited. Workers who are dismissed without justification will be paid an additional amount equivalent to 50 percent of their salaries. As of now, anyone hired will have his salary fixed in URV's. With the new salary policy, public servant salaries will not be adjusted in March, as they would have been under the current policy. This is an initial loss which, according to Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim, will be compensated for. [Begin Canhim recording] This temporary loss will be practically neutralized by a government decision to grant a bonus in February and a small increase in the salary base. [end recording] Compensation for salary deterioration for private sector workers will be arranged through free negotiations. This is progress, according to Labor Minister Walter Barelli, who unsuccessfully tried to set the minimum salary level at $100. [Begin Barelli recording] The battle was hard, but compensation has been obtained. A decree will be issued today creating a commission to increase the minimum salary by 50 percent in real terms during the rest of this government's term. [end recording] The commission created to find ways to increase the minimum salary has 60 days to conclude its work. Its members are representatives of the Labor, Social Security, Planning, and Finance Ministries, and of the Federal Administration Secretariat. If Minister Barelli's proposal is accepted the minimum salary will stand at approximately $100 at the beginning of 1995. Today the minimum salary is equivalent to approximately 61,000 real cruzeiros.
