"Any visit to the South by North Korean Chondogyo officials and a South-North Chondogyo contact to discuss the visit are not permissible," a National Unification Board official said on Tuesday. He said such a move runs counter to the government policy of withholding all travels back and forth between the two sides due to the nuclear issue. The central headquarters of Chondogyo, an indigenous religious organization, formally asked the unification board earlier in the day to send to the North its reply that they had accepted the North Korean Chondogyo proposal to have a working-level contact at Panmunjom on Feb. 3. In a telephone message to the South's Chondogyo on Jan. 24, Yu Mi-yong, guidance chairman of the North Korean Chondogyo, offered to have a working-level contact at Panmunjom.
