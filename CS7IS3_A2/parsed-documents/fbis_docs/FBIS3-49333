Our correspondent Renata Havranova, editor of the daily PRACE, sent us this report: [Begin Havranova recording] While Madeleine Albright talked to Slovak President Kovac, Gen. Shalikashvili held talks with Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Both representatives of the U.S. side later, at a brief news conference, expressed their great satisfaction with the course of all meetings with Slovak representatives. In their opinion, it is evident from these meetings that Slovakia can become the first country of Central Europe to sign the U.S.-proposed Partnership for Peace plan. Gen. Shalikashvili added that Slovakia had understood the U.S. intention to aid the stability and security of Europe by this plan without creating new dividing lines. President Kovac replied to a question asking if he presented his recently published counter proposal to the U.S. guests by saying that he never had any counter proposal. On the contrary, he appreciates that the central motive of the Brussels summit will be a decision to build a qualitatively new relationship between NATO and other countries of Europe. The U.S. endeavor to support the security of our continent as a whole is, according to Kovac, self-evident. The Partnership for Peace plan is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and also an instrument for Slovakia and other countries to draw closer to NATO. It is also an opportunity to expand the security and stability zone further east, the president said. Kovac went on to say that the Slovak Republic wanted to become an active participant in the Partnership for Peace plan. However, Slovakia expects that the acceptance of the other side, irrespective of its form, will also constitute a definitive decision about the geopolitical incorporation of the Slovak Republic into the NATO sphere of interests. According to Kovac, through Partnership for Peace, the Slovak Republic has conclusively claimed its allegiance to Western states. [end recording]
