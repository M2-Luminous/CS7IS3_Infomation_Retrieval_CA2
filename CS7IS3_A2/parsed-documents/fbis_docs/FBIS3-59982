He said that drug use is now spreading rapidly. The Ministry of Education is trying get teachers to tell students about the dangers of drugs. He said that in his view, there has been a marked increase in drug use in the south. This is the responsibility of narcotics units and the police. Administrative officials must formulate a system in order to step up the monitoring of drug activities. ``It must be admitted that in the southern border provinces, a large number of youths are addicted to drugs. But the government is not ignoring this problem. Teachers will be asked to monitor their students more closely in order to control drug use. This is all that the Ministry of Education can do.''
