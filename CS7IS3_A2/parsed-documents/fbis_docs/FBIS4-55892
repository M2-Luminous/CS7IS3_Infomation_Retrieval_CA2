Martic expressed dissatisfaction over the way this has been handled by Gehrt Ahrens and Kai Eide, deputy cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia, and proposed that Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in Yugoslavia, take over as the coordinator to bring about the resumption of talks. According to a statement by the RSK president's office, the two deputy cochairmen have acted as mediators in a tendentious and one-sided [as received] way and and have, in fact, only been passing on Croatian demands to the republic of Serb Krajina. President Martic said that mediation by a neutral and objective diplomat such as Yasushi Akashi would certainly produce certain results and would speed up the negotiating process between Knin and Zagreb.
