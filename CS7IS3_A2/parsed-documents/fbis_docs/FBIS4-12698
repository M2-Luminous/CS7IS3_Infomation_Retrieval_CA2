He noted that given Israel's social and political structure and the aggressive and expansionist theory dominating its institutions, Israel finds it difficult to continue the peace process and ensure the conditions and concessions necessary for its success. He said that Israel's failure to instigate a civil war among the Palestinians prompted it to commit the crime of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and then to attempt to disturb security and foment sedition in Lebanon, particularly with the horrific crime in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. He pointed out that there is a clear link between the two crimes at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and Sayyidat al-Najat Church, with the aim of avoiding peace. On the goal behind the recent security incidents, Mirhij said the perpetrators sought to harm the economic and social situation in Lebanon and to play on sensitivities to aggravate the situation and foil the formula that the Lebanese people agreed upon in al-Ta'if. Asked about explosives being placed in Ghidras and the Lebanese Army surrounding the area, Mirhij attributed the security and political focus on the Kasrawan area to the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and the French cultural center, which took place in that area.
