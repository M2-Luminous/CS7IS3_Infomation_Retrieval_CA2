Today, the government and UNITA spent the whole day discussing the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. The government wants Vorgan to operate as a commercial radio station and stop broadcasting on medium wave because it violates the law. UNITA accepts this, but says for historic reasons the transformation of Vorgan into a commercial station must be gradual. The two delegations will continue discussing the issue tomorrow. Although the talks have not yet discussed a new mandate for the UN Angola Verification Mission, the United Nations has already invited a number of countries to monitor the peace process once an accord is signed in Lusaka. Jack Mabanga, Zambia's secretary of state for defense, told today's edition of the Zambian DAILY MAIL that Zambia is one of these countries.
