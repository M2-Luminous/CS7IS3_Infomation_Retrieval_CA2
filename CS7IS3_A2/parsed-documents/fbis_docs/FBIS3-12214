Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, informed U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross of the decision reached by the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese delegations. He pointed out that the decision had been personally made by the representatives of the various Arab delegations. Israeli sources expressed the assessment that this was an indication of the desire of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan not to exacerbate the tensions generated by the Hebron massacre. Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington told our correspondent Arye Golan that Israel was prepared to launch continuous negotiations with the Palestinians in Washington starting this Wednesday [2 March], as proposed by President Clinton; however, this was now up to the PLO. Political sources in Jerusalem expressed regret at the break in the talks, noting that this was merely a temporary hiatus which did not mean that the peace process had been halted. The resumption of the Security Council's debate on the Hebron massacre has been put off due to the PLO's demand to include Jerusalem in the resolution calling for guarantees for the security of the Palestinians in the territories. Israel is prepared to accept this formula but refuses to include Jerusalem in it. Israel has also rejected the PLO demand to include a clause on a temporary international presence in the territories. Gad Ya'aqobi, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, said that the international presence stipulated in the Declaration of Principles signed between the PLO and Israel referred to foreign observers that would be deployed with the mutual consent of both parties during the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The Security Council is not convening because of the disagreement over these two issues. For the time being, agreement has only been reached on issuing a condemnation of the Hebron massacre and a call for accelerated peace negotiations. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 28 February reports that "political sources in Jerusalem believe that the United States will take action to resume the peace talks after the Security Council issues its resolutions. Yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin received a letter from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus- Ghali. The secretary general called on Israel to agree to an international or foreign presence in the territories as stipulated by the Declaration of Principles signed in Oslo, although that document mentions the issue from a different aspect. Butrus-Ghali justifies his position by saying that stationing an international presence in the territories would constitute a confidence building measure between Israel and the Palestinians. Officials in Jerusalem, however, have categorically rejected this demand. Jerusalem officials also clarified that no additional decisions would be taken beyond those made by the cabinet yesterday."]
