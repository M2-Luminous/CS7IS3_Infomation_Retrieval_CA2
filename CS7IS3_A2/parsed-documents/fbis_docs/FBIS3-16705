This is one of the first trips abroad by the Pentagon chief. At the end of last year, when Perry was offered the post of secretary of defense to replace Les Aspin, who had resigned, evil tongues maintained that the candidate was good in every respect -- an experienced leader, an expert in high technologies, and a successful entrepreneur -- but not a politician. In Kiev, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and, particularly, Moscow, Perry will have to demonstrate his qualities as a political leader. The Pentagon chief is coming to Moscow literally a couple of days after the Vladivostok meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- which gives grounds for assuming that they are connected not only in time but in aims. In addition to tackling questions of bilateral cooperation between the United States and Russia in the military sphere, Perry must demonstrate that Washington's policy in support of democratic transformations in Russia has not changed, despite the friction which has arisen recently, and that the partnership will be continued. On the eve of his trip the secretary spoke at the George Washington University. He emphasized that "all the major powers, including those friendly to the United States, have their own interests, which sometimes run counter to Washington's. We cannot expect Russia or any other great power to act against its own national interests." At the same time in relations between states there must not be even a hint of jealousy of others' successes. The defense secretary once again made a high assessment of Russia's contribution to settling the crisis in the Balkans and, in particular, to removing the Serb artillery from positions around Sarajevo. Speaking of the main aims of U.S. policy toward Russia, Perry outlined to some extent the range of problems which he intends to touch on in Moscow -- guarantees of security and of the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the maintenance of regional stability in the region, including the states of the former Warsaw Pact. Special attention will evidently be devoted to Russia's attitude to the NATO "Partnership [sotrudnichestvo] for Peace" program, which Moscow is in no hurry to subscribe to, although it has declared its readiness. As has been learned from informed sources, the problem of recycling radioactive elements will be discussed in the talks -- a problem which, in the Russian leadership's opinion, can be resolved only with all possible international assistance. Moscow's offer of broader cooperation might meet with understanding on the part of the U.S. secretary, who believes that closer relations with Moscow not only help to advance democracy in Russia but also contribute to better understanding of what is happening there, on those immense expanses. IZVESTIYA was told at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that the program has not yet been finalized, and it is too soon to say anything specific about the visit.
