Sources close to the presidential palace said that the Honduran Armed Forces will be reduced from 24,000 to 12,000 troops, an amount similar to Nicaragua's Armed Forces. Reduction of the Honduran military will follow once the demilitarization in Nicaragua and El Salvador is completed, in accordance with these neighboring countries' peace agreements. General Luis Alonso Discus Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, said recently that the Honduran Army will reduce operating costs by 10 percent.
