His negative answer came in response to a question from an Interfax correspondent asking whether or not he promised Guliyev to withdraw Armenian forces within 20 days as Baku was alleging. At the same time, Ararktsyan said the withdrawal of troops was envisaged by the CSCE-proposed peace plan of last November which both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had approved. He called for the Lachin corridor linking Armenia with the disputed territory to remain intact. Ararktsyan spoke of the two sides' renewed commitment to a regional peace settlement. But for this to happen, he said, any talks on Nagorno-Karabakh must follow a durable regional cease-fire. He stressed the need for the enclave to be made party to regional peace talks. Ararktsyan spoke of offering his Azeri counterpart to reopen Armenian roads for Azeri shipments of cargoes and fuel to Nakhichevan as a way of "restoring mutual trust and ending charges about Armenia blocking" that Azeri enclave. State Secretary of Azerbaijan Gabil Huseinli [name as received] maintains that the Armenian side had offered promises of withdrawing its troops from occupied Azeri territories within the next 20 days, at Saturday's meeting between parliamentary leaders of the two countries. In an interview with Interfax, he said the Armenian pullout would be done in two stages. Initially, the warring sides are to withdraw troops at a distance of 10 km to 15 km away from the engagement line, observers are to be moved into the buffer zone and refugees are to be returned to their homes simultaneously. Huseinli said that if Armenia kept up its promise by relinquishing at least part of the annexed territory as a goodwill gesture, the prospect of an Azeri-Armenian summit would become ever more real. He said the territory to be relinquished was outside Nagorno-Karabakh while the Lachin corridor linking the enclave and mainland Armenia would remain under Armenian control. In the meantime, Lachin and the Karabakh city of Shusha, whose population was mainly Azeri before the conflict broke out, are to be discussed during talks on the future of the disputed territory, he said. Huseinli said Baku preferred CSCE-brokered talks on regional peace though praising Moscow's mediation in the peace process despite its traditional support for Armenia.
