[Begin Sifi recording] We will look into the means available. God willing, we will make an effort to provide you with the means in all fields. We will have to be realistic and bear in mind the circumstances and the means available to the state. We, as a government, and also the people notice that the policemen are sacrificing their lives to defend this homeland so that it can remain a state of law. The main thing is that this is a noble mission that concerns the defense of one of the basic human rights. Many people talk about human rights but we should not forget that the main and the most crucial human right is the right to life, and the defense of this right is a noble mission. This mission is carried out by the police and all security corps who have sacrificed so much for the state and for Algeria. Algeria will not forget these sacrifices, which aim to protect the citizens and their property and defend this nation and this people. I must say and stress that the state, with Mr. Liamine Zeroual at its head, is opposing this violence and will continue to do so until the situation quiets down and things return to normal and until stability is restored, God willing. This will be relentless until stability and tranquillity are restored so that we can let our people choose their representatives. [end recording] [passage omitted]
