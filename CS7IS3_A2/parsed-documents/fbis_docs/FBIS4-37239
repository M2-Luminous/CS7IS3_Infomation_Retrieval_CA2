FBIS4-37239 "drnes118_j_94010" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Salih, Defense Minister Said To Differ Over Entering Aden Salih, Defense Minister Said To Differ Over Entering Aden JN1906085694 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 19 Jun 94 p 24 JN1906085694 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN ["Exclusive" report by Fathi al-Qatta' in Sanaa] [Text] Early this week, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry stopped financial remittances through the Yemeni Central Bank to some of its diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Those include the embassies in Washington, New Delhi, Rome, Havana, Cairo, Muscat, Tehran, and Nairobi. The measure was adopted because the majority of the staff of those embassies supports the secessionist step declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid on 21 May. Last week, Najib al-Haddi, a leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] and brother-in-law of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the Presidential Council, was killed in the battlefield. Muqbil al-Fil, a member of the Yemeni House of Representatives and a leader of the YRG, was also killed. Official and semiofficial Yemeni newspapers, as well as some parties that support unity, have launched fierce media campaigns against Saudi Arabia after its involvement in the Yemeni crisis and support for the secessionists diplomatically and militarily. During President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to the two newly created camps of Zafar and al-Fatah in Dhamar last week, it was noticed for the first time that there were tanks having a different color of soil and desert. It was learned that these tanks were sent by Saudi Arabia to the secessionist forces through the Sharurah region, under Saudi occupation, near Hadhramaut. The forces of legitimacy seized those tanks but did not announce this. There have been some changes in the military leaders. Some commanders who are close to President Salih were dismissed. Those included Colonel Ahmad Faraj, commander of the Khalid Bin-al-Walid Camp, and Colonel 'Abdallah al-Qadi, commander of the Infantry Brigade. The two camps are in Ta'izz. The commanders were dismissed because of the losses sustained by the forces of the two camps on the fronts. It is also rumored in Sanaa that there has been a recent dispute between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the defense minister, because the latter refused to storm Aden justifying this by the great losses that the forces will incur, as well as the civilian losses. Hadi thinks what should be done is only to tighten the siege around Aden for some time and consequently bring about a change within the leadership and the military command of the Yemeni Socialist Party. Sanaa restored direct contacts with the outside world yesterday.
