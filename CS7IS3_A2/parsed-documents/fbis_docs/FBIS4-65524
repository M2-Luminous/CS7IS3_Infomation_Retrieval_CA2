Maroni said that the Vicenza police chief had authorized the march off his own bat, without informing the ministry, and that the latter had evidently given the green light after taking only matters of public order and safety into account, with no political assessment. In fact, no violence broke out during the demonstration, but the sight of hundreds of skinheads marching through the streets in black leather, arms raised in the Fascist salute, set off alarm bells up and down the peninsula. Already Sunday evening, national police chief Vincenzo Parisi issued a communique saying that he had issued instructions that no such marches or rallies would henceforth be allowed, in the interests of public order. The Vicenza police chief Romano Argelio was said to be replaced by his colleague Di Censo, while the prefect Michele De Feis was being replaced by Castronovo. Meanwhile, it was learned that police blocked an attempted demonstration outside the French embassy in Rome Monday night [16 May] by a score or so of extreme right-wing youths belonging to an association called Spina nel Fianco (Thorn in the Side). Men from the special Digos branch of the police force detained the youths who said they wanted to commemorate Sebastien Dyzisu, the 22-year-old ultra who plunged to his death from a fifth-floor window in Paris on May 7 trying to escape police after clashes which erupted when a skinhead boutique was shut down. Among the members of Spina nel Fianco detained and later released was Stefano Andrini who, along with his brother Germano, was convicted in 1991 to 4 years and 8 months in jail for taking part, along with other skinheads, in an attack on two youths in Rome in June of 1989. For his part, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightist National Alliance [AN], said those who took part in the skinhead demonstration in Vicenza over the weekend were numbskulls who would do better to go work in the mines. There is absolutely no connection between the entrance of the AN in the government and this first ever national skinhead demonstration in Italy, he insisted. It was later learned that he called for the withdrawal of a bill presented earlier by the AN to abrogate that part of the Constitution which bans the recreation of the Fascist Party. The Vicenza demonstration was led by Piero Puschiavo, who is under investigation for attempting to re-form the banned Fascist Party of Benito Mussolini. Puschiavo, who heads an organization calling itself the Veneto Skinheads Front, founded in Rome in 1991, at a rally following the march praised Fascist ideals and compared Fascists killed during World War II to those who died fighting against Mussolini and Hitler.
