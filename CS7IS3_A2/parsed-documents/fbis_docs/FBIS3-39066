"No member state is fully opposed and the United Kingdom and Germany have already showed their support," Fenech Adami said yesterday in a meeting with several journalists. The Maltese prime minister was in Brussels for talks with the European Commission. He also had a meeting with Prime Minister Dehaene. Malta applied for membership of what was the European Community on 16 July 1990. Fenech Adami said that the required reforms, like the introduction of value added tax, the abolition of capital controls or reduced customs duties, have either been implemented or are about to be approved by Parliament. The membership of this small state located in the Mediterranean Sea would not pose many economic or budgetary problems for the EU, which has 345 million inhabitants at present. This figure would even increase to 370 million inhabitants if Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria joined. The country consists of three small islands with a total of 360,000 inhabitants. The reforms requested are intended simply to prevent membership becoming too great a shock for the Maltese economy. Nor does the domestic political situation offer any reason for disquiet to the Union. The way the Union functions would be the biggest problem arising from Maltese membership. As a small country with little international experience and a small diplomatic corps and civil service, it is doubtful whether Malta would be able to take on the six-monthly presidency. Out of the present member states, only Luxembourg has so few inhabitants, but it has been involved in European integration right from the start. A modification to the rules will be discussed at the planned inter-governmental conference in 1996. However, many will be reluctant to start new institutional discussions after the difficulties with the Maastricht Treaty. But according to Fenech Adami, it was senseless to avoid this discussion and Malta's application should not suffer on these grounds. He rejected a possible link between the applications of Malta and Cyprus or postponement, should the talks with Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria become stuck. Language will in any case not be an obstacle. Malta is prepared to use English rather than Maltese in the Union, so that the Union would not have to add another language.
