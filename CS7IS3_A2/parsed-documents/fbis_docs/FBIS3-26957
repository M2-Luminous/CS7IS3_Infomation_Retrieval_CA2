Not only should the income index be assessed, but a full set of reform and the establishment of a new mechanism and structure should also be taken into account. In Guiyang yesterday Chen Shineng and his entourage visited the cadres and staff members of the Weixing Financial Office, the Toutiao Taxation Office, the Jinhua Taxation Office, and the Zhongnan Financial and Taxation Office. He expressed his Lunar New Year greetings to them and all financial and taxation staff members in the province on behalf of the provincial party committee and government. After listening to a feedback report by the Weixing Financial Office, Chen Shineng said: In the major reform projects to be carried out in the province this year, financial reform will be given top priority, and its success or failure will have a direct bearing on the entire reform. Because there is no ready-made experience to go by, we will carefully proceed with financial reform according to Marxist-Leninist methods and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, keeping in mind Guizhou's specific conditions. We should not merely consider increasing indices in task fulfillment, but we should also formulate practical and coordinated measures and policies and should establish a new financial and taxation mechanism and structure. [passage omitted] Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of deepening financial and taxation reform, financial and taxation departments in all localities should consider new situations and new problems. In particular, they should consider and resolve prominent problems during the replacement of the old structure by the new. In the meantime, we should do a good job in promoting the economy at the county level. In the Toutiao Taxation Office, which has won the designation of a nationally renowned taxation office, Chen Shineng wrote an inscription, which reads: Learn From This Nationally Renowned Taxation Office. In the Jinhua Taxation Office, which has been cited as an advanced collective by the State Taxation Bureau, Governor Chen Shineng explicitly indicated the need for all financial and taxation departments in the province to learn from the Jinhua Taxation Office in increasing revenue and improving their mental attitude and professional quality. Chen Shineng also took a group photograph with some financial and taxation personnel.
