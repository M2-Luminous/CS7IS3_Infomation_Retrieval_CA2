FR941116-0-00075 FR941116-0-00012 C. Statement C_Pipeline Facilities and Services In Statement C, the Commission is requiring the oil pipeline to describe its own facilities and services in the relevant markets identified in Statements A and B. Statement C must include all pertinent data about the pipeline's facilities and services in those markets. For example, without limitation, the oil pipeline would have to include data on the capacity of its facilities, on its throughput, on its receipts in its origin markets, on its deliveries in its destination markets and to its major consuming markets, and the mileage between its terminals and its major consuming markets. Data should be supplied for each commodity carried, such as jet fuel, gasoline, etc. The AOPL maintains that, aside from its origin market objection, the proposed Statement C would require extremely sensitive shipper receipt and delivery information, which, in many instances, would constitute disclosure of confidential shipper information in violation of Section 15(13) of the ICA. It adds that disclosure of data for each commodity carried would compound the problem. It makes two requests. First, Statement C should be streamlined to require only information likely to influence the ultimate market power determination and, second, some mechanism must be developed to safeguard the confidentiality of the information filed. Alberta and Total support the Commission's proposal to collect detailed data. Total adds that the Commission should direct its staff to aggregate delivery data submitted by all pipelines serving each BEA and calculate delivery-based HHIs because the availability of such studies would reduce the need and difficulty of obtaining such data in discovery. It further states that the delivery data also will be useful to determine the extent of excess capacity and to determine the likelihood that terminals would be constructed in response to a rate increase because it is necessary to know the extent of available uncommitted upstream capacity and supplies to serve a new terminal. The Commission rejects the AOPL's request that Statement C require only data likely to influence the ultimate market power determination because it would enable the oil pipeline to make that determination at the outset. The AOPL's concern about safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive information is being addressed through a change in procedures as discussed above. In this rule, the Commission will not direct staff to collect aggregate delivery data and calculate delivery-based HHIs. However, if the Commission receives sufficient data to make collection warranted, it may reconsider this in the future.
