One can feel that the Yemeni public in Sanaa, and perhaps outside Sanaa too, support the president of the Yemen Arab Republic in his efforts to maintain unity by any possible means, because unity is a popular demand. Therefore, there is a rift between the Yemenis in connection with this issue. What do you want to tell the Yemenis in Sanaa and the northern governorates who consider you separatists? You did secede. What do you want to tell the people, the ordinary citizens, who maintain that you seceded from the unified state? [Al-'Attas] Regrettably, we in Yemen, just like the rest of the Arab homeland, handled the unity issue emotionally. Facts and reason had no influence on the formulation of the unity policies we pursued nor on the manner in which we implemented them. [Jazulit] You therefore bear responsibility for the failure of unity... [Al-'Attas, interrupting] Certainly everyone is to blame. The leaders bear the blame, certainly. When we the southern leaders united with the northern leaders to establish the Yemeni union, the public responded favorably to this great national dream. As a consequence, the Republic of Yemen was proclaimed. However, when the people realized that things were being done that were different from those they had expected under the aegis of unity, they began to declare their rejection of these acts and this form of unity. Perhaps the masses of the people in the southern and eastern governorates, currently the Democratic Republic of Yemen, made their feelings known during the parliamentary elections of 27 April 1993. They declined to give a single vote to the representatives of the government in the northern governorates. They gave their entire vote and all the parliamentary seats in their governorates to the representatives of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] which formerly represented the leaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The masses of the people in Sanaa, and indeed all Yemeni people, support the unity. However... [Jazulit, interrupting] The masses of the people in Sanaa regard you as separatists. [Al-'Attas] I do not believe that is true. The people in Sanaa know who the separatist really is. Perhaps the southernmost governorates of northern Yemen, that is the Yemen Arab Republic, are suffering more than the southern governorates ever suffered. We embarked on a union with the understanding that it would be an equal union between partners formed by the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic, which would then integrate the institutions of both parts of the country. However, the brothers [in the north] looked on the union as an annexation. Some Sanaa leaders said that the part had returned to the whole. We found this reasoning unacceptable. We first expressed our rejection of this reasoning during meetings held in September 1990 between the YSP Political Bureau and the General People's Congress' General Committee. [Jazulit] Let us again discuss the government that you head. It is a government without a parliament. Will this government be an interim government serving merely to explore the reactions of the Yemeni public here? What does the public expect from you? [Al-'Attas] First of all, we have formed an interim parliament and called it the National Assembly. [Jazulit] Does this parliament actually have a constitutional character? [Al-'Attas] Yes, under the circumstances. This parliament is composed first of the representatives of the electoral constituencies who were elected in the southern and eastern governorates and who formerly made efforts to strengthen Yemeni unity. Representatives of the political forces in the Democratic Republic of Yemen were also included in this parliament. We believe that this National Assembly, which is an interim one, is sufficiently constitutional to monitor and supervise affairs of government legally. [Jazulit] Where do you place public opinion here, in south Yemen, on your list of priorities, that is, on the list of the priorities of the government you will chair? You must take what the Yemeni public wants into account. The YSP must certainly have made errors for which the Yemenis have paid a price. Now you have formed a new state and you have a government and an interim parliament, as you mentioned. Could you tell me what the masses expect from you? [Al-'Attas] I believe you were here in Aden when the Democratic Republic of Yemen was proclaimed, or indeed, reestablished. This republic has maintained all its institutions despite the union years as a result of the conduct of the Sanaa leaders. You have noticed how the masses of the people were very joyful at this proclamation, here in Aden and in all the other governorates. Regrettably, our people here in the southern governorates see themselves as entering a new stage of independence. Independent of whom? Of our brothers in Sanaa. [Jazulit] This is a very dangerous sentiment. [Al-'Attas] Of course, this is a very dangerous sentiment and we frequently warned that it might occur. [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas, you are well-known as a statesman. At the same time, you are one of the YSP's leaders. I know, and you know too, that before the union between the two parts of Yemen was proclaimed, there were people in this party who rejected the union on the grounds that the time was not yet ripe for it. Apparently a few people in the YSP monopolized the decisions and did not take into account the general attitude of the YSP leaders and members. On this basis you embarked on a union which lasted for four years and then you returned to Aden. Do you hold yourselves responsible for the union's failure? [Al-'Attas] Without a doubt, we bear some responsibility for the failure of the Yemeni union experiment. However, I totally agree with the view of Shaykh Sulayman Abu-Luhum. When the president asked him: Why do you criticize me, not the YSP and the southerners? He answered him: You bear 70 percent of the responsibility for the failure. The YSP bears 30 percent of the responsibility. [Jazulit] Why does the president take 70 percent of the blame while you represent two basic parties in unified Yemen? [Al-'Attas] When I speak of the president, I talk about the executive leadership in Sanaa. This leadership was a primary cause underlying the failure of this experience. I do not deny our responsibility. But compared to their responsibility, our responsibility is very slight. [Jazulit] You did not reply to the second part of my question about your possible withstanding of self-criticism before the Yemeni people in the southern republic. [Al-'Attas] We certainly exercise self-criticism all the time. When we make mistakes, we talk about our mistakes. The YSP in particular has been one of the parties that exercise self-criticism after each stage. Before unity, we criticized the prevailing situation and drew up a program for political and economic reform. I believe that self-criticism is a source of power; it makes room for progress and for avoiding mistakes. We certainly criticize ourselves when we make mistakes. Equally, when others make mistakes, we have to criticize them constructively. [Jazulit] In your new republic, you raise the slogan of democracy and unity. Can you explain your strategy in the economic field? [Al-'Attas] In our new policy in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we are committed to developing the economy into a market economy and are working for economic freedom. This course is in full harmony with the democratic approach. It gives equal opportunities for competition, which means providing better services at lower prices. Therefore, we are working and will continue to work for establishing economic freedom and paving the way for private and share-holding companies to run the various aspects of the national economy within the framework of the state laws and legislations. In my view, this is an approach that enables us to develop, just like the approach of democratic political practice. It is true that this road is hard and long and involves a certain sacrifice, but it is the safe and guaranteed road to prosperity and social and economic development for all the masses. [Jazulit] As long as we are talking about the economic approach, I learned that you are seriously contemplating applying to join the Gulf Cooperation Council. There is a geographic element involved. Moreover, you state that you are committed to a free economy. All these factors show that you are seriously pursuing that goal. Is this true? [Al-'Attas] I believe that the states of the Arab archipelago must maintain the highest level of cooperation and coordination. [Jazulit] What about joining the Gulf Cooperation Council? [Al-'Attas] I believe that this is a good step that should be taken. [Jazulit] A question before the end: Where does opposition stand in the political arena in your new republic? That is, of course, if there is opposition. During years of unity, the opposition played a central role in the meetings of the national dialogue committee. Its role was to reconcile the two major parties. After fighting broke out, unity disintegrated; some supported the south and are helping you in your new republic, while others stayed in and are getting support from Sanaa. The secession that led to the proclamation of a new republic here played a negative role at the opposition level and its future. Where does opposition stand in your new republic? [Al-'Attas] In fact the opposition played an important role in phrasing the Pledge and Accord Document, the document because of which Sanaa launched a war. This is clear in the statements that started on 18 January and continued until a few days ago, when Sanaa added yet another condition, saying that it accepts negotiations, but not on the basis of the document. Why? Because the document was the right way to refute the divine authority claim of the executive leadership in Sanaa. That leadership thought that it had inherited the right to lead and hence it should continue to control Yemen. The Pledge and Accord Document would have ended such an era. But the leadership sensed that it was being threatened and launched war on Yemen. We are now in a state of war. The national unity that embraces all political and social powers is being enhanced in the institutions we established. Accordingly, the task of the government and the institutions we are building now is to remove the impact of war. [Jazulit] Then is it a provisional government? [Al-'Attas] Yes, a provisional government. As declared in the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we will prepare for local government and parliamentary elections within a year, God willing. [Jazulit] You are coming closer to decisive developments. [Al-'Attas] Certainly. But we feel safe, because everyone here will act in a civilized and responsible manner. No one will carry a machine gun, gun, or bomb. All citizens in the southern and eastern governorates are marching along the road of democracy peacefully. Therefore, we expect democracy to flourish. No citizen will be coerced or subjected to injustice or oppression in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas; thank you for this meeting. [Al-'Attas] Thank you very much.
