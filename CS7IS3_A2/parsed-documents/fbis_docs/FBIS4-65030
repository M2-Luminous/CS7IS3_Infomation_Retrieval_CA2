The economic stabilization package and the controversy over the formation of new government have caused the Kurdish question to be temporarily forgotten. But the conflict has not come to a halt. On the contrary, the number of confrontations has increased. Following the decisions taken during the PKK's Third National Conference, it is clear that the army is determined to finish the matter by the end of the summer by means of an all-out war. But the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) also decided to declare all-out war in March. These decisions have created impassable obstacles to democratic or political solutions and have also signalled that the year 1994 will be of crucial importance in the history of this question. Statements issuing both from the army and from the PKK suggest that there will be a further escalation of violence and that more blood will be shed before the end of the summer. As of April, parallel to the operations initiated by the army, there has been an increases in PKK activities. Meanwhile, the unsolved murders which have become characteristic of the Southeast region have suddenly begun to increase. We mentioned in our previous articles that the PKK had launched some diplomatic initiatives as part of its strategy, primarily in an attempt to get European countries to put forward proposals for a solution, and that the PKK was waiting for the outcome of these initiatives. The period of waiting is about to end.... It has been impossible to get a definitive report on the result of the operations which the Turkish army has launched against the PKK. Both army and PKK sources claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties--a familiar tactic. The army has announced that 4500 PKK militants have been eradicated, and that camps like Shive, Haftanin and Mezi have been destroyed and are unusable. However it is a known fact that the PKK had not used those camps following the operations carried out by the army in 1992. In other words, the army had launched assaults on uninhabited camps. Meanwhile, according to the reports received from the region, minor clashes only have taken place and not the large-scale engagement that has been spoken of. The PKK militants have managed to protect themselves with hit-and-run tactics and their losses have not matched what was claimed by the army. The PKK have also boasted of major successes in order to establish a psychological superiority. They claim to have killed 630 soldiers, of whom 30 were ranking officers. Their statements also reported that many tanks had been destroyed and that a number of helicopters had been shot down. While the army and the PKK both continue to come up with false statistics, it is at least clear that the army has failed to get the results it was looking for from its cross-border operations. It also seems that talk about the creation of buffer zones was mistaken because a significant proportion of the forces moved to the region have since been withdrawn. However airborne operations are still being carried out, and statements insist that the PKK will be finished until the end of summer. The army has now to come to terms with the fact that a package of democratic reforms is in preparation. Following the press coverage of the telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and True Party (DYP) ministers Necmettin Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace, it has also been made public that the term of office of the chief of General Staff, Gen. Dogan Gures, will be extended for another year and that Ciller and Gures have agreed on a democratization package. It's clear that the democratization package that the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) had earlier announced contains only proposals made some time previously. What is important here is the fact that the chief of general staff has agreed with the prime minister about the preparation of a democratization package. The prime minister has also announced that the deputy prime minister, Murat Karayalcin, also supports the package. It is quite evident that 1994 will be critical for the Kurdish question. But it is also certain that the army will not be able to finish off the PKK this summer. Democratic reforms prepared in such circumstances will not be workable, and a package worked out jointly with the army does not look like a genuine remedy for anything. It is not a prediction to say that violence will further increase, because the army has already launched an all-out war, and so has the PKK. Meanwhile, within the last month, incidents such as unsolved murders and the abduction or execution of citizens have increased. A considerable number of people have also lost their lives in mine blasts. Within the PKK organization, hardliners have completely taken control. Despite PKK Leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls for peace and his instructions that soldiers should not be attacked, the decisions taken at the PKK's 3rd National Conference are designed to escalate the violence. The most important decision taken at the conference, which met between March 5 and March 15, 1994 is "to stage all-out revolutionary war in response to the enemy's all-out war of destruction." In order to organize the guerrilla forces better, those who attended the conference decided to establish a general staff. This signalled that the hardliners in the organization have gained strength and that the violence will increase further in the near future. The most important decisions of the Third National Conference may be summarized as follows: "The struggle which the PKK carries out has left the stage of strategic defense and entered that of strategic balance. It is inevitable that we escalate our struggle in response to Turkey's declaration of all-out war. Consequently, all economic, political, military, social and cultural organizations, institutions, formations -- and those who serve in them -- have become targets. The entire country has become the battlefield." With the decision for centralizing the military structure of the PKK under a general staff, the PKK aims to build a popular army 50,000 strong. The front line now includes the western regions and the PKK has decided to allow the members of the National Liberation Front (ERNK) to take part in the action. Even this decision on its own can be interpreted as meaning that the violence will now escalate, because ERNK members were previously confined to support services, propaganda and logistics. Striking at various military and economic targets will now also involve ERNK members, who are primarily based on metropolitan areas. It was further decided at the Third National Conference to set up state assemblies and state governments and to establish a separate judiciary in mainly Kurdish areas. Other targets and aims were also listed at the conference: "The liquidation of all parties and associations which represent imperialism. Putting out of action all radio and TV channels, newspapers and magazines which are the tools of special warfare. The liquidation of imperialist cultural and educational organizations in various forms. The liquidation of all the legislative and executive organizations and representative offices of the Turkish republic. Rendering the judicial system inoperable. Eliminating all local collaborators and agents working for the Republic of Turkey in Kurdistan. "All the financial organizations and institutions which finance the dirty war which the Turkish republic is waging in our country. Under the heading are included tourist facilities, mines, oil pipelines, power stations, factories, the arms industry, transportation and communications systems, and economic organizations both large and small. Their destruction and expropriation is what is important. The entire army, which is the basic instrument of imperialism in Kurdistan, is a target. All the special units, special teams, counter-guerrilla units and village guards are targets. All the internal security units, the police force, the National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and civilian defense units are also targets." In view of these decisions, it is likely that attacks in the western regions will be aimed increasingly at tourist centers and certain economic facilities. It is likely, too, that as the ERNK become involved in front-line activities, violent and bloody actions will be seen in the cities. This, in turn, will make the possibility of a political solution recede even further. Both sides have committed themselves to violent solutions. One side will have to admit defeat by the end of the year. Which one is as yet unknown...
