The countdown has started: At the end of May, the last foreign office will close down in Paris. At the end of this month, the remaining Trust Agency commissioners for Austria and Switzerland will close their offices. The worldwide network for the marketing of former GDR state enterprises was established in 1991. Since then, agreements with almost 900 foreign investors involving about 20 billion German marks [DM] have been concluded. A total of 146,000 jobs have been promised. This is approximately 10 percent of total investments and jobs in the Trust Agency's privatization balance. Large enterprises were not in great demand. "The foreign investors acquired mainly medium-sized enterprises with a work force of 800-1,000," the director for international relations, Wolfgang Vehse, said. The great majority of investors in the new laender has come from neighboring European countries. The number of Asians who signed take-over agreements with the Trust Agency is almost negligible. "Despite a permanent office in Tokyo, we have not managed to change the traditional procedure of the Japanese," Vehse said in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. In many cases, they took a long time for extensive examinations. Other investors reacted considerably faster, thus attaining some offers from rival contenders from the Far East. Trust Agency Director Vehse expressed a certain respect for the Americans who concluded an astonishingly high number of 70 agreements. For U.S. enterprises, in particular, the contract regulations prevailing in Germany, such as investment rules and the restraint on alienation, have been difficult to understand at times. For some U.S. Trust Agency customers, the investments in eastern Germany were in many cases the first leap across the Atlantic. [passage omitted]
