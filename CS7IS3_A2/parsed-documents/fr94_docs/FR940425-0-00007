FR940425-0-00007 FR940425-0-00005 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;AWP&hyph;3] Revision to Restricted Area R&hyph;2302; Flagstaff, AZ AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends Restricted Area R&hyph;2302, Flagstaff, AZ, by lowering the designated altitude ceiling 1,000 feet to accommodate an airway between Flagstaff and Peach Springs, AZ. In addition, a controlling agency is added and an editorial change is made to the using agency. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Gallant, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On May 1, 1992, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by amending the altitudes and time of designation of R&hyph;2302, Flagstaff, AZ, and by adding a controlling agency (57 FR 20066). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No negative comments objecting to the proposal were received. Comments were received from the Arizona Pilots Association supporting the proposal. The notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to amend the time of designation from ``0800 to 2400 local time, Monday to Saturday'' to ``0700 to 1700 local time, Monday to Saturday; other times by NOTAM.'' Subsequently, the Department of the Army requested that this amendment be deleted from the final rule and the original time be retained. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the designated altitudes of R&hyph;2302, Flagstaff, AZ, from ``Surface to 11,000 feet MSL'' to ``Surface to 10,000 feet MSL'' to accommodate an airway between Flagstaff and Peach Springs, AZ. This action also adds a controlling agency, ``FAA, Albuquerque ARTCC,'' and makes an editorial change to the using agency from ``Commanding Officer, Navajo Ordnance Depot, Flagstaff, AZ'' to ``U.S. Army, Commander, Navajo Ordnance Depot, Flagstaff, AZ.'' The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of the Army conducted an environmental review of military activities at the Navajo Depot Activity (NADA), Arizona, associated with the revised restricted area adopted in this rulemaking proceeding. After careful and thorough consideration of the facts contained therein, the FAA finds that the airspace action adopted in these amendments is consistent with existing national environmental policies and objectives as set forth in NEPA and that it will have no significant impact on the environment.
