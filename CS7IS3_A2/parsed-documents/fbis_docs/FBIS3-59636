A simple and, moreover, inexpensive method has now been developed at the Dortmund Institute of Hygiene. "I might well imagine that Germany's dual system will soon not just cost money, but even yield profits." With this rather unusual prognosis, Prof. Harry Rosin, the head of the Dortmund Institute of Hygiene, summed up the advantages of a new process for recycling plastics, electronic scrap, and composite packaging materials. The trick to turning "Gelbe Tonnen" [recyclable] waste into recyclable secondary raw materials that are nearly completely sorted into categories is supposed to be: deep freezing to -160°C. The "Dortmund mixture," consisting of gaseous hydrocarbons and which Rosin has already successfully recommended as a refrigerant free of chlorine and fluorine for refrigerators, is also to be put to use in the form of a similar compound for the treatment of waste. Propane, ethane, and methane take care of the removal of heat--even from a container filled with plastic waste. The characteristics of the materials are known: Propane liquefies at -42°C, ethane at -88°C, and methane at -161.4°C. Each of these materials--this is the principle the process is based on-- vaporizes in separate cycles, extracts heat from the surrounding area, and is reliquefied. In the process, the liquefier of the lower degree of cold is cooled by the vaporizer of the higher degree of cold until a temperature of -160°C is reached. Rosin is convinced that at this temperature any plastic, even unmanagealbe teflon, becomes brittle, like thin glass. The temperature at which the most commonly used plastics become glasslike is about -110°C. The various materials become brittle at different temperatures, which causes composite materials to fall apart or break up during the cooling process. Metals in electronic scrap would almost break away from the plastic by themselves because of the different expansion coefficients alone. In any case, it is anticipated that a simpler way of crushing the material that consumes less energy will be produced by making it brittle. By means of which separation techniques the frozen plastic mixture can be processed is yet to be studied. According to Rosin, sieves, winnowers, and also flotation techniques are currently being tested for their suitability. Rosin places particular importance on the great cost effectiveness of his process. Hans-Friedrich Hinrichs, the head of the Office for Communal Consultation on Technology in Oberhausen, estimated operating costs at 18 pfennig per kilogram--with reference to a plant that processes five tons of plastic waste an hour and 40,000 tons [as published] a year. And this is not taking into account the proceeds from sales of separated raw materials. Rosin: "This in comparison with the 50-85 pfennig required at the present time by the dual system." Waste incineration would also benefit from this process. Namely, if the plastic waste is burned as powder, a higher calorific value is obtained than is with the incineration of large pieces. The deep freeze process has its limits if a plastic is, for example, mixed with fire retardants--like computer housing units. According to Rosin, they are at present engaging in intensive discussions with superregional waste disposal agencies.
