ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), the Department of Energy, through the Boston Office, intends to award a grant to the Pennsylvania State University (PSU). The grant will provide additional funding of $75,000 to continue work begun in phase I which focused on energy efficient HVAC systems for modular homes based on current designs and features. During phase II the PSU will continue work focusing on near-term development of practical, energy efficient modular house designs which will use almost no heating or cooling energy at a reasonable cost to the consumer. DOE knows of no other entity that is conducting or planning to conduct such an effort. This project is suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. The initial term of this grant will be twelve (12) months from the date of award for a possible project period of five years from the initial date of award. Possible additional funding in future years will be based on satisfactory completion of the initial term, and availability of funds.
