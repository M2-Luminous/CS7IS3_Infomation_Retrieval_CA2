FR940527-0-00081 FR940527-0-00024 35. Alascom also incorrectly argues that replacing the JSA with the new market structure will somehow undermine its ability to provide satellite service. We conclude that this contention is incorrect for several reasons. First, Alascom, as the facilities-based carrier for the Bush, will be able to recover the cost of furnishing service to that region. Other carriers must use Alascom's facilities to provide service to the Bush. As required in this order, Alascom will tariff interstate access to the Bush separately so that related costs, including the costs of the satellite, are borne by all interstate carriers using Alascom's Bush facilities. Second, AT&T must pay Alascom $150 million to reduce its plant accounts. This payment will make Alascom more competitive. Third, we have retained the jurisdictional separations frozen allocator, which would assign 86% of circuit equipment investments and expenses, including a new satellite, to the interstate jurisdiction. Finally, we have required AT&T to purchase a fixed amount of common carrier services from Alascom during the second phase of the transition period. Thus, Alascom has not demonstrated that its ability to provide telecommunications service in Alaska will be undermined by the competitive environment under the new market structure. 51 51 In an ex parte filing dated May 12, 1994, Alascom requests that the Commission establish a pleading cycle to address universal service issues regarding who will serve the Bush, how a satellite to serve the Bush will be financed, and whether revenues are sufficient to ``maintain universal service at integrated rates and levels of quality enjoyed today.'' We deny Alascom's request. These issues were considered by the Joint Board in making its recommendations to the Commission on the new market structure for Alaska and have been addressed by parties commenting in this proceeding. As discussed above, the Joint Board has recommended, and we have adopted in this order, a number of mechanisms to ensure that universal service is available to the Bush areas of Alaska. Those mechanisms make provisions for satellite replacement, rate integrated interstate service to the Bush, and universal service to the Bush. Since Alascom has not requested, nor received, approval for a Section 214 application to discontinue service to the Bush, Alascom remains the carrier responsible for providing facilities in the Bush. 36. Alascom also argues that: (1) AT&T will not be harmed by continuing the JSA; (2) there will not be benefits from eliminating the JSA; (3) if other carriers want to provide service to and from Alaska, they have been able to do so under the current market structure; (4) the Alascom ARC plan is better than the Board's recommended market structure; and; (5) Alascom is efficient and would be more efficient than AT&T in providing service in Alaska. 52 All of these issues have been raised previously in this proceeding, and the Board has previously addressed and rejected Alascom's arguments. We concur with the Board's interpretation of the record. The new market structure in Alaska will enable Alascom to compete with other interstate carriers on price and service. Consumers will benefit from reduced prices, additional providers, and new services. Additional competition in Alaska under the new market structure will provide greater opportunity for AT&T to provide service independently, for other IXCs to take Alascom's common carrier transport services to provide interstate service to Alaska, and for consumers to receive lower prices and additional services than the current mandated structure under the JSA. 52 Alascom Application for Review at 1&hyph;23. B. Alascom's Procedural Arguments 37. Alascom argues that the Commission erred in convening this proceeding pursuant to nonrestricted rulemaking procedures. This was not an error. In the Final Recommended Decision the Joint Board fully explained why Alascom's argument is not supported by the language of Section 410 or any other law. 53 Since we agree completely with the Joint Board's analysis, there is no reason to repeat that discussion now. 53 Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at paras. 152&hyph;160. 38. Alascom also is wrong in its contention that the D.C. Circuit's decision in Sangamon Valley Television Corp v. USA , 269 F.2d 221 (D.C. Cir. 1959), compels the use of the Commission's ex parte procedures applicable to restricted proceedings. 54 To the extent that Sangamon Valley still is good law, 55 this situation is plainly distinguishable. First, this proceeding is unlike Sangamon Valley because here the Commission and the Joint Board had ex parte procedures in place since the inception of the rulemaking to ensure that interested parties had ample opportunity to participate in the proceeding and to respond to all presentations made to decisionmakers. 56 Thus, under the ex parte procedures used in this proceeding, all written presentations and summaries of all oral presentations that go beyond the written comments have been placed in the public record. See 47 CFR 1.1206. Over the course of this lengthy proceeding many parties, including Alascom, took advantage of these ``permit but disclose'' ex parte rules, and it is hard to see how Alascom can argue now that it was not accorded due process. 54 See 47 CFR 1.1208. 55 As the Joint Board stated in the Final Recommended Decision, ``subsequent to Sangamon Valley, the Supreme Court admonished the courts not to force an agency to provide procedures more demanding than those required by statute or the Constitution absent `extremely compelling circumstances.' Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC , 435 U.S. 519, 543 (1978). Such circumstances do not exist here.'' Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at n. 195. We note further that the Commission has construed Sangamon Valley to apply only to proceedings involving changes to the table of allotments. In the Matter of Amendment of Subpart H, Part 1 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations Concerning Ex Parte Communications and Presentation in Commission Proceedings, Gen Dkt No. 86&hyph;255, 2 FCC Rcd. 3011 52 FR 21051, June 4, 1987, para. 38 n. 30 (1987). Alascom does not argue that this case has anything to do with such subject matter. 56 See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 83&hyph;1376, FCC 85&hyph;520 (released Sept. 27, 1985), 50 FR 41714 (1985). See also Amendment of Part 67 of the Commission's Rules and Establishment of a Joint Board, CC Docket No. 80&hyph;286, FCC 82&hyph;106 (released May 5, 1982), 89 FCC 2d 36 (1982). 39. Second, the Alaska proceeding is not like Sangamon Valley because, as the Joint Board explained, this situation does not involve ``conflicting claims to a valuable privilege.'' While the JSA is a private contract, it was ``crafted and approved by the Commission on an interim basis.'' 57 Indeed, Alascom itself recognized in an earlier stage of the proceeding that the contractual arrangement was established only as a result of Commission regulatory action implementing steps to assure that rate integration would be provided to the Alaska interstate market. 58 The JSA does not confer any particular privilege on Alascom, as Alascom's authority to serve the Alaska interstate market is not derived therefrom. Moreover, Alascom has been on notice since the inception of this proceeding that the cost recovery arrangement provided by AT&T under the JSA was not likely to be permanent. 59 57 Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at para. 28. 58 See Opposition of Alascom, Inc. to AT&T Petition for a ``Lawful Interim Division of Charges'' at 7, citing Domestic Communications-Satellite Facilities, 35 FCC 2d 844, 856 (1972); aff'd. on recon., 38 FCC 2d 665 (1972); aff'd. sub. nom., Network Project v. FCC, 511 F.2d 786 (D.C. Cir. 1975). 59 See supra note 7 and accompanying text. See also AT&T Comments on the Proposal of the State Members of the Federal-State Joint Board at 6 (Dec. 18, 1992).
