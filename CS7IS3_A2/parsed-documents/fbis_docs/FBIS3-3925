The symposium, sponsored by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECK), closed here Friday [18 March] in Beijing. During the two-day meeting, Chinese energy officials introduced the state plans to develop the country's energy and minerals industries. They noted that the demand for energy and minerals will soar by the end of the century. They said the government encourages domestic enterprises to tap foreign funds, technology and management to ease current and predicted shortages. In China, the annual demand for coal in 1995 is estimated to reach 1.23 billion tons and hit 1.4 billion tons by the year 2000. To meet the burgeoning demand, China will pump 200 billion yuan in the coming years to build 20 energy bases and 15 key mines, said Fan Weitang, vice minister of coal industry. About 19 major projects, including 14 mine-mouth power plants and three coal mines, are being offered for development with foreign investment. The ministry also is considering the construction of a 300-km pipeline for transporting coal from Yuxian County in Shanxi Province to Weifang, Shandong Province. Some U.S. firms have shown interest in investing in this project. Also, China is planning to produce 100 to 120 million tons of steel by the turn of the century.
