[passage omitted] "Since the beginning of this year (1993), we have come under increasing pressure from some Thai sources, most probably in the line with the Thai government policy of constructive engagement with Slorc," leaders of the three ethnic groups said in a signed joint letter to one of Thailand's highest institutions. "Some forms of pressure involve the threat to push our refugees back into the war zone or cut off food supplies, and restricting our travel for medical treatment ... "Our understanding is that for positive or constructive results, pressure should be applied equally to both sides. "Actions perceived as not evenhanded could only be counter-productive," they said. A copy of the Dec 3 letter signed by Karen leader Gen Bo Mya, Karenni leader Saw Maw Reh and Mon leader Nai Shwe Kyin was obtained by THE NATION. [passage omitted] According to well-informed border sources, the Mon and Slorc agreed at a meeting late last year in Moulmein, in Burma's Mon State, to an "unofficial" or "loose truce deal". The deal effectively ends the fighting in southern Burma's Thaton, Mergui and Tavoy areas. Several more rounds of talks are needed to finalise details before an actual truce agreement can be concluded, said the sources. Burmese southern commander Maj Gen Ket Sein headed the Burmese negotiating team while Nai Htaw Mon a senior military affairs officer, led the Mon delegation to the Moulmein meeting. Meanwhile, the Karenni have delegated a three-member mission to meet Slorc officials this week, according to a senior Karenni leader, Abel Tweed. He said Karenni Deputy Army Chief Maj Aung Mya will head the team, which also includes Karenni officials Paulu and Shan Reh, to a "preliminary meeting" in Daw Gnew Khu, a small border village of about two-days walk from the Thai border. Tweed said no agenda has been set. The forum will look into the possibilities of further talks. Tweed conceded that the bilateral talks could eventually lead to a military ceasefire, but said the Karenni National Progressive Party has not abandoned its political objective of an independent Karenni state. He expressed the hope that future peace talks would be held in Thailand, and said the Karenni mistrust Slorc too much to ever go to Rangoon. "They (Slorc) refused to meet in Bangkok or Chiang Mai but if there is some progress from the (first) meeting then we may have the next talks in Thailand... Thai authorities are willing to host peace talks either in Chiang Mai or Mae Hong Son if both sides agree," said Tweed. Sources said the Burmese armed forces attache in Bangkok, Col Thein Swe, travelled to Mae Hong Son at the end of last year to propose that the two sides meet. As for the Karen, their leader Gen Bo Mya sent a letter last week to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai urging the Thai government to "persuade" or "pressure" Slorc to enter into a peace dialogue with the collective ethnic opposition. An informed border source said that the Karen group has finally agreed to meet Rangoon officials to seek out common ground for further truce negotiations. The source said the group has already appointed a team to engage in "preliminary talks" with Slorc. It was not known when they will meet. The source added that Gen Bo Mya at a meeting last Friday with a senior Thai security general urged Thailand to host the Karen-Slorc talks. Bo Mya sent a similar letter, which bears his title as chairman of the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut. [passage omitted] In his letter, Bo Mya accused Slorc of trying to disunite the opposition and warned Rangoon's policy of approaching individual groups would not lead to "a stable peace" or a "comprehensive solution" to the problems in Burma. "Slorc's insistence, needless to say, could only be viewed as a crude attempt to divide the resistance forces and, at the same time, to improve its international image," he said. "Moreover, Slorc's approach would never lead to a stable peace as desired by the people, and a comprehensive solution to the problems besetting the country. "Whatever the circumstances, the DAB is the only organisation that can bring about general reconciliation and peace in the whole country. "If you have the means to persuade or make pressure bear on Slorc, we would like to urge you to use it for the emergence of a peace negotiation between the Slorc and the DAB as a whole," said the Karen leader.
