This explains why the SDL has proposed early elections, he says. To avoid the crisis in which it had found itself, the Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) formed a coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS). Because its 75 votes are exactly half the parliament's total number of seats, the vote of no confidence in it cannot be made. However, since it is one vote short of a majority, it lacks leverage for pushing through certain issues, Kanis says, adding that he believes that the process of differentiation within the HZDS is something latent and hidden which it might be possible for all to see if members of the HZDS group of deputies show the necessary courage. If they fail to take initiative, the process might be sparked off by the worsening political and economic situation in Slovakia. Some deputies from the most deeply struck regions may come under pressure from their voters and distance themselves from the government, Kanis says in SLOVENSKY DENNIK.
