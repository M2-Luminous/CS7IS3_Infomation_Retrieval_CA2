The operation took three months. The police teams established that a certain Atif Baytaz would smuggle the tablets into the country. They placed him under surveillance and established that he met Ali Demir, a truck driver in his hotel. Demir later picked up the tablets from a house in Karagumruk and drove his truck to meet with the people who wished to buy them. A car owned by Mehmet Kasar, a known drug trafficker, approached his vehicle. The police teams arrested Demir and Ahmet Gani Bilici, Cengiz Cincih, and Kamil Goren, who worked for Mehmet Kasar as they were transferring the Captagon tablets from the truck to Kasar's car. Atif Baytaz and Mehmet Kasar were also arrested at about the same time. The teams are reported to have impounded 3.5 million Captagon tablets, the estimated market value of which is $5 million.
