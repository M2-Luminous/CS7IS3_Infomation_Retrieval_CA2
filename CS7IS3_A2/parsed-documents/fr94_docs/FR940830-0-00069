FR940830-0-00069 FR940830-0-00013 Response: A HA has the option to prepare its Comprehensive Plan/Annual Statement based on funding received in the prior year and make adjustments before submission to HUD if the same amount of funding is not provided in the current year or the HA can wait for the actual formula amounts before preparing its submission. HUD has retained the proposed provision, and notes that with one formula amount, any difference between a presumptive estimate and a final formula amount is eliminated. The accelerated approach which is optional, may use a dollar amount for planning purposes, i.e., last FFY's final formula amount, that is different from the actual formula amount for the current FFY. If there are problems associated with that approach, the HA may continue to use the old approach ( i.e., the HA could wait for the actual formula amount, before planning for the current year). In any event, a HA's Annual Submission must be received in the Field Office no later than July 15 each year in order to allow for the 75-day review period before the end of the FFY. Since HUD will no longer provide an estimated formula amount, HUD has eliminated the requirement for the initial notice. The level of detail and the format for the public notice has been left to local discretion. Public Notice Comment: HUD proposed to expand the public notice requirements. HAs were to provide public notice of the advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the HA and which ensures notice to all duly elected resident councils. The information to be provided in the public notice was also to be expanded to include a summary of activities of the previous year and progress update, estimated funding level, summary of CGP requirements, the estimated time frames for completion of the required CGP documents and the requirement for resident participation in the planning, development and monitoring of modernization activities under the CGP. In order to reach a much broader public, HAs stated that they would have to use means beyond mailings to current residents. Commenters objected to the use of media such as newspapers, radio and TV because it would greatly increase the cost to the HA, and HUD should allow an increase in the allowable administrative costs to cover the additional expense. For the public at large, it was suggested that the HAs state that the required information is available for inspection at various locations. Presenting a draft P&E Report for all active funding years would increase the HA's administrative burden. A simplified summary of active modernization projects and management improvements in a format to be determined by the HA was suggested as sufficient for this stage of the process. Other commenters found an improvement in the timing and manner of the notice, but also questioned the level of detail. The listed details were thought to be more appropriate for the resident meetings and public hearings and the notice should properly indicate that these details will be presented during these forums. Large HAs found there is no way to simply summarize this information because any summary's level of detail would be so broad that the report would be meaningless. It was also said to be impossible to summarize large HA's activities and progress on hundreds of contracts representing hundreds of millions of dollars in contract work on any HA-wide notice. HAs requested the discretion to provide such detail where feasible and appropriate. Recommended information in resident letters would include basic information ( i.e., level of funding and the time and place of the advance meeting) with the understanding that additional information is available upon request at the HA's management office. Response: HUD has revised the public notice provision. HAs have the discretion to decide the level of detail and format of the public notice. HUD is not specifying the information to be included in the public notice. Public notice related costs are eligible administrative costs. Advance Meetings Comment: HUD proposed that the HA shall hold, within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing, an advance meeting for residents and duly elected resident councils at which the HA shall explain the components of the Comprehensive Plan. The meeting shall be open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. In addition, HUD requested comments as to resident consultation regarding changes to the Five-Year Action Plan. Most commenters agreed that the timing of meetings with residents should be the decision of the HA. HUD was requested to clarify to HAs, residents and HUD Field Offices that the residents' role is to advise and not approve. It was stated that resident interest and concern are concentrated on the development in which they reside. Given the backlog of critical work that must be done, such as replacing leaking roofs and complying with HUD mandates, there is often considerable frustration about the inclusionary planning process when realistically there is not a lot of choice about what will be done. Another HA noticed that resident involvement has diminished since it began conducting advance meetings. One commenter objected to the removal of the three-week notification for a public hearing, following the advance meeting because they considered the current rule to be a reasonable minimum. Regarding resident consultation on changes to the Five-Year Action Plan, NAHRO suggested there is no need for a dollar threshold nationwide. Each HA has its own method in place for consultation with residents. HAs are currently notifying residents and their representatives and public officials about the CGP. They questioned what benefit further notification requirements would provide. One HA proposed written notification to resident council presidents with a meeting per local needs. They proposed to limit the definition of significant change to instances where a work item is deleted or postponed from the Five-Year Plan. Modifications resulting from a reprogramming of unobligated funds from a work item or in response to emergency needs should not be deemed as significant changes for resident consultation purposes. IHAs that commented suggested that this consultation should be at the discretion of each HA. For a threshold, they recommended that resident consultation would be in order when significant changes reach the cumulative total of 15% of the total grant amount. One commenter did not support putting the burden on the HA to create resident involvement. It was recommended that HUD should mandate that a minimum of one notice be given to residents of the HA's intent to apply for funds combined with a notice of one public hearing to solicit input. One commenter suggested that the proposed rule separates the planning process from the funding process, making resident participation in the former of little consequence to the latter. Tenant consultation would have no meaningful purpose. It was also suggested that this is inconsistent with the statute because HUD was fulfilling the resident consultation requirements simply by engaging tenants in abstract discussions of modernization concerns, unrelated to any particular year's funding decisions.
