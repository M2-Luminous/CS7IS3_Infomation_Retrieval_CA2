FR940512-2-00008 FR940512-2-00006 [A&hyph;412&hyph;803] Industrial Nitrocellulose From the United Kingdom; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Industrial Nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom. SUMMARY: In response to a request by one manufacturer/exporter, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on industrial nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. As a result of this review, we have preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the differences between United States price and foreign market value. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rebecca Trainor, Breck Richardson or Maureen Flannery, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 36391) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order on industrial nitrocellulose (INC) from the United Kingdom. On July 29, 1993, the respondent, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI), requested to be reviewed in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act), and ยง353.22(a) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)). We published the notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44653), covering the period July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. We have now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act. Scope of the Review This review covers shipments of INC from the United Kingdom. INC is a dry, white, amorphous synthetic chemical with a nitrogen content between 10.8 and 12.2 percent, which is produced from the reaction of cellulose with nitric acid. It is used as a film-former in coatings, lacquers, furniture finishes, and printing inks. INC is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 3912.20.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The scope of the antidumping order does not include explosive grade nitrocellulose, which has a nitrogen content of greater than 12.2 percent. This review covers sales by ICI of INC from the United Kingdom entered into the United States during the period July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. Verification We verified the questionnaire responses of ICI's affiliate, Nobel's Explosives Company Ltd. (Nobel's) from February 7, 1994 to February 11, 1994, at Nobel's manufacturing facility in Stevenston, Scotland. We verified the responses of ICI's U.S. affiliate, ICI Americas Inc. (ICIA) from February 21, 1994 to February 25, 1994 at ICIA's offices in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
