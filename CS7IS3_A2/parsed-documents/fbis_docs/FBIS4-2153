This is the finding of a nationwide survey of 3,000 owners of Chinese-built cars over a period of three months. Results of the survey, conducted by the State Statistical Bureau and the China Automobile Industry Corporation, were announced here today. Improvement in the Chinese people's living standards will give a major push to the buying of family cars, the survey says. It indicates that a growing number of well-to-do Chinese have bought cars for private use. And more and more autos are expected to be driven home in China in the coming decades. The survey shows that the most popular Chinese-built cars are the Audi from the China First Automobile Group Corporation (CFAGC), the Santana from the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto Corporation, Ltd. (SVAC), and the Jetta from the Fow-Volkswagen Auto Corporation, Ltd. (FVAC) [name as received]. Heavy-duty trucks praised by consumers surveyed are the Huanghe from the Jinan Heavy-Duty Motor Works (JHMW) and the Jiefang from CFAGC, it says. A few enterprises such as CFAGC and SVAC were valued by the consumers as the best automobile enterprises in China. China has 116 motor works, but their output and manufacturing technology lag behind world standards. The survey was aimed at helping China's auto corporations to adapt to the market and improve their manufacturing technology and quality so as to raise their competence on the world market. The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993, China produced 1.31 million autos, an increase of 20 percent over 1992. Statistics show that China had 8 million Chinese-built autos by the end of 1993, 16 percent higher than the 1992 figure.
