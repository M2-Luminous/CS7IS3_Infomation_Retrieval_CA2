FR940622-0-00068 FR940622-0-00011 The provisions of this rule will require Medicare participating hospitals to provide inpatient services to individuals with insurance coverage under CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, and VA programs, provide each Medicare beneficiary a statement of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital and provide an appropriate medical screening examination to anyone who requests examination or treatment, and stabilizing treatment in the emergency room to any individual with an emergency medical condition. As required by the statute these provisions are in effect and are being enforced. Although hospitals may incur incremental costs to ensure compliance with these provisions, we believe the costs are minimal and the benefits to individuals far outweigh those costs. These provisions will allow military personnel and their families to receive inpatient services in hospitals that may be closer to their homes as opposed to receiving services in military hospitals that may be some distance away. Another benefit will be that all individuals will receive medical screening and, if an emergency medical condition exists, will also receive stabilizing treatment and protections against inappropriate transfers regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare. We believe that these provisions will improve access to care and reduce patient complaints. The potential use of sanctions provides the incentive for hospitals to ensure continued compliance with these provisions. We included a voluntary impact analysis in section VII of the preamble in the June 16, 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 22513). We received no comments on that analysis, and we believe that none of the changes incorporated into this interim final rule have any significant impact. Therefore, we are not preparing a similar analysis. For the reasons discussed above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that these final regulations will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis or an analysis of effects on small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act Sections 488.18(d), 489.20 (m) and (r), and 489.24 (c), (d) and (g) of this interim final rule contain information collection requirements that are subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The information collections in §§488.18, 489.20(m), and 489.24 require the State agencies to notify HCFA when hospitals are not in compliance with provisions contained in the Medicare provider agreement. Section 489.20(m) also requires that a hospital report to HCFA or a Medicare state survey agency when the hospital believes it has received an individual who has been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the requirements of §489.24(d). Section 489.20(r) now requires both transferring and receiving hospitals to develop and maintain lists of on-call physicians and central logs containing information about what services the individual did or did not receive and applicable patient records on admissions, discharges, and transfers. In addition, under §489.24 (c) and (d), transferring hospitals must send receiving hospitals an individual's medical records (or copies) available at the time of the transfer, and the individual's other medical records must be sent as soon as practicable after the transfer. The provisions also require hospitals to record certain information on individuals' medical records, require individuals to sign consent forms pertaining to examinations, treatments and transfers, and require physicians and other qualified medical personnel, when a physician is not present in the emergency department but in consultation with the physician, to sign transfer certifications containing specific information. Section 489.24(g) also requires PROs to prepare reports regarding individuals' medical conditions when requested by HCFA. Section 489.27 of the proposed rule required that hospitals that participate in the Medicare program obtain from the beneficiary or his or her representative a signed acknowledgement of receipt of a notice of discharge rights. We also required these hospitals to retain both a copy of the inpatient notice of discharge rights (``Message'') and of the signed acknowledgement for 1 year. As discussed in section IV.B. of this preamble, this interim final rule eliminates the requirement for an acknowledgement statement. Thus, the accompanying recordkeeping burden also is eliminated.
