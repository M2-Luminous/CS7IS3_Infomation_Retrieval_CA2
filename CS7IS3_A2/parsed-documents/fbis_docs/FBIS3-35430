In his recent report the special envoy of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, with the intent to damage Iran's image in the world public opinion , has charged Iran with cases including violation of political and social freedoms and terrorism. This is while Iranian officials, incuding the Head of the Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, have termed the allegations biased and a political ploy to pressure Iran. The pressure is of course by the Western powers that do not favor Iran's active role in the region and its independent stance with regard to such important regional development as Gaza-Jericho compromise deal. Stressing the existence of political and social freedom in the country, Iranian officials state that all the points mentioned in the constitutional law on the precise observation of individual rights and the preservation of the rights of the religious minorities are respected and practiced in Iran. The existence of freedom of activity for political groups, the progressive nature of laws and judicial system of the country and freedom enjoyed by the religious minorities prove this fact. This has been confirmed by leaders of religious minorities and independent observers who have visited Iran. The restatement of these allegations and unfounded matters about human rights violation in Iran at Western circles and mass media has created numerous questions. Galindo Pohl's report which is a repetition of previous claims was published following the massive Feb. 11 rallies (marking the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979). To any impartial observer, the rally was full of meanings and implications and removed numerous doubts instilled in the world public opinion about the popularity of the Islamic government in Iran. On the other hand, the report should be considered connected with the firm stances recently taken by the Iranian official in condemning the genocide of Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs and the compromise accord in the Middle East. The fact that five years have passed since the issuance of the verdict on the apostate Salman Rushdie, the author of the Satanic Verses, and the futile political and economic pressures by the West on the Islamic Republic of Iran to revoke the verdict can be mentioned as other reasons behind presentation of this report. Exertion of pressure to make Iran compromise and move along with the policies of the West is the main goal that the United States and its allies constantly are pursuing by publicizing such false claims. This is while Galindo Pohl's colleagues have overlooked human rights violations in the countries allied with the United States. Another important point in this report and similar claims is that Iran is accused of state terrorism when it is a major victim of terrorism itself and this is something that those claiming to support human rights have always ignored. The recent assassination attempt on the life of the Iranian president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani on Feb. 1 during the Ten-Day Dawn inauguration ceremonies (marking the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979) and the November 29 hijacking of a Fokker friendship passenger plane belonging to the Oil Ministry to Iraq are among more recent cases, not to mention over a decade of post-revolution victimization of the Iranian nation at the hands of Western-supported terrorist outfits. The allegations on human rights are brought forth at a time when tens of thousands of innocent Muslim Bosnian children and women are being martyred in the heart of Europe and hundreds of thousands are facing the prospect of being massacred or raped. The outrageous violations of the rights of the Muslim Palestinian nation by the Zionists are among other issues which have been neglected in the files of the so-called human rights organizations. The double standard in dealing with the world events by international organizations is not something that Muslim nations can overlook.
