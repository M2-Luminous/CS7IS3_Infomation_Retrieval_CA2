The debate was highlighted after Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin met with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, in Washington on Wednesday. Albright reportedly expressed American concern over the possibility of a violation of the U.N. embargo on Iraq, while Cetin said he had fully assured the United States that Turkey had no such intention. Cetin recalled on Thursday though that Turkey was a country which had been affected most by Gulf War losses and that its direct and indirect losses had already reached $20 billion. "Despite this," he said, "I told Albright that Turkey was acting according to U.N. decisions." Turkey is currently concerned that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline is being damaged owing to its closure which has been in effect since 1990 and wants to pump out the oil contained in the pipeline. In Cetin's words, such an effort would not be a violation of the sanctions but should be interpreted as only maintenance work. In early April, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk visited Baghdad where the Iraqi side agreed to Turkey emptying the pipeline, leading to a strong reaction from the United States. Last weekend, U.S. Ambassador to Ankara Richard Barkley visited Sanberk at the Foreign Ministry and reportedly told him that a Turkish initiative to be taken on this issue without any consultations could create problems in keeping promises which had earlier been given to this country. The Turkish press has dubbed these remarks as a "warning" or a "note." Foreign Ministry officials prefer to refer to them as "an American initiative." Turkey argues that there are about 12 million barrels of oil in the pipeline, which is now corroding away, and an amount equivalent to 7.5 million barrels on the Turkish side of the border. Along with the 2 million barrels in tanks in Yumurtalik, the amount of oil on the Turkish side is currently at around 9.5 million barrels or the equivalent of $60 million. The 986-kilometer pipeline extends from Karkuk in Iraqi territory to Turkey and 641-kilometers of the line runs inside Turkish territory. Daily capacity before the closure was 1,200,000 barrels of crude oil or an annual 70.9 million tons of crude. Unless a solution can be found to the crisis, Turkey will continue to lose some $5 billion a year and in Cetin's words, "This is leading to feelings that Turkey is being punished." The effects of these feelings have, in turn, been evident among the Turkish electorate, leading rapidly to reactions in Parliament. Hints have been given that in the upcoming June meeting, which is to decide on extending the mandate of the coalition forces based in Turkey, Parliament is to take into account the American attitude on its project to empty the pipeline and for Turkey to use the 3.5 million barrels which it owns. According to political sources in Parliament, even if Ciller puts pressure on her group to extend the mandate, the reaction of the electorate will be stronger this time, turning the debate into the most difficult of all. Turkey has had frequent problems in extending the mandate since the Motherland Party (ANAP) was ousted from power in the October 1991 elections. The then new Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, who was critical of Turgut Ozal's Gulf War policy, first reacted adversely to the issue but was later persuaded into agreeing to an extension. The former social democrat deputy prime minister, Erdal Inonu, as well as his predecessor, Murat Karayalcin, were also convinced by highlevel state staff of the necessity of extending the mandate. But the friction with the United States, the heavy losses which have occurred owing to the pipeline closure and the serious economic crisis Turkey is going through are now reportedly putting more pressure on politicians. The recent electoral victory of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), which has been voting continuously against the extension, is cited as another pressure. In his commentary titled "The secret formula which angered the U.S.A." mass circulation HURRIYET writer Sedat Ergin wrote Thursday that Turkey's final trump card would be the Provide Comfort Operation dubbed by the Turkish public as Poised Hammer. Ergin also warned against the atmosphere in Turkey immediately after the RP victory which was one opposing this force. In the words of one senior official, "Whatever we do and whatever Mrs. Ciller does, this time there is the serious risk that the DYP [True Path Party] group may not be persuaded." Turkish officials believe that if the pipeline could be emptied this would lift some of the economic burden being shouldered by the people and would without doubt bring about the conditions necessary for the government to extend the mandate. In Ergin's words, "Turkey's bargaining chips are not as small as some people think."
