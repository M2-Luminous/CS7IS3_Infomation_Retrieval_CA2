In a letter to the director of the Freedom Forum foundation, which sponsored the drafting of the report, he wrote: "I read the report on the freedom of media in Slovakia and have serious doubts about its objectivity. I was unpleasantly surprised that Slovakia is rated as a `partially free country," while the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland are included among countries with `free media.' I do not know the circumstances that made you come up with such an assessment, but I want to assure you that, according to the principles of the Charter of the Free Press, Slovakia meets all of the conditions of an open society with a free press and should be included among countries with such a rating."
