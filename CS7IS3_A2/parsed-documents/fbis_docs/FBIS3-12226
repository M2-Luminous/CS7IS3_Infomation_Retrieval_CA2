Hundreds of innocent martyrs and wounded people among Hebron's citizens fell victims to this crime at dawn yesterday. The Senate met in an extraordinary session this morning, attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and other ministers. The session was devoted to discussing the dimensions of this crime. Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi said the terrible crime perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday -- in which hundreds of innocent martyrs and wounded people fell as victims -- makes it necessary to draw lessons and explore the results this terrible event implies and the dangers and challenges it poses. Al-Lawzi said the extraordinary session is a contribution by the Senate to the efforts of his majesty, the homeland's leader and the faithful one Jordanian family. This session will allow brother senators to exchange views and consultations. They will contribute to enhancing Jordan's honest march and national unity in view of this barbaric crime, and to consolidating Jordan's pan-Arab responsibilities. Jordan has never failed to assume these, in terms of supporting the Palestine question and the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their rights and achieve self-determination on their national soil and secure the implementation of international legitimacy in order to realize a just and comprehensive peace that ends occupation and removes the settlements. The Senate later observed one minute of silence for the martyrs. The senators read the opening chapter of the Holy Koran for the martyrs' chaste souls.
