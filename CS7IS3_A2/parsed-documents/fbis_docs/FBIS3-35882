The Latvian delegation participated in the CEPA Strasbourg session Jan. 24-28. During the session, Latvian delegates received CEPA experts' recommendations on the citizenship issue together with Secretary-General Catherine Lallumiere's letter. Latvia will consider the recommendations at the top-level, Endzins said. Saeima (parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee head Alexander Kirsteins addressed the assembly's Migration and Refugees Committee on the social integration problems of Latvia's Russian-speakers. During lobby conversations, French, British and German delegates worried Latvians by attaching a priority to interstate pacts with Russia over Russian troops' withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia, Endzins said. The all-European transportation problems was another topic for consideration at the session, Endzins said. Estonian and Lithuanian delegates said they hoped to get a financial help by the CE to build the Via Baltica highway. The Baltic delegations closely cooperated during the session, said Latvian delegation secretary Rolands Blezurs. Blezurs also spoke highly of Estonia's Tune Helam's election as CEPA's vice president. Latvia was also represented to the session by MP's [member of parliament] Andrejs Pantelejevs and Alexander Kirsteins.
