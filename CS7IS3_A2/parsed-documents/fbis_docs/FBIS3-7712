He said the international community should instead engage in constructive dialogues with Yangon [Rangoon] if it wants to seek change in the country. Speaking at the end of his three-day official visit to Myanmar, Mr. Goh said that after many years of self-isolation, the country now wants to open up its economy. He said ASEAN's policy of constructive engagement is the right one. The prime minister also encouraged businessmen and leaders from Western countries to visit Myanmar to assess the situation. More importantly, such visits will give them the opportunity to put forward their viewpoints to the country's leadership. Myanmar's minister for national planning and economic development, Brigadier General David Abel, said Mr. Goh's visit has built a lot of confidence in the business community. He added he now expects better rapport between businessmen in the two countries.
