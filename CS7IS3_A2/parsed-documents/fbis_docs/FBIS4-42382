Year-on-year growth in MO, the officially targeted narrow money measure, relating mainly to banknotes and coins, rose to 7.1 per cent. This indicates that the authorities will have to watch for signs of inflationary pressures building up. The Government's target for MO is 0 to 4 per cent. Fears about inflation and interest rates sent shudders through Europe's financial markets; the FT-SE 100 index fell 41 points at one stage, before the market recovered its nerve. The index ended 4.1 points up, at 2,970.5. Bonds fell sharply, the long gilt shedding 1.5 points. Anxieties will be reinforced by the results of the latest survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS). They show that raw materials shortages and capacity constraints appear to be driving up prices in manufacturing. The institutes purchasing managers index, which measures output, new orders, delivery times, stocks and jobs, rose to 59.2 per cent in May, its highest since the series began in June 1991. Demand was found to be growing so fast in some areas that firms were having difficulty finding supplies. The survey underlines last week's CBI [Confederation of British Industry] industry report, which indicated that economic growth had withstood the tax shock. But the CIPS prices index rose for the sixth successive month, jumping to 57.8 per cent in May, from 54.3 per cent in April. The strength of new orders, at record levels in May, and of production, encouraged firms to take on more workers for the fourth consecutive month. The survey and other pointers are likely to prompt the Treasury to upgrade its growth forecast for the overall economy this year from the 2.5 per cent predicted in November. The Bank of England said year-on-year growth in MO, for which the Treasury has set an annual growth monitoring range of 0 to 4 per cent, rose to 7.1 per cent in May, after a 6.2 per cent gain in April. Annualised MO growth over the past six months was 9.2 per cent. The Treasury sought to dismiss the above-target growth in MO, arguing that interest rates at their lowest for two decades have persuaded consumers to hold more cash. But the Bank, more concerned about inflation, gave a warning in its recent inflation report that the implications would be "more disturbing" if the money supply continued to rise. The Bank sees MO as a reliable advance indicator of inflation. The measure is linked by economists to movements in retail sales, which showed annual growth of 4.4 per cent in April. Though some economists believe the impact of tax increases on consumers has yet to be felt, galloping MO suggests that the monetary reins might need a tweak by the end of the year. Year-on-year growth in May was distorted by very low growth recorded in May last year. But John Marsland, an economist at UBS, said the rate of increase was still very strong and signalled a bout of inflation next year. The Government has highlighted its success in achieving economic growth with low inflation, and City economists believe there is no immediate need to raise base rate from its present 5.24 per cent. Some fear, however, that by the final quarter of next year, base rates will have almost doubled to contain inflation. Mortgage lending by the major British banks totalled 1.43 billion in April, a fall of 11 per cent from March and 20 per cent lower than in April last year, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said. Net lending, after seasonal adjustment, showed a further deceleration. Mortgage approvals were also lower in April, in both value and volume. Lord Inchyra, the BBA's director-general, said it was too soon to attribute the drop in lending to tax increases or changes in mortgage tax relief. He said two explanations could be the shorter month and a rush in March to beat the introduction of higher rates on fixed-rate mortgages.
