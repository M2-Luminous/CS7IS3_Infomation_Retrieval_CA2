According to a spokesman for the Afghan prime minister's Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the president should step down, a transitional government set up, a national army formed, and elections held after six months. Meanwhile the spokesman for Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society of Afghanistan] led by President Borhanoddin Rabbani, says Mr. Rabbani will remain as president, and stressed that the government will accept the ceasefire if the opponents remove their heavy weapons from around Kabul. This is at a time when it does not seem the two sides can come to the negotiation table under the bases of conditions they have proposed. What complicates the situation is the two sides' unwillingness to compromise under demands because of the sensitivity and significance they attach to their political positions. It seems impossible to reach an agreement on the basis of good will as long as a climate of forgiveness is not allowed to prevail over the inter-Afghan parties' relations. According to observers of Afghan affairs, a change in the political situation in Kabul cannot help create peace and push forward peace objectives either, because it is hard to conceive an end to the war as long as political objectives are being achieved through the use of arms and military force. Experience, however, shows that under such difficult conditions faced by Afghanistan, friendly and neighboring countries -- not withstanding their divergent views of the sides involved in the fighting -- have been able to persuade them to hold negotiations. The ongoing war in Kabul will lead to the same conclusion. According to the special envoy of the Iranian foreign minister to Kabul, all sides have welcomed the mediation efforts of friendly and neighboring countries. Mr. [Mohammad Ibrahim] Taherian [Iran's special envoy for Afghan affairs] returned to Islamabad on 12 January after meeting the leaders of the warring sides in Kabul. In an interview, he said it is not ready to persuade the two sides to hold negotiations. He reiterated that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is trying to create the ground for carrying out mediation between the Afghan groups through consultations with the officials of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry and other Islamic countries.
