A recent evaluation by the National Assembly deputies on the economic affairs committee showed that with the passage of time after the implementation of Decree-Law 141, the self-employment phenomena are growing increasingly complex, which means that activity is expanding, not the contrary. The greatest achievement of this measure was certainly eliminating needs not being met by the state, and helping to reactivate the national economy. Among other things, it provides another outlet in Cuba's present imperfect and difficult situation. This effort requires constant modification to continue seeking a happy medium, whose essence consists in not drifting toward capitalism, but instead developing a Cuban formula in order to comply with the fundamental principles that have given it life. Over 106,000 applications have so far been made, and of these almost 87,000 were approved; fewer than 2 percent were rejected. This shows a trend toward greater openness in this area. The status of workers who were self-employed some years ago is also favorable, and while the number of approved occupations has been increasing, it seems promising that studies are continuing for the approval of others, and also of occupational sectors that may be included as suitable for self-employment. With ups and downs related to the particular features of each area, the matter of supervision is now a topic of debate. In some places, like Holguin and Granma, inspections and procedures have been established, but that has not been done in all provinces. I believe the city of Havana merits different treatment, but there is no doubt that the legal instrument now being prepared by the State Finance Committee will provide a positive mechanism for dealing with possible violations. Moreover, more than a few people believe that self-employment foments the diversion of resources and other forms of crime, and the strict controls of which we are speaking must also deal with this vital issue. Still, I agree with those who think the negative phenomenon of theft was present before the implementation of Decree-Law 141, and now it should disappear with more stringent controls. The issue of prices is also controversial, with a range going from a pair of earrings for 10 pesos up to a small carton of fried rice, pork, meat, or salad, which may cost 70 pesos, depending on the province, day, and category of the place of sale, as is frequent in the Paladar network--recalling the unforgettable Raquel of "Vale Todo" ["Worth It All"]--so well known in the city of Havana. I agree that some prices are too high, but prices are subject to the laws of supply and demand, in which prices cannot be managed. They will regulate themselves as the situation stabilizes and there will be greater satisfaction of needs. In one essential oversight--which may include strong fines and even confiscations--consideration is being given to the future application of a variable progressive tax on personal earnings. Sales and services for foreign currency, which are damaging the meaning of self-employment, also need to be scrutinized more carefully. Taking a positive view, I think of the hundreds of thousands of workers who, because of the necessary layoffs in search of greater efficiency, may find an occupation and employment in this activity, not to mention people of diminished capacity, those without jobs, housewives, and retirees; all these people will ensure a good selection. I am also thinking of the revenues that may be provided for next year's state budget; the program may also help to improve finances and reduce the excessive amounts of cash in circulation in Cuba. In a preliminary accounting, self-employment seems to be working, though it has its weak points because of the short time it has existed. Soon improvements will be made, and there will be more complete control; the workers' movement may also focus on this new labor sector. And of course, when the National Assembly of the People's Government examines the application of Decree-Law 141, the debate will be enriched and the Cuban economy will move toward the consolidation of another necessary measure that will be of great benefit in our immediate future.
