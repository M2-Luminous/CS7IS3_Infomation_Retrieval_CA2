In his interview with Interfax he declared that "for Russia Federation [this] does not mean weakening of the state but is the sole means to preserve the nation's territorial integrity." Shakhray pointed out that laws and Russia's Constitution have actually not acted on Tatarstan's territory over the last three years (the term during which the treaty was being developed). As he said, this situation could have led to a political crisis. Shakhray reported that a new method to develop documents had given impetus to the success of the negotiations. "We were moving to the text of the basic treaty basing on concrete agreements. Thanks to this we managed to prepare both the document itself and mechanisms to implement it," he said. In Shakhray's opinion, this method makes it possible to sign an identical treaty with Chechnya as well. At the same time he underlined that the text of the document to be signed with Groznyy would differ from the one signed with Tatarstan. Tatarstan's participation in the elections to Russia's Federal Assembly is the political result of the treaty, said Shakhray. "This means recognition of Russian Federation's sovereignty, its legislation, and Constitution on the part of the republic," he underlined. Shakhray does not rule out possibility that other constituent members would wish to take the course of agreed relations with federal bodies of state power. Development of such a process, to quote Shakhray, corresponds to the country's Constitution which stipulates that economic and regional "self-tuning of the federation" should be built with the help of treaties. Shakhray also underlined that the federal parliament should adopt a decree on principles of division of objects of responsibility and authorities to regulate this process. According to Shakhray, in the future Tatarstan may join the Federative Treaty in the field of provisions which coincide with the provisions of the treaty on division of objects of responsibility and authorities signed on Tuesday.
