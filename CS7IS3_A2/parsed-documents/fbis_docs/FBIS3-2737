The "Three North" forest belt extends from the Ozbel mountain pass in China's far northwest to Binxian county in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, with 13 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions involved. Statistics reveal that the "Three-North" areas have been blessed with an annual increase of over three billion kg of grain harvest thanks to the trees that protect farmland in these areas, which used to suffer from serious soil erosion and sandstorms. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council decided in late 1978 to build the giant forest belt in the northern part of China, which is designed to protect 42.4 percent of China's landmass. According to the plan, beginning from 1978, China is to take 72 years to plant 35.6 million ha of trees and raise the forest cover percentage from 5.05 percent to 14.95 percent in the areas involved. Over the past 15 years, with 3.232 billion yuan from the central government and related departments, local farmers have put in 1.5 billion work days and have planted about 13 million ha of trees, enclosed six million ha of hillsides and drifting sand to facilitate afforestation, besides carrying out aerial seeding on 60,000 ha of land and planting 5.5 billion trees. Moreover, trees have been planted along 11 million ha of farmland in the Three-North areas. The efforts have greatly improved the ecological environment in the localities involved and enabled a steady and high output in rural and pastoral areas. Because of the building of the forest belt, the output of forage grass has increased by 20 percent in pastoral areas, which are able to feed two million more head of sheep a year. The afforestation drive has also played a positive role in controlling soil erosion on the loess plateau, according to forestry officials. Local forestry departments have listed the work of combining afforestation, industry and trade as an important step for deepening reform. Incomplete statistics show that more than 3,000 industrial "green" projects have been established in the Three-North areas, creating 90.5 million yuan in extra income a year. Li Jianshu, director of the Three-North Forest Belt Construction Bureau under the Ministry of Forestry, attributes the success to the fostering of a selfless spirit among workers, the adoption of a multi-channel fund-raising system and wide application of practical scientific techniques. At the same time, flexible policies have been adopted to encourage more individuals to plant trees in addition to government and collective efforts.
