The seminar was attended by representatives of 38 states of the former Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Alliance. Milewski emphasized that the most important decisions on defense policy should be made by the authorities coming from "free and general elections." Civilian control over the Army should not be identified with restrictions, but public acceptance is necessary for the principles of the defense policy, the functioning of the armed forces, and defense spending.
