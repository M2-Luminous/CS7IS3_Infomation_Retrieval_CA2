Within this context, he ruled out that the change will in any way affect the mission since someone else will be named to replace him, as occurred following the departure of Igbal Riza, the first person to head Onusal when it began its mission. [Begin recording] [Cristiani] First, or at least the information we have is that the contract with Mr. Ocampo was for one year. He had said earlier he wanted to return to Colombia to continue to participate in some capacity in Colombia's political life. In this regard, this is nothing more than an administrative change, and, in that respect, I do not see that this is something against Ramirez, since he has chosen not to remain here for personal reasons. Second, talking about these changes, one took place already without affecting the efforts to continue implementing the peace agreements. That was when Ambassador Igbal Riza was replaced by Ambassador Ramirez Ocampo. We do not feel this change has an adverse impact on the implementation of those agreements that involve processes such as the transfer of land and the lack of public security. [as heard] [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] [Cristiani] Not true. [end recording] Cristiani also flatly rejected remarks by Francisco Lima, accusing him of being personally responsible for the corruption in state enterprises. He said the charges are so groundless that he will not even file a suit against Lima. To end, the president said he was satisfied with the development of the electoral process that will end on 20 March. He added that the elections are contributing to the overall development of the democratic process in El Salvador. Cristiani made these remarks after he presided over a solemn session held this morning in the Legislative Assembly. During this session the city of Santa Ana was declared a heroic city owing to the developments that took place there in 1894 during the revolution that led to the ousting of General Carlos Erzeta. In addition, David Escobar Galido was declared El Salvador's most distinguished son.
