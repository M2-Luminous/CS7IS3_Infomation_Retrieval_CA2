Section 12.700 is revised to read as follows: ยง12.700 Scope. This subpart implements section 307 of the Department of the Interior and Related Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103&hyph;332, 108 Stat. 2499) and section 501 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1995 (Public Law 103&hyph;316, 108 Stat. 1723). For awards made under the authority of section 307, this subpart requires that no funds made available in the Act may be expended by an entity unless the entity agrees that in expending the funds the entity will comply with sections 2 through 4 of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a&hyph;10c; popularly known as the ``Buy American Act''). It applies to procurement contracts under grants and cooperative agreements which provide for the purchase of equipment and products. Section 501 of Public Law 103&hyph;316, 108 Stat. 1723, only applies to awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. In addition, for these awards, there is only a requirement that in providing financial assistance to, or entering into any contract with, any entity using funds made available in this Act, the Secretary, to the greatest extent practicable, will provide to the entity a notice describing a statement within the Act made by Congress. This statement concerns the sense of the Congress that to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available in the Act, should be American-made. Therefore, for Fiscal Year 1995 awards, only the requirements in ยง12.700 and 12.710 will apply to awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. 3. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of ยง12.710 are revised to read as follows: ยง12.710 Policy. (a) In the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided using funds made available under Public Law 103&hyph;332, it is the sense of Congress that entities receiving the assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. (b) In awarding financial assistance under Public Law 103&hyph;332, bureaus and offices excluding the Bureau of Reclamation will provide to each recipient of the assistance the following notice: Notice Pursuant to Sec. 307 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103&hyph;332, 108 Stat. 2499, please be advised of the following: In the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided using funds made available in this Act, it is the sense of the Congress that entities receiving the assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products.
