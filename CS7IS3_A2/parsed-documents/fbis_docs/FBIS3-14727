At the same time, neither has it displayed any animosity. Of late, however, there has been a rapid change in the situation. The United States is doing everything possible to embarrass India. Why is it so furious against India? The sole reason is that, being an international policeman, it thinks that India has not become its consummate slave. Moreover, India's progress in South Asia as well as its overall development, which befits a global superpower, also irritates the United States. Right from the Nehru era, only the Soviet Union maintained a close friendship and gave protection to India. The United States was unhappy with India as it was leaning toward the Soviet Union when both the Soviet Union and the United States were superpowers. Therefore, whoever became U.S. president, he maintained a moderate level of friendship with India. They never provoked India unnecessarily. Similarly, while being friendly with the Soviet Union, India never neglected the United States. It maintained an equal level of friendship with both countries. The situation started changing after the Soviet Union was fragmented in 1992. Some change occurred in the moderate level of friendship that existed between 1941 and 1991. At the same time, India improved its ties with the United States without sacrificing its right of individuality. The stance adopted by India during the Gulf War a shortwhile before the break up of the Soviet Union pacified the United States. The then prime minister Chandrashekhar permitted the American warplanes, which took part in the Gulf war, to refuel in India. Although the opposition leader Rajiv Gandhi protested and the event created some turmoil, the Gulf War came to an end by then and the United States emerged victorious. Besides appreciating India for its cooperation, the United States came forward to strengthen its ties with India. As a result, Indo-U.S. joint military exercises were organized. The commanders of the armed forces of the two countries met and held discussions. During the war in Afghanistan, the United States was lending support to the Afghan militants through Pakistan. Although Pakistan acted with silly intentions to neglect India, the United States did not endorse it. Moreover, when the Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan and Najibollah relinquished his presidency, the United States delinked itself from Pakistan. The resolution moved by Senator Larry Pressler to declare Pakistan a terrorist state and withhold all assistance because of its support to terrorists in Kashmir and Punjab was passed. An ultimatum was also issued to Pakistan that it would be declared a terrorist state, unless it mends its ways. At this juncture, U.S. presidential elections were held by the end of 1992. George Bush was expected to be re-elected as the president. He was defeated and Bill Clinton became president. Some political observers predicted that India will have problems as long as Bill Clinton is the president. This was proved right. As soon as President Clinton took office, he indirectly made it clear that he is antagonistic toward India. He discreetly said that if India does not cooperate with (obey) the United States in its efforts to establish global peace, the U.S. will resort to other means. What President Clinton said came true. The Soviet Union collapsed and the United States now is the only superpower in the world. President Clinton is prepared to tell the world that all countries should obey the United States and whoever does not obey will have to meet the fate of Libya, Cuba, or Iraq. He, who vetoed the decision to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, has extended assistance to that country and started using it as a tool against India. Everything is under the grip of the United States, whether it is the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, or the United Nations. When it imposed certain regulations, India endorsed some of them -- those with which it could cope and were deemed appropriate. Opposition parties accused Rao of introducing the economic liberalization program only per the dictates of the World Bank. It is true to a certain extent. The World Bank gave directives toward the establishment of a market economy in order to pave the way for implementing a privatization program, which is aimed at real economic growth rather than create a wrong precedence by granting unnecessary subsidies and concessions. As this program was deemed appropriate, Rao introduced it. Then came the compulsion to accept the Dunkel proposals. It is nothing, but granting royalty to a country for a commodity which solely originates from that country. Although we have to grant royalty to the United States for some particular pharmaceuticals, we stand to gain in several ways. Agriculture will not be affected. Only after realizing this did the government accept the Dunkel proposals. The United States, however, is exerting pressure on India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The United States thinks that if India signs the treaty, it can enslave India by crippling its military might. The treaty does not say anything about destroying nuclear weapons from the developed countries or to prevent their manufacture. India has insisted for the past few years that it will not sign a treaty which is aimed at crippling only the developing countries. This alone enraged the United States. Then again, the United States has not given up the intention of setting up a military base in India. It has been nurturing this intention for several years. When India sensed this, it decided not to have any military exercises or strengthen its military ties with the United States. India's frontier regions are best suited to conduct military exercises or launch offensives from land, sea, or hilly terrains. Hence, the United States also wants to browbeat China by establishing bases in India, especially on its border with Kashmir by upgrading its military ties with India. India has not accepted this. India's advancement in missile technology has also amplified the irritation of the United States. The successive accomplishments in the testing of Agni and Prithvi missiles have intensified President Clinton's indignation against India. Under these circumstances only, President Clinton unnecessarily raked up the Punjab and Kashmir issues. Where there is a gradual return of peace in Punjab, he spoke about the deprivation of the rights of the Sikhs. His statements about the violation of human rights in Kashmir and about his readiness to assist the terrorists have dismayed India to an unprecedented level. So far, no president has raked up the issue of Kashmir or Punjab in such a silly manner just because India is not their slave. Similarly, they did not encourage Pakistan after describing it a terrorist state. Now, Clinton has done it. Indian experts are of the opinion that it is not going to bring any change. India has begun to protect itself and to improve its growth without caring about the United States. Like China and Japan, it is ready now to speak with dignity and honor at international fora. The Kashmir issue, however, is a stumbling block in this regard. The central government believes that if terrorists are dealt with and elections held in Kashmir, normalcy can be restored there through democratic rule. However, although the United States will not create a big headache for India over Kashmir, it will not fail to use it as leverage to coerce India to sign the NPT. Indo-U.S. ties deriorated to such an extent only after President Clinton assumed office. He is not going to yield, whatever peace efforts India makes. As long as he continues in office, there will not be any dearth of problems. It is a matter of two and a half years only. After that a new president will come to power. The American people always have regards for India. They would like to maintain friendship with India. On this score, we believe that the crack in Indo-U.S. ties is of a temporary nature.
