He said that the United States is adamantly adhering to its current stance for political reasons, which are supported by some Arab countries, and economic reasons stemming from the fear of Baghdad's return to the oil market. He pointed out that Iraqi authorities have implemented all the international resolutions, including the recognition of Kuwait. He accused Kurdish leader Mas'ud Barzani of working for Washington's interests. AL-SAFIR met Salih in Paris, where he was heading the Iraqi parliamentary delegation to the 19th conference of the International Parliamentary Union held at UNESCO headquarters and attended by parliamentarians from 125 countries, among them many Arabs countries, including Kuwait. This conference is usually dedicated to looking into issues of international interest, human rights, and bolstering democratic action. During his speech, French President Francois Mitterrand stressed issues of work, environmental protection, and development. However, the Iraqi delegation, which is currently visiting Paris for the first time since the occupation of Kuwait, stressed other goals. Salih summarized these goals by explaining Iraq's viewpoint to the international forum and presenting the issue of major concern to Iraq: lifting the economic boycott. [Kulayb] We learned that a meeting took place on the sidelines among the Arab parliamentarians. What were their stances on lifting the boycott? [Salih] The Arab meeting took place on the sidelines of the international meeting. In general, activities during such meetings are restricted to coordinating stances that will be presented during the international conference. This is why these issues were discussed, and we reached an agreement on a way to bolster Arab issues and proposals, including lifting the boycott on Iraq. [Kulayb] Much is being said about a change in the French stance regarding Iraq. Is this serious? [Salih] I believe that it is serious; France headed those countries that demanded that the lifting of the siege of Iraq should be discussed in a new way, not in the usual way that always followed an American opinion. In short, this American formulation maintains that there is nothing new in Iraq's stance and, therefore, the boycott must continue. But now the French, Russian, and Chinese have rejected this argument. They believe that Iraq has implemented many of the resolutions and a new stance must be taken. I believe that this is a good beginning. [Kulayb] What are the obstacles preventing the lifting of the boycott, just so long as Iraq has implemented all or most of the international resolutions? Is it American policy or the economy and Iraq's return to the oil market? [Salih] Of course, the political stance is the main reasons. The Americans and their Arab allies want to achieve the objective they failed to achieve through the use of weapons, that is, changing the regime in Iraq. This in itself is a violation of the UN Charter and of the right of people to choose the regimes they want. We still believe that this is not a good policy and will not achieve any results. The second factor is economic. The oil-producing countries oppose Iraq's return to the oil market because this would mean a new reduction in oil prices. This is selfish. The oil issue should be treated in accordance with quotas. Prices can be stabilized only when quotas are redistributed and the highest production ceiling is maintained. We believe that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are using this method now. [Kulayb] The West wants you to declare a clear position on the border issue with Kuwait. Why don't you recognize the borders and Kuwait's sovereignty over these borders? [Salih] Actually, we are taken aback when this issue is submitted in this manner. Until 2 August 1990 Iraq had recognized Kuwait as a state and had treated its amir as a head of state. Kuwait's amir was even honored by the al-Rafidayn medal first class. But things changed when we entered Kuwait militarily. We believe that there are known factors behind this, because the plot was exposed and Kuwait's amir was the perpetrator of this plot against Iraq. Everything is now clear, since we implemented the Security Council resolutions. The issue of Kuwait is in the past, as stated by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz. 'Aziz even reiterated this stance in his message to the Security Council president, French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee. [Kulayb] What about your relations with Iran and Turkey? [Salih] I prefer not to talk about this subject. We had excellent relations with Turkey. We still maintain some of these ties, but we hope that one day we will promote our bilateral relations. Iran's stance is variable, shifting between negative and positive aspects. We hope that Iran, as a Muslim neighbor country, will adopt the correct attitude toward Iraq. This is not difficult for Iran. This would benefit both countries. [Kulayb] The Western countries continue their embargo on Iraq, and you continue to besiege the Kurds. Why did the relations deteriorate with the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south? [Salih] I believe that those who are objective would find that all that is being said on these matters is untrue and inaccurate. As for the Shiites, they are leading Iraq side by side with t?eir Sunni brothers. Concerning the Kurdish problem, if the United States, Britain, and France withdrew their troops deployed in southern Turkey, the situation would return to its pre-1990 status. Iraq's Kurds enjoy full rights. They have their autonomous region and their language: the second official language in Iraq. They also have their local parliament and government. [Kulayb] We asked you the question because Mas'ud Barzani has increased his attacks on Iraq, and also because the Kurds stress that Baghadad has imposed a new oil embargo on Kurdistan. [Salih] The whole country is under siege. Therefore, the talk about the siege of Kurdistan is of no use. Barzani's attacks on Iraq are motivated by the United States. The game has been uncovered and it is disgraceful for an Iraqi to talk in this way. This is treason.
