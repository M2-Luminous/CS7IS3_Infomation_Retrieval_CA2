The move has been prompted by the worsening financial status of enterprises making consumer goods, especially in the light industry. Rampant inflation, unstable money circulation, decline in the buying power of the population and insolvency of partners have caused a decrease in the production of key goods and negatively affected their competitiveness on the domestic market. Additionally, enterprises have been using their industrial potential and personnel resources by only 50 per cent. The resolution adopted by the Byelorussian Government envisages a number of measures aimed at stabilising and increasing the production of basic goods, improving the situation in the domestic market and boosting exports of consumer goods. The Government has requested the National Bank of Byelorussia to allocate 150 billion roubles to the light industry at a discount interest rate to buy wool, cotton and fur in 1994 and another 50 billion roubles to offset mutual debts with its partners.
