[Abreu] The objective of this meeting is to evaluate matters of importance for the integration of the four Mercosur countries. One of the more significant matters is the progress of the technical studies on the common external tariff. Another very important topic is a Brazilian proposal to create a free-trade zone in South America. We will evaluate those topics. Even though this meeting is not being held to meet any formally established deadline, we can also evaluate the progress made in all the integration processes. [LA PRENSA] What points are creating most disagreement among Mercosur members? [Abreu] The Treaty of Asuncion divides the integration process into three major parts: The commercial liberalization program, which is being implemented in close compliance with the agreed terms and deadlines; the common external tariff is also on schedule, although a technical definition is still pending -- one of the reasons for this meeting is to evaluate studies on this last point. A third controversial point refers to macroeconomic policies and the consolidation of the integration process with liberalization in four areas: goods, services, capital, and labor. This last point is held up by the asymmetries of the four countries. It will undoubtedly be evaluated to see what adjustments and political decisions can be introduced to fulfill the terms of the treaty. [LA PRENSA] Among the four countries there are problems like the harmonization of the macroeconomic policies and the common external tariff. Do you think it will be possible to agree on a common external tariff by June? [Abreu] There are disagreements but it should also be noted that we have complied with the commercial liberalization deadlines. This is a really important matter because 82 percent of tariff reductions have already been accomplished and the number of exceptions has dropped, as was expected. External tariff levels are now being studied, as I was telling you, and it should be noted that a consensus has already been reached on 85 percent of the cases to which the common tariff applies. There are pending decisions on fields that can be considered sensitive, in petrochemicals, informatics, and capital goods. We believe by June we will have a technical and political decision on the work and on the fulfillment of deadlines on this particular point. [LA PRENSA] What will be the Uruguayan position with respect to Mexico? [Abreu] Uruguay will adopt a very clear position. We want an additional regulation for Article 44 of the LAIA [Latin American Integration Association] -- which regulates LAIA's concessions on agreements reached with third parties -- not just in the case of Mexico but for all those countries that want to establish relations with nations outside LAIA. We want to be sufficiently realistic, from a political viewpoint, in order to acknowledge this situation. From the legal viewpoint we propose providing an appropriate framework for integration under an umbrella that also includes LAIA. [LA PRENSA] Does Uruguay want to relieve Mexico from the commitments it assumed with LAIA? [Abreu] This does not apply just to Mexico. It is an additional regulation for countries that grant concessions to third countries outside LAIA and which engage in negotiations with their partners to compensate for the commercial distortions that may result from agreements signed in the region. It is an additional juridical document that will, or may, apply to those countries which, like Mexico, make deals with countries outside the region.
