The two sides agreed to hold an airport committee meeting this week. Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said prior to the meeting: There are only a little over three years left between now and 1997, and there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss. The JLG should speed up its work; however, that requires efforts from both sides. He said the Chinese side would bring up some subjects for discussion by the JLG at this meeting, and the objective is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition. Today's meeting lasted more than four hours. After it was over, the two sides announced they had agreed to hold an Airport Committee meeting of the Sino-British JLG on 24 June. It has been reported that the current meeting will last three days, and the two sides will discuss such subjects as the military land issue, localization of laws, public servants' retirement pensions, and the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] passport issue. The previous JLG meeting was held in London from 7 to 9 December last year.
