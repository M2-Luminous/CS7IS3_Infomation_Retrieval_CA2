FR940628-2-00063 FR940628-2-00051 National Park Service Burro Management Plan, Lake Mead National Recreation Area; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Summary: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91&hyph;90 as amended), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) assessing the potential impacts of the proposed Burro Management Plan for Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA), Mohave County, Arizona, and Clark County, Nevada. Once approved, the plan will guide the management of burros within the NRA over the next several years. The proposed action, designated in the DEIS as Alternative B: Resource Based Management, would establish burro-free areas within designated areas of the NRA and accommodate a certain amount of burro use in other areas. Burro use would not be permitted to expand to new areas and the animals would be removed from areas where they pose a resource threat or public safety hazard. Four alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS, including No Action/Status Quo, No Management of Burros, Managing a Population of Burros for Perpetuity, and Total Removal of All Burros. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Written comments on the draft burro management plan and DEIS should be directed to the Superintendent, Lake Mead NRA, 601 Nevada Highway, Boulder City, NV 89005. Comments will be accepted until August 31, 1994. Inquiries on the draft burro management plan and DEIS and requests for copies of the draft plan should be directed to Lake Mead NRA at the address given above, or by telephone at (702) 293&hyph;8949. Copies of the plan will be available for public inspection at the NRA and at area libraries. Dated: June 9, 1994. Patricia L. Neubacher Acting Regional Director, Western Region.
