In the same way as they directed their internationally-prohibited missiles of mass destruction toward Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and al-Rahidah, killing innocent children, women, elderly people, and men, and destroying the secure residential areas, they did not spare the valiant city of Aden from their treacherous, cowardly strikes. Missile strikes were dealt to it by the forces of apostasy and secession during the past few days, aiming at the residential areas in the city of Aden as if the bloodthirsty criminals -- through this terrorist action -- are warning the citizens in the valiant city of Aden with the aim of terrorizing them and dissuading them from joining the ranks of unity and constitutional legitimacy. The hand of treachery, rancor, treason, and secession is being extended to steadfast and heroic Abyan everyday. Missiles and shells are landing in it from warships and aircraft that are still in the hands of the traitors and secessionists, enemies of God, people, and the homeland. These strikes are destroying houses and killing innocent people. What more do the criminal secessionist traitors have in store? Shall we allow them to continue their criminal actions? That is something that will not be tolerated by our proud Arab Muslim people -- our great Yemeni people.
