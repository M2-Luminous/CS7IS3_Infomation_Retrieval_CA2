He urged the trade unions and political parties to come up with projects that can instill and improve such awareness. Speaking to the media at Madras Harbor on Saturday, he said that most of the common people did not know anything about the Dunkel proposals. (Arthur Dunkel drafted the proposals on which global trading agreemnt is being designed. The proposals turned out to be controversial, but with some revisions, most of the countries in the world have accepted them). He said that if the trade unions and farming institutions co-operated in opposing the Dunkel plan, then the government will be compelled to re-examine its stand. He told them that only the initial debates on the proposals were concluded on the 15th of December. There was a whole year for the government to decide on signing or rejecting it. He added that there was enough time for the government to re-examine its decision. On a specific issue that could throw light on the implications of entering hastily into agreements the following meeting report is helpful: He had come to Madras to participate in the meeting of an action committee appointed to examine the issue of the methodology to be adopted in the bilateral negotiations on the dock-workers' salary raise. He said, "We are not opposing starting ports under the private sector, but we are worried how it will affect existing ports. No one is opposing re-organizing trade sectors. But we are requesting that the improvements do not prove detrimental to workers' interests and their jobs. There are already efforts to reduce the number of workers in ports." Finance minister Manmohan Singh's repeated claims that there is no reduction in the work force is just a show. There are no jobs to meet the resultant unemployment. [passage ommitted] The finance department has to make decisions on about 55 sick and ailing industries. When they finally close there will be a big clash between the trade unions and the government. Since the government has decided to sign the Dunkel Draft, this clash may reach serious proportions.
