He said it does not mean, however, that the ministry will surely move toward cutting the project. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has yet to reach any conclusion on its plutonium policy as reported recently, said the official, who declined to be named. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that the ministry has decided to postpone full-scale use of plutonium for nuclear recycling until its economic feasibility is confirmed. The economic daily also cited global fear for nuclear proliferation in Japan and a diminishing need for an immediate establishment of nuclear recycling amid falling uranium prices as other reasons behind Japan's review of its plutonium policy. The trade ministry's advisory body will probably issue a proposal on the matter in its interim report in June, the official said. Meanwhile, the MITI official confirmed a newspaper report that the ministry will assist a shift of idle petrochemical production facilities in Japan to China. The NIHON KEIZAI said Friday the nation's petrochemical companies will transfer unused facilities to China at an ethylene equivalent of 1 million tons. The official said MITI will shortly send a mission to China to work out details on the scheme.
