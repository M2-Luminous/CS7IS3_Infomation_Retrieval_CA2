Speaking after the conclusion of their conference in Warsaw, the ministers of defence from the four states declared they expected the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal to open the way to permanent working contacts with NATO and lead to a full membership of the alliance. The Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said that the Visegrad states expected the NATO summit in Brussels to be held in a few days' time to put this proposal to detail as well as fixing the dates for including the four countries in the transatlantic security system. Kolodziejczyk was very critical of Thursday's statement by the Russian presidential spokesman who said that granting NATO membership to central European states would enrage the Russian military. "Either Russia has taken the road of democracy, or she still regards herself an empire and is feverishly looking for enemies," the minister commented. He also made it clear that Poland was not at all interested in any security guarantees from the West. What Poland wanted was a full NATO membership, he explained. Jiri Pospisil, the first deputy defence minister of the Czech Republic, told reporters here Friday that his country could join NATO on its own, if that method proved faster. If not, then the Czech Republic would join NATO together with the remaining Visegrad states, he added. Lajos Fuer, the Hungarian defence minister, said that it would be NATO which would decide on whether new members will be accepted individually or as a group. He also warned against using the Partnership for Peace initiative for delaying a full NATO membership. In the official communique issued after the conference, the ministers favourably assessed mutual relations between their countries and to-date results of cooperation. They pledged to continue this cooperation in future.
