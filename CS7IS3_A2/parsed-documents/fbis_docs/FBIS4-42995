In an interview with AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINE (Tuesday [7 June] edition), Naumann said that a celebration with Russia "is not my decision." But one "should not forget the contribution and the sacrifices made by Russia to destroy fascism and to end the war, even though Moscow's goal was the establishment of another dictatorship." Concerning accusations of antisemitic and xenophobic statements by drunk Guard Battalion soldiers, as well as the arrest of a noncommissioned officer for being the head of a defense sports group, Naumann said that he does not observe any intensified influx of right-wing extremists in the Bundeswehr. Last year 53 such cases were reported, in which 63 soldiers were involved, 80 percent of them conscripts. "I think that the fact that there were only 53 cases among 390,000 soldiers in 1993 contradicts the impression of a shift to the right."
