Yastrebov, Ryazan Institute of Radio Engineering; UDC 551.501.7:621.373.826.038.823] [Abstract] The principle of differential infrared absorption with scattering is considered for sounding the atmosphere and its contaminants, especially CFCl[.sub]3[/] (Freon-11) CF[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]2[/] (Freon-12), and CCl[.sub]4[/]. Inasmuch as TEA CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers are inadequate for this purpose owing to the presence of transverse modes and the decorrelating effect of the atmosphere along with instability of the radiation intensity and poor reproducibility, an ammonia-nitrogen 9-13 �m laser with resonant pumping by a pulsed CO[.sub]2[/]-laser is proposed instead. The optics include three diffraction gratings: G[.sub]1[/] (100 lines/mm, 30� glancing angle) on the exit side of the pump laser cavity, G[.sub]2[/] (75 lines/mm, 23� glancing angle) behind the first, G[.sub]3[/] (100 lines/mm, 30� glancing angle) on the exit side of the NH[.sub]3[/]-laser. Pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/] laser impinges on the first grating, whereupon radiation leaving its zeroth order impinges almost normally on the second grating and then through its first order enters the cell with NH[.sub]3[/]. The optical cavity for this active medium is formed by a spherical opaque mirror with a 10 m radius off the optical axis in front and the third grating on the optical axis behind. The opaque mirror is positioned so that it reflects radiation emitted by the NH[.sub]3[/] laser onto the second grating, which then rereflects this radiation back into the cavity along with the pump radiation. Addition of nitrogen not only boosts the emission efficiency (to 20 %) and the energy of emitted pulses (to 1.5 J) but also appreciably widens the emission spectrum (up to 13.5 �m). Absence of optically weak elements inside the cavity makes possible periodically-pulsed operation of the NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser. The laser is tuned by rotation of that third grating. Emission of 10-1000 ns long radiation pulses is achieved by passive locking of longitudinal modes. For measurement duty the system is modified and includes only two gratings. The first one (64 lines/mm, 31� glancing angle) tunes the pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser to one of the two absorption lines of the sR(5,k) transition in ammonia and thus, with the aid of a compound cavity formed by that grating and two mirrors, splits that radiation into two beams of unequal intensities. The cavity of the NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser is now formed by this grating, another mirror, and the second grating (100 lines/mm, 37� glancing angle). This grating tunes the radiation from that laser to the absorption line of whichever contaminating impurity in air is being targeted, for use as the probing radiation. The system now also includes a transceiver into which the first grating sends both tuned pump radiation and tuned probing radiation, not together but in separate differently directed beams brought together into the transceiver upon their reflection by another mirror each.
