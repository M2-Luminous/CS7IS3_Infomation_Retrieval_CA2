Dozens of terrorists were killed in those operations. [passage omitted] Senior Army sources said the IDF continues initiating operations against terrorists in south Lebanon. Great apprehension prevails among the terrorists, most notably the senior ones, who have been sleeping in safe houses away from their own homes ever since the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani. The IDF fears that suicide Hizballah squads will try to carry out attacks inside the security zone. The attacks may be either car bombs or infiltration to Israel through the northern border. The IDF has beefed up its patrols in south Lebanon, and troops have been instructed to be alert. An SLA [South Lebanese Army] patrol came out unscathed last Friday when a powerful bomb exploded as the patrol was moving through the western sector last Friday. Army sources have announced that Hizballah's terrorist attempts in south Lebanon registered a rise over the past three months. One of the sources noted that the recently adopted terrorist technique of operating out of houses and the outskirts of villages, in which civilian population lives, encumbers the IDF activities. In addition to Hizballah's attempts to attack the IDF and the SLA, a rise has been noted in similar attempts by other bodies, such as Amal and George Habash's organization. [passage omitted]
