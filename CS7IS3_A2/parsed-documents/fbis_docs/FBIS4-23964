FBIS4-23964 "drafr118_e_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Cote d'Ivoire France's Juppe Discusses Plan To Intervene in Rwanda France's Juppe Discusses Plan To Intervene in Rwanda AB1706211694 Paris AFP in English 2107 GMT 17 Jun 94 AB1706211694 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Abidjan, June 17 (AFP) -- "Between 1,000 and 2,000 men" would be needed to try to halt the genocide in Rwanda under a French proposal to lead a military intervention in the country, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Friday [17 June] during a visit to Ivory Coast. Earlier reliable UN sources had suggested similar figures. Juppe did not indicate how many of these troops would be provided by France. Speaking in Abidjan, the minister said the operation would only be carried out "under the flag and with the green light of the United Nations." He described the effort as "humanitarian operation with the protection of force." He stressed that France would require the support of other countries "in order that there is no ambiguity over France's intentions." US Secretary of State Warren Christopher had expressed his country's support for France's initiative earlier the same day, Juppe said, adding that it was one of many expressions of support. Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie had also given his support, but the question of sending Ivorian troops was not discussed. The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has declared itself opposed to the French initiative, but Juppe said France would "try to convince it." "Even if victorious on the ground, the Front will never be able to govern alone," Juppe said. In order to resolve the conflict quickly, there should be an immediate ceasefire and reinforcements for UN trooops in Rwanda should be sent "as quickly as possible", the minister said. He described as a "pure invention" the "most serious allegations" reported by the Brussels daily LE SOIR that French soldiers were involved in the April 6 attack which killed the heads of state of both Rwanda and its neighbour Burundi. Juppe said he had also discussed the economic situation in Ivory Coast with President Bedie and Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan. He said he was pleased to see that there were encouraging signs following the devaluation of the CFA franc last January. "The battle isn't won but catastrophe has not taken place. It is necessary to stay on course," the minister said. Juppe was due to leave Abidjan early Saturday for Dakar, the last stage on his brief African tour, his first since being named head of French diplomacy in 1993.
