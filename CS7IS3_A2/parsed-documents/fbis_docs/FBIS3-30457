National Police Airport Security Service Head Colonel Jozsef Balogh said that one of Zhirinovsky's companions carried an unloaded gun in his hand baggage. The gun was confiscated according to international regulations and given to the plane's captain in a steel box. Balogh said the group flew to Moscow from Ferihegy-2 terminal by Malev flight 100. He added that when a protected Hungarian politician travels abroad, for example, the president or the prime minister, the security men accompanying him also hand over their guns to the captain, who gives them back upon arrival at the point of destination.
