S.: "Is Part-Time Work Cheaper? Flexible Working Hours as an Employment Policy Tool"] [Text] According to a study of the McKinsey Deutschland business consulting firm, numerous jobs could be created in an economically viable manner with flexible part-time work solutions. The research study arrives at cost savings of up to 20 percent, which, at least in part, should be passed on to the part-time workers. A study presented on Thursday [21 April] by ETH Zurich points in a similar direction. Unemployment in Switzerland seems to be declining slowly once again, but thinking about possible ways out of the employment crisis remains a necessity. For one thing, in Switzerland, with an unemployment rate only half that in many surrounding countries, we cannot and should not think of ourselves as an island of the blessed. For another, 180,000 unemployed are far too many unemployed. The idea of a general reduction of work time plays an especially prominent role in the public discussion about instruments of employment policy. Discussion about this subject in the media has gained in substance recently, but even with varied arguments, the simplistic and static notion comes through that a reduction of work time must, in principle, lead to a corresponding increase in employment. Advantages for Both Sides Of particular interest in this context is a comprehensive research project by McKinsey Deutschland, which in the past few weeks has been quoted repeatedly and fragmentarily. (Dividing and Gaining, "The Potential of the Flexible Shortening of Work Hours," McKinsey & Co., 1994 (Project Management: Helmut Hagemann). It concludes that the systematic introduction of flexible part-time work offers the best possibilities for alleviating the problem of unemployment, and it supports this with ample microeconomic research and data. According to the study, a massive acceleration of part-time work in Germany that pays due regard to the diversity of business and individual realities could net a maximum of 1.4 million full-time or 1.9 million part-time jobs. If we apply this thesis to Switzerland, we probably will not come up with analogous figures. In other words, the effect on employment would clearly be less than 150,000. The part-time rate in the Federal Republic--a good 15 percent--is only a little more than half that in Switzerland (28 percent). On the other hand, what is applicable is the basic individualistic assessment of the study, which considers only those jobs as part-time potential the reapportioning of which would be desirable for both sides, for employers and employees. According to the study, that applies to 24 percent of existing full-time jobs. We are talking here about those jobs for which conversion to part-time, despite conversion costs for the business, would yield cost advantages and whose present "holders" would be prepared to accept a reduction in work hours if losses in wages could be kept within bounds. Gaining Through Dividing In a sense, the McKinsey study removes the contrast between the desire of the employer for a proportionate reduction in wages in the case of an all-encompassing reduction in work time and the demand of the employee for at least partial wage compensation. How is this successful? According to the study, cost reductions in a significant degree can be expected through advantages of flexibility: Individually tailored part-time models should produce average savings of about 20 percent of the personnel costs of part-time workers. These savings are rooted first in higher labor productivity, which is the result of less fatigue as well as better motivation. Second, flexible part-time work would produce reductions in costs resulting from fluctuating work capacity. The thinking here is cyclical part-time plans, say, annual work hours contracts on a part-time basis or a "block model" (for example, nine months of work, three months off). Third and finally, an increase in capital deepening could bring advantages. With voluntary flexibility and reduction of work hours, work time and business hours could be expanded, and thus capital could be better utilized. Destigmatizing Part-Time Work McKinsey people feel they can limit the financial effects on workers in two ways and thus increase willingness to work part time. For one thing, the progressive taxes and dues structure causes available income to be reduced less than performed work time. For another, the study appeals to businesses to pass along a part of the savings gained through part-time work to the employees. Without a partial wage adjustment, the authors feel that sufficient acceptance cannot be achieved. Besides a lot of detailed technical analysis, the McKinsey study is mainly an argument for a positive part-time climate. Part-time work today is associated too much with marginal activities like janitoring and cleaning or, at most, simple office work. Managers still think too much about additional costs and disturbances in the work plan, which we know from traditional part-time regulations. And this form of work is too often thought of as a career dead end, the study says. The study suggests not only giving workers comprehensive information concerning part-time models as well as a promotional campaign showing financial advantages, but it goes further: Should dismissals prove necessary, they should not primarily affect those workers who agreed to flexible and shortened work hours. The authors feel that willingness to work part-time should reduce the threat of dismissal and be seen as a plus for promotions. In its principal thrust, the McKinsey study agrees with a study on the same subject presented in Zurich on Thursday [21 April], which was carried out by the ETH [Federal Technical School] and sponsored, among other things, by the SMUV [Swiss Metalworkers and Watchmakers Association]. (Hans Wuergler, Publisher: Work Hours and Unemployment. A Discussion of Employment Policy in Switzerland. Zurich, 1994) It, too, rejects across-the-board shortening of work hours and emphasizes the importance of voluntarism, individuality, and flexibility. The Zurich study, published by Professor Hans Wuergler, points in this connection above all to the possibilities of moving away into the shadow economy and to the flight toward overtime, which are contrary to any general solution. Moreover, both studies, strongly emphasize the exceptional importance of cyclical work hours models, which adapt flexibly to seasonal as well as to economic fluctuations. According to the ETH study, this requires for Switzerland especially a reform of part-time insurance. The Contribution of Politics While McKinsey strongly addresses businesses and attempts painstakingly to prove to them that flexible part-time models now and then--more precisely: in about 60 percent of all jobs after two years at most--pay off, the ETH study reminds us more strongly of the present political conditions. It calls especially for a lowering of the fixed costs of labor through, among other things, a reform of the national insurance system (mainly greater generosity in the pension funds); through more preventive measures aimed at further training on the part of unemployment insurance; through financing unemployment insurance, say, by means of an energy tax or using general funds, but certainly not by means of higher wage deductions; and finally through liberalization of policies governing aliens. Above all, both studies realize that the potential of making work hours more flexible is by no means exhausted and that with the right steps one could do more than reduce unemployment. What is more, making work hours more flexible could contribute to social development and to strengthening each individual's control over his or her time.
