It is hard to select an appropriate term for the occasion, but what we are talking about is this: Mr. Ion Botnaru, acting foreign minister, invited to his office for conversation over a cup of coffee the chief editors of a number of Moldovan newspapers, press agencies, radio, and television. He described in confidence Moldovan diplomacy's first steps and its successes, failures, and problems, listening to the journalists' observations, proposals, and, of course, impartial questions and responding to the majority of them. He was assisted by Mr. Cubuk, deputy minister, together with the heads of leading departments and the press office. This relaxed roundtable conversation served as the basis for this interview with Mr. Ion Botnaru. [Marian] Mr. Minister, what, from the viewpoint of the head of Moldovan diplomacy, was characteristic of the past year of 1993, the year of the rooster? [Botnaru] The fact that the rooster quite often sang out of place--and he has now ended up as New Year's jelly. And the fact also that the reaction of the disintegration of the former USSR--this colossus on the world map--continued, that is, serious interethnic conflicts, regional wars, and dangerous friction, but as did also a meshing between many of the states that arose on the ruins of the Union. Europe's most dangerous political volcano, in Yugoslavia, continued to erupt. Moldova, despite all the complexity of its domestic situation, managed to secure for itself peace, albeit fragile, and also to progress along the path of self-assertion in the world arena. In this respect, if compared with other former Soviet republics, we finished more successfully. The all-European economic crisis continued to intensify. There was a redistribution of spheres of influence along the entire diplomatic front. Relations between blocs deteriorated, and some states increased their economic pressure for the purpose of deriving political benefits. All the former socialist countries, including the European Soviet republics, endeavored to make their way into Europe--more precisely, into its international structures, where quite a line and crush have already formed. We managed to open certain doors a little. [Marian] On which, as can be seen, the springs had been too tight. Can you, Mr. Botnaru, point to the miscalculations of Moldovan diplomacy? [Botnaru] We have weak points, but we will not tell you them--find them yourselves and tell us! It should be borne in mind, however, that, as a state, we are still at an early age, and there have for this reason been many mistakes, and they are inevitable. I would mention in this sense the current notion of West and East, of political blocs, of the near and far abroad. We inherited it, as it were, from the former regime. Thanks to this, we would set off for conferences or negotiations with our Western partners in more self-disciplined and responsible fashion and more ready to ward off any unpleasantness than at, say, meetings within the framework of the CIS. Out of habit, perhaps, we consider these partners "our people," relaxing our diplomatic vigilance, and at times we would let slip a good opportunity and yield "in our own way" an important position. We forget that there is now no difference between countries of the near and far abroad--each defends its own interests, seeks its own advantage. We also should do the same. [Marian] About the CIS, incidentally. May it be considered that, following a certain period of vacillation, our policy in respect to this bloc has been determined? And that the attacks of the opposition demanding a reorientation toward close economic cooperation with West Europe and Romania--just as long as it is not with the "CIS Empire"--are not confusing our diplomacy? [Botnaru] I will use the words of Krylov's fable: "How many times have we told the world".... But many remain deaf to the official explanations as regards the CIS. Their essence, confirmed also at the recent Ashgabat meeting of heads of state of the CIS, is as follows: Moldova is participating merely in the economic programs of the Commonwealth, and the final decision on its affiliation to the CIS has been left to the new parliament. But, if you like, my colleague, Mr. Cubuk, deputy minister, will tell you about this in more detail and more precisely inasmuch as he is in charge of CIS matters with us. "I do not understand why we have so often to justify ourselves in connection with participation in the CIS if, as they say, there is no other way and there is evidence of economic benefit," Mr. Cubuk began. "It is common knowledge that both the Europeans and the Americans are endeavoring to conquer this eastern market, the Russian market, in particular. We, on the other hand, should, apparently, abandon it to them, demolishing industrial and economic and purely human relations which evolved long since in deference to someone's ideology. Is this not foolish?" [Marian] For what percentage of Moldova's foreign trade turnover does the CIS account, for all that? [Cubuk] Seventy-two percent altogether--Russia for 35 percent plus the remaining CIS countries for 37 percent. [Marian] Thank you, Mr. Cubuk. Now a question to you once more, Mr. Botnaru: Is it true that virtually no one in the world knows our Moldova? If this is so, what has your department done to create a picture of it, an "image," as we say today, and convey it to the world community? [Botnaru] I would ask you not to rush to conclusions, Mr. Editor! Who told you that the world does not know Moldova? Some apology for a businessman or a serious politician? Who does not know of the existence of Moldova? Once again, the petty Hong Kong tradesman or the senior statesman? I will tell you something else: Our republic has been recognized by 133 countries, and our tricolor flutters atop the UN building in New York. President Snegur has traveled round half the world, and the news media have notified the world of this. Aside from this, we participate actively in various international forums, and, finally, in connection with the Dniester conflict, all the top newspapers have written about and all television and radio stations have broadcast on Moldova.... And as far as the republic's image is concerned, this is a difficult question. We have along our lines done a great deal, of course, to convey to the world community the truth about our republic and its situation and policy. But our enemies have not been slumbering either, distorting its image. The so-called patriots have done their bit in this case also. And the former parliament, which was unable in the wake of fruitless debate to untie the Gordian knot of the Dniester region or release the Gagauz problem from deadlock, did a poor job of enhancing Moldova's prestige. [Marian] I understand that in the broad and true sense a country's image is not created by diplomats alone or just the president and members of parliament but by all of us--from the academician through the janitor. In this respect I agree, Mr. Botnaru, that we have done insufficient work. But what are your complaints about the media? What, in your view, are the most annoying "gaffes" of my writing brethren in presenting the international theme? [Botnaru] It is regrettable that not one newspaper and not one channel or program regularly covers international life in general and the work of our diplomacy in particular. All confine themselves mainly to information concerning official visits to Moldova or from Moldova to other countries or to infrequent and, as a rule, sharply worded, barely indicative commentaries on the overseas travel our leadership and the government agreements that have been reached. Our press lacks, unfortunately, journalists who are specialists in international affairs and permanent columns on this subject. Articles are written by whoever and however. And the generally respected "Messenger" program, for example, is in the habit of cutting our reports, which are concise as it is. This frequently shifts the emphases and distorts what has been said. In my opinion, it is impermissible to edit texts of an official nature. The emendations could be coordinated, at least. After all, your brethren, to use your term, frequently confuse an ambassador with a consul and a consul with a consultant, and what is meant by a treaty, what is meant by an agreement, what is meant by a protocol is all the same for some of them. In addition, according to the rules of a civilized press, reports of official receptions should follow in a particular order. It is impermissible that information on the president's reception of the ambassador of a foreign state, say, follow a report on the opening of an agricultural exhibition, even if the ambassador of another state was in attendance. I could give examples. [Marian] In order to close the subject, as they say, tell us what efforts should be made by all of us, diplomats particularly, to achieve true independence, "please" the West, and be accepted in the European family? [Botnaru] We need to take as our reference points here the priorities and values of Western democratic society. The permanency of the Helsinki principle of the inviolability of the postwar borders is a cornerstone of its policy. Consequently, a peaceful solution of the Dniester and Gagauz problems, the transition to a market economy, the adoption of a constitution, the democratic arrangement of the national minorities, and the conflict-free transition to a Western-type society with the preservation of a strong executive--this is what Europe expects of us, and it is on these terms that we can become integrated in its structures. [Marian] Thus there is just one solution for us: sticking to the chosen sovereign path of development, in which we are supported by West and East? [Botnaru] Yes. This is what fate has ordained: Moldova is condemned to be independent. [Marian] I highly appreciate your modesty, Mr. Minister, but would ask you, all the same, to list the achievements of Moldovan diplomacy in the past year. [Botnaru] In 1993 our ministry channeled its main efforts into a strengthening of international confidence in Moldova and the creation of an attractive image for it. Diplomatic missions were opened in Minsk, Kiev, Brussels, and Washington. Work continues on the formation of new embassies and consulates. Treaties and agreements on cooperation in various fields were signed in this period with Romania, the United States, France, the CIS, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and other states. Via the United Nations, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and other international organizations our diplomats notified the world community of the sociopolitical situation in Moldova and the negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the eastern parts of the republic and also aroused world public opinion in connection with the inhuman treatment of political prisoners in Tiraspol and their illegal conviction by an anticonstitutional Tiraspol court. A priority concern was increased cooperation with the permanent mission of the CSCE on the question of a settlement of the Dniester conflict and the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army from the territory of Moldova. As a result of our participation in the Rome meeting of foreign ministers of the CSCE members on 30 November of last year, new prospects for a solution of the above-mentioned questions with the support of this organization were revealed. The purpose of all these efforts is to become firmly established in the international arena as a civilized state which has conclusively opted for democracy and political pluralism and as a dependable partner and peace-loving neighbor. [Marian] It remains merely to thank you for your initiative and this interview.
