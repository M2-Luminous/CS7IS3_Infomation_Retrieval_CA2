According to a recent cross-Taiwan Straits seminar on grain and edible oil production, the total fodder output on the mainland has increased from less than one million tons per year in the late 1970s to 40 million tons now. The annual growth rate of fodder output is 34.46 percent. At present, there are more than 6,200 fodder enterprises and 685 of them can turn out 46 million tons annually. In the 1990s, the proportions of the fodder output changed remarkably. The feed for pigs accounts for 44 percent, the feed for chickens accounts for 48 percent, and that for dairy cows, 7 percent. Up to now, China has set up more than 180 Sino-foreign joint ventures in the fodder industry. However, experts noted that at present, 75 percent of the fodder on the mainland comes from grain, but in developed countries, less than 20 percent of fodder involves grain.
