Government sources said the Cabinet would be informed to acknowledge the change. The NSC had told the Premier it wanted to use the money for secret operations because the projects to which the money had been originally allocated were no longer necessary or had been completed. Of the money involved, 603,500 baht had been allocated for public relations work. The other five million baht had been earmarked for solving southern banditry problems, the sources said.
