Al-Alfi, at a meeting of the Shura (advisory) Council's Committee for Arab and Foreign Affairs and National Security, underlined that terrorists are a negligible minority and do not represent the Egyptian people and that the matter requires concerted efforts to confront such a danger. Thousands of cassette tapes propagating destructive ideas were seized and hotbeds in which they recorded stormed, he said. On exaggeration by some foreign news agencies of violent acts in Egypt, al-Alfi said he is keen on having everything made clear to the public without concealing facts. These media organs are releasing mendacious reports to hasten a coverage without paying due attention to real conditions, he said. During recent months, some 12,500 unlicenced arms were seized he specified. He said he is vehemently against random detention of citizens, specially women, without clear charges. Authorities are conducting daily and surprise inspections of prisons which have full discipline, he added.
