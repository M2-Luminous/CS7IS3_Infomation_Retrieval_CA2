The plan is designed to maximize effects of trade promotion campaigns currently being undertaken by each party, a MITI official told a news conference. Specifically, MITI and the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) will support the EU's "gateway to Japan" three-year export promotion scheme from 1994 by sponsoring trade fairs and seminars. The Japanese side will also offer training to European corporate managers planning to launch businesses in Japan through acceptance of trainees and dispatch of Japanese experts to the EU, MITI said. The program also calls for interchange of information to facilitate European exports to this country, MITI said. These assistance programs are contained in a market-opening package released by the Japanese Government at the end of March, MITI said. In order to smooth implementation of the set goals, MITI and the European Commission agreed to create a joint committee. The committee will hold consultations twice a year in Tokyo and Brussels alternately, with the first meeting taking place here in September, MITI said.
