By 1993, urban-suburban joint economic entities of various types have reached 3,746 from a mere 520 manufacturing businesses a decade ago. The set-up also expanded to other areas such as scientific and technological cooperation and business with overseas ventures. In the industrial sector, there are 200 subsidiary member factories in the outskirts now. The suburban establishments are able to provide more space and labor as well as capital the urban factories need in order to expand. A survey shows that close to 20,000 specialists from Beijing's institutions of higher learning and research institutes are working for the suburban enterprises. The technology input has helped invigorating the rural industries by diversifying the product mix and lifting the quality to a high level. Last year, the value of industrial output in urban and suburban joint ventures amounted to the tune of 15.5 billion yuan, up 48.2 percent over 1992. They also turned over 1.32 billion yuan in profits and taxes to the state.
