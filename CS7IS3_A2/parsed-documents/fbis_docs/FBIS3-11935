Natural gas reserves rose from 136.7 billion to 137 billion cubic meters, an increase of only 0.2 percent. By reaching the level of 3.8 billion barrels (a figure representing what it will be possible to produce), Brazil is guaranteed a petroleum supply for 16 years if no more is discovered and if it continues to extract an average of 700,000 barrels per day, as it is doing today. If that conservative scenario holds up, the figures are quite comfortable compared to those in other countries. Although worldwide reserves (1 trillion barrels) are sufficient for 43 years, their distribution is less comfortable for some countries. The United Kingdom has enough petroleum for 5.9 years' worth of consumption, and the United States has enough for 9.8 years, according to Dimas Jose Simoes, deputy superintendent of operations in the Petrobras Department of Exploration. The fact is that petroleum reserves are concentrated in a small group of countries. Ninety percent of the world's petroleum reserves are owned by only 12 countries (most of them in the Middle East). Brazil, which possesses 0.4 percent of the total, is in 20th place. And 54.1 percent of the world's natural gas reserves, which total 138 trillion cubic meters, is in the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and Iran. In this case, Brazil occupies a modest 40th place. Petrobras's plans for increasing Brazilian petroleum reserves call for investments on the order of $700 million annually in 1994 and 1995, according to Celso Lucchesi, the firm's superintendent of exploration. Petrobras expects to add 350 million barrels per year through 1997. In 1992, for example, when the proven reserves in 234 countries rose by 2 billion barrels, Brazil added 830 million, or over half the worldwide volume [as published]. This was achieved thanks mainly to Petrobras investments beginning in the mid-1980's in the deep waters of the Campos Basin, where the company discovered the giant Marlim, Albacora, and Barracuda fields. In 1992, when worldwide investments in exploration totaled $11.6 billion, Petrobras invested $680 million, the equivalent of about 6 percent of that total. Potential According to Simoes, the 3.8 billion barrels of proven reserves may increase to 8.8 billion. The difference between the two figures (5 billion barrels) represents petroleum that has been discovered but whose volume has not been verified, a process that will require additional exploration investments beyond those already made. Petrobras also has a third figure reflecting "petroleum potential": 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including, in this case, petroleum and natural gas).
