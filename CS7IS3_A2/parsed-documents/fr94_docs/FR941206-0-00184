FR941206-0-00184 FR941206-0-00019 (3) An owner or operator transferring hazardous waste into a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m3 shall meet the following requirements: (i) Hazardous waste transfer by pumping shall be performed using a conveyance system that uses a tube (e.g., pipe, hose) to add the waste into the container. During transfer of the waste into the container, the cover shall remain in place and all container openings shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position except for those openings through which the tube enters the container and as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section. The tube shall be positioned in a manner such that either the: (A) Tube outlet continuously remains submerged below the waste surface at all times waste is flowing through the tube; (B) Lower bottom edge of the tube outlet is located at a distance no greater than two inside diameters of the tube or 15.25 cm, whichever distance is greater, from the bottom of the container at all times waste is flowing through the tube; or (C) Tube is connected to a permanent port mounted on the bottom of the container so that the lower edge of the port opening inside the container is located at a distance equal to or less than 15.25 cm from the container bottom. (ii) Hazardous waste transferred by a means other than pumping shall be performed such that during transfer of the waste into the container, the cover remains in place and all container openings are maintained in a closed, sealed position except for those openings through which the hazardous waste is added and as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section. (c) Each container opening shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid) at all times that hazardous waste is in the container except when it is necessary to use the opening to: (1) Add, remove, inspect, or sample the material in the container; (2) Inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located inside the container; or (3) Vent gases or vapors from a cover located over or enclosing an open container to a closed-vent system connected to a control device that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1087 of this subpart. (d) One or more safety devices that vent directly to the atmosphere may be used on the container, cover, enclosure, closed-vent system, or control device provided each device meets all of the following conditions: (1) The safety device is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors from the container, cover, enclosure, or closed-vent system connected to a control device; and (2) The safety device remains in a closed, sealed position at all times except when an unplanned event requires that the device open for the purpose of preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the container, cover, enclosure, closed-vent system, or control device in accordance with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, explosive, or other hazardous materials. An example of an unplanned event is a sudden power outage. §264.1087 Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices. (a) This section applies to each closed-vent system and control device installed and operated by the owner or operator to control air emissions in accordance with standards of this subpart. (b) The closed-vent system shall meet the following requirements: (1) The closed-vent system shall route the gases, vapors, and fumes emitted from the hazardous waste in the waste management unit to a control device that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section. (2) The closed-vent system shall be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements specified in §264.1033(k) of this part. (3) If the closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices that could be used to divert all or a portion of the gases, vapors, or fumes from entering the control device, the owner or operator shall meet the following requirements: (i) For each bypass device except as provided for in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall either: (A) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator at the inlet to the bypass device that indicates at least once every 15 minutes whether gas, vapor, or fume flow is present in the bypass device; or (B) Secure a valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device in the closed position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. The owner or operator shall visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to verify that the valve is maintained in the closed position. (ii) Low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and safety devices are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. (c) The control device shall meet the following requirements: (1) The control device shall be one of the following devices: (i) A control device designed and operated to reduce the total organic content of the inlet vapor stream vented to the control device by at least 95 percent by weight; (ii) An enclosed combustion device designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1033(c) of this part; or (iii) A flare designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1033(d) of this part. (2) The control device shall be operating at all times when gases, vapors, or fumes are vented from the waste management unit through the closed-vent system to the control device.
