Speaking to the diplomatic chiefs and ministers for budget and foreign trade from the 25-nation OECD, Martino stressed how the commitment of the Rome government was "for greater economic freedom, not limited to just Italy, but one which will develop on an international level." Yesterday, during the first day of the OECD ministerial session, Italy was singled out for its budget problems and told the best way out was through a reduction of taxes for lower level employment and greater flexibility in hiring regulations with the eventual suppression of a minimum salary. Today, the OECD economic policy committee revised its economic growth forecast for Italy for the 1994-1994, predicting a 1.5 percent increase in the GDP for this year, close to its earlier forecast, while in 1995 the GDP is expected to climb by 2.5 to 2.6 percent. Unemployment in Italy was forecast to remain "just below" 12 percent this year, while there should be a slight reduction in store for 1995. In his address to today's session, Martino went on to underscore how "the program of the Italian Government expresses in an explicit way the readiness of Italy to operate for the enlargement of the European Union towards East Europe and to increase world trade relations, first of all with North America and the Pacific regions." The Italian foreign minister then went on to add how premier Silvio Berlusconi believed that "nothing, in Italy's international trade relations, should be done which in any way fuels the protectionist spiral." Martino also voiced his satisfaction for the agreement reached with Russia, also in view its agreements with the European Union, as well as the participation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the July G-7 Naples summit. In order to help support the transformation of the Russian economy, Italy last week took part in the renegotiation of the Russian foreign debt, taking on costs of close to a billion dollars. Looking also at other countries which are evolving towards a free-market system, the Italian foreign minister said the current situation was difficult and was one to which the OECD had to adapt, by moving cautiously.
