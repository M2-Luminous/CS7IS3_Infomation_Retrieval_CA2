The Naval Forces Are Being Replenished With New Cadres'"] [Text] The latest round of negotiations of government delegations from Ukraine and Russia, headed by Yukhin Zvyahinskyy and Viktor Chornomyrdinyy, on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet have concluded in Moscow. As in Sevastopol during the meeting of the ministers of defense of Ukraine and Russia, a final and mutually acceptable solution was still not able to be reached, but the negotiations will be continued in a few days. The military delegation of Ukraine at the meeting in Moscow was Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Navy [VMSU] Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy and the VMSU Operations Directorate Chief Rear-Admiral Viktor Fomin. Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy answered the questions of our correspondents immediately after his return to Sevastopol. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, the latest round of negotiations pertaining to the Black Sea Fleet have unfortunately ended with their postponement. But doesn't there have to be some resolution? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] Yes, there has to be a resolution, and there will be. There is still no conceptual framework, however, that would satisfy both Ukraine and Russia. But there is much, I am confident, that will be accomplished by the delegations over the time until the next round, and our positions will move even closer together. I want to emphasize that the negotiations on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet are proceeding in constructive fashion for the first time, even though there are plenty of mutual claims. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] What were the initial positions of the parties to the negotiations? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The Moscow Resolution of the presidents of Ukraine and Russia regarding the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the gradual split of the forces was made inherent in them. The data worked out by the military delegations in Sevastopol have become the base data on the vessel inventory. Our figures and the Russian ones, true, differed when they were put forward. The reason is that we did not have time to confirm the lists of ships in Sevastopol. The April negotiations, you may recall, were broken off suddenly. The military experts of the Black Sea Fleet that are part of the Russian delegation have now advanced new data with regard to the numerical composition of the ships in the fleet. We will return to this question and continue to coordinate it. The aircraft and shore troops of the Black Sea Fleet will also be divided "fifty--fifty" in accordance with the Yalta agreement. The most problematical issue in the negotiations is the basing of the fleets and the use of the infrastructure. It is too early to comment on that; it has not been worked out. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, you may recall that the Minister of Defense of Russia, General of the Army Grachev, stated in Sevastopol that the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet could last into eternity with the Ukrainian approach to them. How would you comment on that statement? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The Moscow meeting proved that the work of both the Russian and the Ukrainian parties is being conducted in the required channels. Ukraine has a mutually accepted formula that permits the preservation of all constitutional provisions connected with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. An enormous number of legal and economic aspects must be taken into account. I have said earlier, and will emphasize again, that we are discussing deeply the details at the negotiations on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet for the first time. Because any political problem that is resolved from above but has not been worked out at the technical level will always be declarative, as it was before. The fact that we are working on each object in the fleet that is subject to division in profound and concrete fashion is a cause for optimism today. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] What, in your opinion, is the difference between the negotiations in Sevastopol and Moscow? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The difference is that the Russian delegation has taken a clear-cut position for the first time in Moscow. They have been discussing the questions that came up in Sevastopol for the first time. It is felt from everything that the delegation has the aim of resolving the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy, stated in Sevastopol that the servicemen of the Ukrainian Navy would be receiving the same pay as the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet. At what stage of resolution is that question? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] That question has been coordinated with the government of Ukraine. It remains only to resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. I think that the signing of an agreement on the fleet and an increase in pay for our sailors will coincide. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Draftees are coming into the Black Sea Fleet today only from Russia. How do you regard that fact on the eve of the division of the fleet? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] I feel that it should be regarded just as it is. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The negotiations in Moscow on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet coincided with the well-known decision of the Crimean parliament and the unprecedented state of mind that is being fanned by the mass media... [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The literally explosive situation on the peninsula has been created by those forces for which it is advantageous. Even Minister of Defense of Russia General of the Army Pavel Grachev has been drawn into the swirl of disinformation. I met with journalists from Ostankino. Even those people, with their particular approach to covering the situation in the Crimea, were struck by the unbridled nature of the sources of information, or rather disinformation. The situation in the Crimea is calm, and is being monitored. There is no objective data regarding a worsened situation. Everyone needs to calm down and stop "making waves." I have to say on this account that several days ago there was scarcely any explosive situation in Izmayil. It was done by the hand of one person alone. The commander of a brigade of river vessels of the Black Sea Fleet, very "relaxed," started issuing commands for which epaulets were removed during the times of the USSR. Sounding the alarm, he shifted the formation to heightened readiness. He did, in short, wholly intolerable things that even his subordinates did not accept, and they were forced to calm down their furious commander. It seems to me that this occurred owing to the aggravation of the situation in the Crimea. Remember the television and newspaper "canards" about thousands of Ukrainian special-forces troops that had landed on the peninsula? This was funny and sad at the same time. This information, if I can call it that, after all, had a very strong impact on the nerves. The figure of 60,000 special-forces troops was bandied about in the press. But what were these special forces? They were a specific subunit, very small in size. The number of these specialists in any nation is tens or, at a maximum, hundreds of people, or in any case not more than a thousand. You would only get 60,000 people if you added up the numbers of the Black Sea Fleet, the armed forces of Ukraine, the police and National Guard in Crimea anyway. So there was nothing for the Crimeans to be worried about. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, let us return to the affairs of the Ukrainian Navy. What were the results of the winter training period? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] We recently summarized the results. A commission of the General Staff was working on it. The evaluations that we assigned to the formations, units and ships were confirmed. I personally regard the fulfillment of the plan for the winter period as successful. This was thanks to the fact that the staffs prepared the aircraft and shore troops well, we were supplied with fuel and the ships went out to sea. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The shipbuilding program has been lost to view under all of the political events. What ships will be joining the navy in the near future? [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The missile cruiser Ukrayina and an air-cushion assault ship will be joining the force composition this year. A small hydrofoil ASW ship is virtually finished. [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The idea is circulating that the Ukrainian Navy does not need the Ukrayina, and it could be bought by Russia. [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] If we had a considerable selection of ships, then we certainly could talk about that. But since we do not have such a selection today, we can make use of this cruiser. As for "buying" it, I feel that Russia is not able to do that. It has not found either the forces or the funds to finish the aircraft carrier Varyag that is at Mykolayiv. The cost of finishing off the Varyag is equivalent to the cost of the cruiser Ukrayina. The Varyag has been abandoned, so the question of finishing it (I speak as an expert) has passed forever, even though some political figures of Russia, visiting Sevastopol, have announced that they are ready to buy the whole Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol and a portion of Crimea all together right now. If they are that rich, why can't they buy an unfinished ship? Why can't they finish the repairs of ASW ships at our yards? Why are they not able to pay for the overhaul of ships in Bulgaria and pay others for the repair of a single ship? The question of finances is just as difficult for Russia as for us. The Varyag will most likely go for scrap, while the Ukrayina will "float." [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] We also hope that the Ukrainian Navy will soon become a mighty force, able to defend the interests of the state at sea.
