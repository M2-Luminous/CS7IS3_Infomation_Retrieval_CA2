Ray said Australia's re-establishment of accreditation of a defence attache did not mean there would be any change in that position. Answering a question in parliament, Ray said the attache's role was merely to report back on what the Burmese regime and its military were doing. "He is not there for defence links between the two countries," Ray said. "It's an erroneous view that has been in the press. "The Australian government has no intention of resuming defence links with Burma. "Given their human rights record, they are certainly not deserving of any substantial defence links at this stage. We certainly won't be doing such things as defence exports or military to military links. "I can guarantee that we will not re-establish the normal sort of regional sort of defence relationship with Burma until they have a massive improvement in their human rights record." Australian defence cooperation with Burma has been minimal and ties were cut entirely in 1991 with the Burmese SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] regime's refusal to implement democratic reforms. The SLORC military junta seized power in Burma in 1988 after blocking the clear winner of national elections, Aung San Suu Kyi, from taking power and suppressing the resultant nationwide pro- democracy protests. Although Australia has an embassy in Rangoon, the defence attache accredited to Burma is based in Bangkok and will make occasional visits.
