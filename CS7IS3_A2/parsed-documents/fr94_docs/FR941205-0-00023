FR941205-0-00023 FR941205-0-00002 Comments: A comment stated that an asylee should not be required to apply for an EAD, but should be issued an EAD along with notification of the asylum decision. Response and Disposition: The proposed amendments to section 208.20 are designed to ensure that asylees receive their EAD promptly upon application. They do not create new requirements or obstacles for asylees seeking authorization to work. Asylees are among the categories of persons who are eligible for employment incident to their status but must nevertheless apply for an employment authorization document. 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(5). Among others in this category are those aliens who are admitted as refugees, granted withholding of deportation, or granted Temporary Protected Status. Since authorization for employment is a discretionary immigration benefit, the INS will continue to require that persons in these categories file a separate application for an EAD. Accordingly, this provision of the proposed rule will be retained in the final rule with an amendment for clarity. 17. Aliens in Exclusion or Deportation Proceedings (Sections 236.3(a) and 242.17(c)(2)) Proposed Rule: These provisions require that in the case of an alien in exclusion or deportation proceedings who expresses a fear of harm or persecution upon return to his or her country of origin or country of deportation, the immigration judge shall advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum or withholding of deportation and shall make available the appropriate application forms. The proposed rule would have amended these provisions to exempt situations where the alien already has filed an asylum application and that application has been referred to the immigration judge in accordance with the proposed amendments to 8 CFR 208.14(b). Comments: Several comments, all of which also criticized the direct referral of asylum applications under 8 CFR 208.14(b), stated that there should be no exception for situations where an asylum applicant has been referred to an immigration judge. The comments argued that as a result of this change, referred asylum applicants will receive less procedural protection than other persons in removal proceedings. Response and Disposition: These changes do not deny any substantive procedural protection to asylum applicants. An applicant referred under 8 CFR 208.14(b) already has made an application for asylum, and thus need not be advised of a right he or she has exercised. Referred applicants will enjoy all the procedural rights accorded to other persons in proceedings before an immigration judge. Accordingly, these provisions of the proposed rule are adopted in the final rule, with section 236.3(a) amended for clarity. 18. Use of Information in Application to Establish Deportability (Section 242.17(e)) Proposed Rule: The proposed rule would have amended section 242.17(e) to expressly permit the INS to use information supplied in an application for asylum as the basis for issuance of an Order to Show Cause under 8 CFR 242.1 and thus initiate deportation proceedings. Comments: A few comments criticized this amendment, stating that it violates confidentiality by exposing the claims of applicants in immigration court and violates due process by shifting the burden of proof to establish deportability away from the INS. The comments stated that this subsection would be an obstacle to the right to apply for asylum because if the applicant's claim is denied, he or she faces immediate deportation based on evidence provided in the application. Some deserving applicants will avoid this risk and choose not to apply. Response and Disposition: This aspect of the proposed rule is necessary to promptly refer cases to an immigration judge for decision. Often, the asylum application is the only source of information available to the Service to initiate proceedings before the immigration judge. Persons who choose not to file asylum applications for this reason may forego their opportunity for consideration of their claim by an asylum officer; if they are apprehended by the INS and placed directly in proceedings, the immigration judge will have exclusive jurisdiction over their cases. Immigration regulations need not be designed to protect the ability of a person to remain unlawfully in the United States without detection. At the advice of the public, this provision will be amended for clarity to provide that it applies to applications for asylum or withholding of deportation filed on or after January 4, 1995. The final rule will further amend section 242.17(e) to state that an application made under section 242.17 may constitute an admission of alienage or deportability if the alien has been properly served with notice of the hearing before an immigration judge even in cases in which the applicant has failed without excuse to appear for the hearing. This amendment is necessary to enable the entry of orders of deportation against aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States, have been properly served with an Order to Show Cause, and fail to appear for their hearing.
