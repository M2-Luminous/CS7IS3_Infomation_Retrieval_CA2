Their internal reaction is similar to that of the Ni-Cd batteries developed for space use with one difference. Hydrogen generated when they charge and discharge is stored as high-pressure gas in Ni-Cd batteries, but in Ni-MH batteries, the hydrogen is absorbed in the hydrogen occulsion alloy. Hydrogen occulsion alloy can absorb a volume of hydrogen 1,000 times its own volume and produce metal hydride. This new material can release absorbed hydrogen and was developed 20 years ago. Its applications include hydrogen storage and heat pumps which utilize heat generation and release associated with hydrogen absorption and release, but its widest application has been in batteries. Ni-MH batteries are similar to Ni-Cd batteries and Ni-H[.sub]2[/] batteries which were previously developed for space use. Their applicability began being evaluated two years ago using small commercial batteries. The evaluation results were very satisfactory, and batteries with characteristics superior to those of Ni-Cd batteries can be expected. Full-scale research was started in FY 1992 based on the above evaluation results, and 35 AH batteries were trial-produced utilizing space-use Ni-Cd battery technology. The energy density of the trial-produced cells was 20 percent better in both weight and volume than that of Ni-Cd battery cells to be used Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) and the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). Additional scale and weight reduction can be expected. Trial-Produced Cell It should be possible to produce excellent space-use Ni-MH batteries by evaluating their characteristics on a long-term basis and reflecting the results in advanced improvements of characteristics such as service life extension. Japan is leading the world in Ni-MH battery technology and will promote advanced research and development in this area will be promoted by accumulating experience with these batteries on board small satellites.
