During the joint operation, technicians from both sides conducted excavations at four points: points 0079 and 0690 in Viangsai District, Houa Phan Province, and point 1452 in Kham District and point 1482 in Pek District, Xieng Khouang Province. In addition to the excavations, the technical team investigated 23 plane crash cases in various districts in these two provinces. Along with the site surveys and excavations, Lao technicians led their U.S. counterparts to find out about American nationals whom the U.S. side believes to be still alive in Viangsai District and Phoupha area, Houa Phan Province, and at Ban village and Het District, Xieng Khouang Province. The investigation was made at the request of the U.S. side, and is aimed at helping the families of American MIA's and the U.S. Government answer questions about whether there are still Americans alive in the LPDR. NBC and ABC television reporters accompanied the technical team during these joint operations to collect news and observe the cooperation between the two sides. This is the fourth joint Lao-U.S. operation carried out in the 1994 fiscal year. The results of this operation has been considerably good. The U.S. has highly appraised the achievements of the operation. It has also expressed its appreciation to the Lao Government and people for their good cooperation and flexibility, despite the fact that up to this fiscal year the U.S. has not given any humanitarian aid to Laos, which has all along fulfilled its obligations effectively.
