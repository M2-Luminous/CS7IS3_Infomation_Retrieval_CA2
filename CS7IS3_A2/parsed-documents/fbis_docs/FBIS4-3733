In the 1980s, it was colour television sets and refrigerators. Now in the 1990s, it is programme-controlled telephone exchanges. China is regarded as the last huge market for digital telephone exchanges, and foreign and domestic electronics manufacturers are all hungry for a piece of the pie. But the Chinese Government is determined to avoid a repetition of what happened to colour TVs. It is estimated China will need about 13 million lines of digital telephone exchanges in each of the next six years. There are more than 120 manufacturers in the country, and their annual capacity exceeds 10 million lines. Experts believe that capacity will reach 23 million lines by 1996, of which 18 million will be for branch use. Although capacity will soon exceed demand, many domestic firms are eager to set up new production lines. Experts and government officials worry that excessive investment in foreign equipment wastes capital, and few manufacturers can maintain efficient production scales. To curb the zeal of new producers, the government has worked out several regulations restricting such projects. Only five large joint ventures will be allowed in China to produce digital telephone exchanges for branch use. Three are already in operation. The foreign partners are Alcatel of Belgium, Siemens AG of Germany and NEC Corp of Japan. China is negotiating with AT&T of the United States and Northern Telecom of Canada to establish two other joint ventures. Officials stipulate that foreign companies must bring advanced development and production technology if they are to co-operate with China. Some foreign electronics giants anxious about losing the potentially massive market in China, are secretly looking for local co-operative partners, trying to set up joint ventures without approval from the central government. Officials said that the government will adopt strict measures to stop such subterfuge. A new regulation governing the use of foreign capital in making programme-controlled telephone exchanges will soon be published.
