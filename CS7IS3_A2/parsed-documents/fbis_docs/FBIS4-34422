Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the thwarted February 1992 military coup, charged in a communique to the media that Minister Montero Revette conspired last year against the then Defense Minister Radames Munoz in an alleged coup that did not materialize. "Current Defense Minister Gen. Montero Revette was involved up to his neck in the military coup that Vice Admiral Radames Munoz was going to carry out last December," Chavez states in his communique. The retired military officer also maintains that "there is plenty of evidence. The (provisional) government of Dr. (Ramon) Velasquez (1993) had the evidence, and his interior minister was fully aware of that conspiracy." According to Chavez, the former minister was "protected" on that occasion by the ruling political parties, because "a coup of that sort would maintain the status quo, corruption, and the privileges of ruling political and economic groups and would quell the struggle of the people to improve their welfare." Chavez was imprisoned after the coup attempt until his release two months ago, when he benefited from a presidential amnesty granted by President Caldera, within the framework of the Armed Forces' peace process. This amnesty led to the release of virtually all those implicated in the February and November 1992 coup attempts. A few days before taking office last February, Caldera asked Vice Admiral Munoz and the ranking military command accompanying him to resign. He appointed Montero Revette, who until that time was Army commander, the new defense minister. Although, with the change in the military high command and release of the coupist officers, Caldera managed to maintain a period of calm in the military sector for several months, charges of new conspiracies surfaced this week. Alberto Muller, retired general and current senator, charged that Munoz is preparing a new coup, while Montero Revette said that "rightist and leftist" groups are conspiring. Montero Revette mentioned Chavez and the "Red Flag" organization, among other leftist groups. This wave of rumors was denied this week by Caldera, who said that "the most prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading rumors." Caldera said: "I am convinced that the democratic system in my country is a firm and stable reality." Venezuela, which has been a representative democracy for 36 years, experienced two thwarted coups in 1992, and since then coup rumors have surfaced periodically in the country.
