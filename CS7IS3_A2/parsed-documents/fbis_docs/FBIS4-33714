FBIS4-33714 "drlat112_m_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Brazil Details of PT Land Reform Program Released Details of PT Land Reform Program Released PY0906202194 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2232 GMT 8 Jun 94 PY0906202194 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Report by Chico Otavio] [Text] Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, 8 Jun (AE) -- The National Agrarian Secretariat of the PT [Workers Party] has stated that the land reform policy it intends to implement in Brazil, if it wins the elections, will involve 17.5 million hectares. The plan is included in the program of PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Jose Graziano da Silva, the program coordinator, said expropriation will be the main instrument for land redistribution. Graziano is accompanying Lula on a three-day visit to Espirito Santo. He released a pamphlet to owners of small farms outlining some points of the PT-designed "Program for Brazilian Agriculture." A new feature mentioned in the pamphlet is the possibility for farmers to use land as a way to repay their defaulted loans with federal banks. Graziano said one of the program priorities is the settlement of 800,000 families over a four-year period. The PT intends to settle some 250,000 families in a semi-arid zone in the northeastern region -- the so-called Drought Polygon. The objective is to give an average of four hectares to each family, which would provide work for at least two people per family. This project will require about 1 million hectares. Under the project another 550,000 landless families from all over Brazil will be given between 20 and 30 hectares each, depending on the region. The federal government will need approximately 16.5 million hectares to implement this plan. Graziano said preference will be given to squatters camping along highways, squatters occupying indigenous land, and squatters in areas under dispute. Expropriation will affect mainly unproductive properties above 500 hectares -- an area that is enough to house 20 families. The use of land to repay the defaulted loans of farmers is also considered a land reform instrument.
