It proposed the elaboration (in concert with industrialists) of an aeronautical research programme as well as the definition of modalities for financing, follow-through and control and distribution of results. Industrialists, the States and the Union are invited to carry out joint strategic reflection in order to give fresh impetus to this industry. The EP [European Parliament] considers that it would also be necessary to: a) pursue and intensify the aid programme for reconversion of armaments industries (KONVER) and integrate the major military programmes in the appropriate European structures; b) launch training and re-training programmes; c) speed up harmonisation of norms of industrial and regulatory industrial techniques, and create a single authority to oversee the functioning of the unified air transport market. The EP also calls for competition policy with regard to merger or takeover operations to be adjusted to the needs of industry on the world market. The Commission must ensure that this practice does not entail a monopolistic situation. The EP considers that, given the European structure of these industries, it is appropriate to speed up the establishment of representative staff bodies at European level. The situation of the aeronautics industry is not dramatic, said the Rapporteur, despite some structural weakness (companies operate in an over-national way), the vulnerability due to dependence on an often volatile dollar, and the prospect of massive job losses (150 000 by the end of the century). Mr Fuchs (France) said on behalf of the Socialist Group that the opinion that the criteria on merger and concentration control in the aeronautics sector should not be (as the European Commission thinks) respect of competition but the maintenance of European competitiveness. In the future, Mr Fuchs believes, there may be only two or three large companies at European level. Markets are too fragmented, said Mr. Siso Cruellas (Spain) for the EPP [European People's Party], while Mrs. Minardi (France) defended, on behalf of Left Unity, the maintenance of national industries. If there is no specific R&D programme for the aeronautics industry, it is because it benefits from certain aspects of the 4th research and development framework programme, said Mr. Bangemann on behalf of the European Commission. Furthermore, he does not agree with Mr. Fuchs on the need to maintain a public service: privatised industry could be more effective than national monopolies. A working group is currently studying the means to make it possible to compensate for the dollar's volatility (for example, through insurance policies taken out by companies). Concerning the military aspects of this industry, the Member States are reluctant to grant a role to the Community as such in this domain, concluded Mr. Bangemann.
