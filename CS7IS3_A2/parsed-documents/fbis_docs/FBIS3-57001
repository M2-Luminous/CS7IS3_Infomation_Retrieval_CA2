This anxiety was expressed in the Sunday analytical programme Perekryostok (Crossroads) of Ukrainian TV. Perekryostok reminded people once again of the right, granted to President Kravchuk by the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine, to cancel resolutions of local government authorities running counter to the Ukrainian constitution (in the opinion of observers, the presidential elections in the Crimea are just the case), and gave the floor to Yevgeniy Marchuk, head of the Ukrainian security service. He described the situation as criminally dangerous and urged the rivals to act within the limits set by the law. Taking into account the polarization of opinions in the Crimea itself over the future of the peninsula before the second round of the presidential elections, scheduled for January 30, as well as the fact that two obviously political assassinations took place in the Crimea over the past month (Captain Andrey Lazebnikov, head of the press service of the Black Sea Fleet, was killed in Sevastopol last December and Iskander Mamedov, deputy to the Crimean parliament from the Crimean Tatars, died of wounds in Simferopol last Friday, following an attempt on his life), one cannot but agree that the concern of the head of the Ukrainian security service is well-grounded and his warning is timely.
