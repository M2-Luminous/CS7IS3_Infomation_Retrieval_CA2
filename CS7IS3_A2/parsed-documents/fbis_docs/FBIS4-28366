Concerns have been voiced about the industry's losing international competitiveness brought about by the continued appreciation of the yen against other currencies. MITI hopes to indirectly promote mergers and tie-ups among businesses by re-examining the managing of the Antimonopoly Law, among other ways. It also plans to retain the industry's competitiveness through cost reduction methods and to improve the technological infrastructure to establish a technological information network. In the past, MITI has discussed industrial policies separately with individual industrial sectors. This will be its first effort at working out policies for the entire basic materials industry which transcends the boundaries of separate industrial sectors. MITI plans to start full-fledged discussions by setting up early next month an "Informal Panel on Policies Regarding the Basic Materials Industry" to serve as a private advisory panel to the directors of the Basic Industries Bureau and the Consumer Goods Industries Bureau. The panel will consist of president-level officials from companies which manufacture basic materials such as steel, nonferrous materials, chemicals, cement, and paper and pulp. The following topics comprise the pillars of the planned policy review: 1) improvement of the distribution system; 2) improvement of the technological infrastructure; and 3) contributions to an environmental-friendly society. Comcerning improving the distribution system, MITI plans to take such measures as reviewing the managing of the Antimonopoly Law in order to laterally support mergers and tie-ups among firms which are being forced to streamline their operations as a result of poor business performance. In this way, it plans to enhance the industry's competitiveness. In addition, the ministry plans to propose setting up a system of commending firms which have been able to overcome the problems of maintaining excessive product quality and providing excessive services. MITI also plans to have a thorough investigation made concerning differences in commodity prices at home and abroad and to urge promoting deregulation to help reduce distribution and energy costs. Regarding improving the technological infrastructure, MITI plans to establish safety standards for basic materials and chemical products. It also plans to encourage establishing databases and networks which deal with technological information related to the bio-technology field. Computer chemistry has been considered essential to developing chemical substances. While this has been pointed out, Japan has lagged behind the United States. Therefore, MITI plans to respond to this situation by launching a state project. To break away from the malpractice of excessive quality maintenance, the ministry also plans to embark on developing new methods to gauge the durability of basic materials.
