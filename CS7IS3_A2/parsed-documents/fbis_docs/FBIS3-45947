Border trade with Vietnam and Laos was suspended for some time last year due to relations between the countries. "Since trade ties between them resumed, the countries' governments -- both at central and local levels -- are meeting more frequently on border trade policy," said Fan Xiliang, chief of the comprehensive division of Yunnan Provincial Economic Relations and Trade for Neighbouring Countries Administrative Bureau. "Therefore, the outlook for border trade is good," he added. China's southwestern Yunnan province has a 4,000-kilometre boundary with Burma, Laos and Vietnam. It takes care of the mainland's border trade with those countries. "Trade with all three countries is rising. But as our trade with Burma already has a higher volume, Vietnam and Laos are likely to grow faster in the future," Mr Fan said. More than 80 per cent of Yunnan's border trade was with Burma, he said, with Vietnam accounting for about 10 per cent and Laos the rest. "China has had good links with Burma for ages. The traffic and communication systems between the two countries are better developed. That's why their border trade volume is so high," he said. Yunnan's border trade stood at 2.27 billion yuan (about HK$2 billion) in 1992, up 38.4 per cent on the 1.64 million yuan in 1991. Imports and exports were balanced. Border trade is conducted in yuan, as opposed to foreign trade where transactions are made in foreign currencies. The mainland has been conducting border trade with the three countries since before the establishment of the People's Republic. "Since the country adopted its open economy policy, great attention has been paid to border trade, which is supported and agreed on by the Government," Mr Fan said. Lower tariffs are charged on imports through border trade from the three countries, while some cities on the Chinese border enjoy some of the benefits granted to coastal cities. "We help encourage people to trade higher-end goods. We are also working to crack down on both the import and export of imitation products," Mr Fan said. Participants in border trade are state, collective and private enterprises, including hawkers. Approvals from the relevant authorities are needed for conducting border trade.
