Natal Police Liaison Officer Captain Henry Budhram said about 20 men armed with AK-47 assault rifles and 12-bore-shotguns had attacked seven houses just before dawn. The deceased, which included altogether six children, were: Sandile Dlamini, 7, Thuleleni Dlamini, 17, Lalani Dlamini, 65, Nonhanla Madondo, 6, Hlompile Madondo, 16, Kwazi Madondo, 3, his grandmother Rosaline Madondo, 50, Ester Zaca, 50, her sister Zenzele Zaca, 63, Fikilephi Zaca, 17, Nceke Mchunu 50 and Petha Mtolo, 80. They all died from gunshot wounds, Capt Budhram said. Police have launched an intensive investigation and have blamed the ongoing violence between the ANC [African National Congress] and Inkatha as the motive for the attack. Some of the houses were looted. The Masunkazane community has been devastated by violence since 1990 with an ongoing supremacy battle between the ANC and Inkatha. Last year alone, 1975 people were killed in the area, but peace monitors said the area seemed to have quieted down the past few months. ANC members, monitored by peace officials, spent the day campaigning 20-km away in Ixopo, and were unaware of the attack. However, the ANC media spokesman in the area, Mr Blade Nzimande, had been informed by shocked residents. He confirmed the area had been relatively peaceful of late, but said in view of the Freedom Alliance's [FA] stance towards elections he had been expecting trouble. "Its an attempt by the FA to destabilise communities to pressurise the ANC and government to accede to their constitutional demands," Mr Nzimande said on Sunday night. "But to kill women and children is particularly barbaric," he added.
