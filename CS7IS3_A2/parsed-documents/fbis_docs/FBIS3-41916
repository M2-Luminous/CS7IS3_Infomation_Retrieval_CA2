(Andre-Claude Lacoste) of the Nuclear Safety Directorate says in this report -- which was submitted this morning to the Industry and Environment Ministry -- that from the point of view of safety, the reactivation of the reactor could be authorized given two conditions: that the work on combatting sodium leaks is completed successfully, and that the reactor should be brought into service at reduced power for a few months. In other words, Super-Phoenix will be reactivated.
