Since Japanese firms have technology capability and brand power that South Korean firms do not have, it is believed that South Korean firms will embark on the buy-out of Japanese firms not only in home electronics, but also auto parts, etc., in the future. South Korean firms are losing price competitiveness along with the rise in personnel costs, and improvement in technology capability has become an urgent necessity. For this reason, they have been active in M&A these past few years to acquire technology. Last year, Modern Electronics Industries, the largest South Korean electrical equipment manufacturer, acquired 40 percent of the stock of Macstar, a major U.S. manufacturer of hard disk devices (HDD) used in computer memory storage. Samsung Electronics also bought Harris Microwave Semiconductor, a U.S. compound semiconductor manufacturer, last year. The aim of this buy-out also is the acquisition of high-class audio product technology capability and the prestigious brand of Lux. The development speed of firms in advanced nations such as Japan is fast in technology aspects, and it is not easy for South Korean firms to catch up. It also takes considerable time to improve brand image. A buy-out is the quickest way to obtain that. They probably also have judged that now is "the time to buy" Japanese firms which have been suffering in business with the prolonged recession. South Korean firms are expanding scale and acquiring financial power riding on the high growth of South Korea. It is whispered in the South Korean financial world that "there are firms besides Samsung Electronics which aim at a buy-out of Japanese firms or capital participation." Regarding the management of Lux, Samsung Electronics "will make use of the Japanese management and support the management of President Hayakawa," and is giving care to the Japanese side. If the buy-out by Samsung Electronics succeeds, there is a great possibility that it will be an opportunity for South Korean firms to undertake constructively the buy-out of Japanese firms.
