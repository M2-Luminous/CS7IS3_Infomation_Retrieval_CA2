FR940805-2-00097 FR940805-2-00056 III.3. Adequate to Protect the Public Health and Safety NRC and Agreement State radiation control programs share a responsibility to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety in the administration of their respective regulatory programs controlling the uses of nuclear materials and facilities. Accordingly, NRC and Agreement State programs shall possess the requisite supporting legislative authority, implementing organization structure and procedures, and financial and human resources to effectively administer a radiation control program that ensures adequate protection of the public health and safety. III.4. Compatible in Areas of National Interest NRC and Agreement State radiation control programs share a responsibility to ensure that a consistent and compatible radiation control program is administered. Such a radiation protection program should be based on a common regulatory philosophy including use of common definitions and standards. It should not only be effective, and cooperatively implemented by NRC and the Agreement States, but also should provide uniformity and consistency in program areas having national significance. Such areas include those affecting interstate commerce, movement of goods and provision of services. Also necessary is the ability to communicate using a nationally accepted set of terms with common understanding, the ability to ensure an adequate level of protection of public health and safety that is consistent and stable across the nation, and the ability of NRC and each Agreement State to evaluate the effectiveness of the national radiation control program. States will not have the flexibility to deviate from the program elements that the Commission requires for compatibility. III.5. Flexibility With the exception of national radiation protection standards, to the extent possible, Agreement State radiation control programs should be provided with flexibility in program implementation to accommodate individual State preferences, State legislative direction, and local needs and conditions. However, the exercise of such flexibility should not bar or preclude, or effectively preclude, a practice authorized by the Atomic Energy Act, and in the national interest. That is, a State would have the flexibility to design its own program, including incorporating more stringent requirements provided that the requirements for adequacy are still met, and the more stringent requirements do not preclude or effectively preclude a practice within the national interest without an adequate public health and safety or environmental basis. IV. New Agreements IV.1. Overall Process of Becoming an Agreement State Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act requires that once a decision to seek Agreement State status is made by the State, the Governor of that State must certify to the NRC that the State desires to assume regulatory responsibility and has a program for the control of radiation hazards adequate to protect the public health and safety with respect to the materials within the State covered by the proposed agreement and compatible with the Commission's program. This certification will be provided in a letter to the NRC which includes a number of documents in support of the certification. These documents include the State's enabling legislation, the radiation control regulations, a narrative description of the State program's policies, practices and procedures, and a proposed agreement. The NRC has published criteria describing the necessary content these documents are required to cover. The NRC reviews the request and publishes notice of the proposed agreement in the Federal Register to provide an opportunity for public comment. After consideration of public comments, if the Commission determines that the State program is adequate and compatible, and approves the agreement, a formal agreement document is signed by the Governor and the Chairman of the NRC. IV.2. Phased Implementation The NRC believes that a formal phased implementation process, during which a State initially assumes authority over smaller, less complex licenses, would be advantageous to both NRC and the Agreement State. It would provide the NRC an opportunity to obtain important information on the State's program and validation of the State's capabilities before turning over a major portion of the program. At the end of the initial phase, the NRC would have greater confidence in the State's ability to protect the public health and safety and to administratively manage the program. From the State perspective, it should provide new States an opportunity to work out start up problems with their program prior to having responsibility for more complex licenses. Therefore, upon the effective date of a full agreement, a mandatory phased implementation process will be used. In the initial phase, the State will assume full regulatory authority over categories of licensees programs of lesser complexity. During this phase, the State will perform all regulatory functions for the transferred licenses. At the end of this phase, the NRC will evaluate the State program to determine that the State program continues to be adequate to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's program. If, at the end of the initial implementation phase, the Agreement State program is adequate and compatible, and the State has demonstrated an ability to assume authority for more complex licensed activities, the remaining categories of licensees will be transferred to the State.
