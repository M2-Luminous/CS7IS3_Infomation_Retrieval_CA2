The Rasalama Active Forces Political Department, which always remains side by side with the people and is ready to continue the struggle, draws the government's attention in particular to the seriousness of this situation, an example of which is the coming civil servants' strike. The Active Forces Political Department calls on the government to find rapid and appropriate solutions to these insufferable problems. The Political Department believes that the prime minister has only two choices left: He should either resign or should replace ministers who are incompetent.
