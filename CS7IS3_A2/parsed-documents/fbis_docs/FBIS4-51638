With regard to the question of resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, she stated: "During his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor set some conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks and Mr. Hata told Mr. Kantor that he would study the conditions after returning to Japan. We are waiting for answers from Tokyo." She added, "If there are no answers from Japan, it would be difficult to hold informal consultations with it to discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks." During the interview, she also indicated that the U.S. Government will make a judgment on whether Japan has honored the Japan-U.S. agreement on government procurement in late April and work steadily to settle the issue of individual sectors with Japan regardless of whether the framework talks resume or not. In the interview, she stressed that, in order for the framework talks to be resumed, "Japan's measures for the macroeconomic policy and the individual sectors are equally important." As for the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in the macroeconomic policy, she said, "The U.S. Government has already asked the Japanese Government to present not only a ratio for 1994, but a medium-term ratio." Commenting on the reports that the United States will soften its tough trade stand on Japan following a change of government in Japan, the U.S. trade official denied the reports, saying, "They are wrong." Also commenting on the Hata-Kantor meeting, she stated: "They failed to reach an agreement on how to implement what both Japan and the United States agreed last July and confirmed that the two countries are not in a situation to hold informal consultations to discuss ways to reopen the stalled framework talks." In the interview, she disclosed for the first time that "during his meeting with Mr. Kantor, Foreign Minister Hata told Mr. Kantor that he will study the conditions offered by Mr. Kantor for the resumption of the stalled framework talks after returning to Tokyo," adding that "we are waiting for answers from Tokyo." During his meeting with Foreign Minister Hata in Morocco, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks which included: 1) macroeconomic policy that serves to cut Japan's huge trade surplus; 2) expansion of Japan's imports; and 3) establishment of an objective criteria to measure openness of the Japanese market by individual sector. During the interview, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky indicated that Japan needs to respond flexibly to all the three conditions, and the United States places importance on both the macroeconomic policy and the establishment of an objective criteria as its conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks. She stressed in the interview the importance of the objective criteria and of preventing a misunderstanding from spreading in Japan that the stalled framework talks can be resumed only if Japan works out the macroeconomic policy, taking into account Under Secretary of Treasure Summers' remark that "the marcroeconomic policy is most effective in reducing Japan's trade surplus."
