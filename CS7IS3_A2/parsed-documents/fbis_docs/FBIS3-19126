The visit was concluded on Friday [11 March] with a news conference in Berlin, where Grachev and his host, Volker Ruehe, concurrently assessed the visit as a success. Ruehe said that the intention to make special efforts to intensify cooperation after the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces ran through the visit "like a red thread." Grachev said that the point is that cooperation between the German and Russian armed forces will not only be improved by the stipulated joint maneuvers and the exchange of officers who will participate in General Staff courses in Hamburg and Moscow. What is more, it is important to secure both the quantity and quality of the armed forces' relations with each other "for the foreseeable future." Grachev thanked Ruehe for his hospitality. Ruehe, for his part, paid tribute to Grachev's preparedness to honor the members of the military resistance against Hitler and the assassins of 20 July 1944 by laying a wreath in the courtyard of the Bendler Block. The fact that the uprising of 20 July had been attempted from the Bendler Block is the reason for his decision to set up his official seat in Berlin in this building. Grachev and Ruehe largely evaded questions about the organization of the ceremonies on the withdrawal of the Russian soldiers, which is to take place in August. Grachev said that a celebration with the Germans that emphasizes the friendly character of the Russian soldiers' return is wanted. Ruehe added that the point is to lay the foundation for good relations in the future by a worthy celebration. Kohl and Yeltsin have made it a business of the bosses. Questions about Russia's attitude toward NATO, the Partnership for Peace, and the East European states took up a lot of space. Grachev resolutely contradicted the allegation that he had advocated a delimitation of responsibilities in Europe. The contrary is the case. Russia is in favor of a uniform European security system that comprises Russia and NATO. At the same time, he confirmed his assessment that he had made in Bonn -- that is, that the project Partnership for Peace is conceived for a transition period. In response to the question of how long this transition period will last, in his opinion, the Russian defense minister said that this transition period started with the Warsaw Pact's dissolution. It will last until the former Warsaw Pact states have found their place in the European security system and the world. This process also includes their economic recovery. They must stop being debtors who have to beg for unlimited loans. Not only NATO but also the CSCE, the European Community, and other organizations belong to a pan-European security system. In his opinion, they should all cooperate under the CSCE's leadership. He did not rule out that NATO will also become a partner of the CSCE. Grachev evaded questions about the relationship that the East European states should have with NATO, in his opinion. Moscow wants to see by the example of other countries that they, like Russia, are also prepared for cooperation with NATO, he said. In response to questions about Russia's behavior toward the Baltic states, Grachev said that the view that Foreign Minister Kinkel took during his meeting with the foreign ministers of the Baltic states corresponds to the current position. Russia continues to be in favor of a speedy withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states. However, it does not forego the fulfillment of the demands made by it. It will not accept apartheid. This statement was understood as Moscow's demand that the Russian inhabitants of the Baltic states have the same rights as the citizens of these countries.
