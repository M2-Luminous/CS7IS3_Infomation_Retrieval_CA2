Slavomir Novak from Prague's City State Attorney's Office told CTK that the Office had already completed the charge which would have probably been brought against Cibulka today or tomorrow. Cibulka was accused of defamation for calling Havel "you swine, you bastard," during a court case last December. The case had been brought against Havel by Cibulka and co-editor of NECENZUROVANE NOVINY for the criticisms Havel had made of the anti-communist newspaper's decision to publish -- in May 1992 -- a list of alleged collaborators with the StB, the former communist secret police. The defamation case was to have been resumed in April. After the lawsuit was considered in December, Cibulka officially queried the impartiality of the judge, and the case was not able to proceed until the Supreme Court delivered judgment.
