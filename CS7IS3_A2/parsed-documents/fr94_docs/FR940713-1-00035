FR940713-1-00035 FR940713-1-00002 (1) To date, information has not been developed to establish that crib toys present an unreasonable risk of strangulation injury to children; (2) Consequently, information has not been developed to establish that issuance of a mandatory rule for crib toys to address that risk of injury is reasonably necessary; and (3) If this proceeding were continued, such information would not likely be developed. The Commission also concludes that information is not now available or likely to be developed to support a finding that the expected benefits from a mandatory rule to address strangulation hazards associated with crib toys would bear a reasonable relationship to the costs imposed by such a rule. Such a finding is required by section 3(i) of the FHSA to issue a rule for crib toys. Accordingly, the Commission hereby withdraws the ANPR published in the Federal Register of October 19, 1993 (55 FR 42402) to initiate a proceeding for development of requirements to address risks of strangulation deaths and injuries associated with crib toys. Dated: July 7, 1994. Sadye E. Dunn, Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bibliography 1.
