In the same place were Abraham announced to the world the belief in one God, dozens of people were slain while praying to that same God. Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image, the Bible says. In other words, a murderer should be killed, but there is no mercy, forgiveness, or redemption for bloodshed that does not distinguish between a base murderer and innocent citizens. On behalf of my colleagues, and I believe in the name of all the members of this House, I utterly denounce this terrible act and send condolences to the families of the victims. I urge educators throughout the political spectrum and rabbis to close ranks around the sanctity of human life and the moral use of arms which has always characterized us. Even a people fighting for its survival, such as the Jewish people, must uphold its moral standards in war. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, all these rules were broken. Consequently, the government decided to set up a state commission of inquiry to thoroughly investigate the murder and find the truth. I would like to discuss what this committee must investigate and what should be included in its letter of appointment. I would like to tell you that a few hours ago I phoned the foreign minister, who heads the ministerial committee assigned to formulate the commission's letter of appointment, and asked him to add several points. First, we call for an investigation of all the facts and factors related to the horrendous act perpetrated in Hebron. The word factors may not be clear to the members of the House and, indeed, it does not appear in the letter of appointment as reported in the media. According to reports, the government asks the commission of inquiry to investigate and arrive at findings and conclusions with regard to the facts and circumstances pertaining to the massacre. Mr. Speaker, I went back and looked up another commission of inquiry, the Kahn Commission, set up to probe another tragic affair, the killings in Sabra and Shatila. The letter of appointment issued to it by another government stated as follows: The government asks the commission of inquiry to investigate all the facts and factors pertaining to the horrendous acts -- the exact same words we are seeking. I would like to tell you that the word factors was added at the firm and resolute demand of then-Attorney General Mr. Yitzhaq Zamir. After all, we are not just talking about facts and circumstances; there are also factors and people responsible. I do not know who is responsible and I would not presume to say anything like that. However, when you formulated the letter of appointment -- it was worded by well-known jurists whose professionalism I greatly appreciate, including two former justice ministers and the current attorney general -- did you not have the letter of appointment of the Kahn Commission in front of you? Is it just a coincidence that this specific word is absent? Are there only facts and no factors? Has the whitewashing already begun? Do not put the blame on the foot soldier; in this case, Major Ilan, the commander at the Cave of the Patriarchs. If anybody is responsible, the word factors -- as it pertains to responsibility -- should be included. Although responsibility should not be determined at this point, it should be stated that somebody is responsible. Otherwise, what is the sense of the whole thing? Did you not foresee it? Under the Likud government, a commission of inquiry set up to investigate a horrendous slaughter saw fit to look into the factors leading to it. Confronted with a no less horrendous massacre, the Labor government does not see fit to look into the factors. Mr. Foreign Minister, it is not yet too late. The government can meet and amend its decision. If you want the public to perceive the mandate of the commission of inquiry as being state-like rather than of a political or partisan nature, amend the letter of appointment. What else should the commission investigate? No doubt, it must investigate the events pertaining to the tragic murder of some 40 innocent Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs, but it must also probe the no less abominable slaying of over 30 Israelis -- according to data in my possession, 33 Israelis were killed; not all of them were Jews, some were Druze -- in the last few months. Does only the murder of Arabs, however despicable and abominable, merit a commission of inquiry, whereas the slaying of dozens of Jews and Druze -- as well as hundreds of Arabs in the territories who were considered collaborators and were murdered by Arab terrorists -- does not? Mr. Speaker, we listened attentively to the speech of the prime minister, who made a series of remarks which were not to our liking. The commission of inquiry must probe the whole question of the deterioration of the security situation. These events did not take place in a vacuum. Since 13 September, when the Oslo agreement was signed, things have been happening in the field, including a surge in the number of murders. Why is this happening? It is not happening because of facts, but because of the decisions and actions of the government. For example, you allowed the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] deportees to return although you were specifically warned that they had undergone special terrorist training. You allowed them back nevertheless, thus pouring boiling oil on the blazing bonfire of terror. You pardoned dozens of wanted men, and threw them into the bonfire as well. You released hundreds of terrorists. Now, instead of coming to your senses and seeing the situation for what it is, instead of regaining your level-headedness and stopping this succession of capitulations and gestures, what do you do? What do you have in store for us now? What lies in store for us in the next few days is the release of yet another 800 to 1,000 terrorists; more terrorists, more boiling oil. What is worse, in the not too distant future, if we approve the process you are now trying to accelerate with all your might, you will bring into our midst another 8,000 murderers -- not potential murderers as the assassin in Hebron, but certified ones. That is why we demand to add a clause to the letter of appointment. We want and demand that the commission of inquiry investigate the serious deterioration in the security situation since the signing of the agreement with the PLO, including the murder of dozens of Israeli citizens throughout the country, as well as the murder of dozens of Arab inhabitants of the territories by Arab terrorists. I would like to add, Mr. Speaker, that if these events are not investigated now they will be probed by the next commission of inquiry which has yet to be set up. Mr. Speaker, Judaism does not uphold punishing an entire community for the sins of one individual. We do not believe in or accept the concept of collective responsibility, and we will definitely not stigmatize the entire community of settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; a community of law-abiding people and pioneers; of people who have for six years been subjected to a ceaseless onslaught of terror but behaved in a manner which only arouses respect and should be an example to all of us; people who drive in their cars with their children on roads where a woman five-months pregnant is slaughtered and the father of nine children is slain together with his son. These people have displayed supreme heroism, and are for the most part -- and this is an understatement -- law-abiding. We do not accept the current notion of mentioning them in the same breath with a handful of extremists who must be dealt with the utmost severity within the confines of the law. The latter should be dealt with, but not so the vast majority. We ought to watch over this majority and not lend a hand to harming a community of people who are the emissaries of the State of Israel and of generations of the Jewish people. However, that is exactly what you are trying to do. In the last few days, the media has been waging a slanderous and venomous campaign. Not just the media, but also cabinet ministers have been describing the settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza as a hotbed of murderers. I hear talk about separation -- a euphemism for uprooting the Jewish population from Hebron, Bet El, Ari'el, and 'Imanu'el -- and I say: If the answer to terror in Hebron is uprooting Jews from Hebron, the solution to possible terror in Yafo is uprooting Jews from Yafo, Nazareth, 'Akko, and any other place where Jews and Arabs live side by side. There is no solution other than coexistence. Those who demand our expulsion from Hebron as a solution are doomed to flee other places as well. Mr. Speaker, Hebron, the city of the common patriarchs of the Jewish and Arab peoples, must be the place where Jews and Arabs learn to live and to pray side by side. However, the coexistence we advocate cannot grow and develop on the basis of an unfortunate policy which forsakes the security of both Jews and Arabs. We call on the government to return to a sane, responsible policy. Only in such a policy lies the chance of curbing this horrendous bloodshed. A responsible policy will ensure that we can continue to tread this arduous and tortuous road -- albeit the only one we believe in -- of peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Jews in Eretz Yisra'el. I would like to conclude with a word to Israel's Arabs: You are citizens of this country. Through great efforts, we built a life together, a successful delicate fabric. I call on your leaders not to lend a hand to its destruction, to calm tempers, to put down the violence, and to come out against it, just as I call on my colleagues in the left wing of the House to curb the hatred and the venom. Let us argue to the point -- and we do have an outstanding argument -- but not by resorting to uncalled-for hatred. We have only one nation and only one state, and let us maintain both of them.
