Based in Jericho, this 68-year-old banker is preparing to draft his first budget. [Lacorie] How much time do you require to collect taxes for the first time? [Al-Nashashibi] Everything should be operational within a month at the most. However, we have a huge task ahead of us. For instance, I need to find Palestinians to replace the 351 Israelis who took care of fiscal and financial matters as part of the military administration. We also need to recover all computer files pertaining to taxes and custom duties currently scattered among various Israeli ministries. [Lacorie] Did you receive the $42-million (240 million French francs) in emergency aid which the international community pledged to grant earlier this month? [Al-Nashashibi] No, we have not received anything so far. This is not what matters right now, though. We must first set to work, and the money will follow. [Lacorie] Has Yasir 'Arafat postponed his arrival in the autonomous territories to protest the fact that this aid package has still not materialized? [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat stated that he could not come in a bankruptcy context, but there are other reasons as well. In any case, the other members of the Palestinian Authority will come to Jericho in two weeks; I hope the president will do the same. [Lacorie] What do you think of the economic component of the agreement entered into with Israel? [Al-Nashashibi] This agreement, which was put together in Paris, is utterly unbalanced, and we shall try to renegotiate it as soon as possible, as all it does is protect Israeli interests. We had to agree to applying the same custom duties as Israel does, for the sole purpose of sparing Israeli firms any inconvenience. Another example: We shall be able to sell oil fuels at a price only 15 percent lower than that in Israel, even though we could have purchased oil products at a much better price from Arab countries and passed the saving on to our population. Obviously, should we fail to make significant amendments to the agreement, the Palestinian population will be very disappointed and frustrated.
