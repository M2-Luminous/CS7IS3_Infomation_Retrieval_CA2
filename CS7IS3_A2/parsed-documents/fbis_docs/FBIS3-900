In a communique issued today, the parliamentary opposition says it is with great sadness that it has learned of the assassination of Harouna Tahirou, a student, following the unwarranted police intervention on campus, which infringed upon academic freedom. The communique further states that this odious act should be blamed entirely on the authorities of the Third Republic, who in order to ensure their survival no longer hesitate to give orders which are clearly illegal. Nigerois can see from these incidents that there is a slide toward totalitarianism. The Alliance of Forces of Change government has adopted a dictatorial attitude because any time social forces demonstrate for their demands to be met, the authorities systematically resort to imprisonment and violence, leading sometimes to deaths. The parliamentary opposition calls on the government to conduct investigations to find out who gave the orders for this cowardly assassination so that the culprits can be brought to justice. Finally, the parliamentary opposition extends its condolences to the bereaved family and the Niger School Union. PNT-Albarka [expansion unknown] has also reacted to the 10 March incidents. They issued a communique at the end of their party's executive committee meeting denouncing, quote, the tendency of the Third Republican authorities to seriously violate individual and collective rights as seen in the attempts to bring the state and private press to heel; the repression against student and women demonstrators, and intimidation of unions, end quote. PNT condemns the indiscriminate repression against the 10 March demonstrators. The attitude which accompanies this behavior still exists, although people thought it had been done away with, show that the struggle for the institution of true democracy is a continuous process.
