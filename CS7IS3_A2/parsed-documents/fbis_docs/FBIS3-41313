The ringleader was Odamir Davi Bertuol, 28, an engineer and owner of the Edifa condominium management company in Porto Alegre. His office was used as a narcotics contact and sales point. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized when the five people were arrested. Every 15 days the group brought in 10 kilos of cocaine, reaping a $30,000 profit on each shipment. Chief Mauricio Finkelstein, of the narcotics headquarters, requested and obtained an order for temporary detention of those involved. They include Almeida Faviero dos Santos and Marcos Barcelos de Menezes--the latter worked three years at a secret cocaine-refining laboratory in the Bolivian jungle.
