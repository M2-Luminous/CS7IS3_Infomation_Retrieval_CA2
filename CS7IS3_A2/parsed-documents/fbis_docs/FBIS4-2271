Prices in the grain and edible oil markets in Sichuan during the Spring Festival were relatively stable, but immediately after the festival, prices rose again. Because the supply of grain and edible oil in some localities in the province was not timely, lawless merchants took advantage of the situation and engaged in hoarding and speculation to drive up prices. A few state grain shops also raised prices without authorization. This caused excessive rises in grain and edible oil prices and at the same time pushed up the entire retail price index. Everyone is talking about the matter in various localities. It is learned that the three measures to curb and stabilize grain and edible oil prices adopted by Sichuan Province include: --Major measures to curb and stabilize grain and edible oil prices put forward by the State Council and the Sichuan Provincial Government must be seriously implemented and fixed prices must be strictly followed in order to maintain the stability of grain and edible oil prices; --In some places where the supply of edible oils is excessively short, rationing can be adopted; and --In a few localities where there really is difficulty in the supply of edible oils and where a readjustment of prices is needed, a report can be submitted to the provincial commodity price bureau for approval, but rises cannot exceed 10 percent of the price limit.
