When asked about the Indian threat of a limited war on the Line of Control, the defense minister observed that wars are never limited, but I am confident that there is no real danger of an India-Pakistan war at this time. The defense minister also expressed his view on Pakistan-U.S. relations and expressed the hope that some ways and means will be found to repeal the Pressler Amendment. We have paid $658 million for F-16 aircraft and $1 billion in total and we are still hopeful that a way will be found to supply these aircraft. We are, however, also considering acquiring aircraft from other sources to strengthen our Air Force, the defense minister added. The defense minister's view that there is no danger of an India-Pakistan war at the moment is encouraging. Pakistan, nonetheless, needs to be more vigilant in view of Indian designs. Just the other day, Indian Home Minister S.B. Chavan told a news conference in New Delhi that if the law and order situation in Kashmir does not improve, it will lead to serious consequences. He ruled out any negotiations with the Kashmiris to resolve the struggle. The fact is that the Indian attitude is becoming more and more aggressive, with an increase in tension in Kashmir. Recently, Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma made a personal attack on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, ignoring all diplomatic protocol. Two members of the Indian Cabinet have also attacked Bhutto personally. These incidents can help one easily assess India's thinking and attitude. Under these circumstances, Pakistan cannot overlook its defense even for a moment. Pakistan has been continuously striving to resolve its core dispute with India peacefully. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also said today that he wants to resolve the Kashmir dispute with India through peaceful means. He disclosed that during the recent meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, he met Indonesian President Suharto and proposed that the Nonaligned Movement play the role of mediator to resolve the Kashmir dispute. He also told Suharto that if India were to nominate him as mediator or agreed to set up a committee, either of the above would be acceptable to Pakistan. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that even though bilateral disputes cannot be discussed at the platform of the Nonaligned Movement, he has suggested that the organization find a way to help resolve the basic dispute between the two member-states -- India and Pakistan. The Pakistan foreign minister's observations make it amply clear that we are ready to go to any possible extent to resolve all our differences with India peacefully. In her recent interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto revealed that she helped Rajiv Gandhi contain the insurgency in Punjab and she did this because she did not consider interference in internal affairs of any other country appropriate. At that time, the movement of the Sikhs was continuing with all its intensity and it could have resulted in anything. An independent Khalistan state could have also come into being in east Punjab. It is possible that certain circles inside Pakistan may make Benazir Bhutto a target of their criticism in the wake of her aforementioned revelation, but it reflects that Pakistan is always willing to go to every possible extent to normalize relations with India and to eliminate the causes of tension. Unfortunately, the Indian Government has never responded to Pakistan's gesture of goodwill with goodwill and has rejected all Pakistani proposals to resolve the Kashmir dispute through peaceful means. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has done well to declare that Pakistan will not withdraw its resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human Rights Commission; and if the resolution is not approved there, Islamabad will not desist from taking it to UN General Assembly. The foreign minister's declaration makes it clear that while Pakistan will continue to do everything possible to achieve a peaceful settlement, it will also remain firm on its principled stand and will not show any slackness in raising the Kashmir issue in international forums. Pakistan is not indulging in a confrontation with India, but in view of our bitter experiences of the past, we should remain vigilant and cautious against Indian designs and run our foreign policy in a manner in which the veracity of our stand is revealed to more and more nations and international public opinion continues to support our legitimate stand.
