Of the said amount of investment, more than U.S. $91 million has come from domestic financial sources. The said investment was reported to be carried out in three sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and services. Of the three sectors, 187 projects with a capital of U.S. $265 million are in the service sector; 159 projects with a capital of U.S. $217 million are in the industry sector; and 75 projects with a capital of more than U.S. $103 million are in the agriculture sector. Compared with the previous years, the amount of investment capital in the aforementioned fields has increased markedly. We can see that all this reflects an important achievement our party and government have made in implementing the policy of broadening economic cooperation and relations with foreign countries. It appears that the implementation of this policy has been effectively carried out with some modifications, thus attracting more and more foreign business interests to invest in Laos. Under the terms of this policy, the equitable sharing of legitimate benefits will be fully ensured for all the parties concerned. Most of these investment projects are in the fields of agriculture and forestry, electricity production, and infrastructure for export-oriented goods production. In addition to affirming the merit of our policy of broadening economic cooperation and relations with foreign countries, the achievement of attracting more foreign investment to our country also serves to enhance the role and prestige of our party and government in the international arena. Nonetheless, it can be said that most of the foreign investment in our country is mainly concentrated in the service sector. With regard to this trend, many commentators, especially our economic experts, have cautioned that our efforts to attract foreign investment to transform the natural and semi-natural economy into a goods production economy in our country starting from agricultural and forestry development may be misdirected. Superficially speaking, this assumption has a certain degree of rationality in it. However, we must learn more lessons on this from the neighboring countries. In the meantime, we cannot afford to be too theoretically rigid in our economic principles. Everyone must agree that the building of our country along the correct policy of the party and government requires a large amount of investment. Therefore, given the present economic, social, and cultural circumstances and the status of our country, it is appropriate that we try to attract foreign investors to bring capital into our country for investment here. At the same time, we must always keep in mind that proper facilities must be available to serve the service business operations in our country, such as trading and tourism. A network of needed infrastructure, such as roads, telecommunications facilities, means of transport, hotel accommodation, services, and financial outlets must be set up. Many economic experts and public figures frequently point out that a number of investment projects in Laos proposed by foreign businessmen have been delayed. This is because the requests to implement some investment projects here are often submitted to our authorities by brokers, who subsequently sell the permits granted to them to foreign investors for profit. Such practices naturally result in delays in the implementation of the projects concerned, thus causing losses to both our country and the foreign investors, and discouraging prospective foreign enterprises from making investment here. In addition, the implementation of some investment projects has not been carried out in earnest, thereby causing numerous difficulties to our management sector. On average, most [foreign investment] projects, be they small, medium, or large, have been smoothly and effectively executed on the basis of mutual trust, equality, friendship, and mutual benefits. At the moment, preparations are being made for the launching of a number of major investment projects, such as the construction of hydroelectric, cement, and other plants. Relying on past experience, our authorities and cadres concerned are energetically and comprehensively carrying out the necessary work to ensure that all management loopholes are completely plugged so that no losses will ensue to the investors and our country. To continue broadening our economic cooperation and relations with foreign countries effectively, we must first pay special attention to our management work to ensure that the party's and government's policy on promoting foreign investment in various forms of lasting cooperation for mutual benefits is effectively implemented, especially in the fields of agriculture and forestry, hydropower production, and infrastructure construction for export- oriented goods production, thereby creating more financial resources for our national development. To effectively achieve this goal, we must adopt more essential regulations to be included in the law on foreign investment and implement necessary policies with a view to creating favorable conditions for foreign investors. In addition, we must issue more documents with accurate investment data for use by foreign business enterprises. Our service management style must also be improved in order to promote competent businessmen and eliminate brokers. We must rigorously encourage all the services concerned to provide needed conditions to foreign investors.
