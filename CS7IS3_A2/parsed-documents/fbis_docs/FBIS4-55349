Campaign chief Balint Magyar told journalists that if the MSZP names the party chairman as candidate for prime minister, they will read the message that the Socialists do not want to form a coalition with the SZDSZ. The party will accept only an alliance in which it can realize its program, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe said. He added that the final word on coalition membership will be pronounced by the extraordinary delegates' meeting of the SZDSZ a week after the second round of the elections.
