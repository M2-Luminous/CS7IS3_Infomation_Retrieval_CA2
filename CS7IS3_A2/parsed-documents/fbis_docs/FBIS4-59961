Satish: "U.S. South Asia Policy: Bound To Fail"] [Text] The Clinton administration's new concept of a multilateral arrangement on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia is unlikely to succeed. There are only two possibilities: either India changes its stance or it does not. The dialogue is obviously doomed to failure if India does not budge from its consistent stand that it would not accept any regional non-proliferation treaty and would only be party to a regime of nuclear non-proliferation, which is both non-discriminatory and universal in character. But would such an arrangement succeed if India bowed to international pressure and accepted some form of regional restraint? Before considering why it would not the new US approach mooted at the London talks recently needs to be put in perspective. It has been evolved out of the special report on South Asia that US President Mr Bill Clinton presented to the US Congress on April 29 last year. The report virtually indicated the abandoning of the earlier proposal made by former Pakistan prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, and tacitly backed by the US, wherein India and Pakistan would have signed a regional non-proliferation treaty, with the US, China and Russia being guarantors. India's objection then had been that China's presence as a guarantor was unacceptable because that country posed a security concern to India. The most significant aspect that stood out in the report (and reflected in the new proposal) was a tacit acceptance of the Indian position that any durable solution to the nuclear imbroglio in the subcontinent would necessarily have to effectively address its concerns both over China's nuclear potential and the newly-developing nuclear uncertainty in the Central Asian Republics following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The US objectives, under the new approach, on the nuclear issue in the region are: first to cap, then over time reduce and finally eliminate the possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery. A unilateral or regional cut-off of fissile material production. A regional agreement not to conduct nuclear detonations and placing safeguards on new and existing nuclear facilities. Since President Clinton believes that the whole issue is a regional problem, it is worthwhile to consider what factors would influence or come in the way of a regional solution, especially in the context of his suggestion that while "each region is different, both countries can benefit from the ideas and experience that we have gained over the decade in arms control and CSBMs (confidence and security building measures) in discussions with the Soviet Union and others." It is clear that the dialogue that the US is proposing is basically a replication of earlier arms control treaties that it had negotiated with the erstwhile USSR. However, there is one major problem in trying to apply the same to South Asia. Major breakthroughs in arms reduction talks between the two superpowers have always come along with significant thaws in political relations between them. That is not the case between India and Pakistan. The mutual mistrust between the two since 1947 has shown no signs of improving and, if anything, the relationship is at its lowest ebb now. Due to the perverse logic of partition Pakistan's raison d'etre of being an Islamic state would, by extension, succeed only if India's secular experiment is seen to fail. This, added to the division of Pakistan in 1971 (the creation of Bangladesh) and the peculiar sub- continental social realities have only added to the growth of a disease of which Kashmir at symptom. Therefore, a solution to the Kashmir issue would be central to a more basic thaw in bilateral relations and to the success of any future CSBMs on nuclear non-proliferation that may be agreed to. The US approach appears to be that an agreement on nuclear non-proliferation and CSBMs would reduce political tensions and lead to a solution on Kashmir (it may be recalled that the US is now talking of a "deep freeze" on Kashmir and concentrating on non- proliferation). The ground reality is precisely the opposite. A durable regional agreement on non-proliferation is possible only when the more fundamental issue of Kashmir is first satisfactorily resolved. And for that to happen, the geo-strategic realities of the sub-continent at the moment warrant that a solution would necessarily have to take into account the strategic importance of J&K to China and other neighbouring countries. It should be remembered that the state of Jammu and Kashmir shares a 350 km border with China's Xinkiang province. However, this area forms part of Pak-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and, -- 1963, Pakistan ceded the Raskam valley and the Taghdumbash Pamirs, north of the Karakoram mountains, to China. For China, therefore, the Xinkiang border from Siachen glacier to the occupied Aksai Chin area is with India, while further east it is with Pakistan. Since the area has immense strategic value to China, it has a vested interest in the solution (or lack of it) of the Kashmir dispute and cannot be considered as a disinterested party. China is very much an interested party in the Kashmir dispute by virtue of its holding Kashmir territory. Other factors that need to be satisfactorily addressed before any regional non-proliferation agreement are India's security concerns vis-a-vis China arising out of its defeat in the 1962 war, the consequent border dispute, the China-Pakistan military axis and China's own attempts at improving its strategic depth in the region. China's professed commitments to non-proliferation are taken here with a pinch of salt. A glaring example is that despite professing adherence to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 1992, The New York Times of May 6 last year first revealed that there was evidence from satellite photos that China was still shipping M11 missiles to Pakistan. If China is violating the objectives of the MTCR, what is the guarantee that it would adhere to any commitment that would essentially mean a break in the China-Pakistan military axis? Despite the thaw in bilateral relations during the last few years, there are very few in India who believe that China is altogether trustworthy. Many Indian military experts and politicians still believe that with China's ambitions of becoming a superpower and achieving a semblance of nuclear parity with both the US and Russia, the most effective Indian response to this cannot but be to go about setting up a nuclear deterrent force and perfecting delivery systems to have the capability to hit back at important political, economic and military-industrial targets in China even after taking a first strike. With such a volatile ground-level situation, the psyche of the people and politicians of the sub-continent is clearly not geared to adhering to any regional arms reduction or nuclear non-proliferation agreement while problems like Kashmir and terrorism continue to simmer. In such a scenario--of passions running high over Kashmir, worsening Indo-Pak relations and China's overwhelming nuclear superiority vis-a-vis India--it would be unrealistic to have a workable regional non-proliferation a agreement, until the more fundamental issues facing the three countries are first satisfactorily dealt with.
