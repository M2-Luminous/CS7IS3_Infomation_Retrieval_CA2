Just recently, the statement says, the public greeted with satisfaction the news of an agreement being reached on a comprehensive solution for the so-called Korean nuclear question. Then suddenly the alarming news broke that the American side, using its dominant position in the International Atomic Energy Agency, had broken off all these agreements and made blunt threats against the DPRK which were accompanied by a stream of lies and slander aimed at North Korea. By so doing the United States and its allies revealed their true plans: Using the situation which had developed, they planned to slander and strangle the socialist state on Korean soil and prevent Korea's peaceful unification. The Russian association "Bomminren" resolutely condemns the Americans' plans. On behalf of the many thousands of Koreans living in various countries outside of Korea it demands that the row and provocation connected with the so-called nuclear question on the Korean peninsula be stopped.
