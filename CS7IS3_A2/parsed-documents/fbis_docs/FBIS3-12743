Delegation member Marwan Dudin said the delegation's return came in the wake of a Jordanian decision, in coordination with the other Arab parties, on suspending the current round of negotiations as part of the manifestations of protest and anger that prevailed among the official and popular circles in Jordan following the savage massacre against the worshipers at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque last Friday. The decision to suspend the negotiations was made at the government's instructions after holding intensive Arab contacts.
