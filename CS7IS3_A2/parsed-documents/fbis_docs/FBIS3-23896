Ivashchenko: "Chinese Peasants Outpace Russians"] [Text] Negotiations have begun in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast on bringing Chinese seasonal laborers into the fields of collective farms in the Amur region. A delegation of businessmen from the PRC visiting Birobidzhan is prepared to bring, immediately if desired, hundreds of Chinese peasants into local villages in exchange for metals, fertilizers, and equipment. Last year more than 600 gast-arbeiters from the neighboring country were working in the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes of the autonomy alone. Some private farmers have engaged the foreign "hired farm hands" as well. In this regard, instances of illegal transport of Chinese were noted, for which no one was held accountable. Today freedom of transport of manual labor from abroad is significantly restricted by recently adopted governmental documents. The engagement of foreign labor is subject to mandatory licensing with local administrations, for example. This measure is a timely one in the opinion of many, because the previous lack of control led many times to sad consequences for the Russians involved, who suffered losses from cooperation which was not always equal. Last year's experience shows that unemployed Chinese travel to Russia not so much to work hard in the fields as to engage in trading at the flea markets. And in no way do all of them manage to accomplish both tasks without detriment to the harvest. Because of this, some farms in the autonomy were forced to cancel contracts and send the sad excuses for helpers back to their native land early. Nonetheless, the oblast agricultural administration assures us that in the majority of cases, bringing in foreigners is well justified. At least as far as money is concerned. Certain farms have been able to obtain up to R50 million in profit through the Chinese--a ponderable alternative to bank credits borrowed at 213 percent interest, which is still not available to all... But cautions are being sounded today as well: Excessive enthusiasm for foreigners might destroy our own peasant labor. Seasonal workers live day to day--it is important to them to achieve a result right now. But no matter how impressive the result, the main problems of the Russian agrocomplex over the long term will not be resolved by virtue of Chinese labor. Finally, is it not strange to be finding jobs for unemployed foreigners when our own out-of-work people have nowhere to go? Arguments that "our own" are not offering to help and are showing no initiative are hardly legitimate. No one has yet summoned them to the fields; no one is training or organizing them. But the oblast administration labor department believes priority will soon be confirmed for the Russian unemployed worker. Even if only through licensing: Farms and enterprises situated in the so-called manpower-surplus regions are about to get their marching orders. This, incidentally, is also a requirement of the federal authorities.
