[Mojaddedi] I do not deal with Rabbani at all, nor do I recognize the government as a legitimate government. When Nawaz Sharif was prime minister of Pakistan, he made his well-known initiative. So we, representatives of all Afghan organizations, met and secured a solution. Then we went to holy Mecca and swore on the Koran that we would implement it. Then we went to Tehran. When I signed the agreement, I made it a condition that Rabbani's presidential term should not last more than four months. And I said that legislative elections should be held. But Rabbani has abandoned all these obligations and imposed himself as president for all this time through his organization only and against the will of all the other Afghan factions. I would like to say once again that Rabbani's government is illegitimate, I do not recognize it, and I cannot deal with it. Rabbani tried to offer the organization I lead two ministerial posts in his present cabinet but I turned down the offer. [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends in two and a half months and he does not resign, what will happen? [Mojaddedi] There is nothing except war; there is a war raging now, and it will continue. [Qallab] There is a cease-fire in Kabul at present? [Mojaddedi] It lasts for an hour or two, a day or two -- which is futile. The cease-fire was agreed in Kabul but the war has continued in many other provinces. [Qallab] It is clear that Rabbani will not resign, nor will Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. So what are you going to do? [Mojaddedi] The war will continue. [Qallab] For how long? [Mojaddedi] Until they are forced to relinquish power. I tell you here that they cannot last long, as they are in a weak position. They have been moved out completely from the northern provinces of the country. They have been eliminated completely. Therefore, if they are moved out of the part they control at the moment, they will be finished completely. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Whom does Iran support in this war? [Mojaddedi] Iran supports no one. If it supports anyone, it will support the Shiite group (al-Wahdah Party). These people are poor people and facing numerous problems. [Qallab] Is there any thought of widening the alliance between Abdul Rashid Dostam and Hekmatyar? [Mojaddedi] As far as I am concerned, I am in this alliance. There is a shura council for these people, and the organization I lead is represented in this council. And I support their moves. [Qallab] Abdul Rashid Dostam was minister in Najibullah's government, so why do you ally yourself with parties that were communist? [Mojaddedi] That is wrong. Dostam was in Najibullah's government, but he discovered the truth and separated from and turned against it. Had it not been for Dostam's stance against that government, it would not have been possible to topple it, and it would have stayed for 10 more years. [passage omitted] [Qallab] It is said that a large number of "Afghan Arabs" have moved to Afghanistan, where they are now in camps to rehabilitate them and send them to the Arab countries to create conditions like those in Algeria and Egypt. Is that true? [Mojaddedi] That is an issue in which we are very interested. In fact, we are embarrassed when anyone asks us about it. Because over 15 years -- even though the Soviet aggression was very clear -- none of the Afghan factions committed any action against diplomatic missions abroad. We did not try to bomb any Soviet embassy. Nor did we try to assassinate any Soviet ambassador. We fought the Soviet Army occupying our country. But we did not commit any terrorist operation. Regrettably, immediately after the victory of the Afghan revolution some brothers -- and they are known -- opened camps for Arab volunteers, trained them, and then sent them back to their original country to carry out acts like those you talk about, like what is happening in Egypt and Algeria. I saw some of these camps with my own eyes. And there are still camps on which millions are spent in order to launch terrorist operations against Arab and Islamic states. [passage omitted] [Qallab] What is your opinion of what is happening in Algeria and Egypt? [Mojaddedi] I said that we do not interfere in others' internal affairs. I am against killing innocent people. It has nothing to do with Islam at all. I believe the proper thing is to focus on the Islamic call [al-da'wah al-islamiyah]. [Qallab] That means that you are against violence in Algeria and Egypt? [Mojaddedi] Yes, I am against violence. People should use logic and persuasion, not explosives.
