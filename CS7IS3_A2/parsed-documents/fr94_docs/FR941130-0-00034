FR941130-0-00034 FR941130-0-00003 In the interim final rule, the OTS substantially revised and codified its policies regarding the establishment of management recognition plans (MRPs) and stock option plans (SOPs) during the conversion process. The new provisions require that any decision to implement MRPs and SOPs after conversion be voted on and approved by a majority of the shareholders no earlier than the first annual meeting following the conversion, and that prior to implementation, all such plans be reviewed and approved by the Regional Director. The provisions also prohibit the use of conversion stock to fund MRPs, require that MRPs be awarded and stock options be granted only after shareholder approval is received and require that stock options be granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. The regulation also codifies the OTS's policies regarding permissible amounts that may be included in SOPs and MRPs formed within one year of conversion. Approximately 17 commenters recommended allowance of a reasonable amount of stock benefits at the time of conversion, rather than a flat prohibition. A majority of the 17 commenters stated that the level of stock benefit plans should be tailored to the size, health and performance of the association, the business plan objectives and needs, the size of the offering, and the specific contribution and tenure of management. One commenter suggested 1% for MRPs and 5% for stock options, subject to the normal five-year vesting period. Another commenter suggested allowing a small MRP amount at the time of conversion with the remainder reserved for future performance-based awards and a SOP that is structured so that the exercise price is based on an averaging formula or an indexed price. Four commenters supported the prohibition of stock benefit plans at conversion. Of eight commenters addressing the issue, six supported the requirement for shareholder approval of management plans. One of the six supported the delaying of implementation until approval is received and two commenters stated that shares should be allocated at the time of conversion but contingent on shareholder approval. One commenter requested a revision in the wording of the regulation to clarify that plans must be approved by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the securities of the issuer present, or represented and entitled to vote, at the meeting. Of ten commenters addressing the issue, two supported the provision that shareholder approval be at the first annual meeting, and eight requested that the timing aspect be revised to allow approval at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special. One commenter suggested that the regulation require that a meeting be at least two months after completion of the conversion. One commenter expressed concern for differences in flexibility with annual meeting dates for state holding companies and federal savings associations. One of the eight commenters stated that by waiting for the first annual meeting, awards are expensed based upon the fair market value of common stock on the date of the meeting which increases the financial accounting expenses for the institution. This same commenter also noted that the date the MRPs are implemented is inconsequential to officers and directors, because the financial benefit of the MRPs is in the full value of the shares, not in their appreciation as in stock options. Three commenters stated that associations should be given flexibility to obtain a reasonable and appropriate number of shares to fund stock plans through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued shares. Another commenter requested that the regional office review and act upon stock plans at the time of conversion, that no conditional approval be allowed, and that plans not acted upon within a certain time be deemed approved automatically. Consistent with the discussion in the preamble to the interim final rule, the OTS believes that while there are valid business reasons for thrifts to adopt stock benefit plans in order to attract and retain qualified management, these plans are now more appropriately implemented subsequent to the conversion and with shareholder approval. A waiting period allows shareholders to decide whether to permit dilution of their interests after reviewing management's performance. Moreover, the stock price stabilizes once the marketplace has sufficiently digested the financial data of the association. The interim final rule required that stock options be granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. The OTS has revised the interim final rule so as to require that stock options be granted at no less than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. This revision is consistent with the current practices and rules relating to the granting of stock options. The shareholder vote required by the final rule will be uniform for both savings associations and holding companies, i.e., the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting. 19 19 This voting requirement coincides with the voting requirement of Section 5 of 12 CFR 552.3, the Federal Stock Charter provision. As noted, it will apply to savings and loan holding companies formed in the conversion process that implement management stock benefit plans within one year following conversion.
