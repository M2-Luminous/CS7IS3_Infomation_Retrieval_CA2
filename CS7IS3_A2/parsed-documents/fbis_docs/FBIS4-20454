The RP-HPLC was able to effectively and clearly separate into two zones the anti-mammal neurotoxin (including anti-insect neurotoxin that attacks both mammals and insects) and the anti-insect neurotoxin which attacks only insects. The method was also used to purify five anti-insect neurotoxins which were then designated as BmK IT1, BmK IT2, BmK IT3, BmK IT4, and BmK IT5. The BmK IT1 was identified as a contracture anti-insect toxin and the BmK IT2 through IT5 were all flaccid paralysis anti-insect toxin newly identified by the following methods including toxin detection, amino acid component analysis, and N-terminal three-peptide sequence analysis. Results obtained from this experiment showed that the four flaccid paralysis anti-insect toxins were all alkaline and were all single chain polypeptides composed of 61 amino acid residues with isoelectric points between 8.3 and 8.5. Researchers found that positive electrical charge on the surface of amino acid residues of BmK IT2 molecule played an important role on biological activity of BmK IT2 toxin, because BmK IT2 molecule lost its toxicity when being treated with fluorescent labelling substance.
