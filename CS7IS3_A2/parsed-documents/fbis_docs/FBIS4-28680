FBIS4-28680 "dreas113_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 North Korea U.S., Followers Asked Not To Ignore `Warnings' U.S., Followers Asked Not To Ignore `Warnings' SK1206085794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0841 GMT 12 Jun 94 SK1206085794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["They Should Not Suspect Will of Korean People" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is now clamouring for "military attack" and "forestalling strike" upon the nuclear facilities of the DPRK, Japan declared that it would join the United States in its measure for sanction against Korea and some officials of the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are insisting on the inspection of two military objects. The anti-DPRK pressure campaign is being escalated by the United States and its followers over the nuclear issue in a bid to internationalize and politicize the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to put "pressure" and isolate and stifle the DPRK socialism, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed commentary today. Never should it go unnoticed that the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its followers are all the more undisguised, timing to coincide with the replacement of fuel rods in the DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on: Fuel rods are being replaced, preserving the technical possibility to make ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods at a time when our unique status is removed. We have done all we can in relation with the IAEA and the United States to settle the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. We could no longer overlook the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its followers. Therefore, we solemnly made clear our stand of principle toward them. Herein lies the meaning that if the United States takes the road of strong-arm policy, our road to go would be changed and we would be left with no other choice but to go over to the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. This is neither an empty talk nor a threat. We have not told an empty talk but practised what we once decided. We are now carrying into practice our declaration that we cannot stop the peaceful nuclear activities, even sustaining a great economic loss and posing a great danger to technical security. We did if we intended. If the United States and its followers continue to resort to the pressure row against the DPRK, ignoring our warnings, we would have no other choice but to put into practice our stand. The United States and the IAEA will be to blame for any consequence. The United States and its followers should not suspect the will of our people.
