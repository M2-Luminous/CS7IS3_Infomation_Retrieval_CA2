The communique points out, however, that if the final negotiations with Matra Marconi Space fail, negotiations may be resumed with the French state-owned Aerospatiale [National Industrial Aerospace Company], which was also a candidate. The new satellite, initially named Hot Bird Plus, will be delivered 27 months after the contract is signed and will be launched in the summer of 1996. It will join EUTELSAT II F1 in orbit as well as the next Hot Bird, which is scheduled for launching this year. Its expected lifetime is 12 years, EUTELSAT adds. Television programming services will be able to choose between two coverage zones, one in Europe from west to east--in which case the programs will be accessible with small antennas--and the other from Russia to the Canary Islands and the Gulf countries. This new satellite will operate on both the FSS (11.45-11.7 GHz) and the BSS (11.7-12.5 GHz) frequency band with linear polarization. Its position at 13� East is favorable for direct television, cable, and community antenna reception. Four EUTELSAT II and three EUTELSAT I satellites are currently active. They carry broadcasting channels for television, radio, telephony, and communications with businesses and moving vehicles. The EUTELSAT organization was officially established in 1985 and consists of the public and private telecommunications services of 42 countries.
