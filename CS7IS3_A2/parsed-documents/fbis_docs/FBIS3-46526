Saying "we cannot understand at all the prime minister's explanations because they sound unnatural and unreasonable," both Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] plan to intensively question, during the Diet session, the prime minister to reveal details of how he borrowed the 100 million yen and repayed the money afterwards. On the other hand, the prime minister submitted relevant documents and a letter of explanation to a council of the lower house Budget Committee on 15 December. Because of this, he plans to refuse demands from the LDP and JCP, saying that "groundless suspicion will be dispelled completely." Since the prime minister gave different answers to parliamentary interpellations, many members of the ruling parties are worried that the issue may develop into a scandal. It is possible that the issue of 100 billion yen may have fatal impact on deliberation of political reform bills should the prime minister fail to handle it correctly. It may also develop into an issue of whether he must resign or continue to remain in his post. Therefore, the prime minister's close associates are feeling a growing sense of crisis. Regarding the issue of 100 million yen, both the LDP and JCP are deepening their suspicion. A senior LDP member said: "It is a lie that he borrowed the money. The truth is that the money was an illegal contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. In short, he was given the money." The prime minister said, in the documents and during his responses to questions at the lower house Budget Committee, that he had borrowed the 100 million yen to buy an apartment in Tokyo and to repair plaster walls and a temple gate of his house, which is designated as a cultural asset, in Kumamoto. He also explained that he signed a loan contract in October 1982. However, he purchased the apartment house in Tokyo at the price of 75 million yen in July before signing the loan contract, and repair work started from six months to nearly one year after signing the contract. Both the LDP and the JCP are saying that "we cannot possibly believe the prime minister's explanations." Moreover, what invited fierce objections from both parties were six documents (all of which are copies and the originals were confiscated by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office) and a letter, which explains the contents of the documents. The prime minister submitted the documents to the Budget Committee, saying: "They were supplied by Sagawa Kyubin." Some of the documents are: 1) A copy of the loan contract signed between the prime minister and Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 6 October 1982. A column for the lender's name on the contract is left out blank; 2) A copy of a mortgage contract, signed in 1982, with blank columns for lender's name and date of signing. The contract holds a mortgage on the prime minister's villa in Yugawara-cho in Kanagawa Prefecture; 3) A copy of an unsealed receipt, which was issued when the prime minister returned 10 million yen to Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 31 January 1990; and 4) Copies of Sagawa Kyubin's written notices, dated 15 December 1982 and 28 March 1983, for interest payment schedules. They were addressed to the prime minister but an accountant's seal on the written notices was blacked out. The LDP suspects that they are forged documents, saying that "we cannot possibly believe that the receipts without seals, the written papers with blacked-out seals, and other papers are real accounting documents," (according to a senior member of the LDP Diet Policy Committee). On the basis of Clause 104 of the Diet Act, the party plans to call for a submission of the original documents to the lower house Budget Committee. At the same time, the LDP will press for summoning the prime minister's former Secretary Masatoshi Fukayama to the Diet to testify as a witness. Due to the prime minister's explanations, which change every day, people are deepening their suspicion. At the Budget Committee meeting, he repeatedly corrected his explanations regarding details of the loan repayment schedule and on repair of the plaster walls and the gate. The prime minister, when it came to a critical part, refused to answer questions, saying: "I do not remember the details because I entrust my office with the task of taking care of everything." Such responses at Diet interpellations give us the impression that the issue of the 100 million yen loan is a suspicious case.
