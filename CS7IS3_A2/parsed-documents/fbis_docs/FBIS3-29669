South Korea, however, cannot accept them because of the position of North Korea and Russia, said the official, adding that therefore the government is considering other steps to cope with them, such as turning to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR). "Many of those North Korean loggers who escaped Siberia logging yards had come in contact with the South Korean Embassy in Moscow and Consulate General in Vladivostok for permission to enter South Korea," he said. Those who contacted South Korean missions in Russia reached 100 to 150 so far, he said. The official said there are 16,000 to 20,000 North Korean loggers in Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, and hundreds of them are known to have escaped the logging yards and been roaming through Russia. He said that if Seoul accepted them, it is apt to offend North Korea and that Russia, too, is not interested in sending them to South Korea because of its relations with North Korea. "At the moment, the government is asking Russia to recognize the escapees as international refugees and ensure their safety and basic rights," the official said.
