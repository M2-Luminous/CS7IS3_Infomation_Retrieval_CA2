FR940721-2-00096 FR940721-2-00056 Lodging of Consent Decree Modification Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA'') In accordance with Departmental policy, notice is hereby given that a proposed Modification to Consent Decree with an Intervening Plaintiff and the Defendants in United States v. Raymark Industries, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 85&hyph;3073 (E.D. Pa.), was lodged on June 29, 1994, with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This proposed Modification to Consent Decree conforms the remedy for certain groundwater contamination affecting municipal drinking water wells in Hatboro Borough, Pennsylvania to the remedy chosen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') in its Record of Decision (``ROD'') to abate groundwater contamination at and under a Site located at Jacksonville Road, Hatboro Borough commonly referred to as the ``Raymark Site.'' The original Consent Decree was entered prior to EPA's publication of the ROD and required the Hatboro Borough Municipal Authority (which had been compensated under the Decree by Defendants' payments of $612,500) to perform pumping and treating of water at a location different than that later set forth in the ROD. Under the proposed Modification to Decree, Hatboro will remain responsible for performing work which ultimately will exhaust the $612,500 it received under the Decree, as well as interest earned on those funds. EPA will perform all other remedial measures, using Superfund money. The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree Modification. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to United States v. Raymark Industries, Inc., et al., DOJ Ref. # 90&hyph;11&hyph;2&hyph;12. The proposed Modification to Consent Decree may be examined at the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 615 Chestnut Street, 12th Floor, suite 1200, Philadelphia Life Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; the Region III Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 801 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; and at the Consent Decree Library, 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20044, 202&hyph;347&hyph;2072. A copy of the proposed Modification to Consent Decree may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree Library, 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Box 1097, Washington, DC 20044. In requesting a copy of the proposed Modification and accompanying Amended Work Plan (Appendix A to the Modification), please refer to the referenced case and enclose a check in the amount of $9.00 (25 cents per page reproduction costs), payable to the Consent Decree Library. Please enclose an additional $19.25 should you wish to order a copy of the ROD (Appendix B). John C. Cruden, Chief, Environmental Enforcement Section, Environment and Natural Resources Division.
