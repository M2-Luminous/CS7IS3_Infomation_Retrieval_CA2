Shanghai, China's largest city, lacks safe water supply and its main source of water, the tidal Huangpu river, is at high-risk, World Bank officials said. This is China's fourth freestanding environmental project supported by the bank. The bank is also involved in eight projects in water supply and sanitation in China. Of the loans to China last year, which totaled 2.5 billion dollars, nine percent is on environmental protection, the bank said. The bank's task manager for the project, Geoffrey Read called Shanghai "an economic engine of growth for China", which could help fuel the highest increase in gross domestic product in the world.
