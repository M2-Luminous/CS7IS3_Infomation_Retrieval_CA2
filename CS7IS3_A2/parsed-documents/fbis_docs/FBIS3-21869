This daily carried interviews with Bulgaria's "top three drug experts," Prof. Todor Stankushev of the Psychiatry Department with the Aleksandrovska Hospital in Sofia, Filip Lazarov, associate professor and head of the drug addicts clinic in Sukhodol (near Sofia), and Aleksandrina Nencheva, head of the National Drug Enforcement Service. "[Three] professionals clashed aspiring to the top office," KONTINENT comments. Drug abuse has not yet become a large-scale phenomenon in Bulgaria, Prof. Stankushev claims and goes on to say that most of his patients know each other. "The official figures we have set the number of drug addicts at 1,280, all of them registered at the mental hospitals," Ms. Nencheva says for her part. According to her the much-publicized drug-abuse boom is a stunt since Bulgaria has no efficient monitoring system in this sector. Mr. Lazarov, too, shares the view that the effective system for registering drug addicts is outdated. Surveys carried out by the Sukhodol clinic found that 23 percent of the school children in the major Bulgarian cities have tried some kind of drugs, be it heroin, glue or sedatives. "I myself believe drug addicts to be much more [than the official figures]," says Mr. Lazarov while Ms. Nencheva accuses him for using the official figures to conceal the actual proportions drug abuse has assumed in this country. The National Centre on Drug Abuse, which is to be set up, and the Oncology Hospital are placed on an equal footing, Prof. Stankushev says. "The Sofia Municipality, for example, has adopted a 1 million leva (about $25,000) drug enforcement programme setting 200,000 leva for awareness campaigns at a time when it faces a severe funds shortage preventing it from paying the wages to polyclinics medics," Prof. Stankushev also says. "Why my colleagues of the Sukhodol clinic spend the funds they get from sponsors for business trips and not for medicines," he goes on to say. [sentence as received] "We have established contacts with some 20 international organizations and there are interesting proposals for joint projects," Mr. Lazarov says. He threatens to set up a parallel private institution in case others are named to head the National Centre. The programme of the clinic envisages the setting up of a city centre with a department for nonconventional methods of work whose officers will seek to penetrate into drug addicts' communities. The National Drug Enforcement Service was set up to meet the commitments this country has taken under international conventions concerning drugs, Ms. Nencheva tells the KONTINENT interviewer. It is designed to organize and enforce nationwide control over the transportation of narcotic substances. "The quantity of narcotics passing transit through the territory of this country follows a persistent upward trend," Ms. Nencheva says. "Apart from the coordination between experts [of the different institutions] there is a clash and this is the reverse side of the medal," Ms. Nencheva says to sum up the current trends dominating the drug enforcement institutions in Bulgaria.
