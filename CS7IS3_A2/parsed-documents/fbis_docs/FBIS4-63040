The foundation called on political leaders to "study carefully and thoroughly all the possible consequences of this action and to abstain from hasty decisions". Corroborating their point of view, the authors of the released statement note, among other things, that participation in military blocs "perpetuates suspicion and interferes with the development of normal international relations". Full-blooded international partnership and cooperation, the document says, should be developed on a foundamentally different basis -- "on a realistic and effective policy of peace, on a new comprehension of the role and place of leading states in the world community". "Moreover," the eminent Russian economists and politicians stress, "the economic consequences of Russia's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would be burdensome for our country". "The reorganisation of the armaments industry will require huge spendings," the statement says, "because there are single standards and unified requirements to all the types of armaments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In fact, we shall have to re-equip our army with foreign weapons, drawing our own industry into a long and expensive process of reconstruction."
