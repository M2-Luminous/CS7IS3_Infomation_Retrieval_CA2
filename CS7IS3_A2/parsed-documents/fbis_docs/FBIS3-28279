This is a product of bargaining on interests between the ruling and opposition parties. Meanwhile, the first election to be conducted under the new system is not likely to come until next year even when the revised bills are passed at the next regular session of the Diet. Zone Apportioning At LDP's demand, the number of people to be elected from the single-seat districts was raised to 300 while reducing the number elected from the proportional representation to 200. The outcome will probably mean increased "reflection of popular will" and increased "possibility of choosing new government," but, for the LDP, this means less likelihood of the incumbent Diet members being excluded from hometown constituencies and being forced to "run in foreign countries" [constituencies]. As far as the coalition parties are concerned, it is clear that they will benefit if they join hands and put up only one joint candidate to counter a candidate fielded by the LDP. In future, it is possible that political world reorganization toward a two-party system will speed up. Once the reform bills are passed by the next regular session of the Diet, the focus of attention will shift to the apportionment of the single-seat districts. The prime minister will recommend seven members to the Electoral District Demarcation Review Council, and the members will be formally appointed with the approval by the Diet. The Review Council is expected to come up with its draft on apportionment of districts and to make a recommendation to the government within six months. Based on the recommendation, the government will draft the "Electoral District Law" and submit it to the regular session of the Diet next year. Enactment of the law is not likely to come until late next year. When the LDP's Kaifu government prepared its political reform package, it proposed giving three months for the enforcement of the law, but the Ministry of Home Affairs at present thinks such educational period is not necessary in view of the six-month period the Review Council will have to come up with its draft on the district apportionment. All that taken into account, the new election system will still not be ready until next year at the earliest. Proportional Representation The system adopted is a product of compromise between the government proposal to count proportional representation votes with the nation as a single constituency and the LDP proposal to count proportional representation votes on a regional basis with all metropolis and prefectures as separate blocks. The system divides the whole country into 11 blocks, which is the same number of blocks recommended by the Eighth Election System Review Council in 1990. For the LDP, this is an arrangement which enables its members, who will be excluded from single-seat districts [and will have to run on the proportional representation tickets], to maintain some "ties with their regional bases." With the blocks of the proportional representation having become smaller in size, larger parties have more to gain than smaller parties do. For smaller parties which could have gained more seats if votes for the parties had been counted nationally as a whole, this arrangment means a tougher hurdle to cross. The anticipated zoning of the 11 blocks and the number of seats assigned to them are as follows (based on the 1990 recommendation by the Eighth Election System Review Council): Hokkaido = 9; Tohoku covering Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akida, Yamagata, and Fukushima prefectures = 16; Kita-Kanto covering Ibaraki, Tochiki, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures = 21; Minami-Kanto covering Chiba, Kanagawa, and Yamanashi prefectures = 23; Tokyo = 19; Hokuriku-Shinetsu covering Niigata, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, and Nagano prefectures = 13; Tokai covering Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, and Mie prefectures = 23; Kinki covering Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, and Wakayama prefectures = 33; Chukoku covering Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi prefectures = 13; Shikoku covering Kagawa, Tokushima, Ehime, and Kochi prefectures = 7; Kyushu covering Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Oita, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Okinawa prefectures = 23. Corporate Donations While the original government-proposed bills sought to ban donations by corporations and business organizations to politician- representing agencies, the revision will allow each politician to designate one political agency to receive such corporate donations -- up to 500,000 yen a year -- even though all donations of more than 50,000 yen (at present, 1 million yen) will be required to be made public. It can be said that some progress has been made where transparancy of political funds is concerned. But there are said to be some "loopholes." For instance, if the names of existing politician supporting groups [goenkai] are changed into chapters of party youth departments or women's departments, these groups can continue to receive corporate donations. "Donations with strings attached" -- donations to political parties, specifying the politicians to receive the donations -- are also thought to be possible as are under the current law. Public Subsidies for Parties While it may be something the two top leaders did not intend, some new problems are arising with respect to the bills -- from the perspective of the spirit of, and compatibility with, law. One of them is that the justification for collecting public subsidies of 250 yen per head nationally -- or a total of 30.9 billion yen -- has become even more ambiguous than before. The government initially justified the collectiion of the subsidies, saying they will "take place of corporate donations." But now that corporate donations of up to a certain amount have been admitted, it is likely that demands for lowering the subsidies will rise. On the other hand, because vote counting in the proportional representation will be done on a regional basis, it will become difficult for small existing parties and newly formed parties to get their people elected. Consequently, it is likely that demands on revising the "impediment clauses" -- providing qualifications for political parties and requiring candidates to deposit 3 to 6 million yen in security [with the government] in order to prevent many splinter parties from arising -- will arise as well.
