Luck was on his side. He went to Washington uncertain how much longer he could insist on dialogue to resolve the nuclear issue. When he left Seoul, a nagging fear of war was spreading here and hard-liners were demanding action, not negotiations, against North Korea. The nuclear issue was on the brink of being tossed to the U.N. Security Council, which likely would have initiated steps for sanctions against North Korea. Then Pyongyang announced this week it would accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections -- after a one-year hiatus -- of seven sites. The announcement helped turn the mood around. South Korea and the United States confirmed during Han's visit that they would continue with dialogue. This stroke of luck eventually proved that the foreign minister's insistence on a diplomatic solution was the right choice. The "experience" and success gained should prove invaluable for the new administrations in Seoul and Washington, for whom the row was the first major hands-on encounter with the unpredictable North Korean regime. With a changed mood and heightened confidence, the foreign minister and U.S. officials sat down to chart their future course. They focused not only on deterring North Korea's nuclear development but on preventing Pyongyang's nuclear card from getting out of hand. Seoul and Washington's conclusion was to stick to their principles and seek a package solution. As far as principles, North Korea must allow unrestricted IAEA inspections and engage in meaningful dialogue with South Korea on denuclearization. To stop North Korea from prolonging the situation, the two countries agreed to resolve the nuclear problem in its entirety at the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks in exchange for improved political and economic relations. With their initial success and added credibility to trumpet, they must nonetheless begin anew their wrestling with North Korea. The sour note to Han's U.S.-Canada visit was the overshadowing of its original purpose -- strengthening relations with members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Han's visit to Mexico was canceled at the last minute, and his meetings with trade officials in Canada and Washington were played down in comparison to the nuclear negotiations. But the foreign minister was still able to register his country's concern that the regional trade agreement should not discriminate against non-members, asserting that South Korea wants to participate in NAFTA in the long run. Han and Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet agreed on a "special partnership" to cement bilateral trade relations. In Washington, Han conveyed Seoul's worries that any return of the U.S. Super 301 trade legislation could throw cold water on their economic ties. But the highlight, obviously, was the breakthrough in the nuclear impasse.
