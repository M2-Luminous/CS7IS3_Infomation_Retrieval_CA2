FR940404-2-00046 FR940404-2-00034 A second issue related to Asko's internal heater capability is the method to be used to measure the temperatures of the water used during the test. Whirlpool suggested that the wash water temperature should reach an equilibrium temperature prior to the start of the 10 minute wash time required in section 2.10. The Department does not concur with this suggestion because the existing test procedure energy consumption calculations are based on a temperature rise of the clothes washer inlet water. The Department does not consider a ``traditional'' clothes washer's heat dissipation of the heated water into the internal clothes washer components. The Department requires the temperature in the Asko's clothes washer be verified to ensure that it at least meets the specified temperature for warm and hot during the wash cycle; it does not require the clothes to maintain the wash temperature. This is a performance issue for Asko and regardless of the operating heating cycle the energy consumption will be reflected in the energy reporting. A third issue related to Asko's internal heater capability is the tolerance requirement for temperatures. Whirlpool contended that the existing test procedure is based on calculations for temperature rises and recorded volumes, whereas the Asko's machines are actually supplying the energy to heat the water. Whirlpool further contended that a larger temperature tolerance will provide a significant difference in energy requirements. The Department concurs with the intent of Whirlpool's comment and has tightened the temperature tolerances to reduce variability in energy reporting. The Department has changed the tolerance for the various temperatures from # 5 ○F ( # 2.8 ○C) to a maximum and minimum temperature value with only a 5 ○F (2.8 ○C) range. For example, the inlet water temperature requirement for water-heating clothes washers has been changed to a maximum of 60 ○F (15.6 ○C) and a minimum of 55 ○F (12.8 ○C). This reduction in the tolerance range will reduce energy reporting variability while maintaining testing flexibility. This type of tolerance will also ensure that a minimum temperature rise is tested. Speed Queen commented on the requirement for the inlet water temperature. Speed Queen proposed that the inlet water temperature be set to 50 ○F (10 ○C) in lieu of 60 ○F (16 ○C). Speed Queen's concern was based on the fact that the existing test procedure uses a 90 ○F temperature rise in the calculations. The Department does not concur with the Speed Queen suggestion. As indicated above, the Department is changing the amended test procedure to include a test at the hottest temperature setting which will be conducted on a temperature range which is greater than 90 ○F. In addition, the Department believes that a 50 ○F (10 ○C) inlet water requirement may be too burdensome. In many cases the inlet water would have to be cooled to obtain the 50 ○F (10 ○C) temperature. Asko's petition also addressed its design feature which will automatically control the water level in the clothes washer based on the clothes load. Whirlpool and Speed Queen both had concerns about the use of variable test loads to activate a maximum or minimum fill for testing. The concern was that the absorption of the test cloth will introduce an additional variable. Both Whirlpool and Speed Queen suggested using the existing test procedure's test loads (3 lbs. at minimum fill and 7 lbs. at maximum fill). The Department concurs with the Whirlpool and Speed Queen suggestion, however, the testing conducted will be representative of consumer minimum and maximum test loads and not the minimum and maximum test load capability of the Asko machines. The Department also realizes that this will cause the calculations for Asko's clothes washer total energy consumption at minimum fill to go up and total energy consumption at maximum fill to go down. The Department may revise the test load requirements for all clothes washers in the future to reflect consumer habits if usage data becomes available regarding automatic fill controls. Whirlpool also recommended that the Department change the requirement for the test load test cloth. Whirlpool recommended that a test cloth more representative of actual consumer habits be utilized verses the energy test cloth specified in section 2.6. The Department does not agree with Whirlpool's suggestion for Asko's petition because it is not unique to Asko's Petition. The test procedure requires the same test cloth for all front load machines. The Department recommends that this type of comment be presented during a ruling to revise the entire test procedure. The Interim Waiver had a revised requirement for the ``electrical energy supply'' to allow for the testing of Asko's clothes washers which use a higher voltage. In addition to the higher voltage change, the tolerance was changed from the existing test procedure requirement of `` # 2 volts'' to ``1 percent'' of the voltage. The Department believes that this increase in tolerance may be too burdensome, therefore the Department has changed the tolerance to ``1.7 percent'' of the voltage. The 1.7 percent value is equal to the existing procedure tolerance.
