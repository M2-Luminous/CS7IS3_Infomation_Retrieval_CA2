FR941006-2-00199 FR941006-2-00113 The applicant should describe the source of any matching contribution and the nature of the match provided. Any additional contributions to the project should be described in this section of the budget narrative as well. If in-kind match is to be provided, the applicant should describe how the amount and value of the time, services or materials actually contributed will be documented sufficiently clearly to permit them to be included in an audit of the grant. Applicants should be aware that the time spent by participants in education courses does not qualify as in-kind match. (Samples of forms used by current grantees to track in-kind match are available from the Institute upon request.) Applicants that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout the course of the project or on a task-by-task basis must provide a schedule within 30 days after the beginning of the project period indicating at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made. (See sections III.F., VIII.B., X.B. and XI.D.1.) E. Submission Requirements 1. An application package containing the application, an original signature on FORM A (and on FORM B, if the application is from a State or local court, or on the Disclosure of Lobbying Form if the applicant is not a unit of State or local government), and four photo-copies of the application package must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or by courier no later than May 10, 1995. A postmark or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. Please mark APPLICATION on all application package envelopes and send to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. Receipt of each proposal will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for receipt of applications will not be granted. 2. Applicants invited to submit more than one application may include material that would be identical in each application in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each application. The incorporated material will be counted against the 25-page (or in the case of package grant applications, the 40-page) limit for the program narrative. A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of each application. 3. It is preferable for letters of cooperation or support to be appended to the application when it is submitted. If support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than four weeks before the meeting of the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e. no later than October 17, 1994, February 1, 1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively) in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention.
