He will practically move over there to personally promote the approval of the economic stabilization program by senators and deputies. In an interview with O GLOBO, Cardoso says: On the day after the approval of a zero-deficit budget, we are going to create the URV [real value unit]. I am hoping to be able to do this by the end of January. Cardoso is aware that in undertaking such a marathon effort he will have to have lunch and dinner more than twice a day and will have to attend dozens of meetings. But he is not concerned about this. Not even the recurrence of back pains provoked by an old hernia ailment -- which, by doctor's orders, sometimes forces him to lie down -- causes him to lose his good humor and enthusiasm. [passage omitted] [O GLOBO] Congress will vote on the zero-deficit budget proposal, which is the pillar of the stabilization plan, at a time when a historic moralization campaign is being conducted within the Budget Committee. What effect could this have on the success of these measures? [Cardoso] Had it not been for the crisis that erupted within the Budget Committee and for the CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] that was subsequently created to investigate it, I would not have been able to revise the budget. Neither I nor the government would be able to make Congress discontinue its traditional habit of inflating the budget to the point of rendering the fight against inflation unfeasible. Had it not been for the crisis, we would have had no cards to play. [O GLOBO] Who else is obstructing the plan in Congress? [Cardoso] A group of deputies linked to municipal governments who believe the plan will be harmful to their municipalities. What motivates Congress more than the presidential succession, for example, is the election of each deputy. There is a group of municipalities, the poorest ones, that essentially depend on the Fund of Municipal Participation [in the national budget]. But we are negotiating it. One of the alternatives, suggested by Deputy Gonzaga Motta, is of liberating resources according to an idea inversely proportional to poverty. The poorer it is, the less resources it will hold in the fund. Another possibility: not touching the issue of municipalities to continue toward an alternative mechanism. What would it be? I suggested one: Today there is an income tax paid by public employees. That tax collected by the states should remain within the states; what is collected by the federal government will not be kept by the federal government but will be sent to the states and municipalities. It is just a matter of changing it. It represents approximately $1 billion. [O GLOBO] And what is unnegotiable? [Cardoso] Two things. The deficit must be zero. Today everyone already has adopted this idea. Point two: There is no way to end the mechanism of having a provisional fund within the Fund of Municipal Participation because the government would have no way of facing the essential issue, which is, for instance, that of paying for health, because it would have no funds earmarked for that. I must have 15 percent of the budget free in order to meet those expenditures. That is unremovable. But only the municipalities have resisted this idea. [O GLOBO] Then once the budget and the constitutional amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund are approved, will the government immediately create the URV? [Cardoso] Ah, it will be created the next day. But first there must be a decision by Congress so I will be certain I have a balanced budget and I will not need to resort to the banking system to ask for money. I hope to be able to do it by the end of January. The URV's creation is a simple thing. What is difficult will be implementing it. I believe society already is expecting it. Everyone is anxious to see the URV. [passage omitted] [O GLOBO] Does your position as a potential candidate for president of the Republic, which is taken independently from your will, upset the economic program? [Cardoso] Here there is a paradox: To implement that plan I need a certain political leadership; but if you have that leadership people will automatically say you are a candidate. Then it does disturb. But at the same time it helps because people realize that I have a stable relationship with the president of the Republic, that I am capable of negotiating with Congress, that I do not run away from debate with anyone. [O GLOBO] People want to hear a statement from you that you are not a candidate. [Cardoso] It is not a matter of making a statement. I am not taking any personal steps for a candidacy, nor am I organizing an economic policy based on a candidacy. I have never accepted the condition of a candidate, not even within my party, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It is a rather hasty decision to believe that in Brazil someone who is finance minister can be a candidate for president. First, because the minister experiences great pressure. He must say no all the time, and this makes him very unpopular. There is also a public responsibility: Can I give up the ship now? I am not saying I will not be a candidate because I can be a candidate for senator. My political rights already have been lifted once; I do not wish it a second time. There is no sense in someone keeping me away from the political game. [passage omitted]
