He gave assurances that the General People's Congress [GPC] would adhere to any decision made concerning this. During his meeting the day before yesterday with the members of the PFDC, the Yemeni president denied the news that had been circulated concerning Yemen's importing internationally prohibited weapons. He expressed his profound regret concerning the circulation of rumors such as these, which have no basis in fact. The president welcomed the decision arrived at by the PFDC and the Council of Ministers in the meetings recently held in Aden, and he expressed his hope that the transition to the application phase would be completed. He demanded that the PFDC rely upon clarity and frankness when issuing warnings and reprimands to any party that violates its commitments to execute these decisions. The Yemeni president also demanded that the members of the committee not be partial to any party. He called for the formation of a broad national front in order that no harm be brought to the country and its unity and in order to prevent breakdowns or security-related, political, or economic disturbances. AL-SHARQ has learned that the Yemeni president has declared his readiness to represent the GPC when dealing with an investigative committee concerned with the importation of prohibited weapons. The sources said that the Yemeni president set next Tuesday, 5 April, as the date for having Salim Salih, a member of the Presidential Council, come to attend the meeting of the Presidential Council set by the PFDC. If he does not attend, then the PFDC will issue a statement to the nation concerning the matter. The sources said that the Yemeni president guarantees protection for the leaders of the YSP if they wish to return to Sanaa, and the matter of security has prevented them from doing so. In addition to this, the YSP yesterday announced the return of 10 of its former leading members who had been removed from the ranks of the party after the bloody events of January 1986. All of these 10 leaders were supporters of 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, the former president of South Yemen.
