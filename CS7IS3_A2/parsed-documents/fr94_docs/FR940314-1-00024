FR940314-1-00024 FR940314-1-00007 Interservice Sharing The radioastronomy service (RAS), the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARS), the instructional television fixed-service (ITFS), a variety of terrestrial services, and industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment all operate in portions of the bands allocated to MSS or in adjacent bands. The Committee studied the potential for interference between MSS and these services. The Committee, which included an RAS representative, reached a consensus regarding MSS&hyph;RAS sharing. These recommendations, which form the basis for the Commission's proposed rules (§25.213(a)), establish fixed radius protection zones around the sixteen radio astronomy sites in the United States and set technical requirements for MSS downlink transmissions. GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, is operating in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band pursuant to International Radio Regulation RR 732. MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection from stations operating under RR 732. During the Negotiated Rulemaking, the FAA indicated that it sought to use GLONASS in conjunction with the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide aircraft ground approach and terminal communications. The Committee determined that MSS can coexist with GLONASS now, but if GLONASS were used as proposed by the FAA, the GLONASS/MSS interference problems at 1610&hyph;1616 MHz would be unresolvable. The Committee proposed that GLONASS be moved below the 1610 MHz band or, in the alternative, that U.S. reliance on GLONASS be lessened or eliminated. Both inter-agency and international negotiations have been initiated on this issue. We are encouraged that even if GLONASS is used for aircraft approach communications, it will be moved to frequencies below 1610 MHz. The Committee's proposed rules regarding e.i.r.p. limits pursuant to RR 731F and limitations on the use of MSS terminals on aircraft fall within accepted international standards and are set forth for comment (proposed §25.213(c)). The Committee also suggested a variety of solutions to the likely interference problems between MSS and other services, ranging from relocating existing licensees (e.g., ``grandfathered'' terrestrial stations operating in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band) to imposing stricter suppression requirements on transmissions in adjacent frequency bands (e.g., ITFS stations operating above 2500 MHz). However, these interests were not represented on the Committee, nor were the interests of ISM operators in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. In these cases, the Commission does not believe that it can propose sharing rules without developing the record more fully. It therefore requests comment on the interference environment and possible solutions from affected operators. Feeder Links Since the fixed-satellite frequencies to be used for LEO MSS feeder links may also be used by GSO satellites, the Committee studied the sharing potential between LEO and GSO satellites. It concluded that sharing was feasible. The Committee also studied the obligations of the United States under RR 2613, which essentially requires a LEO operator to cease operations when unacceptable interference is cause to a GSO system. To afford LEO operators some protection, the Committee suggested that the U.S. seek international agreement that RR 2613 will not be invoked to require a LEO operator to terminate transmissions unless: (1) The affected administrations reach agreement as to a level of ``accepted interference,'' (2) the LEO system is operating in excess of these levels, and (3) the excess interference is caused by the LEO satellite's failure to maintain sufficient angular separation between the satellites. The Commission accepted the Committee's analysis that sharing between LEO feeder links and GSO systems is feasible with coordination. Further, the Commission agrees with the Committee's interpretation of RR 2613 and has already begun to explore, in international forums, issues relating to international coordination of and protection for LEO system feeder links. Several applicants request feeder links in the 5/6 GHz frequency bands (C-band); other request the 20/30 GHz bands (Ka-band). The FAA opposes feeder links at 5 GHz, arguing that feeder link operations would be incompatible with its intended use of the band for new navigation aids. In a related Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the Local Multi-point Distribution Service (CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297; FCC No. 94&hyph;12) 59 FR 7964, February 17. 1994 adopted the same day as this Notice, the Commission proposes to conduct a negotiated rulemaking to assist it in assigning the 27.5&hyph;30.0 GHz frequency band. It expects, in the context of that proceeding, to be able to identify sufficient spectrum to satisfy 1.6/2/4 GHz MSS operators. The Commission will, however, continue to pursue feeder links at 5 GHz and will allow applicants to incorporate these bands or other bands if they become available. Intersatellite Links Motorola's proposed system system includes intersatellite links in the 23.18&hyph;23.38 GHz band. The Committee concluded that Motorola's use of this band would be compatible with other operations in the band. The Committee's recommended rules regarding intersatellite service frequencies, coordination with government agencies, and sharing criteria are contained in proposed rule §25.279. Service Rules Regulatory Classification The 1993 Budget Act requires that the provision of space segment capacity directly to commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers be treated as common carriage. However, the Act gives the Commission the discretion to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity to CMRS providers should be treated as common carriage. (Most of the pending applicants propose to offer service through resellers.) The Commission tentatively concludes that 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS offering will, in most cases, fall within the definition of CMRS. The Commission requests comment on whether 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station licensees making satellite capacity available to CMRS providers should be required to operate as common carriers. Specifically, the Commission requests comment regarding whether there may be any public interest reasons to impose a legal compulsion upon 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS operators to serve the public indifferently, and whether a decision to exempt operators from common carriage requirements will allow them to engage in unreasonable or anticompetitive practices. The Commission recognizes that requiring common carriage may limit the amount of foreign participation in these inherently global systems, potentially impeding international coordination of these satellites. The Commission requests comment on the extent to which applicants are seeking foreign investment and the extent to which a common carriage requirement may impact their plans. The Commission also requests comment regarding the likelihood that 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station capacity will inherently be offered as an indifferent holding out to the public. System License and License Term The Commission also proposes licensing and service rules (proposed rules §§25.143(a), (c) and (d), 25.120(e), and 25.143(e) and (g)). These include blanket licensing for the space segment, a ten year operating license that begins to run when the first LEO satellite is launched, authority to replace older satellites as they are retired, a filing window for next-generation system proposals, system implementation milestones, and an annual reporting requirement.
