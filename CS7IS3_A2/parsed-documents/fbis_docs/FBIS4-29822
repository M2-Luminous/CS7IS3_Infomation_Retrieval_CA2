The results belie a general mood that the country's economy is not performing as well as earlier expected as the inflation figure is much higher than projected and investment has slowed. The stock market, in particular has posted sluggish trading activity since the beginning of the year, when the SET [Stock Exchange of Thailand] Index plunged from its peak 1,700-point level to the current level of 1,350 points. The market's bearishness was partly attributed to the country's continued political paralysis. Mr Aphisit said after the Council of Economic Ministers meeting that the overall picture of the Thai economy during the period was favourable as exports, investment and tax collection were in good shape. Inflation was within manageable limits at 4.8 percent, but Mr Aphisit said that by the end of this year, the annual inflation rate should not exceed the government target of 4.2 percent. "We are trying to control inflation and if necessary, monetary measures may be initiated to bring inflation to within 4.2 percent for 1994. There is now a tight liquidity problem in the financial system because banks have lent much more than deposits mobilised. Apparently, investment is improving," he said. During this period, a total of 362 projects valued at 144,635 million baht had sought promotional privileges from the Board of Investment, representing a fair increase in terms of projects and amount of investment to be made, compared to that of the same period of the preceding year when there were 228 projects applying for such privileges. Mr Aphisit did not give the exact figures on how much those projects would invest but said main investment was in the construction and oil business and that Japanese investment during the period doubled that of the same period in the preceding year. Applications for setting up new factories in the provinces during January-May rose 74 percent over those in the same period last year. Again, Mr Aphisit did not give the details on the figures. He said overall tax collection by the Government during the period rose 15.6 percent, implying that economic growth should reach the 8 percent target. Thai exports in the first five months this year increased 21.4 percent over the same period last year reaching 421,800 million baht --accounting for 39.6 percent of the country's export target forecast at 1,065,000 million baht, according to Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap. Mr Chaiyot, who quoted the Business Economics Department's preliminary figures, said exports in the first five months totalled 421,800 million baht, up 21.4 percent from last year's 347,567.8 million baht. He said imports increased 10.1 percent from the same period last year to 519,600 million baht. The imports increased at a smaller rate because the country had imported crude oil instead of refined oil. Therefore, the trade deficit in the first five months decreased by 21.3 percent to 97,800 million. The country's trade deficit in the first five months last year was 124,318 million baht. Mr Chaiyot said agricultural exports reached 72,000 million baht, up 16.4 percent over last year, while industrial products increased 19.7 percent to 284,200 million baht. The major markets were still the traditional ones, including the United States (up 11.8 percent), Japan (up 36.1 percent), ASEAN (up 61.2 percent), particularly Singapore. However, exports to the European Union increased by only 3 percent due to the slow economic growth in the union, particularly in Germany. Mr Chaiyot said Thailand had diversified its exports to other regions which have great potential, including Indochina (up 54.6 percent), the Middle East (up 8.4 percent), Eastern Europe (up 5.2 percent) and Australia (up 4.7 percent). Garments were the largest export item valued at 36,500 million baht, up 3 percent from last year. The small growth was attributed to problems exporting to the United States due to the delay in the extension of a bilateral agreement. The second largest export item was computers and parts totalling 31,100 million baht, up 24.4 percent. The third largest item was frozen shrimp totalling 19,000 million baht, up 50.9 percent over the same period last year. For the period, Thailand exported gems and jewelry worth 18,000 million baht (up 4 percent), rice worth 16,900 million baht (up 42 percent), integrated circuits worth 16,800 million baht (up 20.7 percent), rubber worth 13,382 million baht (up 13 percent), plastic products worth 13,000 million baht (up 43.4 percent), shoes and parts worth 11,950 million baht (up 5 percent) and canned seafood worth 11,000 million baht (up 26 percent). Mr Chaiyot said it is likely that the country's 1994 exports will be higher than the target of 1,065,000 million baht as the Government promotes exports by setting more trade centers and commercial counsellors' offices abroad.
