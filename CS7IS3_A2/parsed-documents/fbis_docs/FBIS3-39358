The trade talks between the two countries had failed. Period. That was it. There were no veiled declarations to give the impression that the failure was less radical and brutal than it appears. They would rather have no agreement than yet another bad compromise whose negative consequences would only come to light later, to everybody's disadvantage. Trade disputes are not an exceptional phenomenon. However, it is something else if the numbers one and two of the world economy are seen fighting in public. And the fact that no attempt was made to obscure the disagreement indicates that far more is at stake than a dispute over a few percentage points in import or export quotas. The dispute marks a not unimportant shift in the relationship between Washington and Tokyo. It has escaped no one's notice that the U.S. Government has taken a more assertive attitude and is being consistent in its policy since the election of President Clinton. This attitude is helped by the economic recovery now taking place in the United States. Clinton's predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, also paid attention to U.S. trading interests, but avoided such open confrontation. The scene when President Bush fainted in January 1992 during an official banquet in Tokyo is still fresh in the memory. At the time, Bush was in the wake of leading businessmen seeking to beg a greater share in the Japanese car and car-component market. The collapse was felt to be virtually symptomatic of the United States's lack of decisiveness toward Japan in that period. Back then possible differences in opinion were traditionally brushed under the carpet at the last minute with hastily cobbled-together compromises which were sufficiently unclear to allow everyone to save face. Just as traditionally, the explanation of such agreements given by both parties differed, which gave rise to new tensions. President Clinton is playing a more open and much harder game. He is demanding cast-iron guarantees rather than vague promises which produce nothing in the end. Since 1980 the United States and Japan have made no less than 29 agreements to settle bilateral trade disputes. Most of them remained dead letters and did nothing to prevent the Japanese trade surplus with the United States increasing to $50 billion last year. The international context also offers President Clinton more room for maneuver. The end of the Cold War means that the U.S. President can concentrate his attention on other domains rather than pure security objectives. It has now been shown that he is not afraid of confrontation with Japan in this new approach. Some were assuming that the U.S. President would do everything possible to stay good friends with Japan, because they have geographical frontline positions with North Korea. The chill in relations between Washington and Tokyo comes at the very time when both capitals are keeping a close eye on North Korea's attempts to become a nuclear power. The hard attitude of the United States toward Japan indicates that Washington attaches more importance to its national industry than to spotless relations with an ally in its policies on North Korea. In this sense it is obvious that the failure of the trade talks between the United States and Japan has far wider implications than simple trade policies.
