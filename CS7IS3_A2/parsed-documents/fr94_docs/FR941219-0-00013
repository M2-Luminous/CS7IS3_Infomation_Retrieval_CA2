FR941219-0-00013 FR941219-0-00008 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 263 [Docket No. R&hyph;0855] Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors) is amending a provision of the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure adopted by the Board. The final rule is intended to clarify that the rules' provisions relating to ex parte communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, the amendment would clarify that the ex parte provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the Administrative Procedure Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 18, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Katherine H. Wheatley, Assistant General Counsel, Legal Division (202/452&hyph;3779), or Ann Marie Kohlligian, Senior Counsel, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation (202/452&hyph;3528). For the hearing impaired only, Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD), Dorothea Thompson (202/452&hyph;3544). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules) (56 FR 38048, Aug. 9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024, Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The Board of Governors is amending one aspect of the Rules relating to ex parte communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other agencies have proposed or are considering proposing a similar amendment (FDIC, 59 FR 60921, Nov. 29, 1994; OTS, 59 FR 62354, Dec. 5, 1994). The Board of Governors issued this amendment as a proposed rule on November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60094, Nov. 22, 1994). It is now adopting the rule in the form proposed. Currently, ยง263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from making an ex parte communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991) explained that the proposed rule regarding ex parte communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding ex parte communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA itself. The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's ex parte communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] outside the agency '' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis added). Intra-agency communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel. The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, did not mention the separation of functions concept explicitly, and appeared to apply the ex parte communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the ex parte communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result.
