Mr. Ray met the U.S. assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, Mrs. Robin Raphel, in Washington yesterday and discussed in detail President Clinton's letter to a Democratic Congressman, Mr. Gary Condit. The External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi had sharply reacted on Sunday [23 January] to the development which comes in the wake of the series of negative pronouncements by the U.S. authorities on issues like Kashmir, human rights, and Punjab. Meanwhile, a U.S. official in Washington has said that Mr. Clinton's letter did not contain anything anti-Indian or sought to encourage secessionist elements. According to the official Mr. Clinton had mentioned that the situation in Punjab has improved and that there have been regional elections leading to the restoration of the local government and the level of violence in the state also declined. A United States delegation has appreciated the working of the National Human Rights Commission set up in the country recently. A 12-member delegation consisting of two associate justices of the United States Supreme Court, four U.S. circuit judges, and five lawyers visited the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi today. The chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Ranganath Mishra, informed the visiting dignitaries that the commission will soon publish its own regulations and make people aware of its working procedures. The delegation has specifically appreciated the commission for taking suo moto cognizance of human rights violations and for its steps to order independent inquiries into various cases. The Punjab chief minister has criticized President Clinton for his comments. Talking to our Chandigarh correspondent, Mr. Beant Singh, said the U.S. President is ill-informed about Punjab. The Sikhs are fully enjoying democratic rights in the state. Reacting to the alleged violations of civil liberties, the chief minister said he himself and the majority of the elected legislators, sarpanchas [head of village council], and panchas [village council member] in villages are Sikhs and the state government is curbing militancy and not civil rights. Mr. Beant Singh invited the U.S. President to Punjab to see for himself the smooth running of democracy in the border state.
