This move was consistent with Sudan's tenancy and leasing laws. The ministry stressed to the Egyptian ambassador that these actions were taken within the framework of Sudan's tenancy and leasing laws and that the issue should not be misinterpreted and politicized. The ministry also emphasized that no one had been expelled, contrary to the contents of the two above-mentioned statements. The ministry told the ambassador that the Egyptian media had treated the issue with exaggerated sensitivity and had accused the Sudanese Government of tackling the issue in a manner which went against international norms. The ministry stressed that the Egyptian side's issuance of two different statements on the same subject, which were distorted, was inconsistent with international and diplomatic norms.
