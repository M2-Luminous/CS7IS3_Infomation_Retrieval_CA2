This aggression, which was designed to take my life and the lives of the peace-loving citizenry and to seize power by force, failed despite its violent and cruel nature. It came at a time when our country had embarked on the second phase of putting our democratic institutions in place and when preparations toward the parliamentary elections are going ahead, involving all the political forces, in collaboration with French and German experts of the international monitoring committee and the National Electoral Commission, as well as with the effective commitment of our country. This attempt to topple democracy cannot but arouse the strongest disapproval and indignation of the Togolese people, who have already suffered untold hardship and deprivation during this transitional period. The failure of this aggression demonstrates once more that no one can swim against the tide of destiny. In 1977, at a time when nothing could constitute a rebellion against the Republic, mercenaries recruited from outside attempted to overthrow the government with the complicity of a handful of countrymen. This military coup failed because it was not aimed at preserving the interests of the people. In 1985, for the first time Lome was shaken by a series of explosions which claimed innocent lives and caused considerable damage. These criminal attacks were the early beginnings of a heavily armed terrorist commando operation launched from outside on 23 September 1986 to invade our capital, invade the broadcasting house, eliminate me, and seize power. This attack, which unfortunately claimed more lives, failed once more with the help of God, who cannot bless an undertaking inspired by personal ambition, hatred, and vengeance. Hardly 10 months ago, on 27 March 1993, with the complicity of a few officers, some armed groups who also came from outside managed to penetrate the Togolese Interarms Regiment camp and shot rockets point blank at my residence, aiming particularly at my sleeping quarters. They did not hit me, but they succeeded in murdering in cold blood two of my closest companions in arms. This new attack, contrary to the interests of the people, has failed once again. The painful events that we have just witnessed on 5 to 6 January follow the same pattern. They did not give those responsible the expected results, despite the large deployment of men, arms, ammunition, and logistics. Dear compatriots, the tragedy which has just befallen our country should be an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the destiny of our nation, which God has never wanted to abandon into the hands of those who only seek its destruction. This attack came just at the time when the Togolese people, who have suffered from three years of stormy transition, begin to entertain some hope again with the resumption of economic activities and payment of salaries. The aim of the terrorist action was to prevent free expression of the people at the legislative elections. Those who launched the attack have demonstrated, by so doing, their refusal to accept the democratic principles that they claim to defend. Just as they tried on the night preceding the presidential elections to embark on a terrorist action to prevent the elections from taking place, they are trying to disrupt the legislative campaign with violent actions. Togo leaves the international community to judge this behavior. Our country is involved in an irreversible democratic process. We are leaving no stone unturned for the legislative elections to take place in total freedom and transparency. Nothing will deviate our course from this objective. Today we must thank God for having saved us from this new trial and for having, once again, saved the Togolese people from chaos. I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the security forces and services for the courage, determination, sense of duty, rapidity, and efficiency that they showed in returning the fire that resulted in the routing of the attackers. I would also like to thank the residents of Lome and its vicinity for remaining cool, calm, and disciplined during this severe ordeal in accordance with government's instructions calling on them to stop and resume work for security reasons. Furthermore, I especially want to commend and thank those who, in various manners, contributed to restoring social peace, which is indispensable for our development and welfare. Finally, on your behalf, on that of the government, and in my own name, I would also like to present our most heartfelt condolences to the innocent victims' families and wish a prompt recovery to those who were wounded during this aggression. Dear compatriots, a new year has begun. I hope that it will be for each of you a year of peace, health, fraternity, forgiveness, and love. May the democratic process continue to its end in dialogue, consultation, tolerance, and acceptance of each other. May our youth steer clear of those trying to divert them from the right path and earnestly continue their studies and professional training in order to give their best to our country. May those possessed by hatred and craving for revenge get rid of their resentment, abandon the path of violence, and utilize their intelligence and as their know-how to build our dear Togo a bit more each day instead of destroying it, as it remains the only treasure that we will bequeath to future generations. May this new year further bring us together each day to serve our country. Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!
