Speaking at a weekly news conference Ataman recalled Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's words as saying Turkey has incurred a loss of 20 billion U.S. dollars because of the Gulf crisis. `This loss continues to gradually grow,' he said. Ataman said there is no difference of opinion that the Turkish-Iraqi pipeline should be rescued as this important pipeline remained idle there. `The problem is how this rescue will take place within the United Nations system,' he said. He said Turkey worked on several alternatives to rescue the pipeline. `We will continue our discussions with Iraq and our coalition partners on the issue,' he said. Ataman said Turkey's aim is to rescue the pipeline within the framework of existing principles and a technical operation. `We have no intention to circumvent the embargo,' he said.
