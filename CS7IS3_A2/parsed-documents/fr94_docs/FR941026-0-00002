FR941026-0-00002 FR941026-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 591 RIN 3206&hyph;AF88 Cost-of-Living Allowances (Nonforeign Areas) AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to increase certain cost-of-living allowance (COLA) rates paid to General Schedule, U.S. Postal Service, and certain other Federal employees in Kauai County, Hawaii; Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The final regulations also consolidate the two nonforeign COLA areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance area, delete obsolete Commissary/Exchange COLA categories in four areas, clarify definitions shown in one of the appendices, and remove from regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials are paid. These three locations are no longer territories or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area post differential program. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective October 26, 1994. Applicability Date: These regulations are applicable on the 1st day of the 1st pay period beginning on or after October 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Allan G. Hearne, Methodology Development Branch, Office of Compensation Policy, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415, (202) 606&hyph;2838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, certain Federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous States are eligible for cost-of-living allowances when local living costs are substantially higher than those in the Washington, DC, area. Nonforeign area COLA's are currently paid in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. OPM contracted with Runzheimer International to conduct living-cost surveys during the summer of 1993 in Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. At that time, Runzheimer also surveyed the Washington, DC, area, which is the base or reference area for living-cost comparisons. According to these surveys, the COLA rates should be increased in three areas and reduced in three other areas. However, a provision in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;141 as amended), bars OPM from reducing any COLA rate through December 31, 1996. Therefore, only the COLA rate increases are being implemented. The increases in COLA rates are summarized in the following table: COLA Rate Increases 1Allowance area/category 1Old rate(s) (percent) 1New rate (percent) County of Kauai, Hawaii All Employees 17.5 20.0 Territory of Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Commissary/Exchange 17.5 20.0 U.S. Virgin Islands All Employees 112.5/17.5 17.5 1Old rates for St. Croix and St. Thomas/St. John, respectively. In computing the new COLA rate, OPM made two changes relative to the indices published with the proposed rule. The changes were made to correct an error in one survey and to incorporate a methodological change recommended by one of the commenters on the proposed rule. Neither of these changes affected the COLA rates proposed in the Federal Register on May 26, 1994 (at 59 FR 27314). The error OPM corrected was the failure to price a homeowner insurance policy in Maui, Hawaii, that included coverage of damage caused by high winds. Correcting this raised the Maui index slightly. The methodological change made by OPM was to use the Goods and Services Component index as the cash contributions item index in the Miscellaneous Component. The effect of this change was a slight increase in the living-cost indices in all areas except Puerto Rico. The chart below compares the indices shown in the notice that accompanied the proposed rule and those used in this final rule. As noted above, none of these convert to a different COLA rate under the procedures prescribed in 5 CFR 591.206(b). Previous and Final Living-Cost Indices 1Allowance area/category 1Previous index 1Final index City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii: All Employees 122.90 123.32 Hawaii County, Hawaii: All Employees 109.63 109.82 Kauai County, Hawaii: All Employees 119.27 119.69 Maui and Kalawao Counties, Hawaii: All Employees 119.32 120.29 Territory of Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: Local Retail 122.25 122.67 Commissary/Exchange 120.81 121.14 Puerto Rico: All Employees 103.00 102.96 U.S. Virgin Islands: All Employees 117.81 118.01 In this final rule, OPM is also consolidating the two allowance areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance area. The two allowance areas were (1) the island of St. Croix and (2) the islands of St. Thomas and St. John. The new allowance area is titled ``The U.S. Virgin Islands.'' In future surveys, OPM will continue to survey living costs on both St. Croix and St. Thomas, but the data will be consolidated to represent the Virgin Islands as a whole. OPM is eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in Anchorage, Alaska; Fairbanks, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Puerto Rico. OPM is not eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in the Guam/Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) allowance area. According to the Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Federal civilian employees in the Anchorage, Fairbanks, Honolulu, and Puerto Rico allowance areas do not have access to commissaries by virtue of their Federal civilian employment. Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are payable only to Federal white-collar employees who, by virtue of their Federal civilian employment, have unlimited access to commissaries and exchanges in the allowance areas. Since Federal civilian employees in these four areas do not have access to commissaries, the Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are not payable in these areas. Accordingly, OPM is eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in these areas. In Guam/CNMI, on the other hand, DeCA says some Federal civilian employees have access to commissaries by virtue of their Federal civilian employment. OPM believes these employees also have access to exchange facilities. Therefore, OPM is not eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in Guam/CNMI.
