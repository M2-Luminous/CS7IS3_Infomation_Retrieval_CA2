If the U.S. actually suspends MFN for China under the pretext of "human rights," "it would have a very disruptive effect for the Pacific region," they warned. "As was already noted, trade with China is crucial for many economies. If economies were forced to choose, it could happen that it would be the United States that would find itself isolated and its actions widely condemned," the outlook said under the title "Risks in the Forecast -- the Greatest Anxiety." The outlook was released here this evening in conjunction with the 10th International General Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council which is being held here on March 22-24, 1994. "No one should want such a confrontation, so it is to be hoped that a satisfactory solution to the dispute can be found," the report further noted.
