State Oil Company of Azerbaijan [SOCAR] told Turan that Lukoil intends to develop this oil-field either in the framework of the consortium of western oil companies or independently. In exchange of that the Russian company is ready to give up its share in the consortium or to refuse its participation in the development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields together with western companies. In March 1994 Lukoil and SOCAR signed the agreement. Under the agreement, the Russian company has to get the share of 10 per cent from the participation in the consortium of western oil companies. Lukoil has to get one third of Azeri oil explored from two oil-fields. That time, official Baku did not conceal that this agreement signed with Russian oil company is of political character. "Kyapaz" offshore oil-field located 135-140 km to the coast, close to Guneshli oil-field. Its reserves total 25 million tons of oil. Local geologists drilled three wells on "Kyapaz". Two of them are gas-bearing and one is oil-bearing one. According to SOCAR's specialists, geological researches presently conducted are not sufficient to estimate reserves of this oil-field exactly.
