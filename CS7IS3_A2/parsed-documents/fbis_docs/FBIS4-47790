The Angolan peace talks being held in Lusaka were unproductive today. The government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators did not achieve anything. They are staying put on the modalities for the implementation of the second round of presidential elections. The mediators presented a new version, which the government and UNITA negotiating teams assessed this afternoon. Blondin Beye is doing everything to dissipate doubts and overcome the differences. So far that has not been easy. The next hours may be decisive. Meanwhile, a source close to the talks told our reporters here that Paul Hare, U.S. president's special envoy to Angola's peace negotiations, leaves Lusaka for Luanda tomorrow, where he will within the next few days meet with His Excellency Engineer Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic. It is presumed that the U.S. diplomat will report to President dos Santos on the results of talks held recently by the U.S. Administration and Congress in Washington.
