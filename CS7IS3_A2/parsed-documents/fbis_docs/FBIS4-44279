[passage omitted] In a comment earlier this morning, before meetings began on the second day of the summit, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said that "if there is no agreement today on one of the present candidates, others must be sought." During negotiations yesterday, Italy had been seen as the swing vote in an election that confronted "pro-Europe" forces (which the Belgian Dehaene would be expected to represent) and the so-called Euro-skeptics, led by the British. Italy, Martino explained, had "placed no personal or ideological vetos, just a methodological one" he said, referring to earlier reluctance to approve Dehaene as the result of Italy's "perplexity" because "a Franco-German initiative had been set in motion without prior consultation." The Italian Foreign Minister said that Britain's position was different, however. "The problem is a methodological one and Prime Minister Major says he's not ready to bargain on the issue." The question had seemed near to resolution late last night and early this morning, with much attention focusing on how Italian opinion would swing. The new government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which has presented itself as more "Euro-moderate" than previous administrations, was seen by some as forging a conservative, "Euro-skeptic" alliance with Britain.
