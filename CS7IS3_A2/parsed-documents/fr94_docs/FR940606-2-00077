FR940606-2-00077 FR940606-2-00055 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34125; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;41] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Limitation of Exchange Liability for Negligent Conduct May 27, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to limit the Exchange's liability in connection with its administration of proprietary indexes and products. Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the Federal Register on April 1, 1994. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33817 (March 25, 1994), 59 FR 15466 (April 1, 1994). The Exchange currently has listed for trading, or has received approval to trade, options on several broad-based and narrow-based stock indexes. 4 The Exchange represents that there is a great deal of work involved in the daily calculation and dissemination of these index values and while much of this work is automated, a substantial amount of manual input is still required. Human error, such as incorrectly inputting a symbol or index value, overlooking a corporate action, or inaccurately reporting the number of outstanding shares of a component of an index, can occur during the manual input of data which exposes the Exchange to potential liability. As options on more new indexes are introduced, the chances for human error increase, thus exposing the Exchange to an even greater risk of liability. 4 Examples of the broad-based indexes include the Eurotop 100, Institutional, Major Market, and S&P MidCap 400 Indexes. Example of the narrow-based indexes include the Biotechnology, Broker/Dealer, Natural Gas, and Retail Indexes. Currently, Amex Rules 902C and 1003 disclaim Exchange liability regarding the calculation or dissemination of any index value, and in the creation, redemption, and trading of Portfolio Depositary Receipts, respectively. These disclaimers cover errors, omissions, and delays resulting from any conduct beyond the reasonable control of the Exchange, and include acts of God, power or systems failure, or any error, omission, or delay in the reported price of an underlying security. The Exchange believes, however, that these disclaimer provisions are arguably ambiguous with respect to whether the Exchange remains potentially liable for damages caused by any human error or omission by an Exchange employee in connection with the performance of the Exchange's index responsibilities. In view of the increased potential for Exchange liability as a result of the Exchange's expanding role in the administration of new proprietary indexes and products, the Amex wishes to make clear that in addition to the areas specified in Rules 902C and 1003, the Exchange also disclaims liability for negligent conduct. The Exchange represents that the Amex, as well as other self-regulatory organizations, currently disclaim liability for negligent conduct associated with the dissemination of their market data to vendors, as well as generally in connection with the use of their facilities, except as they otherwise provide. The exchange believes that it is inappropriate for exchanges to bear the risks and liabilities associated with the use of such information and facilities. In the area of index administration, the Exchange represents that Standard & Poor's and all the other major index providers likewise routinely disclaim liability for any negligent conduct. 5 Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has a rule which is substantively similar to the Exchange's proposed rule change. 6 Finally, the Exchange acknowledges that Rules 902C and 1003 cannot be relied upon by the Exchange to limit its liability to non-members or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws. 7 5 See e.g., Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Rule 24.14. 6 See NYSE Rule 702(b). 7 See Letter from Bruce Ferguson, Associate General Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy, Amex, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 21, 1994. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5). 8 Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change provides the Exchange with virtually the same protection from liability available to the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to NYSE Rule 702(b). Additionally, because the Amex represents that the proposed rule change cannot be used to limit its liability to non-members arising from negligent conduct or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws, 9 the Commission believes that the proposal may serve to facilitate transactions in securities, while also protecting investors and the public interest. Specifically, entities such as the Amex may be encouraged to continue to calculate and disseminate index values so that derivative products based on these indexes, which are found to provide hedging or other economic functions, will remain available to investors. 8 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 9 See supra note 7. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 10 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;41), is approved. 10 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 11 11 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
