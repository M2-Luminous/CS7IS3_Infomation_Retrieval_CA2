[Berlusconi] The only important thing was my country. A great change has taken place here; as a result of the corruption scandals, the old political class has disappeared. After the Left won the local elections in December and no opposition formed, I felt compelled to intervene myself to fulfill Italians' desire for a new political power. [passage omitted] [Kadereit] But what do you, an entrepreneur, want to achieve in politics? [Berlusconi] We want to lead this country out of the state of real socialism in which it is still ensconced.... [Kadereit] But here the Christian Democrats were in power? [Berlusconi] We want the state to have less say in the economy. [Kadereit] You call the 45-point program of your Forza Italia "absolutely liberalistic." What does that mean? [Berlusconi] We believe in freedom, the individual, family, tolerance, and, of course, in competition and free market economy, that is, the values of the large European democracies. [Kadereit] But in southern Italy you have concluded an election alliance with the extreme right... [Berlusconi] The political and economic program of Alleanza Nazionale is absolutely liberal. I take any bet on that. [Kadereit] How compatible is a liberal program with the great concentration of power in your hand -- industry, media, now also political power? In other countries your appearance has certainly given rise to some concern. [Berlusconi] Other countries have a completely distorted picture of Forza Italia and of me. The majority of Italian correspondents abroad are part of a group that is fighting under the flag of the communists. You see, the idea that I would use my media for my own purposes as a politician is completely wrong. Without having any law tell me to do so, I have resigned from all functions within my Fininvest group. I am only the president of my soccer club AC Milan. [Kadereit] But your are still the sole owner of Fininvest. [Berlusconi] I tell you one thing: If I become prime minister I will, of course, keep far away from all decisions that might directly or indirectly affect my industrial group. And all Italians will have the opportunity to examine my behavior. [Kadereit] This sounds as if you expected to get the highest government office? [Berlusconi] The latest polls show that I predicted correctly that there is a desire for change. Forza Italia keeps rising in the polls. Italians believe in an entrepreneur like myself, who has worked in many sectors and founded companies everywhere, which became number one. According to the polls, I am by far the most appreciated politician. Asked "Do you trust Silvio Berlusconi?" 61.3 percent of the Italians say yes. [passage omitted]
