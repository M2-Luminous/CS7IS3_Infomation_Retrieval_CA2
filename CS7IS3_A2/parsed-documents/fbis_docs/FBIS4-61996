The base is located four kilometers from the nearest cow farm, away from people and can be well guarded, said Andres Rekker of the Defense League Fund, which owns one-third of the company. The concrete hangars at the base also meet the standards established for a military plant, he said. Two-thirds of the shares in the company belong to individual members of the Turi unit of the Defense League paramilitary corps. The issue of turning the base over to the company is expected to be under discussion at May 17 meeting of the government. Arbalett Ltd. already has made and demonstrated in a field test the serial parties of explosive packages -- used as substitute for hand grenades in military training. The company is set to assemble its first combat grenades soon and hopes to launch production of land mines in June or July. Metal shells for the hand grenades come from Erivasar, an Estonian company. A part of the materials necessary for the manufacture of grenades "is expected from a foreign country soon," Rekker said.
