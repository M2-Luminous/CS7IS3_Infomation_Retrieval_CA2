This phenomenon has spread far beyond Israel and has also affected the U.S. secretary of state and President. Before his meeting with King Husayn, Warren Christopher came up with an excellent explanation for delaying his Middle East visit: He could not have postponed his visit as he never planned to visit the region in June to begin with. If the secretary of state was telling the truth, it must be stated that all his peace advisers intentionally misled the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Even worse, is it conceivable that a politician who has committed himself to energetic mediation between Israel and Syria should take such a long break without planning his next trip to these countries? Some maintained that the eminent politician was forced to delay his trip to our region at the last moment because of the North Korean crisis. President Clinton said that Jimmy Carter visited Pyongyang as a tourist rather than as an official White House emissary. A day later, the former president said on television, however, that he routinely discusses sensitive issues, such as the invitation to visit North Korea, with the President. In fact, when President Bush asked Carter not to go there, he acquiesced, so it stands to reason that had Clinton asked nicely, the former Democratic president would not have turned him down. Whom are we to believe: Carter, who promised Kim Il-song and CNN that the sanctions have been frozen; or Clinton, who announced that the diplomatic effort to consolidate the sanctions will continue until President Kim translates his words into action? Meanwhile, Kim has won several more weeks to smuggle additional quantities of fuel waste for implementing his plan of turning North Korea into a nuclear bomb supermarket. Last month, Clinton warned that destroying any evidence regarding the removal of fuel from the reactor would destroy all chances of opening a third round of talks between the United States and North Korea. The evidence was destroyed, and Western intelligence can only guess the number of nuclear bombs hidden in the cellars of one of the most dangerous regimes in the world. Now, after Carter has returned triumphantly from the Korean peninsula, Clinton is talking about encouraging signs and hope for a new beginning in relations with North Korea. The tension regarding the sanctions has evaporated, and Clinton found the time to deal with his health reform and the Whitewater and Paula Jones affairs. Washington policymakers have been busy explaining that the only superpower in the world cannot be expected to solve all the world's problems. Strategists carefully explicated the nature of regional-ethnic conflicts, such as those in Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda. Regretting the bloodshed in all these places, they nevertheless maintain that the United States must conserve its strength for the real tests, such as threats to world peace. It so happens, however, that precisely during this trial period -- and what is more dangerous than the proliferation of nuclear weapons among mad leaders and extremist regimes -- this U.S. Administration is being exposed in all its weakness. It started with the difficulties in getting Japanese and Chinese support for the sanctions against North Korea after Kim mocked the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. After securing most favored nation status, Beijing threatened to veto sanctions against its communist neighbor. Japan announced it is bound by law to exhaust all diplomatic efforts. Even in South Korea, there is a growing opposition to escalation with the north. The alliance with the United States has always been one of Israel's most important strategic assets. An ally with the prestige of a paper tiger, however, does not contribute anything to its security. The Jordanian newspaper AL-RA'Y, for example, wrote this week that "North Korea has proven that a proud country can challenge the United States. Rational neighbors such as Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo can curb U.S. arrogance." If this is what the wimps in Amman are saying, what do people in Baghdad, Tehran, and Tripoli think? The entire world is following Clinton's pathetic maneuvers on the North Korean track. The loss of control over its nuclear armament efforts and the unsuccessful attempt to implement effective sanctions could harm the embargo against Israel's most dangerous enemies. It is to be hoped that Hafiz al-Asad will not question the reasons for continuing to pin his hopes on these people. Incidentally, during the Reagan administration's tenure, Jimmy Carter brought a message to Rabin from Damascus regarding al-Asad's desire for an arrangement. Rabin, who was defense minister at the time, shrugged off Carter's initiative. If it nevertheless transpires that Carter has managed to move Kim, it is advisable to send him instead of Christopher on the "unplanned" visit to Damascus. Even Carter, however, will find it hard to have an impact there.
