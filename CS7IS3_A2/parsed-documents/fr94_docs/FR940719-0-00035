These special local regulations are needed to control vessel traffic within the immediate vicinity of Waterside due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected vessel congestion during the Norfolk Harborfest 1994 activities. The effect will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of participants and spectators. effective dates: This regulation is effective for the following periods: 1:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., June 3, 1994 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., June 4, 1994 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., June 5, 1994 for further information contact: Stephen L.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Discussion of Regulation Norfolk Harborfest, Inc. submitted an application to hold Norfolk Harborfest 1994 on June 3, 4, and 5, 1994, in the Waterside area of the Elizabeth River. This area is covered by 33 CFR 100.501 and generally includes the waters of the Elizabeth River between Town Point Park, Norfolk, Virginia, the mouth of the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River, and Hospital Point, Portsmouth, Virginia. Since this event is of the type contemplated by this regulation and the safety of the participants and spectators viewing this event will be enhanced by the implementation of special local regulations for the Elizabeth River, 33 CFR 100.501 will be in effect during Norfolk Harborfest 1994. Norfolk Harborfest 1994 will consist of aerobatic demonstrations, an air/sea rescue demonstration, fireworks, lighted boat parade, and numerous other water events, to include a parade of sailboats and several boat and raft races. Because commercial vessels will be permitted to transit the regulated area between events, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted. In addition to regulating the area for the safety of life and property, this notice of implementation also authorizes the Patrol Commander to regulate the operation of the Berkley drawbridge in accordance with 33 CFR 117.1007, and authorizes spectators to anchor in the special anchorage areas described in 33 CFR 110.72aa. Dated: April 13, 1994. W.T. Leland, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11982 Filed 5&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
