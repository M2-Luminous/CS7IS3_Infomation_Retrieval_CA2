The Economy and Security Were the Main Topics of Discussion for the Leaders of 12 Countries"] [Text] The presidents and prime ministers who gathered last Friday in the capital of Russia, which chairs the Commonwealth's councils, examined more than 35 issues. But there were two main topics. First, ways to deepen the participating countries' economic integration. Second, the states' security and the guarding of the Commonwealth's external borders. According to Boris Yeltsin, it is a question, above all, of a package of decisions aimed at putting the Treaty of Economic Union into practice. "Economic Union is the fundamental principle of the Commonwealth," he emphasized. "The level of integration of the CIS countries as a whole will depend, in the final analysis, on progress in this area." Implementing this idea, the participants in the Moscow summit approved two decisions of fundamental significance. They set up the Economic Union Commission and gave the "green light" to the creation of a free trade zone. Commenting on these agreements, Vladimir Mashchits, Russian Federation minister for cooperation with CIS countries, reported that it had originally been planned to create a permanently functioning executive and coordinating organ of the Economic Union -- the Interstate Economic Committee -- and in this connection to abolish the Coordinating Consultative Committee. The heads of government and experts, however, agreed that it is necessary at present to preserve the CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee, but to set up a commission of professional economists under it. Its chief function is to shape the Economic Union's activity and ensure its efficiency. Vladimir Mashchits voiced the opinion that this commission might, in time, be transformed into the Interstate Economic Committee, which will essentially be a supranational organ of the CIS. A free trade zone is also being created to improve the effectiveness of cooperation. The agreements that have been signed provide, in particular, for the resolution of specific tasks at the first stage of the gradual abolition of customs duties, taxes, imposts, and nontariff restrictions in reciprocal trade. Thanks to this, our experts believe, trade will develop more intensively within the Commonwealth, and the single economic area will become more attractive to foreign partners. The financial sphere has not been overlooked either. Approval was given here to the concept of the Payment Union of CIS states, which makes it possible, in time, to arrange uninterrupted payments on the basis of the mutual convertibility of national currencies. It is proposed that participants in trade deals will independently decide on the forms of transactions, the currency of the contract price, and the currency of payment, while the states must ensure the convertibility of national currencies in respect of current operations. All the member countries of the Payment Union have pledged to adopt all the necessary acts and to pay the appropriate sums into the charter fund of the Interstate Bank of Multilateral Transactions before 20 May 1994. This bank will commence practical work 1 July. A new chapter has also been begun in the history of military-political cooperation. The approval for the statute on the Defense Ministers Council, which took into account the structural changes that have occurred recently, was important here. An information report by the chairman of the CIS countries' Border Troops Commanders Council on the state of cooperation in guarding the Commonwealth's external borders was heard. A memorandum was signed on the states' participation in guarding the external border in the Central Asian region. Agreements were reached with Georgia and Armenia on Russia's participation in guarding their external borders. A similar agreement with Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] was prepared. The appropriate departments were instructed to draw up founding documents on the creation of an aid fund for the Republic of Tajikistan. Even this short list of the problems resolved has shown that, to use Boris Yeltsin's words, "the Commonwealth states' integration aspirations are starting to be turned into practical deeds."
