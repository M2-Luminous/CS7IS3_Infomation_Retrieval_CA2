An article published today in EL FINANCIERO newspaper states that "the Clinton administration today (1 February) accused its Mexican counterpart of openly violating election laws and committing numerous human rights abuses." Washington's official position surprised local analysts because Mexico is an important U.S. trading partner. In fact, these two countries, along with Canada, are part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This trilateral agreement came into effect on 1 January, and it created the world's largest market, with more than 350 million consumers and $500 billion worth of worldwide investments. As for the apparent inconsistency of U.S. foreign policy by signing a trade agreement with a country it accuses of violating civil rights, State Department adviser Timothy Wirth replied that "nobody is perfect." EL FINANCIERO cited the U.S. opinion that "Mexico has indeed strived to eradicate the culture of impunity that surrounds its security forces through the reorganization of the Attorney General's Office and through its permanent support for the National Human Rights Commission." The Clinton administration also believes that the groups that took up arms on 1 January in Chiapas are made up mainly of Indians. This contradicts the official Mexican report that they are "lawbreakers linked to violent Central American groups." National observers recalled that the United States continuously violates the civil rights of Mexican citizens who reside there. At least two of them were executed in the last 12 months. Mexico thinks that its citizens who have been sentenced to death in the neighboring country are victims of judicial irregularities. It also believes that Washington violates other individual rights by encouraging racial discrimination against Mexicans. In September and October 1993 the White House staged a blockade to prevent Mexicans from entering U.S. territory, claiming that their presence promotes crime and theft.
