They have enough weaponry to seize half of Colombia, he said. [Begin Alvarez recording] The U.S. presence is a presence of foreign troops. Those people brought weapons, but Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo [commander of the National Navy Base at Malaga Bay] has their weapons stored in a container that is under the custody of a Colombian soldier. The admiral is executing strict orders based on an agreement, but a foreign Army is undoubtedly being lodged at a Colombian naval base; therefore, it was necessary to request the Senate's permission. [end recording] The great doubt of why prevails. What is the reason? What explanation will be given concerning a large weapons shipment under the custody of a Colombian Navy member if they reportedly came to cooperate with Colombia and build projects in the zone? [Begin Alvarez recording] I met with a commission from the Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating the case. I suppose the same will be done by the commissions being sent this week by Valle Department's assembly, Buenaventura's council, the Senate of the Republic, and many journalists from different media, who will witness how enough weapons to seize half of Colombia were transferred to build a small school and a health post.
