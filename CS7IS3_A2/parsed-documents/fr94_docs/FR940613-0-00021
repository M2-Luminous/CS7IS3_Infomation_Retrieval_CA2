FR940613-0-00021 FR940613-0-00008 The amendment to ยง141.4 implements these provisions. In the case of railway locomotives and freight cars which are exempt from entry on the basis that no duty is owed on them and they are classified in headings 8601, 8602, or 8606, HTSUS ( i.e. , without reference to subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS), no special evidentiary requirement is imposed because duty-free treatment is not conditioned on any special condition (other than duty-free status because of origin). In the case of railway freight cars which are exempt from entry by virtue of subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS, because there are conditions other than the absence of duty being owed on the freight cars, the amendment contains special evidentiary requirements. The requirements, concerning the time of production of the freight car and the duration of the stay in the United States of the freight car, shall be met by a certification (documentary or electronic), subject to Customs verification. In the case of the requirement to export the freight car within 1 year from the date of importation, in subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, the amendment specifically provides that a freight car admitted into the United States under this provision which is not exported within the 1 year period becomes subject to entry and the payment of any applicable duties. As authorized by the statutory provision, the amendment provides that locomotives and freight cars described in Additional U.S. Note 1 of Chapter 86, HTSUS, and freight cars described in subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS, may be released only after the importer has filed a bond on Customs Form 301, containing either the basic importation and entry conditions (19 CFR 113.62) or the international carrier bond conditions (19 CFR 113.64). Amendments to 19 CFR 123.12 are added concerning the entry of foreign locomotives and equipment in international traffic, to add references to the provisions implementing these provisions. Instruments of International Traffic Section 681 of the Act added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from formal entry procedures instruments of international traffic, such as containers, lift vans, rail cars and locomotives, truck cabs and trailers, etc. The provision also provided for the periodic reporting and payment of fees associated with the importation of such instruments of international traffic. The exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic is already provided for in the Customs Regulations (see 19 CFR 10.41a). There are no fees associated with the importation of instruments of international traffic. Therefore, no substantive amendment to the Customs Regulations is necessary to implement this provision. However, to alert the public to the exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic, a provision is added referring to this exemption from entry and 19 CFR 10.41a in the list of exceptions from the general rule in ยง141.4. Accordingly, Customs is promulgating on an interim basis amendments as described above and set forth below. Delayed Effective Date and Public Comment Requirements The agency intends that these interim regulations become effective on the 45th day following the date of publication, i.e. , 15 days after the close of the comment period. The agency believes it has good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) to promulgate interim regulations because the regulations provide an immediate benefit to both the Government and the public by increasing exemptions which already exist. These interim regulations are intended to implement Congressional intent embodied in 19 U.S.C. 1321, as amended, that these exemptions, when granted, should exist at statutory minimums. Furthermore, existing rights and obligations are not otherwise changed. The agency believes the public wants these new statutory minimums to become effective as soon as possible as the public should benefit from the efficiencies and savings resulting therefrom. In addition, the agency does not believe the public needs time to conform its conduct so as to avoid violation of these regulations. The due and timely execution of the agency's responsibilities would be unnecessarily impeded by a time consuming notice and comment period. The agency believes such delay is unnecessary because it does not expect the public to object to the regulations being promulgated as they merely provide the relief that Congress intended.
