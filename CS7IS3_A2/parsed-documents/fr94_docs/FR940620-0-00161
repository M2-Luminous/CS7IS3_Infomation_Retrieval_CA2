FR940620-0-00161 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. The NPRM proposed that temporary work comply with ADAAG 4.1.1(4) (Temporary Structures), which applies the scope and technical requirements of ADAAG, including those for an accessible route, to temporary facilities. The NPRM further proposed that the temporary circulation path from building entrances to accessible street crossings be clearly marked. Several commenters from departments of public works noted that it may not always be possible to provide an accessible temporary route. Others recommended that an alternate route be required, particularly to building entrances. One commenter stated that the cost of providing an accessible alternate route might be excessive in some situations. Response. Consistent with ADAAG 14.2.1, which requires that public sidewalks, where provided, be accessible, this section has been changed to require that where a temporary alternate circulation path is provided around construction in the public pedestrian circulation network, the alternate path must be accessible. It also requires that the temporary alternate circulation path comply with alterations standards at ADAAG 14.3 (Alterations). The reference to ADAAG 4.1.1(4) (Temporary Structures) has been removed as unnecessary. The provision at ADAAG 14.1 (General) applies ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35, which includes 4.1.1(4), to ADAAG 14. Comment. Several commenters noted that, where construction involves the entire width of a public sidewalk, some pedestrians may choose to bypass the work by using the adjacent roadway for a short distance. These commenters requested clarification as to whether permitting the use of a street or public sidewalk by pedestrians without disabilities constituted the provision of an alternate circulation path that would require the temporary installation of public sidewalk curb ramps to allow persons using wheelchairs to travel in the street to detour around an obstruction. Response. Along developed rights-of-way, access to other existing routes may already be available at nearby intersections where pedestrians can choose to cross to another public sidewalk that will provide temporary passage by the construction. This would not require the provision of a temporary alternate circulation path. However, where other existing routes are not available and where the sidewalk under construction remains open to pedestrian travel but does not provide a continuous passage, an accessible temporary path must be provided. The temporary path must comply with provisions for alterations in ADAAG 14.3 and must therefore contain a continuous passage connecting to public sidewalk curb ramps and street crossings, where necessary for access. Furthermore, the temporary alternate path must be clearly noted and, where there are hazardous conditions along the route, such as excavations, construction materials, or equipment, they must be protected by barriers. Comment. The NPRM proposed that construction sites in the public right-of-way be protected with barriers. Commenters from FHWA noted that MUTCD contained requirements for street and highway construction, including traffic and pedestrian barriers. (DOT/FHWA, ``Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices,'' 1988 edition.) These commenters recommended that the requirements of this section be coordinated with chapter 6C&hyph;9, Barricade Application, which recommends that, where it is not possible to divert pedestrians to other public sidewalks when a segment of a pedestrian route is impassable due to construction, barricades be used to define an alternate path. Response. Conformance with MUTCD standards, which include technical guidelines for barricade design and designation, is required as a condition for receiving funding under the Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. 101, et seq). Therefore, most jurisdictions will comply with MUTCD guidelines. The interim final rule is consistent with MUTCD recommendations and no changes have been made in this requirement. Comment. The NPRM proposed that construction sites be protected with barriers to warn pedestrians of hazards on the pedestrian circulation network. Many persons with vision impairments and organizations representing them submitted comments supporting this requirement and recommending that barriers be required to be discernible to persons with vision impairments. One commenter provided information on guidelines developed for the installation of scaffolding along public sidewalks in San Francisco.
