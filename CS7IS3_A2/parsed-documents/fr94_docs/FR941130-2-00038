FR941130-2-00038 FR941130-2-00024 [GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314; DA 94&hyph;1289] Broadband Personal Communications Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Public notice. SUMMARY: This public notice announces the Canadian Interim Sharing Arrangement for the broadband personal communications service (PCS). This action is taken on the Commission's own motion. The arrangement permits the United States and Canada to use PCS spectrum without causing interference to the operations of the other country. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Mooring, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8114. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is the text of the Commission's public notice in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, released November 21, 1994. The arrangement itself is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC and also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Text of Public Notice On November 14, 1994, representatives of the FCC and Industry Canada concluded a sharing arrangement for 2 GHz Broadband Personal Communications Services (PCS). This interim sharing arrangement provides for use of the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band for PCS along the United States and Canada border. This sharing arrangement should assist parties intending to participate in the FCC auction process and should facilitate the eventual provision of PCS services along the border. The principal provisions of this interim sharing arrangement are: •The frequency band 1850&hyph;1990 MHz is to be shared on an equal basis and both countries are to have full use of these frequencies for the provision of PCS services. •Additional use of the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz frequency band for fixed point-to-point microwave use is to be limited and discouraged and any new use of the 1910&hyph;1930 MHz band for fixed microwave operations is to be avoided. (The 1910&hyph;1930 MHz portion of the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band has been designated for unlicensed PCS use in the United States and a similar type of use in Canada.) •Any new PCS use of these frequencies is not to cause harmful interference to existing fixed point-to-point microwave operations in the other country. •Coordination of all PCS systems within 120 km (75 miles) of the border is required and will be based on: _A technical analysis, using recognized industry procedures such as TIA/EIA Bulletin (TSB10&hyph;F), that interference is not caused to existing microwave operations; or, alternatively, _A mutually acceptable arrangement between the PCS and fixed microwave operators. •Licenses for PCS base station facilities within 72 km (45 miles) of the border will be conditioned to indicate that future coordination is required between PCS operators in both countries to ensure that interference is not caused to PCS operations in the other country and that the band is shared on an equal basis. (This is similar to actions taken during the initial licensing of the cellular radio service.) •The predicted or measured median field strength of any PCS base station is not to exceed 47 dBuV/m at any location at or beyond the border unless the affected PCS operators in the adjacent areas agree. •Compatible PCS operations at the border are best assured through coordination of operating and technical parameters by PCS operators; and, PCS operators are to notify the FCC and Industry Canada of any agreements. Such agreements are subject to review by the Agencies. The full text of the arrangement has bee placed in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and copies are available from International Transcription Service at (202) 857&hyph;3800.
