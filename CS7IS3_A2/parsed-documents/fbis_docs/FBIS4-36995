It also recommended the formation of a transitional government. The resolutions, which were drafted after a series of contacts on the sidelines of the conference and in close consultation with former prime minister General Michel 'Awn who kept on introducing amendments to the draft resolutions until late at night the day before yesterday, stated that the LNC "is a comprehensive united establishment embodying the patriotic trend working for Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full sovereignty over all its territory with its historical and internationally recognized borders." [passage omitted] The conference defined its "struggle priorities" by setting a number of targets including "liberation" through "expansion of the struggle work at Lebanese and international levels by mobilizing Lebanese resources in Lebanon and the diaspora." It also called for the mobilization [tajyish] of the Lebanese world's resources "in order to influence public opinion and the decisionmakers on Lebanese fateful issues, particularly the five permanent members of the Security Council, especially the United States, and also the Arab states which have no interest in sacrificing Lebanon's freedom, sovereignty, and independence." The conference assigned to the Board of Trustees the task of pursuing dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent Lebanese and international experts to perceive and offer alternative options to the sectarian regime to pave the way for a political secular regime that would transfer power from the sects to the state and promulgate laws that would define the basic rights of the Lebanese citizen and offer a concept of a new structure for the state ensuring the executive independence of every authority as well as independent judicial control for every authority. The conference asserted that the Arab-Israeli peace plan "is the most important diplomatic framework as far as Lebanon's fate is concerned and it would constitute a definite threat to Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon went to the negotiations represented by a government whose decisions have been mortgaged and confiscated, a government which lacks legitimacy and public mandate." It renewed the call for "tripartite negotiations by Israel, Syria, and Lebanon." It urged work for "solid and comprehensive Lebanese accord embracing the Lebanese leaderships which accept a negotiation plan for the full and absolute liberation of Lebanon, in the framework of a transitional government representing all parties which accept the principle of peace and work for it." The conference suggested that "the transitional government should, after completing the peace process and liberating Lebanon from every direct and indirect military and semimilitary presence, pass a new electoral law on which free parliamentary elections would be held under UN supervision, giving the right of voting and candidacy to all the Lebanese people at home and abroad."
