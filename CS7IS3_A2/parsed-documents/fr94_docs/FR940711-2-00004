FR940711-2-00004 FR940711-2-00003 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1995 Census Test &hyph; Field Verification Operation. Form Number(s): DG&hyph;121(ADP), DG&hyph;131(ADP). Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 310 hours. Number of Respondents: 6,190. Avg Hours Per Response: 3 minutes. Needs and Uses: A critical component in conducting a census is a current and accurate address list of all living quarters. The Census Bureau will use two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass in urban areas (enumerators systematically canvass census blocks to verify or update addresses on the census address list) and prelist in rural areas (enumerators systematically canvass census blocks to obtain the physical location address and/or the mailing address of all structures where people live or could live). In addition to these methods the Census Bureau will receive additional address update information from outside sources including the United States Postal Service, local governments, and the ``Be Counted!'' campaign. The added addresses from these outside sources will be field verified to confirm their existence before being added to the census address list. The 1995 Census Test &hyph; Field Verification Operation will help verify the accuracy and completeness of the Census Bureau's address control file that we will use for the delivery of census test questionnaires. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: July 6, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
