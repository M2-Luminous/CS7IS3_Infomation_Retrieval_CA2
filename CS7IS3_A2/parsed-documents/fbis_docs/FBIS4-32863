Rocha said he awaits only the final report of Senator Jose Richa [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Parana State], who is the rapporteur of the proposal, to open the debate. The draft patents law is designed to protect patents rights against acts of piracy. The United States has gone so far as to demand the approval of the law in order to continue to maintain trade relations with Brazil. The Brazilian Government had promised to have the law approved by the middle of this month. Senator Rocha noted, however, that this deadline is unfeasible. He noted that the committee is not hurrying because it wants to pass a law that will be in the best interests of the country. Rocha believes that the draft industrial property law will be voted on only during the extension of the congressional recess in July--if there is one--or during the second half of this year during the electoral campaign. The rapporteur has already announced that the proposal will be amended in order to have its provisions conform with the decisions included in the GATT accord, and it will have to go back to the Chamber of Deputies after the Senate vote.
