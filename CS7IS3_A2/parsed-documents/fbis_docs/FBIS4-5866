On 12 April, we attacked the enemy troops west of Pailin and at Boeng Pralit, thus blocking the stretches of road within the perimeter of Pailin to the northern, southern, and eastern parts. We smashed the invading forces into bits and launched infantry attacks and shelling on their general command post at Boeng Pralit, killing or wounding many of them. Many others fled in disarray. 2. These escapees are 6th Division commander Ritthi and 60 officers and soldiers. Many of them were wounded. Having been constantly attacked and pressured by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, they fled into Thai territory. On 12 April, they fled in great alarm onto Thai soil, carrying weapons but wearing only shorts. The local people crowded around this General (Ritthi), because it is strange to see this general in such a position in spite of the earlier propaganda by the Phnom Penh ringleaders and some Western foreigners claiming that Pailin was under Phnom Penh control.
