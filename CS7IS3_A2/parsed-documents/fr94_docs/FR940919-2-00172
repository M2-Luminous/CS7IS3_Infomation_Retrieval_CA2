This advisory committee consists of private sector defense trade specialists who advise the Department on policies, regulations, and technical issues affecting defense trade. The Federal Register notice of June 30, 1994 announced that the October 6 DTAG meeting would be an open meeting. After setting the agenda, State Department officials and the DTAG officers found it necessary to close the afternoon portions of the meeting. The open session, which will be made up of all sessions preceding the lunch break, will include speakers from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and reports on DTAG Working Group progress, accomplishments, and future projects. Members of the public may attend the open session as seating capacity allows, and will be permitted to participate in the discussion in accordance with the Chairman's instructions. As access to the Department of State is controlled, persons wishing to attend the meeting must notify the DTAG Executive Secretariat by Friday, September 30, 1994. Each person should provide his or her name, company or organizational affiliation, date of birth, and social security number to the DTAG Secretariat at telephone number (202) 647&hyph;4231 of fax number (202) 647&hyph;4232 (Attention: Eva Chesteen).
