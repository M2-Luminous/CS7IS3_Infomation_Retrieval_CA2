This concept has already been advanced repeatedly by certain Western and developing countries in response to the demands of Bosnian Muslims. In all instances, the threat to use force has been directed at the Bosnian Serbs. The subject of "air strikes against the Serbs" has once again become a central topic. After the January session of the NATO Council declared the readiness of the alliance to use air power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia's State Duma appealed to it. The mass media have treated the NATO decision entirely superficially, detaching it from the history of the issue. Intentionally or not, this leads to inflamed passions and incorrect conclusions, including with respect to Russia's position and the role of the United Nations. Here is the history of the issue. Russia has never supported the use of military methods to resolve the problems of the crisis in Yugoslavia, especially through intervention involving the use of force by the world community against one of the Bosnian sides. When such proposals came rushing into the United Nations, Russia insisted on a more well-considered and balanced approach toward all participants in the conflict. As a result, the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council permitting use of force in Bosnia and Herzegovina contain rigid criteria and restrictions. First of all, actions of force are possible only in three cases: if an attack is conducted against a convoy carrying humanitarian assistance (Resolution 771, August 1992); if one of the sides violates the no-fly zone in the airspace over Bosnia (Resolution 816, March 1993); or if one of the conflict participants directly hinders the UN Protection Force, Yugoslavia from carrying out its mandate in the security zones (Resolution 836, June 1993). Secondly, all United Nations documents clearly establish that coercive measures may be used against any side guilty of actions prohibited by the Security Council, not just against the Bosnian Serbs. Thirdly, in all decisions, we are talking only about the threat to use force--its direct application requires special supplemental procedure involving the participation of the secretary general of the United Nations and members of the Security Council. Fourthly, the Security Council has invited UN member states and regional organizations to undertake "all necessary measures" to facilitate the implementation of resolutions, but has stipulated one steadfast condition: Such measures may be taken only "under the direction of the Security Council" and "in close coordination with the secretary general of the United Nations and UN Protection Force, Yugoslavia." In August 1993, NATO responded to this proposal. The North Atlantic alliance declared that it was prepared to participate in operations related to the conduct of air strikes in accordance with a United Nations Security Council resolution and under its direction, i.e., strictly within the framework established by the international community. Now the question of bombing has resurfaced in the January NATO Declaration. But the leaders of the alliance state in this document that they are prepared to conduct air strikes only under the direction of the Security Council. Thus, there have been no changes in NATO's fundamental position since August of last year. It is another matter that the time of emergence of this new declaration is difficult to consider an apt choice. Its underlying anti-Serbian message clearly did not further the normal course of the Geneva negotiations among the parties in conflict, although it did not prevent the Serbs and Croats from affixing their signatures to a bilateral agreement. Once again the Muslims have convinced themselves of the illusion that someone will support them with force. To a certain degree the readiness to conduct air strikes also contradicts the propositions voiced at that same session of the NATO Council concerning a peaceful settlement to the conflict. Russia shares the UN position in the Bosnian crisis. The "Blue Helmets" command headquarters in Bosnia and Herzegovina has already stated many times that in the event air strikes are inflicted, an escalation of combat operations may follow. All peacemaking forces in the former Yugoslavia will find themselves under direct threat. Nonetheless, the decision of the NATO Council shows once again that an answer must be found to the question of how to further develop United Nations cooperation with regional organizations. Precedents in this regard already exist. The United Nations Security Council adopted resolutions in support of peacemaking efforts of the Organization of American States in Central America and the Organization of African Unity in Liberia. This same experience can be applied to the task of maintaining peace in the territory of the former USSR, where the United Nations could cooperate with CIS mechanisms in matters of maintaining peace. The necessary legal base for this has been established in the Commonwealth: Agreements have been reached on collective peacemaking forces and groups of military observers. In accordance with decisions of the Ashkgabat summit meeting which took place last December, the CIS requested that the United Nations afford the Commonwealth UN observer status. All in all, this experience must be studied and more precise criteria drawn up based on it with respect to how regional organizations can settle conflicts through peaceful means.
