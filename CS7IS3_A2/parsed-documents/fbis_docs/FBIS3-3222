Mr. Liu made these remarks at the session of the presidium of the 8th NPC when he delivered a report on a review of the state budget for 1993 and a draft budget set for 1994. There are now nearly 25 million persons on the state payroll which is part of financial spending, 50 percent more than in 1985. The committee believed that a too big government structure and redundancy of staff were the main reason for excessive financial spending. The committee suggested that China should make reference to other countries and make a decision to streamline government structure. Other proposals put forward include cutting the financial deficit by every possible means, increasing financial revenue, maintaining the growth of financial revenue and the gross domestic product at the same pace and raising the input of capital to support development in economically poor areas. According to the draft state budget for 1994 made known by the Minister of Finance Mr. Liu Zhongli, China will borrow loans of over RMB129.2 billion this year. The committee believed that it was inevitable that a deficit and loan-making would take place at a time when China was now seeing rapid economic development and a change in its system. It said, however, that the authorities had to pay much more attention to controlling spending on new items of basic construction while subsidies for the making up of losses should be kept under control and reductions or exemptions of tax not in line with the law should be prevented.
