Romulo said the panels will discuss "how the Philippines will be able to support Vietnam go into a free-market system from a centrally planned economy." Romulo said the Philippines has a lot of agriculturists and economics professors and practitioners. Under a "trilateral cooperation" arrangement, they can provide expertise to developing countries funded by a developed country like Japan. Romulo said such an arrangement is already in effect in Cambodia where a number of Filipino agriculturists are helping Cambodians under a program funded by Japan. Other areas where Filipinos could lend expertise are banking, business management, fishing, and ceramics manufacturing. Another area the Filipinos are good at is implementation of official development assistance, Romulo said. Romulo said Vietnam, with more than 70 million people, is a rich market for the Philippines once the purchasing power of its population goes up.
