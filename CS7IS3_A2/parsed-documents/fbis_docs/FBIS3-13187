Commenting on statements by Iraqi Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Rufa'il Bidawid I to the effect that the Pope has promised to visit Iraq at the appropriate time, the paper today, in an article contributed by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, adds that a positive stand by the Pope now could make an effective contribution to thwarting attempts to spark such wars. AL-JUMHURIYAH goes on to say that the neo-imperialists have chosen Iraq as a target for their vindictiveness, and as a major springboard for sparking wars designed to last hundreds of years by inflicting colossal harm that will not be forgotten by Iraq, the Arabs, or the Muslims. This harm engenders vengeance. The paper says: Iraq is determined to shed light on the unreligious motives for this Western hostility toward the Arabs and Muslims. However, Iraq's efforts in this regard need to be supported by efforts from other camps, which the United States wants to wage the war against Iraq. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The Pope can play a role in thwarting the scheme of Western imperialism. A visit by the Pope to Iraq would address a clear message to all, telling them that Christianity has nothing to do with capitalism's covetousness and criminal schemes, and that Islam and Christianity have coexisted without wars for thousands of years, and that there is no reason for this coexistence to be discontinued. The paper asserts that a visit by the Pope would also be a message to the Iraqi people, telling them that Christians have nothing to do with their suffering, that they are sympathetic to their ordeal, and that they want to see the embargo lifted. The paper hopes that the visit by the Pope will be made before the embargo clamped on the Iraqi people is lifted, because the timing of the visit is immensely significant. This is because the visit must encourage the countries of the Christian world to take bolder steps to lift the embargo, or push for a lifting of the embargo. The paper concludes by noting the failure of the Bush administration to dominate the world in the name of the new world order. The paper adds that there are currently moves toward a new stratagem even more horrible and criminal than Bush's, namely, that of pushing the world into the crematorium of ethnic and religious wars in a bid to make them the bases for future conflicts.
