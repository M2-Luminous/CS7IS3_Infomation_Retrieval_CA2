FBIS4-7692 "dreeu065_y_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Serbia Romanian Minister Voices Support for Belgrade Romanian Minister Voices Support for Belgrade LD0404173194 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1630 GMT 4 Apr 94 LD0404173194 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania on Tuesday and his meeting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu is a step forward in the search for a solution to the problems of the region, Romanian Education Minister Liviu Maior said in Belgrade on Monday. Maior, who is the vice president of the National Council of the ruling Social-Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR), met in Belgrade on Monday with a delegation of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) headed by Goran Percevic -- the vice president of the biggest party both in the republican and the federal [word indistinct]. The major achievement of the talks was an agreement to convene a Balkan meeting of moderate leftist parties to be held under the slogan "Balkans to the Balkan peoples", Percevic said. He said that there was agreement about the direct link between peace and stability in these territories and the "fact that only the Balkan peoples and states should shape their own destinies." The SPS Information Service announced that Maior said that Bucharest is in principle opposed to the U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which Romania, as a member of the United Nations, has been forced to implement. The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed strict sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its alleged involvement in the civil war between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Maior underscored that the sanctions have caused much damage to Romania and recalled a recent statement by that country's leadership that the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia should be lifted out of ethical and humanitarian reasons, and because of the damage they are causing to the entire Balkan region. Romania said that in 1993, it has suffered damage amounting to seven billion dollars, while in the case of the other countries in the region this figure exceeds tens of billions of dollars. Percevic warned that a part of the international community verbally urges a peace, while at the same time shutting its eyes before the fierce Moslem offensive in the territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) and thus threatening to annul everything achieved so far in the peace process. The Moslems launched an offensive on RS in mid-March encouraged by the Washington agreement on setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia.
