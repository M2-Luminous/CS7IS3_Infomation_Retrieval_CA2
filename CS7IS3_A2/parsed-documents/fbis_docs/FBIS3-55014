The government's policies target to enlarge the number of jobless residents because the budget provides twice more funds for unemployment allowances in 1994 than last year, Kuprijanova said. The funeral allowances have also increased, she noted. In 1993, both needs required 1.1 million lats, while this year the planned sum reached 1.6 million lats, said Kuprijanova. Another chunk of budget resources is earmarked for Latvia's membership in international organizations. In 1993, the sum was 13,000 lats. This year, the allotment soared to 238,000 lats. From this, 153,000 lats will go to the World Health Organization alone. Kuprijanova questioned the feedback of the Latvian entrance into the international structures. In her words, the budget plan is misinterpreted. It should be submitted to competent institutions for shaping in accordance with concrete development mainstreams and programs, like the economic development program and the social and medical care programs, said Kuprijanova. The health care funds remained unchanged, 38.7 million lats, in the prospective budget. The factual assignations also would not increase for pensions, social maintenance and maternity allowances, Kuprijanova added.
