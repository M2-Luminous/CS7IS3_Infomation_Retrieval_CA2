According to the preliminary statute, anyone "who is committed to the revolutionary heritage of the NVA" and does not "serve in armed FRG organs" can become a member. The East Berlin comrades, who are looking for fellow-fighters to "preserve our ideals" in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND and by circular letters, have a clear enemy image: "According to the will of the occupiers, everything was supposed to be abolished through the counterrevolution in autumn 1989." The protest slogan of the NVA nostalgics: "Let's not put up with that!" The response is still meager. Nevertheless, the Bundeswehr Association reacts nervously to the "alarm signal." In an open letter, Berlin District Chairman Herbert Becker, a former NVA lieutenant colonel, warns all 25,000 former NVA soldiers in the capital against this "extremist organization." In the future traditional association, which wants to "decide" contentious issues "in an authoritarian manner if necessary," one can "continue holding one's former service rank." And one who has not yet flogged his NVA uniform on flea markets or to souvenir shops "can" wear it "at closed events." The first opportunity: "Our day of honor" on 1 March, 38 years after the founding of the NVA -- provided that the initiators of the association manage to settle "some organizational problems" by then. So far, only about a dozen activists have rallied, and they are industriously preparing the NVA resurrection project.
