FR940610-1-00015 FR940610-1-00002 (iii) The institution believes that the invoice does not fully or accurately reflect adjustments provided for in paragraph (g) of this section. (2) Inapplicability. This paragraph (h) is not applicable to requests for review of an institution's assessment risk classification, which are covered by §327.4(d). (3) Requirements. Any such request for revision must be submitted within 60 days of the date of the quarterly assessment invoice for which revision is requested, except that requests for revision resulting from detection by the institution of an error or omission for which the institution files an amendment to its quarterly report of condition must be submitted within 60 days of the filing date of the amendment to the quarterly report of condition. The request for revision shall be submitted to the Chief of the Assessment Operations Section, and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the revision sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the Corporation's request for additional information. Any institution submitting a timely request for revision will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding the outcome of its request. Upon completion of a review, the Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee) shall make a determination as to whether the requested revision is warranted and shall promptly notify the institution in writing of the determination. (i) Assessment notice not received. Any institution that has not received an assessment invoice for any quarterly payment by the fifteenth day of the month in which the quarterly payment is due shall promptly notify the Corporation. Failure to provide prompt notice to the Corporation shall not affect the institution's obligation to make full and timely assessment payment. Unless otherwise directed by the Corporation, the institution shall preliminarily pay the amount shown on its assessment invoice for the preceding quarter, subject to subsequent correction. 5. Newly designated §327.4 is amended by revising the section heading; removing paragraphs (a) through (c); redesignating paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) as new paragraphs (g), (c), and (d), respectively; removing the heading of paragraph (e); redesignating paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) as new paragraphs (a) and (b), respectively, and revising them; revising newly designated paragraph (g); and redesignating paragraphs (h) and (i) as new paragraphs (f) and (e), respectively, to read as follows: §327.4 Annual assessment rate. (a) Assessment risk classification. For the purpose of determining the annual assessment rate for BIF members under §327.9(a), and the annual assessment rate for SAIF members under §327.9(c), each insured depository institution will be assigned an ``assessment risk classification''. Notice of the assessment risk classification applicable to a particular semiannual period will be provided to the institution with the first-quarterly invoice provided pursuant to §327.3(c)(2). Each institution's assessment risk classification, which will be composed of a group and a subgroup assignment, will be based on the following capital and supervisory factors: (1) Capital factors. Institutions will be assigned to one of the following three capital groups on the basis of data reported in the institution's Report of Income and Condition, Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, or Thrift Financial Report containing the necessary capital data, for the report date that is closest to the last day of the seventh month preceding the current semiannual period. (i) Well capitalized. For assessment risk classification purposes, the short-form designation for this group is ``1''. (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, this group consists of institutions satisfying each of the following capital ratio standards: Total risk-based ratio, 10.0 percent or greater; Tier 1 risk-based ratio, 6.0 percent or greater; and Tier 1 leverage ratio, 5.0 percent or greater. New insured depository institutions coming into existence after the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be included in this group for the first semiannual period for which they are required to pay assessments. (B) For purposes of assessment risk classification, an insured branch of a foreign bank will be deemed to be ``well capitalized'' if the insured branch maintains the pledge of assets required under 12 CFR 346.19, and maintains the eligible assets prescribed under 12 CFR 346.20 at 108 percent or more of the average book value of the insured branch's third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
