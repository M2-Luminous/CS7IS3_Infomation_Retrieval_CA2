It was then that the new parliament began work and the Russian Government was reorganized. There was also the NATO Council session in Brussels whose decisions directly affect Russia. As well, of course, as the U.S. President's visit, which not only comprised talks with Boris Yeltsin but also the more or less sensational tripartite meeting involving Leonid Kravchuk. I have no doubt that the opening of the Federal Assembly has the greatest significance for the country. At the same time I do not think that what is presently taking place in both chambers really submits itself to analysis. At the moment, whichever way you look at it, we have the same confusion and struggle as before, but not so much between political policies as personal ambitions. At the same time, the week's events point to one fairly alarming and completely developed trend in international relations. What is more, it appeared in the midst of events which, paradoxically, were for the most part fairly positive. What I mean is the approval in Brussels of the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" project; as well as the signing in Moscow of the tripartite documents, which, in the opinion of one high-ranking Russian diplomat, should finally draw a line under the question of the fate of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. NATO has indeed proposed an extremely wise solution to the problems of the security of East European states. Of those states which demanded their immediate admission to the North Atlantic bloc, attributing this demand to the growing threat from Russia which, they claim, might emerge as an imperial force. But several statements by leaders of East European countries give reason for caution by dint of their hysterical fervor and the fact that they are clearly out of touch with the situation as it is. I must remind you that the Polish President stated that a refusal by the West to produce a clear plan and schedule for his country's admission to the North Atlantic bloc would be a "great tragedy" which may give rise to a "second Yugoslavia" in Europe. All this leads to the conclusion that there are considerations behind these attempts to force their way into NATO which bear no direct relation to problems of security. In my view a strange kind of inferiority complex can be seen here. After the Warsaw Treaty and CEMA ceased to exist, the East European states "cast off their Soviet chains" and discovered to their surprise that they were of no great interest to the outside world as partners. They have ended up on the sidelines of the main European and global processes. For example, no room was found for them in the "single Europe" which for the moment remains restricted to West Europe. The countries of the European Union, in creating a single economic area, are painstakingly surrounding it with a barrier of taxes, tariffs, and other restrictions. They certainly do not intend to allow any outsiders in. Other economically developed states like, for example, the United States or Japan, are showing even less interest in cooperation. They have their own priorities. In this situation, speculation in the problems of security has, not to mince words, presented a real opportunity to draw attention to themselves and to raise their international status. For the extremist pronouncements which can be heard in Russia at present do not, of course, improve our image, but it is, to say the least, silly to perceive them as a real threat to anybody's security. But it has emerged that, by using the bugaboo of imperial Russia and portraying themselves as potential victims, it is nevertheless possible to alarm the West. Consequently, it is possible under the pretext of a dire military and political need to first of all attempt to integrate themselves into its defense structure, and only later into its economic structure. After all, you treat your neighbors one way but your allies in a completely different way. Ukraine also suffers from this very complex, but it is aggravated still more by economic collapse. All talk of Russia being a threat, which Kiev used as a pretext to limit its progress toward adopting a nonnuclear status, can be explained first and foremost by an urge to win for itself economic and financial advantages which have nothing to do with Ukraine's security. Nevertheless, those who speculated in security in order to try and enhance their status, got their share of attention from the U.S. President. When Bill Clinton held talks in Prague, he tried to persuade the East European leaders to adopt partnership for peace. Stopping over in Kiev, he tried to persuade Leonid Kravchuk to agree to give up his nuclear warheads. Is it, however, possible to consider the matter closed? Alas, no. The real reasons for speculation in security have simply not been resolved. Indeed, the East European countries now have the opportunity to integrate themselves into NATO's structures by an evolutionary process; but by no means into West Europe's economic structures. But the capital which Ukraine has been promised in accordance with the agreement, however large it might be, will not pull it back from the economic abyss. Consequently, it is still possible that speeches about the Russian threat will be heard again. Maybe we will not just hear speeches. After all, it is not out of the question that they may attempt to provoke Moscow in order to reinforce in some way what at the moment seem like absolutely unfounded claims of its aggressiveness. We also had an opportunity to see how this is done this week. I refer to the provocation involving the arrest of Russian generals in Latvia. I am prepared to believe that this was inspired by a local nationalist petty tyrant. However, by some strange law, violent actions which might put Russia in a bad light occur in the Baltic states precisely on the eve of or during the visits of U.S. Presidents. Nor is it out of the question that someone in the future will attempt to go along the well-trodden path of provocation. This is dangerous. Because, by speculating in security and playing games with military force, it is necessary to continually raise the stakes. You do not know where you will stop and whether you will indeed stop at all. It is very likely that the attempts by individual states to turn problems of security into a means of attaining other economic and political goals may prove to be the same kind of challenge to global stability as local conflicts have already become. I think that both Russia and its Western partners should see this threat.
