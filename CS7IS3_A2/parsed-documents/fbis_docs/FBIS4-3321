Africa Election OW1904191094 Beijing XINHUA in English 1841 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904191094 Beijing XINHUA English BFN ["News Analysis" By Teng Wenqi: "A Great Change in S. African Situation"] [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April 26-28 elections in South Africa. The decision was announced by South African President Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in the poll is of great importance to the current situation in South Africa. The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in the elections. The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu Homeland. The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party negttiations and adopted by the parliament. The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to submit its candidates for the elections. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and IFP, but failed. Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since 1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year. More than 300 people died of violence monthly. De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks in Pretoria. The memorandum said the three parties "reject violence and will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa." In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful means. The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa. The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the total South African people, are taking part in the elections. This means a great change in the elections in South Africa. Buthelezi said at a press conference today "South Africans may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions." Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is "a leap forward" for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process." "IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all leaders and of all those who love South Africa," Mandela stated.
