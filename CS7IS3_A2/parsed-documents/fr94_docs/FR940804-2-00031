FR940804-2-00031 FR940804-2-00010 Cost of Production Petitioners alleged that Roldan and Acenor were selling in the home market at prices below COP in the petition filed in this investigation. The Department initiated COP investigations for both respondents on January, 19, 1994. However, as stated above, the Department rescinded the original COP investigations. After reviewing petitioners' revised allegations, we re-initiated COP investigations. We requested that respondents reply to Section D of our antidumping questionnaires issued on February 28, 1994. Roldan and Acenor submitted their responses to Section D of our questionnaire on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. On July 13, 1994, the Department sent Roldan and Acenor a Section D deficiency questionnaire. In order to determine whether home market prices were below COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act, we calculated COP based on the sum of the respondents' cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses and home market packing costs. We compared individual home market prices with the COPs. We tested the home market prices on a product-specific basis using Roldan's sales to unrelated customers from the database received on June 13, 1994, and Acenor's sales to unrelated customers from the database received on June 29, 1994. We compared model-specific COP to reported prices that were net of movement charges. Following our standard practice, where we found over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based on constructed value (CV), in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. If sales below cost occurred in three or more months of the POI, they are considered to be made over an extended period of time. For sales made in less than three months of the POI, the extended period of time is the number of months in which the sales occur. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(1)). Roldan and Acenor provided no indication that the disregarded sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(2)). Constructed Value (CV) We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of respondents' reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses. Roldan For purposes of calculating FMV, we used the sales from Roldan to its unrelated customers and CV, as described above. For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing to unrelated customers in the home market. In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement V. United States, 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir., 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including inland insurance). For both price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We re-calculated home market and U.S. credit expenses because Roldan reported an average interest rate for a seven-month period, rather than the six-month POI. In addition, for those sales with missing shipment dates and payment dates, we calculated credit expenses based on the average payment period for the respondent's sales reported with shipment and payment dates. We did not make a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for commissions claimed by Roldan that were paid to its parent company for export sales services performed by the parent company's commercial department. We also did not adjust for commissions paid by Roldan to the U.S. subsidiary of its parent company for marketing Roldan's products in the United States. We consider these payments to be intra-company transfers not tied directly to sales of the subject merchandise. Furthermore, we have no appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Roldan and its related party commissionaires are at arm's length. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.) We also deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.
