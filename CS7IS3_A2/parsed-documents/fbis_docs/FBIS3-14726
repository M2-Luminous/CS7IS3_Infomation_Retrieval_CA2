The chances of a Prime Ministerial visit to Washington will also depend on the outcome of the talks here between Indian officials and Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel from Tuesday, and Deputy Secretary of State Strove Talbott in the first week of April. The fact that the U.S. is despatching two senior officials to India within a fortnight has given rise to hope as well as apprehensions. There is hope that the Clinton Administration may be seriously trying to improve relations and clear up misunderstandings arising from certain unfortunate observations regarding Kashmir, human rights and the "Sikh rights". At the same time there exist apprehensions that the officials may only articulate the now-too- familiar stand of the Administration and attempt to bring pressure to bear on NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] and other such issues. The Indian side expects the two senior officials to clarify the U.S. Administration's stand on all these issues. New Delhi's serious concern at the possible supply of more F-16 aircraft to Pakistan as a "one-time exception" through a Congressional waiver of the Pressler Amendment has been voiced in strong terms by the Prime Minister, the External Affairs Minister and the Chief of Air Staff. Such an act will upset the balance of power in the region, escalate the arms race and force India to divert more resources to defence to safeguard its security. That will not be a friendly act, Ms. Raphel and Mr Talbott will be told. A visit by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, to Washington is still in the realm of uncertainty though officials on both sides have been talking about it in the hope that an Indo-U.S. summit will help clear up the misunderstandings and also expand the already strong economic relations between the two countries. But the fact remains that no formal invitation has so far been extended by the Clinton Administration to Mr Rao to visit Washington. This being the case, Indian side does not want to give the impression that it is keen on such a visit while the Clinton Administration is not or that success of such a visit would be ensured if India fell in line as regards the U.S. suggestions on NPT, MTCR and Kashmir. The U.S. Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, has tried to put the issue of Indo-U.S. relations in perspective by referring to United States' "great admiration" for India and "very high respect" for it. At the same time he has pointed out that "as with many friends we have problems with India" on issues like nuclear non-proliferation and human rights. The Indian side recognises that differences on several issues between the world's two largest democracies have persisted over the decades and will continue in the future. But observations like questioning the legality of Kashmir's accession to India and excessive concern for human rights have conveyed the feeling that there is a decisive U.S. tilt in favour of Pakistan. Following the passage of the unanimous Parliamentary resolution, it is not open to the Indian Government to negotiate the status of Kashmir, and the Prime Minister has already said that there is no question of a dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Political opinion in the country is also sharply divided on the question of India trying to make up with the United States regardless of the existing controversies. Many ruling party members feel that the fate of Indo-US relations should not hinge on the statements of a few foreign office officials, and that the two countries should cooperate with each other in economic and other fields. However, another section in the party as also in the Opposition, has accused the Government of prevaricating in responding to the provocative statements made by U.S. officials and by President Clinton himself. They feel that the Government should strongly resist U.S. interference in India's internal affairs, its encouragement to Pakistan which is sponsoring terrorism against India and its bolstering Pakistan's strength by resuming the supply of F-16s under the pretext of capping its nuclear programme. Although Pakistan's former Chief of Army Staff General Aslam Beg is on record saying that Islamabad's nuclear programme has already been capped, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has recently declared categorically that "there is no question of Pakistan capping its nuclear programme."
