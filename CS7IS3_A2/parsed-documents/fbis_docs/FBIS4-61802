The meeting was also attended by the Lithuanian prime minister, finance minister and chairman of Lithuania's bank board of directors. National radio quoted on Sunday the IMF officials as saying Lithuania's deficit had exceeded the level specified by the memorandum which was signed by the republic's government and the IMF. Unless the situation over the mounting deficit is rectified in the near future, the International Monetary Fund may suspend credits earmarked for Lithuania. The IMF officials believe the first thing to be done by the Baltic republic is to cut back on budget expenditures. The IMF representatives expressed regret that Lithuania had not yet passed a law on its National Bank, nor had it taken any measures to regulate activities of commercial banks. The officials were especially critical about reliability of statistic data which they said did not reflect the actual economic situation in Lithuania.
