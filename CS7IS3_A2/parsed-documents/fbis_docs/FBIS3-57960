Horst Waffenschmidt, the commissioner for resettlers' affairs at the Interior Ministry, said today in Bonn that in 1993 only 218,888 resettlers came to Germany. In 1992, the figure was 230,565. Compared with last year, the number of applicants for admission dropped by over 161,000. While the number of applications received from Poland and Romania continues to decline considerably, Waffenschmidt said, applications from the former Soviet Union were around 37 percent lower than last year. The state secretary pointed out that a large number of people granted admission documents have not emigrated to Germany. A growing number of Russian ethnic Germans from Kazakhstan and other CIS republics emigrated to Russia in 1993. This year, too, the main objectives of Bonn policy are to create a secure living and future prospects for Germans in Central, East, and southeastern Europe by helping to develop settlement areas and granting admission, and to integrate late resettlers into Germany, Waffenschmidt said.
