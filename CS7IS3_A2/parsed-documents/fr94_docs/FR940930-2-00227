FR940930-2-00227 FR940930-2-00074 Columbus and Simco request an authorization for Simco to return excess capital to Columbus through a declaration of dividends on its common shares of stock out of paid-in capital surplus to be paid on a periodic basis until the amount of dividends equals $500,000. In an order dated June 5, 1987 (HCAR No. 24405), the Commission authorized Columbus to acquire a note from Peabody Coal Company (``Peabody'') in connection with the sale of real property and fixed assets to Peabody. In consequence of this transaction, the coal mining activities of Simco were transferred and almost all of its business operations were discontinued. In an order dated October 19, 1990 (HCAR No. 25174), the Commission authorized Simco to reduce the par value of its authorized shares of common stock to $0.10 per share, to reduce the stated capital of its common stock from $9,000,000 to $9,000, and to declare and pay to Columbus dividends out of paid-in capital up to $4.5 million. Simco is a party to a May 1, 1991 agreement with Conesville Coal Preparation Co. (``Conesville''), a non-utility subsidiary company of Columbus. Under the agreement, Conesville has a non-exclusive right to the use of a coal conveyor beltline, through January 1, 2017, in exchange for a usage charge currently in the amount of approximately $38,000 per month. In consequence of the above-described transactions and the cessation of all other business by Simco, Simco has cash in excess of its foreseeable capital requirements. Simco currently has 90,000 shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share. On June 30, 1994, Simco had retained earnings of $111,338, paid-in capital of $740,000, a stated capital of $9,000, and cash and temporary investments of $355,479. Monthly usage charges under the agreement will continue for approximately twenty-two years. This amount together with the current capital of Simco is far in excess of foreseeable capital needs. Therefore, it is proposed that excess capital in an amount not to exceed $500,000 be distributed to Columbus. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
