They will not succeed in putting on a collision course the logic of the state and the logic of the honest, rational, and objective resistance, which complements the work of the state for liberation by its steadfastness, he added. The prime minister added that we will not give Israel the satisfaction of seeing any crack in the unity of the Lebanese, who on the contrary are tending toward more strength, cohesion, and firmness. Prime Minister al-Hariri reiterated that Lebanon joined the negotiations in collaboration and consultation with Syria and with a well-known objective--namely, to liberate every inch in the south, the Western al-Biqa', and the Golan. Prime Minister al-Hariri made these remarks after inaugurating the municipality offices in Sidon.
