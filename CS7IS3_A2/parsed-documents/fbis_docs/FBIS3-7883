In the interview, the foreign minister warned against NATO's "threatening policy," saying that if NATO extends the target of an air-strike threat to other areas of Bosnia, "something unexpected will occur." He called on Muslims to make bold to sign a peace accord at the opportunity of the cease-fire in Sarajevo. [Goto] How will the avoidance of NATO air strikes affect the Bosnian conflict? [Jovanovic] NATO's ultimatum was designed to stand to the side of the parties in the civil war, and it nearly demolished the cease- fire accord reached between Serbs and Muslims. If NATO extends an air-strike threat to other areas of Bosnia, something unexpected will happen and it will spread to all areas of Bosnia. [Goto] Some people see that the Serbian force has withdrawn its heavy weapons from around Sarajevo under pressure of NATO. [Jovanovic] This is not true. We took the action after concluding that the withdrawal is a rational compromise which turns out to our advantage. Because we already reached an accord with Muslims on withdrawal of weapons several days before NATO's ultimatum was given to the Serbian force, the ultimatum was unnecessary. Because NATO has lost its enemy of the Soviet Union following the collapse of the Cold War structure, it is now seeking a new external enemy in a bid to justify its existence. [Goto] Do you think the Sarajevo cease-fire will bring progress in negotiations on peace? [Jovanovic] The Serbian force has made the maximum concessions in response to proposals included in a draft peace accord presented by the European Union (EU). The utmost concession is to grant one- third of national land to Muslims, and 98 percent of the draft peace accord has been agreed on. Now is the time to sign a peace agreement and to discuss the land issue that remains unsolved. We support any agreements among the three parties, including the Croatian. [Goto] Russia played a major role in achieving the Sarajevo cease-fire. Do you think its influence will increase? [Jovanovic] Different from American and European nations, Russia has adopted balanced policies toward the Bosnian conflict. Serb's withdrawing weapons is the product of Russian policies. President Yeltsin's call on American and European nations to hold a summit is one of Russia's initiatives. We support the proposal.
