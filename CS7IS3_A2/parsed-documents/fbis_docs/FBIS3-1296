The international news agency REUTERS quoted the PAC's Deputy Secretary-General Tobile Gola as saying the meeting -- due to last two or three days -- was being held at a conference centre on Pretoria's eastern outskirts. However, SADF spokesman Col John Rolt said as far as the SADF was concerned the meeting was taking place at a venue in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area and was expected to last until Friday. "The SADF cannot unilaterally disclose the venue of the meeting and therefore we still stand by our earlier information that the meeting is held at a venue in the PWV area," Col Rolt said. REUTERS, in its earlier report, said the SADF and APLA met for the first time on South African soil on Wednesday to discuss an end to hostilities. According to the report Mr Gola said the meeting was expected to cover "everything". "It deals with all issues in relation to the future situation, the integration and the amnesty for APLA members. They will talk about the new army," he said. "There must be agreement on all issues. We need peace in this country," he added. The report also quoted SADF spokesman Nick Sendall as having described the talks -- with about eight people on each side -- as "very exploratory". They were about "what we do, what they do, and what we both look like". They would attempt to find common ground for further talks, he said.
