FR941017-2-00108 FR941017-2-00062 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposal, as discussed above, clarify the application of the rule and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers as to the application of this rule. Additionally, the original proposal was noticed for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;37 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 31 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;37), as amended, is hereby approved. 32 31 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). 32 The Commission notes, however, that the proposed rule change will not be implemented until the Commission receives certain written representations from the OCC regarding the operational status of C/MACS. See supra note 15. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 33 33 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
