In an interview with the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the present status and prospects of the two countries' economic cooperation, Minister Le Xuan Trinh said that during the visit the two sides reviewed the implementation of the programme of the Vietnam-Russia Intergovernmental Committee on Economic, Commercial and Scientific-Technological Cooperation approved at its second session held in Hanoi in early 1993. The two sides also discussed an agenda for the third session of the committee scheduled to be held in Hanoi in mid-April this year. The two sides signed protocols on trade for 1994 between the two countries, and on their cooperation in the time to come. Vietnam also signed a protocol on payment of mature debt to Russia. Asked about the payment of debts to Russia, Minister Le Xuan Trinh said that Vietnam agreed to pay a mature debt of some USD [U.S. dollars] 60 million in garments, woolen carpets, lacquerwares, rice, meat and other goods. The two sides agreed that an amount of USD 50 million contributed by Vietnamese guest workers in Russia would be included in the payment to Russia. The Russian side agreed to take part of this payment to reinvest in and expand its cooperation with Vietnam. Speaking about the cooperative orientation between the two countries in the years to come Mr Trinh said that the Russian side had declared to continue to provide loans to Vietnam to implement in 1994 the project for the city public lighting system. Also this year, he said, Russia will resume investment in agro-industrial projects to plant tea, rubber, and coffee.
