The reorganization impacted not only on top organs of the Ministry of Defense but also was manifested particularly in military units and formations. One of the features of change in the Army is undoubtedly the substantial movement of personnel, equipment, and all types of materiel. Only for purposes of illustration, last year some 266,043 tons of materiel were transported within the framework of the Army. Even though the majority of this materiel was transported by highway, the Army also used 12,332 railroad cars. This year, the volume of materiel to be shipped will be approximately 177,500 tons of state property. A specific element in the transformation is the disestablishment of military components. Since 1990, some 777 formations and installations have been disestablished, with 132 of them being eliminated just recently. Some 126 formations moved to other garrisons, and 187 new formations were created. Just for last year, the reorganization impacted on a total of 198 formations and installations of the Army. Military personnel left 28 garrisons, which represents the evacuation of 261 facilities. This trend will continue in the coming months. During the next two years, another seven garrisons will be disestablished. One of the problems that burdens the Army and exerts an influence in terms of the final consequences affecting training in some units is the fact that abandoned facilities continue to be guarded by the Army, although it does not utilize them. Virtually 400 facilities are being guarded by almost 2,000 men. A special chapter in the transformation is military aviation. According to official sources, the Air Force terminated regular flying activities at seven airfields since 1990; the Army is preparing to abandon an additional three airfields. Unfortunately, pressure by representatives of some communities and municipalities continues to have military pilots evacuate their surroundings. Military aviation also has three air rescue centers under its wings. It is precisely the members of the Army who used this service to transport 5,500 persons in life-threatening situations last year; of these, 850 were in critical shape and 1,250 were children. At the same time as the numerical strength of the military is declining (just last year the planned peacetime strength of the ACR was reduced by 12,923 individuals), the number of military training areas has also declined. The Army has thus permanently left the training areas at Mimon, Dobra Voda, and Mlada. The reorganization has substantially impacted the area of military education and has had a basic impact upon civil defense, the military health-care service, and the military police. In March of this year, military railroad troops will be disestablished. The personnel area continues to be one of the most closely monitored problems in the current Army; it has also been subjected to more than one change. But the search continues for a system to determine military careers; some reports indicate that there are several models for this but that they continue to stay under cover. Departures from Army ranks continue. Last year, some 6,594 individuals left the Army, including 113 noncommissioned officers, 1,856 warrant officers, 4,607 officers, and 18 generals. On the other hand, 1,821 individuals joined the service in the ACR, including 438 noncommissioned officers, who joined the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] unit. At foreign schools, 117 career soldiers are training, as of today, or have completed their training. Gen. Nekvasil indicated that the most immediate reorganization would transform the central and western Army commands into the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army Corps. An additional four combined-arms divisions will change into mechanized brigades. Air Force bases will be developed to house the 6th Air Force Transport Regiment and the 20th Air Force Bomber Regiment. The development of the rapid-deployment brigade is announced for April of this year. In a more extended time frame, it is expected that 11 territorial defense brigades and pontoon brigades will come into being. One motorized division, three infantry divisions, a chemical protection brigade, the headquarters of two divisions of air defense, and the headquarters of the 7th Civil Defense Recovery and Rescue Brigade will be completely disestablished. All changes are to be accomplished by 1 October 1995. The resulting status should then have the following structure: There would be a Ministry of Defense and a General Staff, followed by the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army Corps, the headquarters of the 3d Corps of the Tactical Air Force and the 4th Air Defense Corps, the headquarters for logistics. The armed forces would be formed by: seven mechanized brigades, a rapid-deployment brigade, and 14 territorial defense brigades. Military aviation would operate six air bases.
