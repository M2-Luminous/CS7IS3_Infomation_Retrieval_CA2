Salable % (Item 10 divided by item 3 × 100) 90 13. Reserve % (100% minus item 12) 10 The ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' (Guidelines) issued by the Department in 1982 specify that 110 percent of recent years' sales be made available to primary markets each season. This rule provides an estimated 656.4 million kernelweight pounds of California almonds for unrestricted sales (1994 crop salable production plus carryin from the 1993 crop) to meet increasing domestic and world almond consumption demands. This amount exceeds the actual 1991&hyph;92 record for delivered sales of California almonds by 18 percent. Thus, the Guidelines' goals are met. The members of the Board that opposed the establishment of salable and reserve percentages believe that free competition is best for the industry and that the industry should concentrate on building demand for almonds rather than imposing a reserve. One member was also concerned that enforcement procedures would be difficult as many handlers are reluctant to cooperate with a mandated reserve. The overall consensus of the Board is that the establishment of salable and reserve percentages will reduce market volatility and enhance returns to growers, while stabilizing supplies to customers and encouraging customer confidence in the industry. Establishment of salable and reserve percentages are often contentious and controversial in the almond industry. Those opposed to reserves generally have philosophical differences with supporters, favoring a market situation not affected by supply controls as reflected in the Board discussion and vote. However, a majority of the Board favored the recommendation, and all Board members (even those opposed) have indicated they will support the majority Board recommendation and work to ensure fair and equitable administration of the reserve, if established. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this proposed rule would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is considered appropriate because the salable and reserve percentages are recommended to be established for almonds received by handlers during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began on July 1, 1994.
