[passage omitted] In another important development, Sanaa yesterday denied promising the United States not to storm Aden. A General People's Congress [GPC] senior official went so far as to say that the statement issued by the U.S. State Department "is a flagrant and rejected interference in the internal affairs of the Yemeni Republic." In New York, it has been learned that the government of the Yemen Arab Republic conveyed to Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's envoy, its position on the Cairo meeting between delegations from Sanaa and Aden to discuss a mechanism for the supervision of the cease-fire, emphasizing that the meeting should take the form of indirect talks, not face to face, should be based on the existing government coalition, and should not constitute any form of recognition or dealing with the secessionists. [passage omitted] In Sanaa, in the first reaction to the U.S. State Department's recent statement, the Yemeni Government denied promising the U.S. Administration that the government's armed forces would not enter Aden. A responsible sources said that "the Yemeni Government had informed the U.S. and Saudi Governments that it would postpone the entry of the forces of legitimacy and unity into Aden in pursuit of the remnants of the rebel secessionists if the government found a suitable political solution based on ending the mutiny and holding a dialogue within the framework of the Yemeni Republic with commitment to the Constitution and the constitutional legitimacy resulting from 27 April 1993, as well as noninterference in Yemen's internal affairs, to end the war and spare blood." [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, head of the General Department and member of the General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC], has stated that the U.S. State Department's statement came as a surprise and was illogical and the GPC saw it as flagrant interference in Yemen's internal affairs. In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Sanaa yesterday, he said that the GPC totally rejects the U.S. State Department's statement and sees it as a flagrant and rejected interference in the internal affairs of the Yemen Arab Republic, because the current war in Yemen is a war between the legitimate and constitutional government forces and a band of secessionists from some leaderships of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. What the legitmate forces are doing comes under the constitutional rights of the Yemeni Republic's Government." [quotation marks as published] In conclusion, al-'Ansi said: "The Yemeni Government and the legitimate forces care more about Aden, its population, and its installations than the U.S. Administration or anyone else, and the government forces' entry into Aden does not depend on an U.S. or non-U.S. permit. It is rather a question of the government's concern for the lives, properties, and human rights of the innocent population, and of preserving economic and public establishments in the city. When the time comes for the legitimate forces to enter the city in pursuit of the secessionist remnants, there would be nothing to prevent them from entering the city any time the military and political commands decide that the lives of the citizens are safe from any danger."
