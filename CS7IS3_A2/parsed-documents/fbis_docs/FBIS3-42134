The Japanese Have Learned This from a Secret Report by the Russian General Staff"] [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN carries a detailed account of a secret report on North Korean nuclear affairs prepared by the Russian General Staff and an interview with an unnamed official involved in compiling that report, referred to in a note as "a leader." The report is entitled "The Russian Federation's Military Policy in the Asia and Pacific Region Under the New Military-Political Conditions." It seems that more can be seen from the top of our General Staff building than from the U.S., Japanese, or NATO counterparts. At any rate, Russian specialists and analysts are more candid on the problem of the North Korean nuclear program and stricter in their judgments than their Western colleagues, who recently have repeatedly shared information with journalists -- true, their own journalists, not foreigners. It follows from the report, prepared for Grachev and then forwarded to Yeltsin (according to the Japanese magazine, which was told all this by our talkative secret agents in Moscow), that Pyongyang has scored major achievements in implementing a missile program and a nuclear program. The DPRK already has its own nuclear warheads and several hundred delivery vehicles capable of delivering the payload. It is clear from the Russian report, and from the mysterious "leader's" comments on it, that Pyongyang embarked with particular zeal on its nuclear missile program in the second half of the eighties, with active Russian participation. Almost 160 Russian nuclear scientists and missilemen have passed through North Korean laboratories and specialized centers since then. At present nine Russian nuclear scientists and 17 highly qualified missile specialists are working in North Korea. This is outside the framework of bilateral cooperation and is unofficial, as it were -- according to the "leader's" comments, many of our scientists have changed their names, and some have taken DPRK citizenship. Only it is not this that is important but the fact that the project to create the Korean Nodong-1 intermediate-range missile was successfully completed with the assistance of Russian brains, and North Korea has accumulated a sufficient stock of enriched nuclear raw materials with the help of Russian scientists and technologies and now possesses approximately 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium-239. Citing the testimonies of four Russian specialists who recently returned from the DPRK after working in Korean nuclear complexes, the report maintains that Pyongyang already possesses one or two nuclear warheads and by the end of this year will roll several more off the conveyor belt. The DPRK is now engaged in creating a new generation of Nodong-2 solid-fuel missiles with an increased hit range. According to Russian estimates, in the very near future our fuel technologies and know-how and our missile scientists and solid-fuel specialists will be objects of special attention for Pyongyang's agents. In this connection the report proposes revising all existing technological agreements between Russia and the DPRK, stopping the leak of cadres, and devoting special attention to bridge-building with the United States, South Korea, and Japan for extensive coordination of actions. It is even proposed that we think about the prospect of creating some kind of regional ABM system involving Russia, Japan, and the United States. At the same time it is pointed out that not only Russia but also China has been involved in the DPRK's nuclear affairs, and the Chinese factor is now becoming the key one. The document cited at length by the Japanese magazine is stamped "top secret" and was prepared by the Russian Defense Ministry General Staff Military-Strategic Analysis Center. After being read by Grachev and Yeltsin, extracts from the report were forwarded on the president's instructions to the U.S. Defense Department (within the framework of an information exchange). A facsimile of a Russian Defense Ministry form with the issue number 001 SM-137 and date of publication 22 October 1993 is even given as an illustration. In short, there are no doubts about the authenticity of the document itself, but some questions do arise, and it makes sense to ask them. The first and most important question: On what unspecified grounds does Russian General Staff information get into Japanese hands, accompanied, moreover, by detailed comments and explanations by a "leader" working, to judge from the wording employed by the weekly, in the structure of the General Staff itself? Maybe no major secrets have been divulged, but the question needs to be answered if only for one reason -- a Japanese audience is the first to learn about the Russian military department's assessments, while the Russian audience, as is already the custom, is considered "second class." Second question: On what terms and in what circumstances did the Japanese weekly obtain exclusive material from the Russian Defense Ministry? If it was on instructions from chiefs conducting an intricate publicity operation, I would like to have an idea of that intention. If it was without the chiefs' knowledge, it would be even better to know the whereabouts of the secret key which opens Russian General Staff safes for Japanese guests. Finally, a third question, again one of considerable importance: Who in Japan (or some other country) will be the next happy possessor of Russian secret documents? If the Russian mass media are not old enough to have the honor of being the first to learn the Russian military department's viewpoint, they must at least get their bearings in the information area and know in which foreign journal or newspaper it will be possible to familiarize themselves with the views of their own Defense Ministry.
