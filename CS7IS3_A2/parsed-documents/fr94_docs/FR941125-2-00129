FR941125-2-00129 FR941125-2-00086 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 31102] Wisconsin Central Ltd._Exemption Acquisition and Operation_Certain Lines of Soo Line Railroad Company AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed modification of historic preservation condition and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Commission proposes to remove a condition, imposed in 1987 in connection with a sale of rail lines, that prevents the railroad from selling, destroying or modifying properties until completion of procedures under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. DATES: Comments are due by January 9, 1995. ADDRESSES: An original and 10 copies of all comments must be sent to Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Attn: Finance Docket No. 31102, Interstate Commerce Commission, 1201 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Louis Mackall, (202) 927&hyph;6056. [TDD for the hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is proposing to reopen this proceeding to remove a condition that was imposed seven years ago in this rail line sale proceeding. The condition appears to be inconsistent with our current procedures and may no longer be necessary. Wisconsin Central Ltd. (Wisconsin Central) purchased approximately 1,800 miles of rail line from Soo Line Railroad Company (Soo) on October 11, 1987, pursuant to the class exemption for rail line sales, 49 CFR 1150.31 et seq. 1 We allowed the sale to proceed under the class exemption, but imposed an historic preservation condition. Because this case was processed under the class exemption procedures, and we did not want to delay the public benefit of the line sale in preserving rail service, we permitted the sale, but ordered the carrier not to take any steps that would affect historic properties until after the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) process could be completed. 1 See Wisconsin Central Ltd._Exemption Acquisition and Operation_Certain Lines of Soo Line Railroad Company, Finance Docket No. 31102 (ICC served July 28, 1988). The exemption overrides certain regulatory requirements associated with filing a formal application under 49 U.S.C. 10901. Section 106 of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. 470f, requires that, when a federal agency approves a license, it must ``take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register [of historic buildings and places].'' Under the NHPA, we consult with the appropriate state historic preservation officer (SHPO) and, where appropriate, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to identify historic properties, determine if they will be adversely affected, and consider appropriate mitigation. The broad historic preservation condition we imposed in this case was worded as follows: The Commission will undertake a section 106 National Historic Preservation Act process in this matter. Pending completion thereof, [Wisconsin Central] shall refrain from taking any action that may jeopardize the historic integrity of sites and structures 50 years old or older. Because hundreds of properties were transferred, the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) attempted to enter into some kind of ``programmatic agreement'' (36 CFR 800.13) 2 or ``memorandum of agreement'' (36 CFR 800.5) 3 with ACHP and the various SHPOs involved to facilitate the process by identifying the historic properties adversely affected by the transfer, so that we could craft appropriate mitigation conditions for them. This effort has been unsuccessful, however, and the process of determining appropriate historic preservation measures for each particular property that Wisconsin Central has subsequently sought to sell or demolish has been inordinately slow, often taking several years. 2 A programmatic agreement, negotiated between ACHP and the responsible agency official in consultation with the appropriate SHPO, may be used to determine proper historic preservation measures for projects when ``effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive.'' The programmatic agreement is a contract that to be effective must be agreed to in writing by ACHP, the SHPO, and the agency. 3 A memorandum of agreement (MOA) may be used, usually for a single project, where the agency and the SHPO agree on a course of action. ACHP must have an opportunity for comment. We revised our historic preservation rules in 1991 so that now the historic preservation process is only required in line sale cases where, at the time of the transfer, the applicant plans to dispose of or alter properties subject to our jurisdiction that are 50 years or older. 4 Implementation of Environmental Laws , 7 I.C.C.2d 807, 828 (1991). Our current rules do not require carriers to file an historic report, and historic preservation conditions are not imposed, for rail line sales ``where further approval is required to abandon any service and there are no plans to dispose of or alter properties subject to ICC jurisdiction that are 50 years old or older,'' 49 CFR 1105.8 (b)(1). Thus, under our new rules, if a condition were imposed in a line sale case such as this one, it would apply only to properties subject to our jurisdiction (``used or useful'' in rail service, see 49 CFR 1105.8) that the buyer has plans to dispose of or alter outside the context of a further abandonment or sale application. 5 These rules have been applied in approximately 100 cases and have worked well in narrowing the focus of the historic review process to rail properties that may actually be affected by a sale transaction. 4 These rule changes were made in consultation with the ACHP. It is unclear whether Wisconsin Central would have had to file a historic report or be subject to historic preservation conditions under this new standard. 5 If subsequent abandonment or sale authority is required for the disposition of properties, the appropriate NHPA review will take place in the context of those proceedings.
