Without the necessary supply of power, the entire economy will be bottlenecked. The country's power industry has been improving steadily since 1975 when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the work of the State Council. But the most rapid progress has been recorded in the last six years, as 12 to 14 million kilowatts of generating capacity has been installed annually. Nevertheless the industry still faces a shortfall. This so-called electricity bottleneck has, in fact, lasted for 24 consecutive years. Today, electricity production falls short of demand by 20 per cent and some 120 million rural Chinese still live in the dark. Rapid expansion of the power industry is necessary. During their industrialization, some countries in the world have invested more than 2 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) annually to expand their power industries. However, between 1980 and 1992, only 1.24 percent of China's GNP per annum was invested in the power sector. Construction of power grids has also lagged behind demand. Moreover, investment in applied science and technology for power generation has been declining. The fund-raising mechanism for enterprises in the power industry should be implemented and a scientific and rational pricing system for the use of electricity should be set up. That electricity is a commodity was ignored as recently as a few years ago, and so fund-raising for construction projects of the power industry from both the domestic and international financial markets was severely hindered. Plants, equipment and the technology used in many power stations and transmission grids are outdated. This results in a waste of generated energy. As to the future, the Ministry of Power Industry (MPI) is considering increasing China's generating capacity by about 15 million kilowatts per year between 1995 and 1997. Beyond that to the year 2000, 20 million kilowatts are to be added annually. Assuming China carry out this plan [as published], its total installed electricity capacity will be about 300 million kilowatts by the turn of the century. If China's GNP grows 8 to 9 per cent annually, the estimated generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts should by and large ease the power shortage nationwide, making it possible for each county in the country and 95 per cent of the country's rural households to have access to electricity. It is hoped that the State, with the backing of relevant departments, will increase its annual investment so that the input constitutes at least 2 per cent of GNP, the minimum required to ensure the industry's steady development. In line with the central government's policy of allocating funds for building key State projects the MPI will compete for preferential policies. Particularly, low-interest loans for rural regions in the country's minority, poor and remote areas will be sought to develop the power industry. The MPI will also encourage the development of new power sources. the transmission of power via grids from energy-rich provinces to those suffering from shortages, and investment from developed coastal regions to the relatively poorly developed power supply industries of the hinterlands. Economically advanced regions will be encouraged to be self-reliant in terms of electricity by collecting funds themselves for investment in their own power sectors. The MPI urges enterprises to create new channels of fund-raising and will permit them to apply to banks directly for loans and to other financial institutions for the issue of bonds and shares after seeking the approval from relevant government organs. State Council officials said that China needs more foreign investment in the power industry to compensate for the shortfall. The MPI will experiment with issuing bonds of enterprises abroad, and use the money collected to develop the power industry. It will also permit some power sector enterprises, which have good economic returns, to issue shares overseas. And it will set up fund-raising companies abroad to help enterprises in the power industry to raise funds from international sources. Because power supply is of great importance to the national economy, foreign investment in it will proceed under the State's macro-control. Domestic investment should provide about 80 per cent of funding and the remainder will be sought from foreign investors. To provide the public with reliable and quality service at reasonable prices, the MPI will continue to develop thermal power, hydro-electric power and limited amounts of nuclear power. The MPI aims to harness the country's rivers to generate between 70 and 80 million kilowatts of hydropower by the turn of the century. To achieve the goal, hydro-electric sites in the mainstream and tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the Lancangjiang and Honghe river valleys will be targeted. The power industry will monitor experience in the construction and operational performance of the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations. The two successful nuclear power stations in China will lay a good foundation for the development of nuclear power in China in the next century. In terms of the operational mechanism of State-owned enterprises. modern corporate systems will be introduced. State-owned enterprises will gradually be converted into limited companies and shareholding companies. The standard shareholding system will ensure independence from government interference and create more channels for fund-raising. To pave the way for the management reform of the industry the MPI has drafted the Electric Power Law. Within three to five years, a comprehensive legal provision for the power industry, with the Electric Power Law as its centre, is expected to be established in China.
