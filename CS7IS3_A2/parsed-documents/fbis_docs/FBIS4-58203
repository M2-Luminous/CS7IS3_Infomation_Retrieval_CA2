"The people's wish shall bring back the power to their hands and it shall lead - God willing - to the isolation and downfall of those whose desire and hatred prevented an agreement with the people," said Abdul Qadir Boukhamkhem and Ali Jiddi in an interview with Arab weekly paper AL- MUSLIMUN. They pointed out that for the first time after the liberation of Algeria from French colonialism the country was on the verge of becoming an Islamic state when the military-backed regime robbed power by force and banned FIS. "A group inimical to Islam, holding power behind the curtian, prevented the Islamic solution and oppressed the will of the people and opened the country to the French and western cultural and economic invasion," noted the two FIS leaders. They called for immediate release of all Islamic prisoners and the lifting of the ban on FIS. Last month the head of the regime, Liamine Zeroual, replaced his prime minister Redha Malek with a technocrat, Mokdad Sifi seen as an attempt to pursue talks with FIS. "The downfall of Malek gives some hope... if it was a real beginning to put an end to those calling for the destruction of Islam and Arabism," they told the newspaper published from Jeddah. "The men of the Islamic Salvation Front do not lack the preparedness and the ability to contribute, as expected from them, for a just and legal reform in the country," they stressed. They revealed that communists and secularists in the ruling clique had created a "death squad" to carry out attacks and killings in the country to terrorize the people.
