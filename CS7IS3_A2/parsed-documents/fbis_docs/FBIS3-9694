Police were trying to prevent the demonstrators, from the rightist and nationalist parties, from forcing their way into the building and interrupting the discussion on the proposal of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek to relieve Jansa because of abuses of power and violations of the constitution and of human rights. Jansa's followers were demanding also the state's President Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek be relieved. The immediate cause for removing Jansa from his ministerial post was his involvement in the recent brutal assault of military police on civilian Milan Smolnikar near Ljubljana. The military police at Jansa's orders beat up Smolnikar, accusing him of spying on the Defense Ministry for Slovenian President Milan Kucan. The removal of Jansa was Monday opposed by Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, president of the Christian Democrat Party, the third strongest party in the ruling coalition, who proposed to the prime minister to withdraw the demand. After Drnovsek refused to compromise, even if the Christian Democrats left the ruling coalition, Peterle requested a parliamentary debate on confidence the government. In the biggest crisis in Slovenia since it seceded from the former Yugoslavia, the Army and police were also at odds as a reflection of, as set out in Ljubljana, the intransigent interests of the political currents in the state leadership. Police was prepared for possible resistance from some sections of the Slovene Army which opposed Jansa's removal. The Slovenian parliament was expected Monday night to come forth with a stand on the prime minister's proposal for Jelko Kacin, former information minister, to become defense minister.
