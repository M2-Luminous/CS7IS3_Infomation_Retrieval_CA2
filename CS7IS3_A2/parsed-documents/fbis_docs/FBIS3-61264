Neither the president nor the parliament should decide whether Lithuania should join NATO. It must be done by the nation, he said. According to the chairman, Lithuania would limit its sovereignty by joining NATO. Therefore, it should hold a referendum like some Western countries did before joining the Maastricht Treaty, the parliament chairman noted. In addition, the NATO-option should be co-ordinated with the national security plan and discussed in the context of Lithuania's entire foreign policy. Mr. Jursenas suggested the parliament hold an extraordinary meeting before Christmas or in early 1994 to discuss the problems.
