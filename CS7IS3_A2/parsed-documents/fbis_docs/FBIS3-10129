Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas has reported that commercial banks have finally realized that Panama does not have the money needed to pay its foreign debt, which amounts to approximately $3 billion. A Panamanian delegation met in the United States 17-18 February with the committee of creditor banks to negotiate on the debt. Cardenas refused to give details of Panama's proposal. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 23 Feb 94 p 3A) Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas, when discussing the alleged imbalance in public financial figures, said: "What has happened is that fiscal 1993 closed with a surplus which, according to the comptroller general, amounted to $16 million versus $40 million, according to our figures. These differences always take place and can be worked out during 1994." She added that the difference is due to the fact that her ministry works with estimates. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 25 Feb 94) The Association of Panamanian Industrialists (SIP) reported a drop in the export of Panamanian manufactured products to the United States from $102.8 million in 1992 to $58.3 million in 1993. The SIP report adds that these exports continue to decline, but it gives no reason. There are, however, cases where the actual amounts of exports have increased, while the amount of income has diminished. In terms of chemical products, quantities sold increased 69 percent, but income from sales of these products declined 9 percent.
