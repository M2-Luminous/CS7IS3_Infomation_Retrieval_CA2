SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Secretary is revising the existing SSIG Program regulations to implement statutory changes required by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, enacted July 23, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) (1992 amendments), which amend the HEA. These revised regulations also change the SSIG Program regulations to reduce burden and clarify existing rules. The SSIG Program provides financial incentives for States to establish and to maintain financial assistance programs that make grants and provide work-study assistance to students with substantial financial need. The SSIG Program supports National Education Goal 5, which calls for every adult American to be literate and possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. On July 2, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the Federal Register (58 FR 36110). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. There are two major differences between the NPRM and the final regulations. The first change is to revise the allotment formula above the ``hold-harmless'' allotment of Federal funds each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program. The ``hold-harmless'' amount of Federal funds is the SSIG Program allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979. Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal year 1979 appropriation, each State still would continue to receive at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount regardless of the results of the allotment formula. Based on the comments received, a change was made in the final regulations to revise the allotment formula above the ``hold-harmless'' level by redefining the term ``deemed eligible.'' The Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most recently available data reported by each State. The Secretary will allot additional SSIG funds to States above their ``hold-harmless'' amounts by using the following steps: (1) Calculate the States' number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each State's SSIG funds expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States.
