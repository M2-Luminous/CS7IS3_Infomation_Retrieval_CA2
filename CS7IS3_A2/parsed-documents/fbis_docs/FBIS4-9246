FBIS4-9246 "dreeu078__a94028" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria FYROM President Gligorov To Visit 25-26 Apr FYROM President Gligorov To Visit 25-26 Apr AU2104184394 Sofia BTA in English 1458 GMT 21 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2104184394 Sofia BTA English BFN [Report by Kiril Vulchev] [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov will pay an official visit here on April 25 and 26 at the invitation of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, the press office of the Bulgarian Presidency announced. This will be the first official visit of the Macedonian President to Bulgaria. Mr. Gligorov has visited Bulgaria twice -- on a one-day working visit in August 1992 and privately in October 1992 in connection with the premiere of a play by a Macedonian playwright here. Dr. Zhelev visited the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] unofficially in February 1993 to attend the presentation of his book "Fascism" published in Macedonia. Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the Republic of Macedonia in January 1992, four months after this former Yugoslav republic proclaimed its independence. The decision to recognize Macedonia was taken by the government of the anticommunist coalition of the Union of Democratic Forces with prime minister Filip Dimitrov. President Zhelev supported this decision. In June 1993 a Bulgarian premier -- Prof. Lyuben Berov, visited Macedonia for the first time. In November 1993 Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski opened a Macedonian Consulate General in Sofia. In December 1993 the diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia were upgraded to embassy level. The recognition of the Republic of Macedonia by the Bulgarian Government marked the beginning of an intensive development of trade and economic relations. In 1991 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and Macedonia amounted to U.S.$50 million while in 1993 it was already U.S.$300 million of which almost U.S.$230 million-worth Bulgarian export and over U.S.$60 million-worth import from Macedonia. Double taxation was abolished in June 1993. The Bulgarian Government has granted two commodity credits to Macedonia -- for U.S.$20 million in August 1993, and in March 1994. An agreement was signed in December 1993 regulating cooperation between the Bulgarian and Macedonian Agricultural Ministries. A direct telecommunications link was established between Sofia and Skopje in 1993. Prior to that the two capitals were linked through Serbia. A 110-KV power conduit between Bulgaria and Macedonia was completed this March. This is the second link between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian power generation systems. The oil refinery in Burgas (southeastern Bulgaria) is the main foreign trading partner of the only Macedonian company authorized to import fuels -- Makpetrol. Almost 50 Bulgarian companies attended the first Macedonian- Bulgarian fair in Skopje in late 1993. Following Resolution 787 of the UN Security Council for tightening the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonian Prime Minister Jovan Andonov said during his visit here in November 1992 that "Bulgaria is the Republic of Macedonia's last open gate to the world." Consultations have started on the construction of a railway between Bulgaria and Macedonia as part of the East-West Trans-Balkan Railway from the Adriatic to the Black Sea. There is no direct railway between Bulgaria and Macedonia, which are linked by three motorways. The issue of traffic arteries became particularly topical after the embargo imposed by Greece on Macedonia this February and the closing of the Greek port of Thessaloniki for Macedonian goods. Macedonia transferred its import and export to the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas. In March 1994 the Macedonian Government confirmed the prime importance of the construction of a railway between Macedonia and Bulgaria for Macedonia's economic development and its guaranteed transport communications with the world. In November 1993 the transport ministers of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed the first agreement for road toll-free freight and passenger transport. The ministers agreed that Bulgaria and Macedonia should jointly insist before the UN Sanctions Committee on a single transport corridor through Serbia. Bulgaria and Macedonia will ask the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to recognize the Tirana-Skopje-Sofia route a transit air corridor. The first air service between Skopje and Sofia dates back to May 1992. After the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia closed its air space to Macedonian airlines, Skopje Airport redirected all Macedonian aircraft through Bulgarian air space. Bulgarian tourists rank first among foreign tourists in Macedonia, according to Georgi Danevski, secretary of the Macedonian Tourist Union. An agreement on cooperation in the field of culture is being drafted, proceeding from the accords reached during the visit of Bulgarian Culture Minister Ivaylo Znepolski to Macedonia last February. Early this month the Bulgarian and Macedonian education ministers failed to sign an agreement on cooperation because of the last-minute demand of the Macedonian side for the agreement to say that it has been drafted "in the Macedonian and the Bulgarian languages." Bulgarian Education Minister Marko Todorov insisted on the original wording "in the official languages of the two countries."
