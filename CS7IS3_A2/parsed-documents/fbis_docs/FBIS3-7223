Other participants, including the European Union (EU), supported Japan's stance. At the end of the meeting, the Japanese representative expressed serious concern over the 3 March U.S. decision to revive the Super 301 provision, saying: "The U.S. Government's retaliatory measures against Japan run counter to agreements under GATT's new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round)." In response, the U.S. representative stated: "This measure is not based on protectionism but is perfectly compatible with GATT articles." However, South Korea urged the United States to immediately abolish the Super 301 provision. Moreover, the EU, Argentina, Australia, and Hong Kong expressed their support for Japan's stance, and urged the U.S. Government to reconsider its decision. It can be said the U.S. Government was subjected to much criticism.
