Shahaq, who also heads the Security Committee of the Taba talks, said that the talks will resume on 31 January, provided that issues currently in disagreement will be settled in the upcoming meeting between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. Our Knesset correspondent Tamar Asalem reports: [Begin recording] [Asalem] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, deputy chief of staff, like all the other persons involved in the peace talks, is waiting for the results of the Peres-'Arafat meeting next weekend. Shahaq said that the prime minister and the foreign minister were briefed this morning about the Army's security stands, which will be presented in the meeting with 'Arafat. If indeed agreements are made over the weekend, the Security Committee of the Taba talks will reconvene as soon as 31 January. Gen. Shahaq addressed the claim that Fatah Hawks have been joining Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and taking part in terror attacks against Israel: [Shahaq] We have witnessed cases where some of those identified with the Fatah Hawks said they do not accept the PLO or Fatah authority, that they are quitting the organization, and that they will continue to fight against us. We, at the same time, stated that we will continue fighting them until we catch them. [Asalem] Shahaq added that the PLO does not yet have full authority over the field, and cannot impose its will on individuals who quit Fatah. In any event, Shahaq said, the IDF will be in charge of capturing the fugitives until April. I do not know what status they will have in the eyes of the Palestinian police force, he added. Gen. Shahaq stated that a real war is being waged in south Lebanon. [Shahaq] This is war, waged daily in more than one way by more than one organization -- not just Hizballah fights us and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] there. The IDF and the SLA soldiers carry the burden of this war in south Lebanon. [Asalem] Shahaq said that the number of incidents in the north has doubled last year, in comparison to 1992. Nevertheless, over the past several weeks, there has been a decline in the volume and nature of Hizballah activity. The Army explains this by the fact that Syria had pressured Hizballah before the Clinton-al-Asad summit last week. Regarding Syria, Gen. Shahaq addressed himself to the remarks by Major General 'Uzi Dayan [that war may break out this year if the peace talks fail], and said that he fails to understand the storm they caused. According to Shahaq, Dayan was not presenting an evaluation of the situation, rather he presented working assumptions of the Planning Branch, which is a routine matter. To conclude, Shahaq was asked about his personal stand regarding the fact that members of the Knesset committee have occassionaly been wondering about the involvement of military men in peace negotiations. Shahaq answered that he does not have a problem with this and, should he have a problem with it, he will present it to the appropriate officials. [end recording]
