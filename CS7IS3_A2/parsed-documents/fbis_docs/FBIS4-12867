This was also accompanied by the routing of its forces. Speaking today during his meeting with media leaders at the secretariat general of the Council of Ministers building, Lt. Gen. al-Bashir said it had been confirmed that Israel and the Zionist lobby were promoting an anti-Sudan media campaign in the West and that Israel was using Garang as one of its tools with which to fight the Sudanese Government. The president of the Republic referred to the symposium organized by a number of well-known leftist movements in Cairo to be held on 14 May which is just two days before the resumption of negotiations between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movement in Nairobi. He said the organizers of this symposium had invited John Garang and Riak Machar to attend. During his meeting, Lt. Gen. al-Bashir stressed that the Western world was trying to stir up discord in Africa, referring in this context to the Israeli enemy's aim to gain control of the sources of the Nile in the African continent with their water resources, in order to put pressure on the main forces in the region. The president of the Republic stressed the need for the Africans to take the initiative to solve disputes within the continent so as to preserve its security and stability. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir declared that the rebel movement's refusal to sign the relief agreement with the government revealed that the movement secretly intended to obstruct relief efforts in order to prepare the way for foreign intervention in Sudan. His excellency reiterated the Sudanese Government's determination to ensure that relief operations were successful.
