It continues with unrelenting intensity. The leadership of Azerbaijan does not wish to come to terms with the idea that, even after mobilizing all the resources (human and material) of that state for the battlefront, this offensive of unprecedented strength has failed like all the others before it. Even so, Azerbaijan continues to throw thousands of fresh conscripts into the meat grinder. Hoping initially to achieve quick success and to break through the defense forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] in any direction, [Azeri president Haydar] Aliyev tried to enhance his authority and to consolidate his rule in Azerbaijan. Because of that reason, it is not surprising that he is willing to lose large numbers of men and equipment for the sake of the most insignificant gain. Although the failure of Azerbaijan's latest offensive of 1 and 1/2 months is evident, that country's propaganda machine has not stopped its boasts, drumming up the fictitious victories of the Azeri army. [passage omitted] This has been happening at a time when virtually all the major battlefields are filled with unburied Azeri corpses who have been left there by their countrymen for political reasons (so that the large number of casualties does not raise political complications for the Aliyev administration). In order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics special services of the NKR forces have been rounding up these corpses and burying them in mass graves. However, the Azeri authorities do not care: The killed soldier is replaced by a fresh one, the destroyed brigade is replaced by one from the reserves. A situation has been created whereby the fighters of the Artsakh self-defense forces, no matter how strong morally and convinced about the justice of their cause and their eventual victory, are faced with severe hardships because of a shortage of manpower. The boys, some of whom have been fighting without rest for 5 years, are tired--some even weakened as a result of continual sleeplessness and poor nutrition. The endurance of their organisms can only be explained with the astonishing Armenian will and ability to survive. The heroic defenders of the NKR have and virtually receive nothing. Their ammunition and weapons are primarily strategic, obtained from the enemy. Obviously that cannot and does not meet the requirements of a steadily intensifying war. Instances when NKR army units cannot pursue fleeing enemy formations simply because they are out of ammunition are not uncommon. The soldiers' lack of clothing and food is even more distressing. The principal elements of the Artsakh force are fighting in a state of semi-starvation. I saw with my own eyes how, in one of the supposedly most combat-ready (if it is possible to compare) units, the Stepanakert brigade, which was at one time led by the legendary Bekor Ashot, soldiers passed from hand to hand a few loafs of bread before going to battle. Breaking small pieces from the loaves each fighter proceeded to the post he is assigned. Those pieces of bread were supposed to be the food which would sustain them in a battle that could last all day. [passage omitted] In these circumstances of manpower shortages the defenders of Artsakh have performed miracles. They have won victories which defy any military logic. Even so, the Artsakh army is in dire need of volunteers from Armenia and the diaspora. Today there is no man of arms-bearing age in Artsakh who has not been conscripted; all of them are on the battlefronts. The Artsakh army has only a small number of units, and that number is getting smaller each day. Artsakh no longer has any reserves. As Artsakh defends the cause of the Armenian nation today, the Armenian nation is obligated to enlist in Artsakh's cause. Artsakh's army is strong and combat-ready; it only needs enlisted men. On many occasions, the fleeing enemy is not pursued and the success of the Artsakh army is not fully developed because there are no complementary forces to take positions in the captured hills. Advancing soldiers often have to stop half way and take positions in order not to leave their rear unguarded. The same men attack during the day and keep watch at night without taking any rest. Meanwhile the routed enemy, having escaped hot pursuit, is able not only to rest and recuperate but also to receive large quantities of reinforcements and equipment and thus can reorganize its forces and resume its offensive. As long as the entire Armenian nation does not realize that the nation's destiny is being determined on the battlefronts of Artsakh and as long as throngs of volunteers do not head there with the call of blood, the war can take a dangerous turn at any moment. The people and government of Armenia must not allow the 150,000 Armenians of Artsakh to stand alone against 7 million Azeris, and must be aware that turning this war into a war of reserves cannot be allowed. Time is working in Azerbaijan's favor. The war must be concluded quickly. It is time to wake up and begin building an army seriously. Also, we must not be deceived by the Azeri offers of ceasefires, which they remember and agree to only when they are in trouble. Those ceasefires are used by Azerbaijan to prepare for new offensives.
