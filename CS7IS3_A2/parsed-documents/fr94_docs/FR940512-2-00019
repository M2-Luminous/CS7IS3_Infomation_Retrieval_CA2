FR940512-2-00019 FR940512-2-00009 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a) (3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. in room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Docket Number : 94&hyph;044. Applicant: Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Plant Biology, 290 Panama Street, Stanford, CA 94305. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer System, Model Delta S. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT GmbH, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of variations in the abundance of the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen that occur in association with biological and physical transformations. These measurements will be used to understand the mechanisms of isotope fractionation in biological processes, particularly photosynthesis and respiration. In addition, the instrument will be used in studies of the natural variation of isotope ratio and relative abundance gases in the atmosphere and dissolved in the ocean. Taken together these studies will address scientific questions concerning the operation of the biosphere and the interaction of these with the atmosphere and oceans. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 6, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;054. Applicant: University of South Florida, Department of Marine Science, 140&hyph;7th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model H&hyph;7100. Manufacturer: Hitachi Scientific Instruments, Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in marine ultrastructural research in the disciplines of biology, chemistry and geology. Specific research objectives will include the following: (1) the enumeration of viruses in seawater and taxonomic studies on viral isolates, (2) determination of the significance of viral encapsulated genomes in the dissolved DNA of the oceans, (3) examination of the effects of anthropogenic activities on reef environments as indicated by viral abundances, (4) a comparison of the variation of fish mitochondrial DNA among different fish groups, (5) pinpointing locations and numbers of ion pumps in fish and crustacean specimens, (6) examination of algal symbiosis in foraminifera including documentation of cytological changes associated with shell bleaching, (7) studies of the toxicologies in marine mammals to identify heavy metals in manatee tissue, (8) characterization of the mineralogy and microtextures of diagenetic marine minerals to obtain detailed elemental x-ray sample maps, (9) characterization of experimentally produced deformation microstructures and (10) examination of organic/crystal interfaces during picoplankton biomineralization. In addition the instrument will be used in the course Theory and Techniques of Transmission Electron Microscopy to give students a basic understanding of its operation. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 19, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;055. Applicant: Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, MCV Box 980017, Richmond, VA 23298&hyph;0024. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model EM 900. Manufacturer: Carl Zeiss, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for the examination of tissue from Surgical Pathology for diagnostic purposes. In addition, the instrument will be used for training Pathology Residents. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 21, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;056. Applicant: Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey WRD, 450 Main Street, room 525, Hartford, CT 06103. Instrument: Borehole Radar System. Manufacturer: ABEM AB, Sweden. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to study bedrock and unconsolidated overburden conditions in situ, from air- and water-filled boreholes as small as two and one-half inches in diameter in order to conduct research into groundwater flow and contaminant transport in fractured rock. The research objectives include development of methods to detect and quantify the effects of bedrock fractures and lithologic changes on groundwater flow and development of methods to directly detect, quantify, and monitor groundwater contaminants in order to increase the efficiency of future remediation efforts to reduce the hazards of contamination to the public. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 21, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;057. Applicant: University of California, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 990, Los Alamos, NM 87545. Instrument: Optical Floating Zone System. Manufacturer: Vacuum Metallurgical Co., Ltd., Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to grow single crystals of high melting point materials, so that the fundamental mechanical properties of these single crystals can then be investigated. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 21, 1994. Pamela Woods, Acting Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff.
