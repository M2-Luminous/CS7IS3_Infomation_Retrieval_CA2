FR940425-2-00050 FR940425-2-00037 [OPP&hyph;50779; FRL&hyph;4775&hyph;7] Receipt of an Application for an Experimental Use Permit for Use of Glufosinate-Ammonium on Herbicide Tolerant Corn Plants AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On March 11, 1994, EPA received from Hoechst Celanese Corp., an application for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for the use of Ignite Herbicide which contains the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, on corn plants genetically modified to be tolerant to this herbicide. Due to recent interest in the introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant plants into commercial agriculture, the Agency has determined that this application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before May 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, in triplicate, should bear the docket control number OPP&hyph;50779 and be submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice to the submitter. Written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Joanne I. Miller, Product Manager (PM) 23, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 237, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;7830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 11, 1994, an application for an EUP was received from Hoechst Celanese Corp., Route 202&hyph;206, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, New Jersey 08876&hyph;1258 for the use of Ignite Herbicide (EPA Reg. No. 8340&hyph;42), which contains the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, on corn plants genetically modified to be tolerant to the herbicide. Ignite tolerant corn has been genetically transformed by inserting a gene identified as the Bialophos Resistance Gene (BAR) containing the information to produce the enzyme, Phosphinotricin Acetyl Transferase (PAT), which detoxifies the herbicide during plant metabolism. The requested EUP for the use of Ignite will be conducted in concert with an EUP for a plant pesticide (66737&hyph;EUP&hyph;1) which was granted to Ciba Seeds for the use and evaluation of a B.t.-derived insect control protein in the corn plant. A request for extension of this EUP is currently under review. The addition of the herbicide resistance gene in combination with the insect control protein to the corn plant provides a convenient marker to confirm the presence of the insect control protein. Application of Ignite Herbicide provides a quality control check for this protein and will also selectively eliminate plants that do not contain it. A notice of the issuance of EUP 66737&hyph;EUP&hyph;1 to Ciba Seeds for testing of transgenic corn was published in the Federal Register of December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68409). The notice of receipt of the EUP was published on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16827), and an extension of the comment period was published on May 7, 1993 (58 FR 27284). A notice of receipt of the request for extension of the EUP was published on March 11, 1994 (59 FR 11600). These notices contain information related specifically to the genetic modification of the corn plants which will be treated with Ignite under the proposed herbicide EUP. The purpose of the proposed EUP for the use of Ignite Herbicide as stated on the product label is for evaluation as a selective herbicide to determine weed control and Ignite (glufosinate-ammonium) tolerance in corn. The product will be applied as foliar sprays using ground application equipment only to transgenic corn that has been genetically modified for crop tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium. The objectives for the testing program are stated to be: (1) Evaluate product efficacy for use in plant breeding by selective elimination of non-transgenic corn plants, (2) evaluate the tolerance of the transgenic plants to the herbicide, (3) determine efficacy of transgenic plants for insect control when used in combination with, Ignite and (4) for production of hybrid plants for use in feeding and safety studies in experimental animals. The application for the EUP requests use of 454.7 pounds of the active ingredient on a total of 157.3 acres of corn for the time period from approval of the permit until October 1, 1995. Testing is proposed for the states of Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. No petition for temporary tolerance was submitted with this application since the treated crop will be destroyed or used only for research purposes. Upon review of the EUP request, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information, EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUP. If issued, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments are to be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP by the Agency will be announced in the Federal Register . EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has a Public Docket Room where a copy of the EUP application deleted of all ``Confidential Business Information'' will be available for public inspection. The Public Docket Room is located at Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA; the hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. Dated: April 14, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
