The Majles approved the urgency of this draft bill. The introduction part of this draft bill says: The task of fixing prices is taken away from the Economic Council and is transferred to the Islamic Majles. The deputies, who have signed the only article of this draft bill, have demanded that every price change of commodities and services should be proposed and approved by the Islamic Majles before implementation. The draft bill has also proposed that all such price rises announced by the Economic Council or other authorities, which came into effect from the beginning of Farvardin this year [since 21 March], should be declared null and void. During today's open session of the Islamic Majles, the speaker Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri announced: The call for impeachment of the education minister [Mohammad 'Ali Najafi], which was submitted to the Majles by 29 deputies, is contrary to Article 151 of the Majles internal regulations and is therefore turned down because the cases raised are general and a number of the signatories have retracted. The speaker of the Islamic Majles stressed: If the deputies wish to go ahead with the impeachment, they can resubmit the impeachment request by giving a detailed and precise account of the cases. I would like to point out that the call for impeachment of the education minister has been signed and submitted to the Majles presidium. Among the instances of criticism raised are a drop in the level of academic progress of students, the granting of licences to managers of the Ministry to set up non-profit-making schools, ignoring the wishes of hezbollahi heads of schools, and squandering the national wealth. Also during today's open session of the Majles, results of the votes cast to elect a number of deputies proposed in some notes of the country's budget bill for the year 1373 were announced. During this session, there was a debate on the first reading of a bill to establish rural development centers. After hearing the remarks made by a number of deputies for and against this bill, it was rejected without being approved.
