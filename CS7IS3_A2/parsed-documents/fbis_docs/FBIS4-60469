The speaker was referring to a recent remark by the Saudi king who sided with the UAE in its dispute with Iran over the island. Nateq-Nuri said Iran was committed to the accord signed in 1971 between Iran and the emir of Sharjah [Al-Shariqah] on Abu Musa Island. He said Iran had only heightened security at the island after arresting a spy around the island and that this had made the UAE officials unhappy. He said bilateral talks should continue to resolve the minor disputes between the two countries, in order not to provide the "aliens to engage in mischief." The negotiations on the matter had been halted by the United Arab Emirates, he said. About Iran's relations with Egypt and foreign minister's imminent visit to Cairo, he said Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati will visit Cairo to attend the upcoming meeting of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM). On possible talks between Iran-Egyptian foreign ministers on the sideline of the NAM meeting, he said there were no restrictions on holding talks between the foreign minister and his counterparts from Egypt or other countries. On the obstacles in the way of improving Tehran-Cairo relations, Nateq-Nuri said the main stumbling block was the spread of the spirit of Islamism in Egypt that the Egyptian officials wrongly attribute to the Islamic Republic of Iran. On Iran's foreign debts, the speaker said the amount of the debts was no problem to Iran in light of its huge natural resources. He said that most of the countries of the world are debtors, but, the big powers magnified Iran's debts due to their hostile attitude towards Iran. On the Middle East peace process and the probability of resolving tension between Syria and Israel, he said Iran's relations with Syria were too solid to easily worsen. In the meantime, he said, "we recommend the Syrian officials not to damage their political prestige because Syria will get nothing from the Zionist regime". About import of the U.S. goods and if they would leave any cultural impact, he said there was no room for concern regarding the arrival of certain American products such as Coca Cola. Because, he said, "our Islamic and national culture is too strong to be affected negatively by such minor issues." On the Iran-Iraq relations, he said numerous issues still remained to be solved including the UN Security Council Resolution 598 and the issue of Iranian prisoners of war (pow) as well as the issue of pilgrimage to the holy places in Iraq. The officials of the two countries intend to meet and settle the issue, he said. On the priorities to be given to the second five-year development plan by the Majlis, he said the Majlis places emphasis on social justice, restructuring the adminstrative system, reducing reliance on oil revenues and reviving the pricing mechanism. On the Saudi ban on holding the special ceremony of "antipathy towards atheists," he said despite the harassment done by the Saudis, the incident was unlikely to result in break off of diplomatic relations due to the two countries being neighbours and because of the interests of the world of Islam.
