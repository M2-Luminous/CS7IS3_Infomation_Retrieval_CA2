Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said the CAP was "a shocking and unjustifiable waste of money for Britain's taxpayers." He said: "Taxes are being wasted to build up beef mountains, butter mountains, lakes of wine, and in easy money for farmers to do nothing. The CAP is an ill-targeted investment which no loner serves the interest of farmers or rural communities." Mr Strang said there was strong support among the Socialist Group in the European parliament to reform the policy, which was given only a brief mention in the group's joint manifesto. He said Labour supported maintaining the EU's external tariff wall, which offers protection to European farmers against imports from other agricultural producers. The party would also argue for the continuation of limited schemes, such as one which helps farmers on poor land in hilly areas. Labour is seeking an end, however, to intervention buying -- which creates food mountains -- and export subsidies, which encourage dumping of cheap food on world markets. The party will also press for an end to the controversial set- aside system under which farmers are paid for not growing food on specified land. A Liberal Democrat policy paper, Reclaiming the Countryside, calls for replacement of the policy with a Common Rural Policy based on direct payments to farmers related to specified economic, environmental and social goals. Mr Paul Tyler, the party's rural affairs spokesman, said farmers knew that the existing system could not last. He said the 840m pounds-a-year cost of the UK set-aside programme was "largely wasted." The size of the paper it is two pages larger than the party's manifesto at 32 pages reflects the importance of a credible rural policy to the party if it is to make its long awaited electoral breakthrough. The Liberal Democrats' best chance of making headway lies across a swathe of Tory-held territory in rural southern England, where it hopes to convince Labour voters the election is "a two-horse race." In a clear pitch for the "Green" vote, the paper says a central aim of the proposed reforms is "to contribute to the objective of environmental sustainability." Mr Tyler also sought to attract rural voters by claiming that the government's plans to liberalise the Post Office demonstrated the Conservatives' "complacency on rural issues." Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, dismissed the proposals to reform the policy. She said that neither party "truly understands countryside concerns."
