He said records showed that there were 190 cases in January and February compared with 152 in 1992. Last year, there were 601 cases with one death in the state. The two-month figure also makes Penang the state with the highest number of cases for that period. "We are making efforts to control the disease in the state," he said after launching a blood donation campaign organised by the Selangor and Federal Territory Hainan Association at Thean Hou Temple. Lee said there were 5,598 dengue cases with 23 deaths in the country last year compared with 5,473 cases with 24 deaths in 1992. So far, the highest number or cases were recorded in 1991 -- 6,628 with 39 deaths. He attributed the large number of cases to the increase in the number of areas left as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and the ministry's ability to detect dengue cases better. Lee said the ministry and local authorities had intensified efforts to check the disease. He said 25,969 summonses were issued to those who had allowed Aedes mosqultoes to breed in their premises last year. During the same period, 1.2 million ringgit in compound was collected while 102 people were charged in court for related offences. Lee said the number of dengue cases were higher in urban areas. Last year there were 4,693 cases with 22 deaths in urban areas compared with 905 cases with one death in rural areas.
