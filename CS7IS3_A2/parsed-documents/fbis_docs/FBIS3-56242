The Polish lawmakers said the accord can be signed on condition that the predominantly Polish populated Vilnius and Salcininkai regions are given autonomy in culture and education; land is returned to Polish farmers who live on Lithuanian territory; Polish social organizations get back their property that was nationalized in 1939-1940; a Polish university is given the right to function in Vilnius. The 72 also demand to exclude the historic interpretation of the 1920 occupation of Vilnius and its region by Poland from the agreement "because it is contradictory" and can result in new arguments and may affect the status of Poles in Lithuania. The Polish lawmakers urge their country's leadership not to sign any additional declarations "which would create possibilities for various interpretations of the agreement and may be later directed against the interests of Lithuania's Poles." As previously reported, Lithuania agreed not to mention the 1920 invasion in the main agreement but demands to simultaneously sign a separate declaration on the matter. The Polish side said it sees no need to sign both document together. The 72 lawmakers also said the previous Polish government ignored their recommendations and urge the new administration "not to repeat the mistakes that may worsen the situation for fellow-countrymen in Lithuania."
