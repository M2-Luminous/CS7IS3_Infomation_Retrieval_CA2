Something like: "May has come--Shakhray has gone." This is because two years ago, also in May, Sergey Mikhaylovich had already submitted his resignation from the position of deputy chairman of the government. At that time he left for the president's circle, to engage in the creation of the GPU [expansion not given], and returned to the government only after a year-and-a-half and "through the Caucasus," where he tried to smoothe over the sins of another deputy chairman of the government, trying to somehow extinguish the fire of the Osetin-Ingush conflict. Sergey Mikhaylovich recalls that voluntary resignation without any satisfaction. He says, "I demonstrated that I did not have a death grip on the minister's portfolio. And what did I have to gain? Only a sense of my own moral satisfaction from the fact that I showed character." There is some logic in this: When you answer for some serious matter, stop and think how your personal ambitions will be reflected in this matter. But quite recently, last December, Shakhray was once again deprived of the post of deputy chairman of the government, and this time not through his own will. (Chernomyrdin was ready to take him into his renewed command only in the rank of minister), and Sergey Mikhaylovich agreed, justifying his decision, among other things, by his desire simply to remain on the political scene: "If one expects a political future, one cannot absolutely distance oneself from power." Five more months went by--and again a resignation. Again a voluntary one. "In connection with the appointment of a new minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy even without a formal consideration of the opinion of the deputy chairman of the government who deals with national and regional policy, I ask to be relieved of my duties as deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government." So, think what you like about these politicians. He had just achieved Chernomyrdin's recognition, gotten back the deputy chairmanship, and was introduced into the Security Council. It is true, they deprived him of the minister's portfolio, but three other "deputies" also do not have one--Oleg Soskovets, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and Yuriy Yarov. Yet Nikolay Travkin, who had just been brought into the government as who knows what, agreed to the position of "minister without a portfolio." Meanwhile, Shakhray retained relations with the mass media on the government line (the dream of any politician--to be in charge of the press!), interaction with public organizations and parties (i.e., the full opportunity to strengthen his own PRES [Party for Russian Unity and Accord] at state expense), and also no one removed Sergey Mikhaylovich from treatment of questions of national and regional policy. "When they dismissed me from the deputy chairmanship, I stayed on to work because I had in my hands a ministry which is becoming a real instrument for implementation of regional and national policy," explained Shakhray. "For the first time the ministry had in its hands real levers--money--7.3 trillion rubles (R) for food to be brought into the rayons of the Far North, R40 billion for aid to Germans in Russia, R20 billion in budget funds for the national-cultural rebirth of the peoples of Russia..." All of this was "hammered out" by Shakhray. And suddenly this was "all" given to someone else. And not just to anyone, but in essence to his political rival--the head of administration of Krasnodar Kray, Nikolay Yegorov, with whom Shakhray had long "not formed relations." In such a situation, how can the deputy chairman of government be in charge of a minister if the minister occupies "an independent place in the structure of state power" (that is the status that Shakhray was also "hammering out"), and who must even replace his own curator in the President's Council on Cadre Policy--a position defined at Shakhray's request as being ministerial "in duty," but not falling under the deputy chairman of government. In other words, now there are no real levers for influencing events in the country. It is true, there is a broad field of activity for political intrigues. Vladimir Shumeyko, for example, had been in such a situation and emerged from it with a large gain. And what about Shakhray--did he become insulted? "My resignation does not mean a departure to the opposition of the president and the government," Shakhray explained to journalists. "It also does not signify any personal insult, although I am also a human being and react to the situation as any normal person would." Here we should note in parentheses that the PRES leader did not coordinate his decision either with the party or with the party's faction in the Duma. Even that Tuesday morning, Sergey Stankevich announced to journalists that the faction's council had decided to forbid Shakhray from leaving the government. At the same time, Shakhray himself was already submitting his resignation to the chairman of the government. Which, it seems, did not make Chernomyrdin very happy. Although Viktor Stepanovich had to know what Shakhray's replacement with Yegorov in the ministerial post might mean. But... "From a constitutional standpoint, the appointment and dismissal of ministers is the prerogative of the president. He can do so only at the written nomination of the chairman of government. These formalities were upheld, but no more than that," Sergey Mikhaylovich explained certain details of his resignation from the ministerial post, clearly hinting that Chernomyrdin "was not to blame." Then who was? "I would like to hope that the appointment of a new minister is not associated with my directive regarding a financial investigation within the system of the former Goskomsever [State Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North], just as it is not associated with pressure by various groups in Krasnodar Kray and their representatives in Moscow," Shakhray stated in his supplemental announcement regarding the reasons for his resignation. This phrase can also be called nothing other than a hint. Especially its second part--about the "Moscow representatives of Kuban," of which Vladimir Shumeyko is deservedly considered the leader (and, we might add, a long-time patron of Nikolay Yegorov). He has repeatedly announced that Boris Yeltsin "consults on cadre questions" specifically with him. Then again, Sergey Mikhaylovich has a number of ill-wishers also in the president's administration, which would itself like to manage and direct the policy in relations with the regions. Shakhray believes that the presidential administration's management of work with the territories must move away from petty patronage of the regions and concentrate on the development of political decisions, but... Even the chief of this administration, Nikolay Medvedev, who was recently removed at the demand of the governors, has once again been appointed as acting chief of this same administration. And the edict on appointment of a new minister in Shakhray's place was approved by Sergey Filatov, with whom Shakhray recently waged a stubborn struggle over the conditions of agreement with Chechnya and over who, Filatov or Shakhray, should head up the Russian delegation at the negotiations. "In principle I never became one of the president's own men," Sergey Shakhray said almost two years ago, after that first resignation. "They reconciled themselves with me, admitted that sometimes I would give sound advice and propose fairly good draft laws. But on a personal plane, I annoyed many..." We will add to this that Sergey Mikhaylovich "annoyed," as a rule, not so much his enemies as the people whom he should have considered "his own," people from the presidential command, from the governmental command. Even at the very beginning of his joint work with Boris Yeltsin, when there was a full opportunity to select the "lawful" Shakhray as first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, he did not get to become even Yeltsin's deputy, "and not without the `help' of Yeltsin's closest advisors" (Shakhray's own words). Even later, working within the make-up of the Gaydar and Chernomyrdin governments, he often saw (or felt?) what steps were being taken by his supposed comrades in arms to move the competitor away from the president or the chairman of government. "It is not only the jealousy which exists in the apparatus that is unpleasant. It is much more unpleasant to encounter those methods which the apparatus is ready to use under the influence of this jealousy...", admitted Shakhray. But he did not go into detail, did not divulge the secrets of the "kitchen." "I know everything--I will say nothing!", he once waved reporters away at one of the press conferences. Of course, politics has its secrets, and one who has "sold" them will later be shunned both by his own and by others. Yet one cannot help but ask: What is this "Kremlin kitchen," if Shakhray, who even in the Caucasus was more or less able to get along with the mutually hostile sides of the Osetin-Ingush conflict, could not find even long-term partners in Moscow, in the "circles close to the ruling circles." It is true, he was not the only one. A recent study conducted by the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Sociology Institute regarding the fates of the old nomenklatura in the current echelons of power showed how the "old tried and true cadres" are invariably returning to their circles, and how the new ones are being forced out. Already today among those surrounding Yeltsin there are only 10.5 percent of the people who came to power with Yeltsin himself or during his time. Thirty-seven percent are still holdovers from the Brezhnev era, and 39 percent--from Gorbachev's. Even two years ago the picture was entirely different. But today there is a definition about the "newcomers" as being "democratic flies who have gotten bogged down in the thick soup of autocratism." Although by a large account, even among the "new flies" far from all are "democrats." We might add that even quite recently the views of Sergey Shakhray himself, with only a big stretch, could be called "fully democratic." It is enough to remember at least the draft law prepared by him in January of '92, "On Ensuring the Effect of Russian Federation Legislation," with its specific responsibility for actions contradicting the edicts of the president and the interests of the Russian Federation. "Under this law, if it were adopted now, one could today expand whatever one liked, political and physical annihilation of the opposition," the then-Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov said in horror, and ultimately persuaded the president to recall this draft law. In Spring of that same year, Shakhray prepared an analytical paper for the president, in which he proposed to Boris Yeltsin that he announce the possible declaration of a state of emergency in the country, although, it is true, in the most extreme case. A year later these recommendations became the basis for the famous OPUS [Osoboye Poryadok Upravleniya Stranoy-play on word ~opus", meaning "work"]. And only now, it seems, has Sergey Mikhaylovich's militancy declined, and his desire to reach national and social reconciliation has increased. Announcing his resignation, Shakhray advised the president and the government to first of all "activate the Agreement on Civic Accord so that it would not remain merely on paper, so that the coordinating commission which is being created would force everyone who signed this agreement to really work..." Having listed several other points of the program of action which the authorities should have implemented "even yesterday," Shakhray predicted that otherwise... "...In July--the first wave of discontent in the defense industry collectives and the demonstrations by part of the military servicemen and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. The problem, it is true, will resolve itself thanks to vacations and summer in general." "But as of August the situation may go into the next phase, under which Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to retire. Moreover, he will himself have to announce his retirement so as to diffuse the situation in society as a whole and in the State Duma in particular. Efforts at coordinating the Duma of the new prime minister--and there are only three real candidacies: Luzhkov, Soskovets and Skokov--these efforts under conditions when the Duma will be "revving up" in opposition to the president, will lead to activization of the scenarios for disbanding the Duma with an effort to announce new elections. Or more precisely, to put off the elections altogether in view of the low activity of the population." "But suddenly it will turn out that the Duna does not intend to disband itself. The Federation Council, upon change of the role of the government and the relationship between the government and the president, will go over to the president's opposition. And the October-December scenario, when the radical opposition will act under the principle of "the worse it is, the better," raising up the people to a social riot, may repeat the worst variant of October of last year..." This is what Sergey Shakhray predicted, stipulating, it is true, that this is the "blackest" of all possible scenarios, that the president, government and parliament will not allow such a thing. He personally remains an optimist and even intends to go on his scheduled vacation. Until August?
