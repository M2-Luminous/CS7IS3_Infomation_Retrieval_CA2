Compared with 1992, last year saw a lot more requests received from foreign law enforcement authorities for assistance in investigating international drug trafficking activities. The Drug Investigation Department of the police last year received some 330 such requests from foreign law enforcement authorities, up 50 percent from the 1992 records. According to an official of this department, the continuous increase in such requests in recent years is due to the fact that drug traffickers are using Hong Kong as a connection spot for their activities and as a place for money laundering. Meanwhile, the route of drug trafficking has also changed in recent years. Because of Hong Kong's effective anti-drug work, there are less traffickers using Hong Kong as a transshipment point. Instead, most drugs are now going directly from the Golden Triangle to their destinations, primarily European and American countries. Currently, Hong Kong has signed bilateral agreements with 11 countries on cooperation in investigating transnational drug trafficking and money laundering. The agreements also cover the exchange of suspects arrested in each other's side. Over the past four years, Hong Kong has repatriated close to 100 suspects to their original countries for trial. The Drug Investigation Department of the police says that all transnational drug trafficking groups are characterized by a strong organizational power, adding that it will beef up cooperation with foreign countries in expanding the informational network so as to deal blows at international drug trafficking.
