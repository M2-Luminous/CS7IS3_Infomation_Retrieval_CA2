FR940830-2-00111 FR940830-2-00057 MEMORANDUM Date: June 22, 1994 To: All Quest Network Participants From: Mike McEvoy, President, Transaction Services Company Subject: Future Direction of the Quest Network On May 10, 1993, the Quest Network sent a memorandum to your organization that outlined our commitment to continue providing Quest-branded services to financial institutions throughout this market area. Since that communication a year ago, several major announcements and changes have occurred which has resulted in a re-assessment of the ongoing viability of the Quest Network and the services offered under the Quest brand. Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (EPS) is a Delaware corporation currently owned by four bank holding companies: Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; CoreStates Financial Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; KeyCorp, Albany, New York (successor to Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio); and PNC Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These four bank holding companies have consolidated their various ATM/POS networks (MAC, Owl, Jubilee, Tri-Net and Green Machine) into EPS under the MAC brand name. EPS has also announced plans to add two additional equity owners: Mellon Bank Corporation and National City Corporation. Locally and regionally, the affiliates of PNC Bank, Bank One, and National City Bank will actively participate in the MAC network and will be converting their cardholder base and ATM terminals to the MAC brand. Liberty National Bank, which is being acquired by Banc One Corporation, has also joined and will likewise actively participate in the MAC network. Liberty will be converting their cardholder base and ATM terminals to the MAC brand, and will be re-marketing MAC access to other financial institutions throughout the region. These developments will cause a majority of the ATM and POS transactions currently processed by the Quest Network to be converted to the MAC brand. It is difficult to develop a reasonable long-term business case for the continuation of the Quest Network and its Quest brand when a significant portion of the transaction processing business will be directed to the MAC network. The owners of the Quest Network believe that the time to begin an orderly transition from the Quest brand is at hand. The Quest Network will offer transition assistance to each of its participants, if requested, and has begun to develop a plan to assist those participants wishing to convert to the MAC network. The Quest Network will also assist participants that wish to convert to another network, if requested. This transition period will begin in July 1994 and will conclude by June 1995. The Quest Network, therefore, does not expect to operate beyond June 1, 1995. We appreciate your past loyalty, support and participation in the Quest Network and pledge to work with you and your processors to effect a timely transition with minimal disruption to your financial institution and your customers. If you have questions, please feel free to contact any of the owners of the Quest Network regarding any aspect of this announcement. Wallace A. Fudold, Executive Vice President, Bank of Louisville.
