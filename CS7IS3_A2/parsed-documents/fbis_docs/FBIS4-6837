FBIS4-6837 "dreas079_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 South Korea Reaction to Prime Minister Resignation Continues Reaction to Prime Minister Resignation Continues Dailies Discuss Resignation SK2304084694 SK2304084694 BFN [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 23 April carry editorials and articles on the resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on 22 April, one day after he lashed out at the decision-making process of the Kim Yong-sam administration by requesting, during a meeting with his senior aides on 21 April, that every decision of the administration go through prior discussions by the cabinet. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word article by reporter Choe Yong-muk entitled "Why Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang Resigned." The article describes the prime minister's resignation as "shocking," and notes, "It seems that Prime Minister Yi had complained about President Kim's mode of managing state affairs and his reform style." The article then cites recent episodes that apparently angered the prime minister -- the presidential office's habit of belittling and sidelining the prime minister's office, such as the instance when the prime minister strongly objected to the Presidential Office directive on the contents of the prime minister's statement of apology to the people in connection with the government's handling of the Uruguay Round; the lukewarm investigation of the Samgmudae financial scandal; and above all, the manner in which the prime minister was sidelined by not being included in the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Meeting. The article concludes, "The prime minister must have thought since his proposals were flatly ignored, this meant that President Kim would not fully recognize the cabinet and instead wanted a `quasi-prime minister,' and this was something the prime minister could never accept." The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word article by reporter Kim Chang-ki entitled "Upright Prime Minister Resigns in Four Months--Background and Prospects for Future Political Scene." The editorial notes that the prime minister's sudden resignation on 22 April has driven the entire political situation on alert and says, "The resignation of a prime minister in this manner is very unusual and thrusts the Kim Yong-sam government into suddenly having to confront a surging wave of problems. In particular, since the Kim Yong-sam government that was launched under the signboard of reform selected Prime Minister Yi, the virtual star of reforms and the standard-bearer of audits and inspections, his resignation must come as a serious blow and burden to the Kim Yong-sam government. This must compel President Kim to modify his style of managing state affairs and to reconsider his policy options." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Prime Minister's Sudden Resignation." The editorial begins, "The prime minister's sudden resignation is very shocking. It is far from an ordinary development because Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang has resigned within four months of his assumption of office and because his resignation resulted from his complaint about the government's management of state affairs." The editorial then notes, "Whatever the background and reason for his resignation may be, the prime minister's resignation is causing considerable damage to President Kim Yong-sam's personnel policy. President Kim Yong-sam must have been aware of Mr. Yi Hoe-chang's strong convictions and upright character when choosing him." The editorial concludes, "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation brings up the old issue in which the prime minister is put in a difficult position regarding his role and maneuverability under a president-centered form of government. Nevertheless, the prime minister's control over the cabinet and his policy coordinating role should be enhanced. For this, the prime minister's authority should be respected." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's Convictions." The editorial begins, "It is a shocking development that Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, who is noted for his uncompromising convictions, should have suddenly resigned on 22 April." The editorial notes Prime Minister Yi's strong complaint about the way the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee was run and his resolve to restore the authority and function of the prime minister and the cabinet, which the presidential office regard as a challenge to the presidential office." The editorial then notes that the people were glad to see a prime minister of conviction who differed from previous rubber-stamping prime ministers who are referred to as "prime ministers who only read what someone else has written for them" and "powerless madams," but that he had to leave office before being able to put his convictions into practice. The editorial asserts that his resignation will provide a fresh jolt to the world where many are changing their convictions to hold on to their posts." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Sudden Replacement of the Prime Minister." The editorial begins: "The sudden reprimand to and replacement of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the ensuing sudden appointment of Yi Yong-tok, the acting prime minister, is an unusual development that shocks and perplexes the people. It is certainly unfortunate that the president should have reprimanded the prime minister for his irregular words and actions and fired him. Nevertheless, we positively evaluate the president's swift action in appointing a replacement to launch a new cabinet instead of concealing the problem, which is an expression of an active will to turn the misfortune to an advantage." The editorial notes the need for the government to establish order and discipline, and rebukes Prime Minister Yi for his unprudent words and actions openly revealing his complaint about the operation of the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee. The editorial concludes: "Prime Minister Yi's resignation should not be construed as a deterioration of reform. We must support the president's resolve in executing state affairs productively and efficiently in harmony and team work to fully utilize the advantage of the year without elections." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's Sudden Resignation--the Retreat of a `Law-Upholding Man' Could Mean a Return to Conservatism." The editorial begins: "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden resignation is an incident of grave importance leading the people into uneasy worries, not to mention the fact that it will deal the Kim Yong-sam regime a political blow." The editorial notes: "Prime Minister Yi had an upright character and held convictions upholding the law, commanding high popularity with the people. The people expected that he would excellently carry out his role as a coordinator in the government to augment the clumsy execution of power of the civilian government." The editorial continues: "It is quite natural that we should be led to suspect that the prime minister's sudden resignation may reflect the problems in President Kim's ruling style and his mode of executing state affairs. Therefore, his resignation could lead the people to suspect that the government is abandoning the law-abiding ethos and returning to the old practice of looking for expediency in violation of the law, thus damaging the civilian government's resolve for reform and political morality." The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN carries on page 2 a 1,500-word article entitled "The Greatest Political Crisis--Striving To Find a Way Out." The article begins: "Political circles regard the contingency created by the resignation of the prime minister unprecedented in the constitutional history as the greatest political crisis facing the Kim Yong-sam government, and are striving to find a way out of this crisis." The article notes a comment by an unidentified senior official of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party that `The sudden resignation of the prime minister could kindle a fire to the disharmony lurking within the ruling camp. The opposition parties and other forces critical of the government will initiate a political offensive, which could lead to the discussion of an overall realignment of political circles.'" The article then notes the comment by the opposition Democratic Party that `Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden resignation well reveals President Kim Yong-sam's weak personnel policy.'" The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Replacement of the Prime Minister in Four Months." The editorial begins: "It is regrettable that Mr. Yi Hoe-chang resigned as prime minister in only four months since he assumed office. Different from the former prime ministers who were described as a `powerless madame' and a `prime minister who only read what someone else wrote for him,' he played a central role in the cabinet with his convictions and demonstrated his competence and reasonableness in coping with various difficult pending issues of the country." The editorial continues: "We think it is a troublesome development that the replacement of the prime minister was made very abruptly and that Prime Minister Yi resigned because of the difference of his view from that of the presidential office over the policy-making process. Yi Hoe-chang's resignation means not only replacing the prime minister himself, but the resignation of all the cabinet members he recommended and the formation of a new cabinet, which is an enormous state event. The abrupt action of this magnitude not only shocks the entire society, but is undesirable for the stable operation of state affairs." The editorial concludes: "The uproarious replacement of the prime minister has to be a political blow to President Kim. President Kim, who professed personnel action to be a matter of foremost importance, appointed a new prime minister for the third time in one year and two months and is to reshuffle the cabinet in four months. This must burden him. We urge the government to reestablish as soon as possible the posture for stable execution of state affairs."
