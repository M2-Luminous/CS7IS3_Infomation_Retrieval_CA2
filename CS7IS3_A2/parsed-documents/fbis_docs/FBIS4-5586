The committee initially planned to send four of its legislators to Moscow and Khabarovsk to observe loggers' conditions before a special assembly sitting opens in May. "The dispatch of a fact-finding team is not always needed in determining the conditions of North Korean loggers there," Kang Sin- che, chairman of the committee's ad hoc committee on North Korean loggers, said on Tuesday. He said Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visits Moscow in the immediate future and there have been other frequent contacts between the two countries over the diplomatic channel. Kang said he was withholding the dispatch. But, the plan seems to have been scrapped altogether. "At the moment, we have no plan to send a survey team to Russia," an official of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee said.
