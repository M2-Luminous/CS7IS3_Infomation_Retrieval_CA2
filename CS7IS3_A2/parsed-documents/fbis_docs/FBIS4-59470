[Al-Sakit] The mission is in implementation of the Arab League Council's decision of 7 May expressing the Council's concern about developments in Yemen and its desire for peace and stability in this Arab state and founder of the Arab League. Arab League Secretary General Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has received scores of cables and messages from Arab leaders and popular and nongovernmental organizations demanding that the Arab League play a role in this regard. [Correspondent] An Arab League role is required, as you have mentioned, but have you sensed a response by the Yemeni leaders accepting the Arab League mediation? [Al-Sakit] All the Yemeni leaders and people are eager to see an end to the bloodshed in the Republic of Yemen and to cling to legitimacy and to the Yemeni territories' unity and stability. [Correspondent] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has appealed to the Arab League and fraternal Arab countries to intervene to halt the fighting. This means that the southerners are willing to stem the bloodshed and end the war. What about the northerners? [Al-Sakit] Everyone is demanding a cease-fire. It is in no one's interest that the bloodshed should continue in Yemen. All the Yemeni parties are very eager to stop the bloodshed but the situation requires some contacts, consultation, and [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] Sanaa has reportedly rejected a YSP proposal to halt the fighting and control the crisis. [Al-Sakit] As I said, the sides are eager to initiate the measures necessary to stem the bloodshed. [Correspondent] Does this mean that the door to dialogue has not been closed and that there is still hope that the parties will resume dialogue and that a political solution to the crisis will be reached? [Al-Sakit] We think so. God willing, the situation will end as the sincere people of the Arab nation desire. [Correspondent] Will the League delegation head for Aden? [Al-Sakit] The situation is not clear.
