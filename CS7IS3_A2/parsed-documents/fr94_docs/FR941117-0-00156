FR941117-0-00156 FR941117-0-00011 (2) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the supervisory audio tones must be # 2 kHz. (3) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the signaling tone must be # 8 kHz. (4) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from wideband data signals must be # 8 kHz. (c) Deviation limitation circuitry. Cellular transmitters must be equipped with circuitry that automatically prevents modulation levels for voice transmissions from exceeding the limits specified in this section. (d) Audio filter characteristics. Except as provided in ยง22.917, radiotelephony signals applied to the modulator from the modulation limiter must be attenuated as a function of frequency as specified in this paragraph. (1) For mobile stations, these signals must be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, as follows: (i) In the frequency ranges of 3.0 to 5.9 kHz and 6.1 to 15.0 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f 3) dB, where f is the frequency of the signal in kHz. (ii) In the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz, signals must be attenuated at least 35 dB. (iii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated at least 28 dB. (2) For base stations, these signals shall be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, as follows: (i) In the frequency range of 3 to 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f 3) dB, where f is the frequency of the signal in kHz. (ii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 28 dB. (3) Filtering is not required for the supervisory audio tones, signaling tones or wideband data signals. ยง22.917 Emission limitations for cellular. The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. (a) Analog radiotelephony emissions. F3E emissions must be used only on the communication channels. (b) F3E/F3D emission mask for use with audio filter. For F3E and F3D emissions, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier wave (P) as follows: (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz: at least 26 dB; (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 45 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency: at least 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation. (c) Alternative F3E/F3D emission mask. For F3E and F3D emissions, transmitters may comply with the emission limitations in this paragraph in lieu of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section and the audio filter requirement of ยง22.915. (1) The mean power of any emission removed from the carrier frequency by a displacement frequency (f d in kHz) must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) as follows: (i) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 12 kHz but not more than 20 kHz: at least 117 log (f d 12) dB; (ii) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency: at least 100 log (f d 11) dB or 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation; (2) For mobile stations, modulating signals other than the supervisory audio tone in the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz must be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, at least 35 dB. (d) F1D emission mask. For F1D emissions, the mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) as follows: (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz: at least 26 dB; (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 45 kHz but not more than 90 kHz: at least 45 dB;
