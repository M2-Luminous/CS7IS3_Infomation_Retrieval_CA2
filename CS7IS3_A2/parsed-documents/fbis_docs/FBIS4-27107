The traitor Kim Yong-sam, who swore an oath to serve the United States, is zealously toeing the master's policy of aggression and war and working for the latter's interests, the article says, and continues: Depending on the American master for its survival, the Kim Yong- sam group is entreating him for "protection" and for the permanent presence of U.S. Forces in South Korea. The puppets have never let a chance pass by without describing the U.S. Forces in South Korea as "a deterrent to war" and "apostle of peace." They are making no bones about donating billions of dollars every year for keeping the U.S. troops in South Korea. Not contented with this, they have left South Korea as a test ground of "the new military strategy" of the U.S. Forces and a military intelligence base against the North. The Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed, a group of traitors trying to slay the fellow countrymen in the North with the sword of outside forces. The puppets are trying to stifle the North, serving as a shock brigade in the nuclear clamour of the imperialist reactionaries. There have been no small number of traitors in South Korea. But there has never been such a fellow as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is running about so desperately to slay fellow countrymen with the help of outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam's is really a group of traitors outstripping their predecessors, traitors without an equal.
