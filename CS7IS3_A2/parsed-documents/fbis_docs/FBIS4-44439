Question: What are your impressions of Taiwan after being back over a year? Answer: I feel that the whole society appears to be lawless. Whether in daily life or in the state of mind, or in achieving goals it appears that they can be unscrupulous. Also the whole society is pursuing money. Even the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) by existing in the society cannot completely escape the influence of this social atmosphere. So, we say that the DPP is becoming more and more like the Kuomintang (KMT). When it was founded, the party was modeled on the KMT. It also has a central standing committee and the central standing committee meets on Wednesday. Even its policies are becoming closer and closer to those of the KMT. [passage omitted.] Question: After you returned to the country, you went to several places helping in the election of DPP candidates. What did you learn from this? Answer: All together I helped in the election of three public officials. I am not a member of the DPP, but I believe that if Taiwan democracy is to get on track, it is necessary to have a relatively strong opposition party. Following this thinking, I went everywhere to help in the election of DPP candidates. Naturally, I could not help those who were too lacking in image. I wanted to hear DPP audiences and I think that at first I was relatively supportive of the DPP and relatively interested in current events. The occasion were all very enthusiastic, it is just that I do not know how big a share of the people of the countryside they make up. For example, the day that the campaign office for the reelection of Su Chen-ch'ang, the former county executive of P'ing-tung County, was established, more than 30,000 people participated. The scene was so enthusiastic, but he still was defeated. There also was the scene for Hua-lien's Ch'en Yung-hsing. I also went twice. The scene was very moving. There was a graduate of the chemical engineering department of Taiwan University in his forties who had never before participated in politics, but he ran up on the stage to help in Ch'en Yung-hsing's election. He spoke and really moved people. I also did not understand why Ch'en Yung-hsing later trailed the KMT candidate by more than 40,000 votes. I think vote buying could certainly have had an influence on the election. There is nothing wrong with everyone's being enthusiastic about the election. The problem is that the election turned out this way. How many hundred million yuan must be spent to elect a legislator? This is twisted. What meaning is there to this kind of election? If Americans or Japanese heard that several hundred million had to be spent to elect a Taiwan legislator, they simply would have no way to imagine it. Moreover, this does not help democracy in the least. However, there is a saying, when things get their worst, they cannot get any worse, they can only turn around, there is no where to go. I hope that the benefits from vote buying will slowly diminish and ultimately no one will buy votes. Also, there is Taiwan's county executive and mayoralty elections. Actually it is like TIENHSIA magazine pointed out last year in its article ("Behind County Executive and Mayoralty Elections---Contending To Grab Land Wealth," November Issue). It is to fight for municipal planning rights and making money by speculating on land. When I went to Tainan's Yung-k'ang County to help in the election, I heard that a candidate wanted to spend 1 billion. He certainly would be elected. I also heard that the mayor of a rather large city after he was elected looked for places to redo the municipal plan. In the 4 billion plan, the mayor himself would take 500 million. Question: You have sacrificed and strived your whole life for Taiwan democracy. What are your feelings when you see these things? Answer: I feel that it is very ironic and very distressing. Before I returned home, I was in contact with several friends who often went in and out of Taiwan and had a good understanding of Taiwan. They laughed at me and said, "Are the Taiwan people worth the sacrifice that you are making? If you went to see, you would know." Also once at a public lecture in Hawaii with an audience of 300 or 400, someone stood up and said that what I said was very right, very ideal, and very reasonable, but if you went back to Taiwan and said these things, everyone would laugh at you. He asked what kind of a society is Taiwan now? He said, if you did not yield on the road, the cars would crush you to death. Taiwan is a dog eat dog society. I had no way to reply to him. I said to him that this society still needs a fool saying some foolish things. Taiwan is a society totally lacking in idealism. If you talk about ideals, people would say that this is because you do not understand reality. When I returned, I assumed it had a little bit of significance, if only to see if I could arouse some idealism. Talking this way people could think that I am too naive, but this is exactly what I think. Taiwan's frame of mind, character, and sentiments are all extremely low, and no one has the ability to reflect. It is as if they cannot stop and think and visualize themselves. Everything appears to be a sham. Question: What should an ideal society be? Answer: Democracy is one ideal, and establishing a clean, fair, just, and harmonious society also is an ideal. The pursuit of ideals sounds very far off. For example, in pursuing democracy we will never reach perfection, but we can gradually improve on various defects and become a society that is a little less defective. American black people have already been free 100 or 200 years and discrimination against black people still has not been resolved, but it is generally much better than fifty or one hundred years ago. Kindergarten children have begun to have it instilled in them that they cannot discriminate on the basis of race. Question: Taiwan has so many problems. Where do you think the greatest problem or the greatest challenge is? Answer: I do not think that there is only one. I am not an expert in environmental protection or the economy, but both of these are very important. Taiwan's environmental protection problem is very serious. In Taiwan I am most concerned about food. We do not know if the vegetables and fish that we eat are safe or not. But the average person does not feel that the environmental protection issue is urgent. I recently saw a report that said that Asia's environmental pollution is the most serious, more serious than any place else. Someone has studied Thai children's intelligence quotients. Because of lead poisoning, they are at least four points lower than normal children. Taiwan also could have this problem. We should study it. I personally have always been interested in politics. If you ask me what is Taiwan's most important issue, I think that it is relations with the mainland. This involves our existence. [passage omitted.] I am very concerned as regards our stand after the government and society have decided to persist in safeguarding our sovereignty. Have they thought it out extremely carefully? The Chinese Communist policy calling for unity and calling for one country, two systems could threaten the future existence of all Taiwan's residents. But what is Taiwan's policy toward the mainland? It would not threaten the Chinese Communists in the least. So, Taiwan must be extremely careful and deal with mainland relations cautiously. What makes me extremely sad and uneasy is that even our leaders often say that wherever the Chinese Communists' bottom line is, we do not want to touch it, especially after they issued the Taiwan White Paper. But what I want to ask is, where is our bottom line? If we do not have a bottom line, forget about a clear-cut surrender. In the past, Taiwan spent several hundreds of billions every year on national defense, and in the 1960s every year 80 percent of the national budget was invested in national defense, buying weapons and training a large army to fight the Chinese Communists. But now it appears that they have leapt to the other extreme. If they take a little action, they are afraid that the Chinese Communists will get angry. Do we not even have the capability to protect ourselves? Where did those large armies run off to? When a society's basic rights are threatened, including its sense of value, education and culture, economy, and life style, if it does not decide to rise to its own defense, this society is not qualified to exist. This is not favoring war, but no matter what this determination must be maintained. A country such as Finland only has a population of 4 million, but when it stood up to defend itself and protect its religion, lifestyle, and concepts, even the Soviet Union had no choice. What I would like to ask is why people now do not identify with this government and this place? The government's past style did not have public trust. Everything that they said was false and it caused people to become very cynical. As when they spoke for several decades about counterattacking the mainland, essentially no one believed it. As a result, it was one thing in public and another thing in private and they could not foster everyone's patriotism. In January of this year before leaving the United States, I had a discussion with Taiwan overseas students. They said that from the time that they were small, at home they heard about engineering fraud cases. They were used to hearing it and believed that it was true, but they would not get indignant. They only asked if they could profit to some extent from it. They did not have a concept of right and wrong. Question: So, how should it be improved? Where will the way out for Taiwan be? Answer: Everyone says that we should begin with national education, and I agree. But the biggest problem is that Taiwan does not have idealism. National leaders should no longer engage in factional struggles, but they should arouse ideals. National goals should be determined, whether they are democracy, fairness, or cleanliness, you should make people feel that you are doing something real and that leaders really mean this in reforming the mood of society. They speak this way now, but they do not have public confidence. No one believes them. They think that they are speaking slogans. Perhaps President Lee Teng-hui is too busy with many problems, but he should emphasize it more. For example, the government speaks publicly against using bribery to win elections, but in fact all the KMT candidates buy votes. When they are nominated, they also look to see how much money they have. If the upper echelon leaders speak, but do not act, the common people can see it. It is as if no one can see hope, even the DPP are about the same. Unless a group has a great deal of determination, it will be influenced by the mood of society. The DPP themselves also acknowledge that they have been greatly influenced by the mood of society and are slowly losing their idealism. Question: So, what should everyone do? Where is Taiwan's future? Answer: Actually every problem by no means has a specific cure, and my thinking about Taiwan's future is no secret. First we must preserve Taiwan's present sovereignty and seek the most suitable method to get along with the Chinese Communists. I am not so pessimistic on this point. [Passage omitted.] There also is what I call "the externally oriented economy and the internally oriented politics." The economy develops externally and politics should not always be entangled with the Chinese Communists. We should spare no effort to improve on internal politics and systems. Internal improvement also is an assurance for Taiwan and lets the whole world see improvements in Taiwan living standard, society, and government based on the will of the people. Question: Is the present government not already based on the will of the people? Answer: What we should ask about is not form, but content. In form we have elections, but what kind of elections? How much does it cost to elect a legislator? In the United States or Japan it would be unimaginable. There also are a great many landed people who even get involved in the election to protect their own land. There also is the question of what the government of the "Republic of China" indicates. Does it still include the mainland and Outer Mongolia? A government must have a clear definition. We should pursue a truly fair, open, and clean society. This is our bottom line. It is not a national flag and it is not the issue of a name. In its system the government should do a great many things. Whether the president is directly elected or not is not necessarily the most important. Besides ideals there are several more practical and realistic issues. Question: How do you place your own role? Will you get directly involved in politics or not? Answer: I study politics and criticize from a political perspective. I do not necessarily want to directly participate in political activities. My foundation has just been established. Later we can conduct some more scholarly symposia. As most symposia now generally seek mostly famous people to come and talk, they very seldom ask young people to come and express their views on the mainland issue, and environmental protection and women's issues. So, I intend to ask many more of these young people to come and talk about what they think after all. Question: Since the break up of the Soviet Union, United States-Japanese relations have changed and relations with the mainland also have changed. What opportunities does Taiwan have in this kind of situation? Is this beneficial to Taiwan or not? [passage omitted.] Answer: In the present world the most important issue still is the economy. No matter what Taiwan's politics are like, how much status it has internationally completely depends on economics. The government must give absolute priority to economics and use economics to lead politics. How do we continue to develop the economy? Do we have this kind of power or can we play some role between the United States and Japan? A policy such as the southern orientation should have been promoted early on. We should not concentrate all of our investment in the mainland. Although I suspect that it is a little late to promote it now, it is still good. Question: Might you come out and run for president? Answer: I am still evaluating and considering that. If I really want to come out, I will need a great deal of courage, to pay a big price, and even have a spirit of sacrifice. But no matter what, I must make people feel that a new era has begun with a completely different way of doing things than in the past. The important thing for me to consider now is whether I have this capability to change society. The KMT president still is doing rather well. It will still be very hard for the opposition party president to do, even if he is elected. But basically I still feel rather comfortable being a scholar.
