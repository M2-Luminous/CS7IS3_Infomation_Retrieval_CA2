FBIS4-16290 "drsov073_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Latvia President Reviews Results of European Trip President Reviews Results of European Trip WS1504082094 Tallinn BNS in English 1614 GMT 14 Apr 94 WS1504082094 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Excerpts] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- The European countries endorse the present Latvian stance in relations with Russia, the Baltic nation's President Guntis Ulmanis told reporters Thursday [14 April] on return from his European trip. During his three-day journey, Ulmanis met with 16 top level leaders of Denmark, France and Great Britain and learned that the issue of relations between Latvia and Russia would be considered in the European Union's [EU] Political Committee. [passage omitted] Ulmanis and European politicians discussed a possibility to create a special foundation to help Russia's military retirees return to their historic homeland. The foundation could be sponsored by European countries, the Latvian president said. Consequently, the return of war pensioners to Russia could be settled "in a civilized manner," Ulmanis said. The foundation's resources could also be used to clean the environmental damage from the Russian-operated radar facility at Skrunda. The Latvian Cabinet has already set up a working party to draft the foundation's statutes. Ulmanis reiterated that the package of withdrawal agreements would not be signed unless Yeltsin revoked the April 5 directive. In addition, Ulmanis claims that the initialed agreements should be amended before signature in view of the setup of the mentioned foundation. Latvia's people staunchly reject several terms in the agreements judging by "thousands of letters with many signatures," Ulmanis noted. The very idea to create the military personnel repatriation foundation belongs to one of their authors. Taking into account the interior situation in Latvia and Russia, Latvia cannot try to begin talks on entirely new agreements on troop withdrawal, Ulmanis said. Ulmanis quoted European politicians as praising the agreement on Russian troop withdrawal by Aug. 31 as a considerable achievement of the Latvian diplomacy. The signature of the troop withdrawal treaty is considered a basic prerequisite for Latvia's acceptance to the European Union, Ulmanis said. Foreign Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Martins Virsis, who accompanied Ulmanis to Europe, said that EU is unlikely to enroll countries that are unable to settle their relations with neighbors. Consequently, Latvia has to tackle the key problems in relations with Russia independently. Ulmanis prognosticated that Latvia could become EU associated member in 18 months. During the trip, Ulmanis and European leaders also touched on the problems of citizenship in Latvia. EU member states should not prioritize the applicants' ethnic belonging in naturalization. The other criteria, like language skills and residence qualifications, are interior issues of each separate country.
