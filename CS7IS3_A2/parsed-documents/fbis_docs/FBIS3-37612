During the conversation, the presidents expressed satisfaction over the dynamically developing Ukrainian-U.S. relations. In particular, Bill Clinton highly commended the political course and practical actions by the Ukrainian leadership to destroy nuclear weapons according to the recent resolution of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the START Treaty. He also expressed the hope that Ukraine will shortly join the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. All these steps, in the U.S. President's opinion, open new possibilities for efficient economic cooperation between Ukraine and the United States both through mutual links and influential international financial institutions. Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton concluded that the issues they had agreed on, after being worked on by experts and government officials, will be prepared as documents, some of which will be signed during the official visit of the Ukrainian president to the United States on 3-7 March 1994.
