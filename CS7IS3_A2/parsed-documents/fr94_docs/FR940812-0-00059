FR940812-0-00059 FR940812-0-00019 Friday August 12, 1994 Part II Corporation for National and Community Service 45 CFR Parts 2541 and 2542 Corporation Grant and Cooperative Agreement Requirements; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 155␣/␣Friday, August 12, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE 45 CFR Parts 2541 and 2542 Corporation Grant and Cooperative Agreement Requirements AGENCY: Corporation for National and Community Service. ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: The Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) is adopting in its final rules the following two Federal agency common rules: Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments; and Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Drug-Free Workplace (Grants). These regulations have been adopted by the Corporation because they are applicable to State and Local Governments that receive grants from the Corporation. In addition, all Corporation grantees must comply with the Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension and Drug-Free Workplace rules. By implementing these regulations, the Corporation grantees will know some of the terms and conditions of their respective grants. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Terry Russell, General Counsel, (202) 606&hyph;4949, (Voice) (202) 606&hyph;5256, (TDD), between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. For individuals with disabilities, information will be made available in alternative formats, upon request. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information Part 2541 contains the Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments which is a common rule developed by OMB and adopted by the Federal agencies to ensure consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and cooperative agreements to State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. A full discussion of the issues pertaining to this rule is contained in the preamble to the final common rule that was adopted by 23 Federal agencies and published in the Federal Register on March 11, 1988 (53 FR 8034). Part 2542 contains the Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension Requirements which were implemented pursuant to Executive Order 12549 to prevent waste, fraud and abuse in Federal nonprocurement transactions. A discussion of the issues pertaining to this rule is contained in the preamble of the final common rule that was adopted by 27 Federal agencies and published in the Federal Register on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19161). Part 2542 also contains the Governmentwide Drug-Free Workplace rules which were established to implement the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, 41 U.S.C. 701&hyph;722. The Drug Free Workplace Act requires that all grantees receiving grants from any Federal agency certify to that agency that they will maintain a drug-free workplace, or in the case of a grantee who is an individual, certify to the agency that his or her conduct of grant activity will be drug-free. A full discussion of the issues pertaining to this rule is contained in the preamble of the interim final rule that was adopted by 33 Federal agencies and published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1990 (55 FR 21679). The Corporation finds that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking on these matters would be unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, since the common rulemaking has been subjected to extensive public scrutiny when OMB proposed and finalized the rules and 27 federal agencies issued these proposed rules for notice and comments. Consequently, the Corporation for good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) has decided not to publish a proposed rulemaking on these matters and has adopted and published these rules as a final rule. This regulation is fully in effect. No further regulatory action by the Corporation is essential to the legal effectiveness of the rule. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this final rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.
