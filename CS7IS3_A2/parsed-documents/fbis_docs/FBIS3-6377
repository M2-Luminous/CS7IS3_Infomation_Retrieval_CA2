Public criticism is directed also to the arbitrary expansion by the consulate of the first and third floors of the three-story building without obtaining permission from Pusan municipal authorities. On Wednesday the consulate authorities even prevented Pusan Chung-ku Ward officials trying to look into the illegal floor space expansion from entering the building on the ground that they had come without giving an advance notice. The building, originally owned by a Japanese co. in 1919, was used by U.S. occupation forces upon national liberation and later by the American Consulate beginning September 1948 upon the inauguration of the Korean Government. In 1970 the government had the Office of National Tax Administration own the building. The ownership of the building was turned over to the Chung-ku Ward of Pusan in 1983. However, the government failed to collect rent from or even conclude any lease agreement with the consulate on the excuse of special relationship between Korea and the United States. Chung-ku Ward officials say that the unauthorized expansion of the floor space is definitely a violation of the construction law, but they cannot take any action against it any longer because the three-year period of prescription expired long before. Faced with the mounting public criticism, the American Consulate and Center plan to move to elsewhere. Consul Edward Kloth of the consulate called at the Pusan Chamber of Commerce and Industry on last March 11 and, while saying he would like to move their offices to elsewhere, inquired about rent and other conditions of the chamber and nearby commercial buildings.
