It says: In his recent address on Crimean television and at a news conference, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov used assessments and allegations that deny the expediency and lawfulness of setting up a mission of the Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea. In this connection the press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers thinks it is necessary to remember that the mission of the Ukrainian president in Crimea was set up in accordance with the resolution of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of 24 February 1994: On the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea under the existing Constitution and legislation of Ukraine, and the resolution of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of 17 December 1992: On the procedure of putting into force the Ukrainian law on the mission of the Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea. The setting up of the president's mission in Crimea is not a political act, as it is being interpreted by some, but a normal legal process of forming appropriate power structures in accordance with the Constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea, which are intended to ensure cooperation between the bodies of state power in Crimea and the central bodies of state executive power in Ukraine. Attempts to present the normal process of improving the ties between the Ukrainian and Crimean power structures in a distorted way do not help at all in creating the businesslike atmosphere and stability necessary for economic transformations in this Ukrainian region. The press service stresses that by their actions the Crimean president and his entourage are not only not assisting in developing friendly and goodneighborly relations between Ukraine and Russia but are also even trying to bring elements of misunderstanding in them.
