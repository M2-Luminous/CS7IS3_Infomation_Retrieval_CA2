They are ignoring the objective facts that put this war in its correct perspective and uncover the culprits who led Yemen to this disaster. Cards and whims have been confused and the only tune that is heard is the tune of secession fed by those who urge a halt to the fighting in order to entrench a dreadful reality as though the only way to salvage Yemen is to slay and dismember it. The claim that there is a war between the north and the south is not supported by the facts on the ground. On the contrary, the fasts point out that Yemen, south and north, is waging war against a misguided group that does not represent the south but is controlling its fate and imposing on its children a stand that does not conform to their interests and convictions. A glance at the names of the military commanders who are leading the forces that are advancing to defeat the secession confirms that the vast majority of the south rejects the adventure, or rather the plot, of secession which seeks to cancel the idea of unity and obliterate the last hope of restoring factors of Arab existence in the face of a bigger plot that aims to usurp Arab land, resources, identity, and history from Arab sovereignty. In a field count of the southern military commanders who are waging the battle of defending the honor of belonging to a unified Yemen, we read the following names: Defense Minister Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi Mansur, central axis commander Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, eastern front commander Colonel Ahmad Musa'id Husayn, Colonel 'Abdallah Mansur, Colonel Salim 'Ali Qutun, Colonel Muhammad Tumays, Colonel Salih Ahmad al-Harithi, Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, and Colonel Ahmad al-'Akrub. All of these are from the southern governorates, joined by tribal men from Shabwah and Abyan governorates. Indeed, some of the military forces that were fighting within the southern ranks joined the northern forces when the Socialist Party revealed its intentions and declared secession. Does not all this reveal the facts of the Yemeni events and uncover the falseness of the secession which fell at home before reinforcements came from abroad?
