FR940426-1-00124 FR940426-1-00015 III. Streamlining of Required Financial Statement Schedules Currently, domestic commercial and industrial issuers are required to file 14 financial schedules with their annual reports and registration statements. Six of these schedules have been eliminated for foreign private issuers, specifically: (1) Rule 12&hyph;02_Marketable Securities_Other Investments. (2) Rule 12&hyph;03_Amounts Receivable from Related Parties and Underwriters, Promoters and Employees Other Than Related Parties. (3) Rule 12&hyph;05_Indebtedness of and to Related Parties_Not Current. (4) Rule 12&hyph;06_Property, Plant and Equipment. (5) Rule 12&hyph;07_Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Property, Plant and Equipment. (6) 12&hyph;08_Guarantees of Securities of Other Issuers. The Commission is proposing to eliminate these schedules for domestic issuers as well. In addition, the Commission is proposing to eliminate two additional schedules for both foreign and domestic issuers, namely (1) Rule 12&hyph;10_Short-term Borrowings. (2) Rule 12&hyph;11_Supplementary Income Statement Information. The proposals, as discussed under marketable securities below, would also eliminate Schedule XIII_Other Investments for commercial and industrial companies that is currently required for investments that are not included on the schedule required by Rule 12&hyph;02 of Regulation S-X. A. Schedules Already Eliminated from Foreign Issuer Filings 1. Marketable Securities_Other Security Investments Commercial and industrial companies are required to furnish a schedule of marketable securities and other investments 29 meeting specified thresholds. 30 This schedule is not required of bank holding companies, insurance companies, or registered investment companies. 31 Investments of commercial and industrial companies which are not required to be reported on this schedule must be disclosed in a schedule of ``other investments,'' unless the total amount does not exceed 5% of the registrant's total assets. 32 29 17 CFR 210.12&hyph;10. 30 An aggregate carrying value of either marketable securities or of other investments exceeds 10% of total assets, or a combined carrying value of marketable securities and other investments together exceeds 15% of total assets. With respect to the securities of each issuer which have an aggregate market value exceeding 2% of the registrant's total assets, the schedule must include a description of the issuer and of each security along with its cost, market value, and carrying amount in the balance sheet. Securities that do not exceed 2% of assets may be grouped by political subdivision for governmental securities and by industry type and similarity of risks for corporate securities. 31 Information comparable to the ยง12&hyph;02 schedule is required of bank holding companies pursuant to Industry Guide 3 [17 CFR 231.801(c)] and Item 101 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.101]. Insurance companies must furnish a financial information schedule, described at Section 12&hyph;15 of Regulation S-X, summarizing investments. Registered investment companies furnish a series of financial information schedules relating to investments, described at Sections 12&hyph;12&hyph;12&hyph;14 of Regulation S-X. No change is proposed with respect to disclosures by registrants in these industries. 32 17 CFR 210.5&hyph;04. Much of the information contained in these two schedules also is required to be furnished today in notes to the financial statements pursuant to GAAP. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (``SFAS 115''), issued in May 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB''), expanded the disclosure requirements for all debt securities and for equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value. These securities must be classified into three categories: held to maturity (as to debt securities), available for sale, and trading account. With respect to securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale, SFAS 115 requires separate disclosure, grouped by major security type, of the fair value, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and amortized cost basis, as well as maturity and other relevant information. Other pertinent disclosure requirements were established in March 1990 upon the FASB's issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 105, ``Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk,'' (``SFAS 105''). SFAS 105 requires disclosure of all significant concentrations of credit risk arising from an individual counterparty or groups of counterparties that would be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, although SFAS 105 does not establish a quantitative guideline for the determination of a significant concentration. In addition, disclosures required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K 33 , ``Management's Discussion and Analysis'' (``MD&A''), include discussion of the material effects and uncertainties associated with concentrations and risks in the investment portfolio. 34 33 17 CFR 229.303. 34 See Securities Act Release No. 6835 (May 18, 1989).
