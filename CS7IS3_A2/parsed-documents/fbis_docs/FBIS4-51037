Liu Hongru, a noted economist and chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, praised them as "file leaders" in our country's economic restructuring. A few days ago, the State Economic Restructuring Commission and the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee sponsored a forum on experiences in placing shares in outside-the- mainland markets at the Kunming Machine Tools Company Ltd. More than 50 representatives from the nine enterprises which had successfully placed their shares in outside-the-mainland markets, relevant departments under the State Council, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange, law firms, and other units reviewed and discussed the work in this regard. With the approval of the State Council, the Shanghai Petrochemical Company, the Yizheng Chemical Fiber Company, the Qingdao Beer Company, the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, the Kunming Machine Tools Company, the Guangdong Shipyard in Guangzhou, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company, the (?Beijing People's Machinery Company) [bei ren ji 0554 0086 2623], and Tianjin's Bohai Company issued stocks outside the mainland last year. Now Dongfang is still selling its stocks, and the other eight companies have already raised a total of more than 10 billion Hong Kong dollars. Judging from subscriptions for its shares outside the mainland, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company is doing well in this regard. These companies have raised so much money in such a short time. It is unprecedented in China. This has not only solved the problems of funds for the nine companies, but also opened a major channel for Chinese enterprises to raise funds from the international market. These nine enterprises are our country's "file leaders" in connecting Chinese enterprises with the international market. They have played an exemplary role in changing operating mechanisms and bringing about profound changes in their behavior. Of all the stock companies, the nine have done a better job in changing their operating mechanisms. They have changed from acting according to administrative directives to acting according to laws and regulations and from focusing their attention on the government to focusing their attention on the market, especially the international market. They have sought a better way for the state sector of the economy to adapt to the market economy.
