North-South direct trade is still minimal, and there are limitations on the types of goods to trade. Therefore, it has been proposed that ROK business corporations positively utilize North Korea-China border trade as a means to promote "indirect North-South trade in order to lead North Korea to open its market and promote economic cooperation with North Korea." The North Korean Economy Research Center of the Korea Development Institute released a "Report on North Korea-China Border Trade" on 11 February. The report says North Korea-China border trade, which is promoted in the form of barter trade, has been rapidly expanding by over 20 percent a year since the start of the nineties thanks to the successive measures by the governments of the two countries to expand bilateral trade. Even though exact figures have not been made public, the volume of North Korea-China border trade is estimated at over $100 million in 1990 and over $240 million in 1992, which accounts for 35 percent of the total volume of bilateral trade. However, in many cases, business corporations involved in North Korea-China border trade tend to report reduced amounts of trade to authorities concerned to reduce customs duties and taxes. Therefore, the volume of border trade is estimated to be over 50 percent of the total volume of trade ($300 million). Border barter trade, which can be said to be rather primitive and unusual compared to other forms of international trade, is expanding rapidly between North Korea and China. This is because North Korea faces very serious shortages of daily necessities and hard currency. Through border trade, North Korea imports such daily necessities as textile goods (36 percent), groceries (31 percent), and chemical, electric, and machinery goods (17 percent) from China. In return, North Korea exports mineral products, fishery products, and antiques to China. Both countries prefer border barter trade over ordinary trade because they face shortages of foreign reserves and have no appropriate credit transaction system. Therefore, to expand border trade, the two countries have reportedly taken measures to ease various restrictions and give tax breaks. Special customs rates, a mere 50 percent of ordinary rates, are applied to almost all goods in border trade, and procedures of trade have been simplified. The Chinese Government's "measure to ease trade management" eliminated almost all import restrictions toward the end of 1992, and a $180 million border trade contract covering 30 items of goods, the largest amount over the 10-year period, was signed at a North Korea-Jilin, China, border-trade fair last May. In fact, border smuggling trade, which is called "peddling," had been prevalent under governmental tacit approval. Therefore, the Chinese Government's measure to activate border trade is described as an approval of such "peddling trade." Border trade is growing in areas along the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, close to the three Northeastern Provinces of China -- Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of the Jilin Province and the border areas close to the prefecture are the most prospering markets. North Korea reportedly opened approximately 140 Chinese goods markets in Sinuiju of North Pyongan Province, Manpo of Chagang Province, and other areas last year to expand border trade with China. The Korea Development Institute says: "In case North Korea-China border trade continuously expands, domestic business corporations must use North Korea-China border areas as a forward base for indirectly leading North Korea to open its economy." The institute also says that toward that end, domestic business corporations must have Chinese border-trade companies as agents or sign work agreements with Chinese border-trade companies to join in border trade in this region. The institute also says: There are "risks in trade" because of the infrastructural problem and the credit problem. However, given the fact that North-South trade is now being promoted through third countries, North Korea-China border trade will become an important means to lead North Korea to sell ROK goods in the North Korean market and open its economy.
