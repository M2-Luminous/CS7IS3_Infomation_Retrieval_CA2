FR941122-0-00045 FR941122-0-00010 Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Any changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket Section, which is listed in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and have been assigned control number 2060&hyph;0258. This collection of information has an estimated burden averaging from 8 to 16 hours per response for about 124 responses. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. An Information Collection Request document and estimates of the public reporting burden were prepared in connection with the January 11, 1993 regulations. 56 FR 63098; 58 FR 3650. The regulation modifications contained in today's proposal will not significantly change the reporting burden that was previously estimated. Send comments regarding this burden analysis or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, S.W. (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , requires each federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. The revisions will prevent the creation of about 200,000 excess, new allowances and thus will have an annual impact of about $318,000 per year in Phase I, i.e., 200,000 allowances times $159 (the weighted average winning bid for 1995 allowances in the EPA 1994 Allowance Auction on March 28, 1994. See 59 FR 19712, 19714 (Apr. 25, 1994)). Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the revised rule will not have a significant, adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. E. Miscellaneous In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this rule was preceded by consultation with any appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and federal departments and agencies.
