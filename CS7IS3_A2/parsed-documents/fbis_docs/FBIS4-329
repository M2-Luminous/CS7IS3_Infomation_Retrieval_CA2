Judge Kriegler said the IEC had met with representatives of the South African printing industry to investigate the possibility of producing amended ballot papers even at this late stage. He said it was to be hoped that negotiations would succeed in bringing the IFP into the election. Judge Kriegler said the election would definitely go ahead. The IEC would provide the necessary framework and mechanisms for the election to take place. However, it was up to political parties and their leaders to ensure that it was free and fair.
