FR941206-2-00081 FR941206-2-00054 [UT&hyph;040&hyph;05&hyph;1430&hyph;01] Virgin River Management Framework Plan, Utah; Proposal Amendment AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of intent SUMMARY: This notice is to advise the public that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing to do a plan amendment for the Virgin River Management Framework Plan (MFP) located in Washington County, Utah. DATES: The comment period for this proposed plan amendment will commence with publication of this notice. Comments must be submitted on or before January 5, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale Ross, Realty Specialist, Dixie Resource Area Office, 225 North Bluff Street, St. George, UT 84770. Existing planning documents and information are available at the above address or telephone (801) 673&hyph;4654. Comments on the proposed plan amendment should be sent to the above address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The BLM is proposing to amend the Virgin River MFP which included lands in Washington County, Utah. The proposed amendment would be to make certain public land available for disposal pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 869 et seq.), for a local government entity in Washington County for the purpose of constructing wastewater-treatment lagoons. The city of Springdale has requested expansion of existing sewer lagoons which service Zion National Park, Springdale, and Rockville. The present lagoons no longer meet demand, and it is anticipated that during the upcoming spring tourist season, the lagoons will far exceed current capacity. A conformance review was conducted; and, while the request was found not consistent with the Virgin River MFP, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) believes that it has merit and therefore proposes to conduct an environmental assessment to determine environmental consequences and impacts on the existing planning decisions and the proposed amendment. The public land being considered for disposal, comprising 73.25 acres, is described as follows: Salt Lake Meridian, Utah T. 42 South, R. 11 West, Section 4, lots 17, 18 and 20; Section 5, lots 9 and 10 the SE1/4NE1/4SW1/4NE1/4, E1/2SE1/4SW1/4NE1/4, and the NE1/4NE1/4NW1/4SE1/4.
