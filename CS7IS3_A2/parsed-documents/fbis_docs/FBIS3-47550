FBIS3-47550 "dreas010__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX January Hosokawa Seeks Consensus on Tax Cut Plan OW1301151094 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1301151094 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Several government sources disclosed on 11 January that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has decided to coordinate opinions within the government and the ruling parties to form a consensus on the implementation of income and residential tax cuts worth more than 8 trillion yen [Y] in fiscal year 1994. The tax cuts are the main feature of the government's pump-priming package. To fund the cuts, Hosokawa plans to issue stopgap government bonds whose repayment period is clearly set. However, he will not mention a consumption tax hike in tax reform bills to be submitted to the ordinary Diet session, which will be convened at the end of January, the sources said. If the bills are approved, the tax cuts will be implemented retroactive to 1 January. The sources said that two years after the implementation of the tax cuts, Hosokawa hopes to reach a conclusion on a drastic tax reform to cope with the aging society, while remaining mindful of a consumption tax hike. Prime Minister Hosokawa has decided to implement large-scale tax cuts as prospects for having four political reform bills approved around 20 January have become bright. After the passage of the bills, Hosokawa will convene a meeting of the Economic Affairs Council to resume discussions on tax reform. The council, which has long been inactive, is chaired by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and is composed of government and ruling party officials. Hosokawa hopes to make a final decision based on council discussions, the ruling parties' policies, and public opinion. After deciding on outlines for tax reform for fiscal year 1994, Hosokawa hopes to begin compiling the third supplementary budget and the draft fiscal year 1994 budget. With these two budgets, which cover a 15-month period, the government will make an all-out effort to shore up the economy. The prime minister considers tax cuts to be "a shot in the arm" for the economy and believes it is necessary to implement income and land tax cuts that are as large as possible. Accordingly, he has decided to carry out tax cuts of more than Y8 trillion, larger than the initially proposed Y6 trillion-Y7 trillion in tax cuts. In addition to the income and land tax cuts, Hosokawa plans to abolish a special corporate tax which was introduced during the Gulf war to cope with the crisis, to increase the total amount of tax cuts to about Y10 trillion. U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the Japanese Government to carry out drastic pump-priming measures. To meet his expectations, Hosokawa will disclose the tax cut plans during the Japan-U.S. summit talks to be held in Washington on 11 February. Up to this point, Prime Minister Hosokawa has said that "the government will not irresponsibly issue deficit-covering bonds" to fund income and land tax cuts. However, his recent decision indicates that he will not oppose issuing government bonds if they are stopgap bonds whose repayment period is clearly set. To make up for the stopgap bonds, the government will need a consumption tax hike. But Hosokawa will avoid mentioning the tax hike in tax reform bills. Instead, he will just note the need for a "drastic reform of the tax system" and "a review of the direct-indirect tax ratio."
