A report to the UN Security Council by IAEA Director General Hans Blix says that further inspections of the North Korean nuclear facilities must be conducted within six weeks. Therefore, some people say that the deadline should be the end of April, and others say it should be mid-May. An ROK Foreign Ministry official, who is now visiting Japan, said on 3 April that this issue must be clarified because the deadline for further inspections would be an important factor for the UN Security Council's next step. The Security Council president's statement indirectly mentioned the deadline, saying: "The Council invites the director general of the IAEA to report further to the Security Council on the question of completion of the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK on 15 February 1994, when the director general is scheduled to report on the follow-up inspections required to maintain continuity of safeguards, as noted in the director general's report to the council." However, when presenting a report to the Security Council on 24 March, Director General Blix said that to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards, further inspections of not only the facilities which were not inspected during the inspection period ending 15 February but the facilities which were inspected during the same period must be conducted within six weeks. The Foreign Ministry official views that "within six week" must be interpreted to be six weeks from 15 February, when the first round of inspections were completed."
