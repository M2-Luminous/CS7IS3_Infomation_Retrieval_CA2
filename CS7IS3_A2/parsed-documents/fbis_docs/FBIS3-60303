Over the past 40-plus years more than 1,000,000 curies of radio-nuclides have accumulated here on the industrial site of one of Russia's major defense complexes in water reservoirs and special technological storage facilities. They present a serious threat not just to the Urals region but the whole planet. [Academician N.P. Laverov, vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, identified by caption] This is a very complex problem. There has been nothing like this in the history of mankind. There has never been such an accumulation of radioactive waste. Therefore any step which is taken now demands careful scientific substantiation. [Sergeyev] The Russian Government has adopted a program for the rehabilitation of the contaminated areas in the southern Urals. Scientists have been assigned an important role in its implementation. A session of the scientific and technical council has been held at Chelyabinsk-65, where specialists discussed the results of the steps taken in the year that is ending and elaborated tactics for combatting the dangerous radio-nuclides for the coming year.
