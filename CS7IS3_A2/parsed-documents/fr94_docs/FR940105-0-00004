FR940105-0-00004 FR940105-0-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 26 RIN 3150&hyph;AE38 Modifications to Fitness-For-Duty Program Requirements AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations governing fitness-for-duty (FFD) programs that are applicable to licensees who are authorized to construct or operate nuclear power reactors and to licensees authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (SSNM). The amendment permits licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the fitness-for-duty regulations to an annual rate equal to 50 percent. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the regulatory analysis, the comments received, and the Government Accounting Office (GAO) report (GAO/GGD&hyph;93&hyph;13) of November 1992 may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW, (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Copies of NUREG&hyph;1354, NUREG/CR&hyph;5758 (Volumes 1, 2, and 3), and NUREG/CR&hyph;5784 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5282 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

Bush, Jr., Safeguards Branch, Division of Radiation Safety and Safeguards, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone: (301) 504&hyph;2944. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The NRC has reviewed experiences gained since publication of the current FFD rule on June 7, 1989 (54 FR 24468), and implementation by power reactor licensees on January 3, 1990, and determined that it may be appropriate to modify the random testing rate. Accordingly, on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15810), the Commission published a proposed modification to the FFD rule that would permit a reduction in the random testing rate for licensee employees, but maintain the 100-percent random testing rate for contractors and vendors.
