A city in which two continents are neighbors and the elemental forces of two seas meet.... Only from a birds' eye view did it acquire for me the clarity and completeness of its quaintly subdividing formation. Looking out the aircraft window at Istanbul, which was turning pinkish in the rays of the setting sun, I finally understood where was Asia, and where was Europe, where the Black Sea, and where the Sea of Marmora, where the Bosphorus, and where the Golden Horn.... Truly, great things are seen from afar! The dimensions of the working visit to Turkey of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also revealed themselves in all their fullness after a certain interval of time. It was later, in Baku, when a number of important summit meetings had been held, that the import and the logic of the visit become clear. The most complex situation that has come about in Azerbaijan as a result of the Armenian aggression, the search for ways to achieve a just and all-embracing peace, the return of the occupied territories to the bosom of Azerbaijan, and the creation of sure guarantees of the safety of the peaceful population in these parts, the settlement of certain questions of military cooperation with Russia, and the strengthening of partner relations with countries of East and West, which implies not only political alliances but also the realization of joint economic projects--this in summarized form constituted the purposes and tasks of Geydar Aliyev's visit to Turkey. It was truly a working visit, in the sense that it was filled to the maximum with meetings, conversations, and consultations on the most important policy issues. The work began at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, even, where the president of Azerbaijan was met by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. The leaders of the two countries issued a statement for journalists representing newspapers and agencies of Turkey, Azerbaijan, and a number of other countries. Both leaders noted how great the danger of an expansion of the boundaries of the military conflict unleashed by Armenia was. According to Geydar Aliyev, its inordinate territorial claims are creating a threat to peace and security throughout the region. Today the focal point of the war is blazing in Azerbaijan, but there is no guarantee that it will not tomorrow spread to contiguous countries. In this situation not only Azerbaijan but all states of the region are concerned to see a stimulation of the efforts of the CSCE and other European and international organizations aimed at interdicting the aggressor. This speech to the journalists set the tone for the whole series of Geydar Aliyev's meetings, which took place at a time when the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was in session. The city on the Bosphorus was greeting many important guests at that time. An Azerbaijani delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov had also arrived for a CSCE [as published] Council session. Politicians of many countries sought meetings with Geydar Aliyev. The limited time of his stay in Turkey constricted, naturally, the range of persons with whom the leader of the republic had a dialogue. But the choice of partners was not fortuitous, it was dictated by both tactical and strategic tasks of grand policy. On the first day of his stay in Turkey, the president of Azerbaijan received at his residence in the Sheraton Hotel British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had initiated the meeting. They dealt with the situation in the zone of combat operations, problems of a humanitarian nature, and the prospects of cooperation in the economy, particularly in the oil industry. Both sides emphasized the importance of contacts and the continuation of political consultations for the resolution of Azerbaijan's main problem--a winding down of hostilities on the territory of the republic, the restoration of peace, and people's return to their native haunts. Peace in the region is the goal and the condition and the means of Azerbaijan's cooperation with foreign countries. The same day the president met with Gen. Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff of Turkey's armed forces. The second day of the visit contained a full program. At nine in the morning the president met in his rooms Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Geydar Aliyev greeted his guest warmly. He said, in particular, that he valued highly her work as chairman of the CSCE and her efforts for a settlement of the Armenian- Azerbaijani conflict. "The problems have, unfortunately, become even more complex," Geydar Aliyev said, "but I am once again counting on the support of the CSCE. I hope that the authority that you have gained in Europe and the efforts of your compatriot Jan Eliasson, who is currently head of the Minsk Group, will permit the achievement of the desired results." Margaretha af Ugglas thanked Geydar Aliyev for the high evaluation of her work as leader of the CSCE. She said that she was pleased to have the meeting and recalled with great satisfaction her stay in Baku. "I realize," she declared, "that not all problems have been resolved, but I am reassured by the fact that the Minsk Group is headed by the experienced diplomat Eliasson. He is in productive contact not only with both sides but also with Moscow, where he recently held important meetings." A key event of the program of President Geydar Aliyev's visit was his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It took place at the Ciragan Hotel, in which the session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was being held at this time. Experienced politicians, Geydar Aliyev and Warren Christopher, having exchanged greetings and pleasantries, immediately got down to an ascertainment of positions in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. President Geydar Aliyev enumerated the problems that Azerbaijan had encountered in the course of the Armenian aggression that has been going on for six years now. He said that as a result of the Armenian offensive, 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory had been occupied and that the republic had 1.2 million refugees. "I believe," Geydar Aliyev said, "that the war should be brought to an end. Since I became president, I have sought a settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. We have cooperated with the CSCE and its Minsk Group and with the United Nations from the very outset. As you know, the Security Council has adopted four resolutions demanding an immediate withdrawal of forces from the captured Azerbaijani territory. The Armenian side is not complying with these resolutions. I would like to be completely sincere: The hopes that we placed in the CSCE have yet to be justified. The Minsk Group has been unable in four years, unfortunately, to do anything of substance. "We would like to see a stimulation of the activity of the CSCE and the Minsk Group and are very much counting on the support of the United States here. It seems to me that a principal condition of a settlement of the conflict is the active position of the United States in untying its knots." In his answering remarks, Warren Christopher thanked Geydar Aliyev for the information and for the "graphic," as he put it, presentation of the picture of the conflict. The secretary of state observed that the United States supported Azerbaijan's peace initiatives. The leadership of his country was impressed by the fact that the republic was working with the CSCE and was helping realize the peacemaking program being undertaken by this organization. "We will always support your commitment to the CSCE," Warren Christopher declared. He sounded out Azerbaijan's readiness to agree, up to certain limits, to compromise and could see for himself that our peace initiatives are not an empty declaration, they are backed by practical actions, which could in the future be even more vigorous. W. Christopher emphasized the importance for a strengthening of Azerbaijan's economy of the signing of the oil contracts. Concluding the conversation, W. Christopher assured the leader of Azerbaijan that the United States would do everything to ensure that the conferees and interested parties operate within the framework of international standards. The foreign ministers of Turkey and Azerbaijan--Hikmet Cetin and Gasan Gasanov--and state counselors Vafa Gulizade and Gabil Guseynli took part in the meeting. Ninety minutes later there was a meeting in the same hotel with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. It pursued the accomplishment of a two-in-one task: on the one hand outlining a program of cooperation with Greece, and on the other, entering into contact with the European Union, of which this country is the chairman. "Our states," Geydar Aliyev said, opening the meeting, "have good prospects for the development of bilateral relations. Considering their geopolitical location, climatic features, and historical traditions, Azerbaijan and Greece have good opportunities for fruitful cooperation. It has long been time to determine spheres of partnership and prepare the corresponding documents." Touching on the subject of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, the president said that it is attended by great sacrifices. They are being borne, in the main, by Azerbaijan, on whose territory the hostilities are taking place. "Our goal," Geydar Aliyev emphasized, "is to achieve a ceasefire and the liberation of the captured territories. The European Union could, in our view, play its part in a settlement of the conflict. We want all countries to have objective information on what is happening in the region. Unfortunately, outside of it the majority believes that both parties to this conflict are equally to blame. It is extraordinarily important for us in this situation that the world community know who is the aggressor, and who the victim. We are counting on your help here." Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias agreed with Geydar Aliyev that the European Union could reinforce the potential of the peacekeeping force operating in the region. "The European Union, like Greece also," Karolos Papoulias declared, "has always been a supporter of disputed questions being solved at the negotiating table, not with violence. We cannot be indifferent to the problems of refugees and offer our services for a halt to an escalation of the conflict. Greece, as a sovereign state and as the country that heads the European Union, is ready to cooperate with Azerbaijan." The search for partners that could help stop the millstones of war and bring back peace to the lacerated land defined also the work in Istanbul of Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov. He had a constructive dialogue with FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who expressed hope for a stimulation of efforts for the speediest resolution of the bloody conflict. He conveyed to G. Gasanov a package of documents that are being prepared for signature by the NATO partners. Gasan Gasanov's speech at the session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was harmoniously interwoven into the political context of the president of Azerbaijan's visit. This speech made it possible once again to contrast the two concepts of a settlement of the conflict: the Azerbaijani concept, based on a just peace and a stabilization of the situation throughout the region and the assurance of guarantees of security and tranquillity for all, and the Armenian concept, which is imbued with a spirit of annexationism and national egocentrism and pursues the goal of digging in at all costs on territory that has been seized by force. "Twenty countries have subscribed to the Partnership for Peace program, and this proves the viability of its underlying principles and ideas," G. Gasanov said in his speech. "The Azerbaijani Republic, which was among the first to subscribe to the program, attaches great significance to the Partnership, seeing in it big opportunities for influencing the present situation in my country. "Azerbaijan has shown in practice repeatedly its commitment to the principles of a peaceful settlement of conflicts. It advocates a solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict from the position of the commonly accepted international standards, specifying the observance of states' sovereignty and territorial integrity and the sanctity of their borders and respect for human rights. But all our efforts to find a peaceful way out of the deadlocked conflict are running into the power barrier of the aggressor. "Flouting the rules of international law, Armenia is pursuing a policy of fait accompli in respect to the occupied Azerbaijani territories. It needs the negotiating process solely to gain time, which is being used to increase its military presence, dig in on the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and expand deep into Azerbaijan." War and peace in the region, who benefits from an escalation of the conflict, and the political calculations, for which the people are paying in blood, were the subject also of the meeting between Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, which was held at the Yildiz Kosk residence. This meeting concluded the program of the visit and summed up, as it were, all that had been done in this time. Geydar Aliyev focused attention in the conversation on the threat of an increase in military and political pressure on Azerbaijan and on the attempt of certain circles to stymie the negotiating process and isolate the republic from the assistance of European and international organizations. Tansu Ciller listened closely to Geydar Aliyev and promised all- around support for all Azerbaijan's peace initiatives. There is no doubt that the meeting of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and the work of the Azerbaijani delegation at the session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Istanbul made obvious and irrefutable for our actual and potential partners the truth that Azerbaijan aspires to peace and harmony in the region and calls on Armenia to do likewise. Having fallen victim to unprecedented aggression, our republic nonetheless does not thirst for revenge, but is displaying the initiative for the suppression, finally, by joint efforts of the conflagration of war. In our view, the main result of President Geydar Aliyev's visit to Turkey is that the world community was shown once again the good will of Azerbaijan and its sincere aspiration to a termination of the senseless war and to peace as the sole possibility of human existence.
