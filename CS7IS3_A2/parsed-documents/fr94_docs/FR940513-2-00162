FR940513-2-00162 FR940513-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;34021; International Series Release No. 664; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;25] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Notice and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change Extending the Informational Linkage With the Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd. for Six Months May 6, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934ยง 1 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on April 26, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD hereby files, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, for Commission authorization to extend the operation of its Pilot Program with the Stock Exchange of Singapore Limited (``SES'') for six months. The Pilot Program currently consists of an interchange of closing price and volume data on up to 35 Nasdaq securities that also may be traded through the SES's facilities (collectively, ``Pilot Securities''). With the thirteen hour time difference (twelve hours during EDT), the trading hours of the SES and NASD markets do not overlap. The end-of-day information being exchanged under the Pilot Program may assist in the establishment of opening prices the following business day. The Pilot Program currently involves no automated order routing or execution capabilities, and no such capability will be established during the proposed extension. The Commission originally authorized operation of the NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program for a two-year term 2 that was extended most recently through May 12, 1994. 3 Commission approval of the instant filing would permit continuation of this Pilot Program through November 12, 1994. During this interval, no more than 35 Nasdaq issues will be included in this Pilot Program. That figure corresponds to the number originally authorized at the inception of the Pilot Program in 1988. As noted in File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;28, the SES information being transmitted to the NASD reflects the SES's use of an order-driven trading system (known as the ``CLOB''). 2 See Release No. 34&hyph;25457 (Mar. 14, 1988), 53 FR 9156 (Mar. 21, 1988). 3 See Release No. 34&hyph;33061 (Oct. 15, 1993), 58 FR 54617 (Oct. 22, 1993). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program commenced operation with the Commission's approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;87&hyph;40 on March 14, 1988. The principal features of this Program were fully described in Section 1 of that Form 19b&hyph;4, which description is hereby incorporated by reference. 4 4 See also Release No. 34&hyph;25065 (Oct. 28, 1987), 52 FR 42167 (Nov. 3, 1987). The current authorization of the NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program will expire on May 12, 1994. The NASD, on its own as well as on the SES's behalf, hereby requests that the Commission approve a further extension of the Pilot Program for six months, expiring on November 12, 1994.
