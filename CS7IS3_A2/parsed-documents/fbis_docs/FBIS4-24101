He told MEDIAFAX yesterday that he was received by "a large crowd of over 50,000 people." Independent sources, and others linked to Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], without risking giving numbers, noted that the reception was "in fact unusual." A Mozambique Television journalist commented that "undoubtedly there were many more people than those who went to receive Chissano." Yet, a Radio Mozambique journalist estimated the number of people who went to the airport as 10,000. The same journalist told us that at the traditional reception ceremony, in which Dhlakama was dressed in a leopard skin, five local traditional chiefs attended the event. Commenting on the reception given to Dhlakama, who is visiting Beira after a 16-year absence, the sources recognized that the security forces were not efficient. "Renamo guards even beat up a number of people who could not control their desire to see Dhlakama." A journalist commented that the government police were apathetic. The level of absenteeism in the companies was enormous. Our sources say that this explains why so many people went to welcome Dhlakama on a normal working day, although workers were not given a day off when Joaquim Chissano arrived in Beira on a visit in his capacity as president of the Republic. [passage omitted] Commenting on the "passive" attitude of the government police during the Renamo chairman's arrival in Beira, the Sofala Provincial governor said that this happened because "the coordination with Renamo was difficult" on security measures. He added: "I do not yet know exactly what happened, but it was nothing serious." On several occasions, we asked the Renamo leader and the Sofala governor about the controversial issue of woodcutters. Dhlakama says he has no planned meeting with the woodcutters "in particular," but with businessmen "in general." The concern of the woodcutters, who are unable to continue their activities, has emerged again. Dhlakama began by saying that he is "very angry with MEDIAFAX" for not having precisely reproduced his ideas in our newspaper recently. He said we "misinformed" people when we reported that he said he would give priority to U.S. nationals in detriment to Mozambican citizens. He said: "I met with U.S. businessmen from several sectors, but I do not know whether there were woodcutters among them." On this issue, concerning Renamo priorities, Dhlakama explained that "there is a policy for the woodcutters, be they Mozambicans or foreigners. When they cut wood they must plant seedlings, otherwise two years from now we will have no trees." We asked him what criteria would be followed to identify the Mozambican woodcutters. Dhlakama said: "We have always said that they can cut the wood, but with the following conditions: cut one tree and plant another one. We know that the Mozambican businessmen do not have these facilities because the state does not grant them loans and they cannot work just with an axe, a saw, or a hoe." But there are businessmen who have the financial resources for that and complain that they are not allowed work. Dhlakama replied: "No, there are no such businessmen!" He added: "We understand that the wood cutters want to earn money, they want to prosper, they also want to pay their workers because they are living in difficult conditions. We know that, but it is better to think about the future of our children and grandchildren." We asked whether Renamo recognizes licenses issued by the government, with whom it signed the Peace Accord. He said: "You should know that the Frelimo government is corrupt," and added, "in Mozambique a number of licenses have been issued to foreigners through corruption which does not benefit the Mozambican people in any way." He also said that it is not a matter of Renamo recognizing the licenses or persisting in having a dual administration. The issue is, although Renamo "is an opposition party and recognizes the government, we do not accept the fact that the government continues with its corrupt actions and the populations remains without land because it is offered to foreigners, and the dollars go to the ministers' pockets." Sofala Provincial Governor Francisco Masquil says he does not know whether Renamo authorizes the woodcutters to work in areas under its control, but would like the problem to be solved "as soon as possible." We asked Masquil whether Frelimo was becoming alarmed about the Renamo leader's visit to Sofala and he said: "This is not our concern at present," adding that "we are currently concerned about peace."
