If the commissions do not propose increased expenditure on agriculture and social welfare, 30 to 40 coalition deputies are prepared to vote against the budget. The coalition has, however, such a majority in the parliament that even a loss of a double this number of votes cannot undermine the government. [Correspondent] The most dissatisfied are some National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies, whose leader in the SLD parliamentary floor group is Stanislaw Wisniewski. Deputy Wisniewski is of the opinion that, if during work on the budget it is not possible to increase funding for social welfare, active combatting of unemployment, and restructuring of the most threatened regions, the OPZZ should vote against the budget. [passage omitted] In the PSL, a group of about 20 deputies from the [organization of] agricultural circles is the most critical of the draft budget. The board [of the organization] instructed its parliamentarians to vote against the government if the funding for agriculture is not increased from 2 billion to 6 billion zlotys. Some PSL activists are of the opinion that the SLD coalition members want to discriminate against agriculture. [passage omitted]
