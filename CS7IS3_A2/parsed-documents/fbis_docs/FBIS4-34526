FBIS4-34526 "drlat119_p_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Ecuador Kidnappings Said To Be Increasing Kidnappings Said To Be Increasing 94P20877 94P20877 CSO [Editorial Report] Crime rates have increased in direct proportion to the socioeconomic crisis affecting the country and, according to an article by Javier Simancas in the Guayaquil daily EL UNIVERSO of 29 May, kidnapping for ransom of businessmen and politicians has intensified from 1992 to the present. The national police have stated that the problem is neither "accidental" nor linked to worsening socioeconomc conditions, but directly related to the immigration of entire mafia-type organizations and "subversive groups" from neighboring countries. Police statements add that Ecuador has become an easy target for these organizations to earn money by these means. In the past two years, 15 kidnappings have been officially reported that have earned the perpetrators a billion sucres. According to EL UNIVERSO, kidnapping crimes are concentrated in the Amazon areas of Sucumbios because that area is conducive to the free movement of organizations between Colombia and Ecuador. The article also pointed out that the cities of Guayaquil and Quito are not exempt from this type of crime. Minister of Defense Jose Gallardo, however, denied that crimes of kidnapping are a real threat to the country and minimized their links to terrorist organizations. He added "it is not true that kidnapping has become an unmanageable scourge," and stated that although Sucumbios had been the site for many of these crimes, they have been "totally eliminated" at present. Gallardo further noted that in Guayaquil, as well, many kidnapping attempts "were controlled in time."
