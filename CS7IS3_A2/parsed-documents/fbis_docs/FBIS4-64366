United States, EU Equally Responsible "Greek public opinion is left with the impression that Europeans are the villains and the Americans are the good guys on the Macedonian issue," writes Potis Paraskevopoulos in the 10 April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. While this impression has been reinforced by the decision of the EU Commission to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice, he argues, it is an erroneous impression because there is complete cooperation between the EU and the United States. According to Paraskevopoulos, the EU was too hasty in referring Greece to the Court of Justice while UN mediator Cyrus Vance's efforts were still ongoing. The move encouraged FYROM President Kiro Gligorov's intransigence and destroyed Greek trust in the EU. However, President Clinton coordinated his deadline for progress on the Skopje issue with the EU Commission, which had set 13 April for talks in New York between Vance and Greek and FYROM representatives, Paraskevopoulos maintains. On the other hand, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government was wrong in hastily breaking off the UN- sponsored dialogue with FYROM, as was Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in imposing the embargo on that country. In so doing, Papandreou misjudged Clinton's intentions, Paraskevopoulos contends. The U.S. President's support for Gligorov became obvious with the dispatch of a U.S. military contingent to FYROM, and it is clear that the EU believes the existence of FYROM is necessary to peace in the region. While Papandreou hesitated to impose the embargo for fear of the European reaction, he was counting on Washington's support because of U.S.-European tensions in the region. The embargo was a "risky" initiative and it failed, Paraskevopoulos continues. At the same time that Papandreou found no supporters abroad, he "blackmailed" fellow Greek politicians into approving his move for fear of domestic political consequences. Since he cannot assign responsibility for his mistakes to the "bad Europeans," he is blaming them, as he will blame the "good" Americans for not understanding Greece and then blame the UN for using the same criteria toward a "statelet" like FYROM that it applies to a "state" like Greece, Paraskevopoulos concludes. EU Action Termed "Naked Provocation" An editorial in the 7 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA calls the EU referral decision an "unprecedented naked provocation" against Greece, as well as yet another proof of the "partiality and enmity" of Greece's European partners. The EU decision "automatically makes Brussels an untrustworthy interlocutor" in solving the problem between Athens and Skopje, the editorial continues. If Greece should not be concerned, for it will win its case on the basis of "inalienable rights," it is the "major issue of Community solidarity that is at stake." In practice, the editorial concludes, solidarity that has given way to "interests and other goals" is nonexistent. Politicians React The 8 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the reaction of a number of Greek politicians following the EU decision. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the decision "does not foster stability and security in the area of the southern Balkans" and that it may have a "negative influence" on Cyrus Vance's mediating initiative. Venizelos added that the EU's common foreign and security policy has been "sorely tried" in recent months because of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and that the decision "violates Community solidarity." I KATHIMERINI also cited Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis as saying that "the Skopje issue is too important to be entrusted to technocrats and economists." Arsenis charged that the European countries' understanding of the "specificities of conditions in the Balkans is especially weak." The decision, he is quoted as saying, is the "bureaucratic result of processing data from a strictly legalistic point of view." Arsenis insisted that the decision will not change the Greek stance. New Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert is cited as saying that while the unity of the national front on the issue of FYROM must be maintained, Greeks must be told that the situation is very serious. Evert criticized government policy, charging that "precious time has been lost" and that "the absence of a clear policy has produced the expected results." According to I KATHIMERINI, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras stated that the EU decision "expressing Community solidarity with Gligorov" is "unprecedented and offensive." He added that even if the Court's decision goes against Greece, "we are not compelled to apply it." Communist Party (KKE) leader Aleka Papariga is cited as blaming the signing of the Maastricht Treaty for the Skopje problem and stressing that it gave the EU "the right to interfere in issues concerning Greece." Finally, N. Konstandopoulos, leader of the Coalition of the Left for Progress, attributed the decision to the "erratic moves" of the government, the ND, and Political Spring, as well as to the EU's negative stance. Noting that an impasse has been reached, Konstandopoulos blamed the government and the parties for a "purely political" approach to the Skopje problem, emphasizing that the PASOK government has turned Greece into the venue for a "peculiar confrontation pitting the interests of the United States, the EU and some of its member states against each other." United States Responsible for Referral In an 8 April I KATHIMERINI article, Ino Afendouli writes that according to a number of moves "in the sphere of secret diplomacy," the United States seems to have offered the EU the basic argument to refer Greece to the Court of Justice by stating that FYROM is "dangerously destabilized" by the Greek embargo and that relations between the Slavic majority and the Albanian minority are "exacerbated." Moreover, the absence of a "conflagration" in the area is just as important to the United States as to the EU, Afendouli continues. At a time when Bosnians are led to a "U.S.-inspired" Croatian-Muslim federation, it is "unrealistic" to expect that Washington and Greece's partners will be receptive to "Greek sensitivities that, in their view, are a destabilizing factor." Afendouli ends by warning that the U.S. intervention may lead to an unsatisfactory solution that the Greek Government would be unable to accept since it rejected better ones in the past.
