The alleged provisional government has de facto power, but no authority. This power has no legality, no legitimacy. It is a power resting upon bayonets, bayonets that are increasingly rusted. For our part, we have not pretended to hold the government machinery in our hands. We therefore have not been relieved of what we did not have, but we have kept moral authority in the face of the usurpers and legitimate authority in the eyes of the international community. What the people, those responsible for the coup d'etat, do not yet understand is that for President Clinton, the Haitian problem is no longer a Haitian problem, but rather a problem of U.S. domestic policy. On that score, President Clinton is going to show the same determination he showed with other problems falling within the scope of U.S domestic policy. [Renois] [Words indistinct] Haiti in all that? Meanwhile, there is the embargo that was adopted by the UN Security Council. Mr. Prime Minister, there are also threats of international intervention. In September of 1993, you did not want a total embargo for Haiti, but today, we have reached that point. What is your government's report, today, on the economic situation in the country, the problems of the poor, the deprived strata of this country? [Malval] In September 1993, I had the same opinion as the -- let us say -- international community. It was after the Governors Island agreement. We all believed in the good faith of General Cedras. The development of events proved that Gen. Cedras is not a man of his word. Negotiations with someone who does not respect what he signs are senseless. Today, my firmness remains the only language possible in view of such demonstration of bad faith. (?Cedras had) in his hands all the cards possible to get the country and himself out of the crisis. He preferred to try to outsmart everyone. He thought his fantasies were realities. Well, today, unfortunately, all of us are paying the full price for ambitions which -- all things considered -- are disproportionate because.... [pauses] here again, I like to use psychological profiles. I know what I am going to say is very strong, but it is my way of perceiving and relating things: Gen. Cedras represents what I would call the debris of the sensual, decadent Jean-Claudism without vision. Today, Gen. Cedras has run out of ideas. He has no alternative to offer the country but a succession of puppet governments that have no foundation among the people, no legal foundations, no constitutional foundations, and no international recognition. This is very little to offer a country that is experiencing the most intense crisis of its history since 1804.
