According to its figures Russia will harvest 80-85 million tonnes of grain. For comparison's sake last year the country obtained 99 million tonnes of grain and the year before 107 million. On what does "SovEkon" base its forecast? The area sown to winter crops has declined by 20 percent and about 2 million hectares (about 15 percent) of the winter crops that were sown have died. The sowing campaign began quite well but now the pace has been reduced, as is borne out by the weekly information. And if the sowing schedule is extended the harvesting schedule will also be pushed back. "SovEkon" also keeps track of information about fuel and fertilizer stocks. As of 1 May stocks of fuel on the farms were 40 percent less than last year and half as much fertilizer and toxic chemicals were applied: The soil continues to be depleted. It is true, as our correspondent Andrey Aderekhin has reported, that the Kuban grain fields this year will not be reduced. In the traditional grain regions they are working on the sowing responsibly and seriously and if necessary going out on night shifts, although it is a long time since anyone monitored anybody. The Kuban private farmers have prepared seeds and equipment in advance. And already the most acute question is not "how to sow and how to harvest?" but "how to sell most advantageously?" Almost everyone is planning a lower yield. But many grain stocks remain in the country from last year's harvest -- approximately 18 million tonnes. Every month about 2.8 million tonnes are spent. We are thus provided with "old" grain on average for six months and for some types through to the next sowing campaign. Apart from the Far East and Siberian regions, to which it is cheaper to deliver imported grain than our own because of the huge distance it has to travel, Russia will nonetheless manage with its own grain this year -- that is the stance of Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun. In principle these calculations are convincing, but ultimately it will all depend on the structure of our stocks: Those 18 million tonnes of grain could contain, for instance, an insufficient quantity of food grain or corn.
