FR940707-0-00003 FR940707-0-00001 Administrative Procedure Act Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d), as Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I find good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking and 30-day delay in effectiveness as to these minor revisions. The notice and delayed effective date are being waived because these technical amendments and corrections to certain OGE regulations concern matters of agency organization, practice and procedure and because it is in the public interest that correct and up-to-date citations and information about paperwork approval numbers for the respective information collection requirements be contained in the regulations as soon as possible. Executive Order 12866 In promulgating these technical amendments to its regulations, OGE has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. These amendments and corrections have not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as they deal with agency organization, management and personnel matters and are not, in any event, deemed ``significant'' thereunder. Regulatory Flexibility Act As Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I certify under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply because this technical amendments rulemaking does not itself contain any new information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (rather, as noted above, in pertinent part references to existing OMB paperwork control numbers are being added at appropriate places in OGE's regulations).
