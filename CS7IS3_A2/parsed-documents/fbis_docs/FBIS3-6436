It says this would constitute "excessive intervention in the private sector." Private businesses, too, are all reacting strongly against the United States, bewildered at its hard-line attitude. The Japanese automobile industry has made firm its plan to set up a consultative body together with the U.S. Big Three automakers to discuss ways to increase Japanese procurement of American automobiles. The government, thus, plans to emphasize these points to gain U.S. understanding. The United States is seeking a new action program aimed at maintaining the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market at a 20-percent level. In this regard, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] stresses that "a 20-percent share was never a commitment, to begin with." Even if the United States should formally ask Japan to work out an action program at bilateral consultations to be held in Hawaii next week, MITI officials plan to tell U.S. negotiators that Japan "cannot accept share-based targets." Meanwhile, the Japanese semiconductor industry has reacted to the situation in a relatively calm manner, saying that its "relations with the U.S. semiconductor industry are not in a critical state," (as stated by an executive official at a major electronics maker). The reason is that although the foreign share of the domestic semiconductor market has indeed shown a downward trend, sales of foreign semiconductors have steadily increased. According to the Users' Committee of Foreign Semiconductors (UCOM), which has been organized by domestic electronics businesses, the sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan in the first half (April-September) of fiscal year 1993 increased by 25 percent over the same period in the previous fiscal year. As a result, hardly any U.S. maker has voiced dissatisfaction, even though the share of foreign semiconductors in the Japanese market has dropped. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has asked the Japanese Government to guarantee further opening its markets to American automobiles and auto parts. In this regard, MITI has expressed strong objection, saying that "the automobiles sector is a free market since access is not limited in terms of locality, in contrast to the case of mobile telephones," (as stated by MITI Deputy Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu). In the case of mobile telephones, the government has the authority over issuing licenses regarding such matters as the use of certain frequencies. MITI, however, stresses "the automobile sector is a matter of private business, and intervention in this sector would run contrary to a principle in the framework trade talks that efforts would be made to increase market access in areas which the government is capable of handling," (as stated by a senior MITI official). Japanese automakers, which have given consideration to U.S. demands and are currently working on a new plan for purchasing American auto parts, have also begun to stiffen their attitudes. They maintain that "since the purchase plan is purely a voluntary target, it would definitely lead to managed trade if government guarantees were to be included," (as stated by a senior official at a major automaker). The Honda Motor Co., Ltd., which plans to purchase approximately $4.9 billion worth of American auto parts in fiscal year 1994, finds it difficult to fulfill its plan due to dropping sales in its passenger vehicles department. Consequently, the company "is considering plans to hammer out cooperation with U.S. firms again on a medium- and long-term basis," (as stated by a company executive).
