Moslems attacked Serb defence positions west of Doboj with strong small arms and mortar fire and tried to carry out an infantry attack, but it was repulsed, Bosnian Serb military sources said. Moslem forces carried out a strong infantry attack northeast of Teslic (southwest of Doboj), planning to break through the Serb defence lines, but Bosnian Serb units repulsed this attack and forced the Moslem formations to retreat. Moslems on Monday also stepped up attacks from anti-aircraft weapons and small arms northeast of Doboj, but the attacks ceased after the Serb side returned strong fire.
