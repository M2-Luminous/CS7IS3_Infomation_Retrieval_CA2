However, it was a good opportunity nevertheless, to criticize the social policy of the government of Edouard Balladur, and, as the Socialist Martin Malvy said, to compare the promises made with the results obtained. Communist Alain Bocquet for his part advocated the abrogation of the five-year law on employment. The prime minister replied during the afternoon: This no-confidence motion was tabled by the very same people who are responsible for the situation that we inherited.
