Even an improved economic situation, which is already emerging, cannot alone remove the structural failings of past years, the chancellor stressed. Important reforms, such as the reform of the railways and the postal service, have been delayed for decades. At the same time, during the good years unions and employers nowhere near managed to exploit to the full the legal scope for more flexible working hours and longer machine running times. Kohl described as a priority "completing economic and social unity in Germany." The people in eastern Germany today are going through a "difficult and far-reaching structural change at a breathtaking pace." Much less radical changes in western Germany would put people very much on the defensive, he said.
