Uncertain How Ukrainian Parliament Will Act"] [Text] Kiev -- "Temporary inconvenience equals improvement forever," Bill Clinton and Leonid Kravchuk gave a press conference next to this promising poster, which does, admittedly, pertain to repair work at Borispol Airport. According to Leonid Kravchuk, this brief visit is as valuable as a long one. Bill Clinton said that the three countries' presidents are ready to sign an agreement on Friday that will commit Ukraine to eliminate the 176 ICBM's and around 1,500 nuclear warheads targeted against the United States and open up new forms of cooperation in the economy, politics, and security. "Let me give credit to President Kravchuk for his statesmanlike way of thinking and his guidance in reaching this accord," he said. However, the credit still has to be given: The U.S. President promised that he would take care to ensure that Ukraine receives most speedily the proper compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons that have already been taken to Russia and, in addition, that Ukraine gets a considerable amount of money for dismantling the weapons -- money that can be used for defense and conversion. The United States pledged to help Ukraine during the difficult period of its transition to a market economy. In Kiev Clinton announced the creation of an enterprise support fund for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus. Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" will provide additional guarantees that it can cooperate with the U.S. Armed Forces and with NATO countries, and Ukraine's decision to become a nuclear-free state will make it possible for it to obtain economic aid from the World Bank, the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the G-7 countries. "I believe that Ukraine cannot be confident of its security in the 21st century unless it is strong economically," Bill Clinton said. The Ukrainian president decided to act without recourse to the parliament, which not so long ago even had a fair number of complaints to make about the START-I Treaty. "Philosophers say that everything in the world is changing and that you cannot step into the same river twice," Leonid Kravchuk said. "It is the same with the parliament: I hope that it will understand the crux of this global problem facing the world, the crux of our relations, and given the three states' mutual desire we will fulfill our commitments with its support." The last session of the current Supreme Council next week could upset this: The accusation of "disarming" Ukraine is one that many people respond to, particularly during an election campaign. During Clinton's visit the youth faction of the People's Rukh demonstrated at the airport with the Ukrainian Students' Union. Boys stood under banners proclaiming "Careful, Clinton: First Crimea, then Alaska"; "Bill, would you disarm if you were in the same cage as a Russian bear?"; and "All Missiles to Zhirinovskiy?" The last question is of interest to many Ukrainian inhabitants -- it may be cleared up by the three president's meeting in Moscow.
