FR940414-0-00008 FR940414-0-00001 (ii) Two commenters suggested that they should not be required to support retired software when there is active equivalent or upgraded software available from the Licensor which it will support. (iii) One commenter suggested that the language should be amended to exclude information that the Licensor does not have the legal right to turn over; e.g., third party Software. (iv) One commenter suggested that the only support covered under this section (2)(xi) should be the support required by the Contract. The commenter also felt that the Licensee should be allowed to modify the Licensed Software for proper equipment operation but not for feature enhancements, and the Licensor should receive royalty-free rights to make, use and sell any modifications made by the Licensee under this section. (v) One commenter remarked that the only time the Licensee should be able to modify the Licensed Software is in the event that the Licensor withdraws from the business of selling and supporting the Licensed Software. Response: (i) REA agrees that support after the warranty period should have a specified time limit. This was addressed when REA published the Proposed Rule Form 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation) in the Federal Register . (ii) REA feels that the Licensee should reasonably expect to receive support for the Licensed Software without having to upgrade the System. (iii) REA agrees in principle, however, this exclusion does not extend to any information or Software not specifically identified as ``agreed excluded documentation'' in an attachment to the Contract, and under no circumstance can it include the overall operating Software of the System. Section (2)(xi) has been revised to reflect the above. (iv) REA agrees that the support referred to in section (2)(xi) is the support required by the Contract. The language has been changed to reflect this. However, REA does not agree that the Licensee should be restricted from making feature enhancements. The Licensee must be able to add enhancements to the System in order to offer current and future services to their subscribers. Due to the circumstances that would require enforcement of this section (2)(xi) any changes made under this section become the exclusive property of the Licensee. (v) REA feels the Licensee should have the right to modify the Licensed Software in the event that the Licensor refuses to furnish support as required by the Contract. One commenter felt that in section (2)(xii), the word Licensor should be Licensee. One commenter felt that this section should apply to both the Licensor and the Licensee. Response: Section (2)(xii) refers specifically to the Licensor. Section (2)(xiii) refers to the Licensee and details the remedies available to the Licensor. Five commenters remarked on section (2)(xiii). Their comments are summarized below: (i) One commenter felt that damages of ten times the Contract price for a breach of the Software License was excessive and should be changed to the initial cost of the Software. (ii) One commenter felt that damages of ten times the Contract price for a breach of the Software License was not a sufficient deterrent and sixty (60) days notice before termination may cause irreparable harm to the Licensor. It was suggested that section (2)(xiii) be eliminated in its entirety. (iii) One commenter suggested that the sixty (60) day notice period for REA should be changed to thirty (30) days. (iv) One commenter wanted section (2)(xiii) to apply to the Licensee and the Licensor and exclude from damages lost revenue or profits. (v) One commenter wanted REA to agree that certain events would cause REA to recommend termination. One commenter wanted the right to terminate the Software License without REA approval. (vi) One commenter suggested the word reasonable in the first sentence of section (2)(xiii) be changed to thirty (30) days. Response: (i) REA feels that damages limited to the initial cost of the Software is not a sufficient deterrent to provide a reasonable amount of security against a breach of the Software License. However, after further evaluation, and in response to the comments, REA feels that ten times the Contract price could financially devastate the typical REA Borrower and consequently jeopardize REA loan security. Damages payable by the Licensee for breach of this License have been changed to not exceed the total Contract price (ii) In order to protect the Borrower and REA loan security REA feels there must be a cap on damages against the Licensee for a breach of this License. REA also feels that there must be some restrictions on the termination of the Software License. This section (2)(xiii) remains. (iii) REA feels that thirty (30) days is not sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate and arrive at a fair and equitable decision regarding the circumstances that might cause termination of the Software License. (iv) As stated previously, section (2)(xii) refers specifically to the Licensor. Section (2)(xiii) refers to the Licensee and details the remedies available to the Licensor. (v) Any event that would cause the Licensor to recommend termination of the Software License must be individually and thoroughly evaluated by REA prior to any recommendation by REA. In order to protect the loan security of REA and the Licensee's ability to repay that loan, REA must be included in any decision to terminate the Software License. (vi) REA has evaluated the suggestion to change the word reasonable to thirty (30) days and agree that it would make the Software License more definitive. The language in section (2)(xiii) has been changed to reflect this. The remainder of section (2)(xiii) has not been changed.
