FR940429-0-00010 FR940429-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 219, 226 and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Interim rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to revise the definitions for historically black colleges (HBCUs) and universities and minority institutions (MIs). The rule also revises the requirement for an offeror to qualify as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI both at time of submission of the offer and at time of award by eliminating the requirement to qualify at time of award. DATES: Effective Date: April 21, 1994. Comment Date: Comments on the interim DFARS rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before June 28, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to the The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, ATTN: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, PDUSD (A&T) DP (DAR), IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D315 in all correspondence related to this issue. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Subsections 811(a) and (b), of the FY 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) revise the definitions for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) in 10 U.S.C. 2323(a)(1)(B) and (C). Subsection 811(c) eliminates the requirement for an entity that is seeking a DoD contract and represents itself as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI to maintain its status as such entity at the time of award. The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94&hyph;06, April 21, 1994, to implement Subsections 811(a), (b) and (c). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The sole purpose of this rule is to implement statutory revisions. The impact, if any, would benefit small entities, because the requirement for retaining status as a small disadvantaged business, historically black college or university, or minority institution, at time of award is deleted. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subparts will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. This action is necessary because Subsections 811(a), (b), and (c) became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160), on November 30, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.
