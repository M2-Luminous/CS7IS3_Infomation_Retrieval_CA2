At a news conference held on 20 January by the provincial statistical bureau, bureau director Song Xiuyan said that in 1993, our province achieved three breakthroughs in economic operations: Total industrial and agricultural output value topped 10 billion yuan, GDP 10 billion yuan, and financial revenue 1.1 billion yuan. Initial calculations by the provincial statistical bureau estimated that the province's GDP in 1993 could hit 10.1 billion yuan, up 9.5 percent from 1992 on comparable prices and achieving the provincial party and government's goal of "maintaining 8 percent growth and fighting for 9 percent growth." Total social demand could exceed total supply by 3.97 percent, which would be within reasonable control. The following are developments in various areas: Industrial production maintained its relatively high-speed growth, with parallel growth in production and sales and slight improvement in economic returns. According to progress-indicating figures, in 1993, manufacturing enterprises of all the province's counties and localities above the county level produced industrial output value of 7.67 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent from 1992, and scored 6.804 billion yuan in sales value, up 13.5 percent. Our province's ongoing economic development is distinguished by: 1) strong indications of investment-pulled growth; 2) government industry as the main force of the province's industrial development, though its growth rate is lower than that of nongovernment industry; 3) large and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises as the keel of the province's industry, playing a decisive role; 4) the value of completed exports and deliveries has continued to be good; and 5) there has been an improvement in economic efficiency. Initial calculations estimate that overall economic return indicators could reach 69.5 percent, an increase of about 5 percentage points from 1992 on a comparable basis. Of this, 265 state-owned budgetary manufacturing enterprises saw their total profits and remitted tax increase by 25.1 percent to 272 million yuan, which did not include the profits and taxes generated by the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau. Industrial development, however, remained beset by problems such as sluggish growth in light industry and low economic returns. The status of agriculture as the foundation of the province's economy continued to be reinforced and consolidated. The output of grain and oil-bearing crops hit record high levels. Animal husbandry output dropped as a result of natural disasters, but not as badly as had been predicted. Total grain output for the whole province was 1,186,300 tonnes, slightly higher than 1992 and an all-time high. The total output of oil-bearing crops was 152,100 tonnes, up 8.4 percent from 1992 and also an all-time high. Grazing livestock in the whole province increased by a total of 16.6 percent, with a year-end estimate of 22.1 million head, down 2.67 percent from 1992. Construction has expanded in scale, and key projects have progressed well. State-owned units of the whole province completed fixed-asset investment of 3.455 billion yuan, up 33.8 percent from the same period of [as published] 1992, of which investment in infrastructure projects and in renovation and transformation were up respectively 65.1 percent and 46.9 percent. The characteristics of fixed-asset investment were: Infrastructure investment was concentrated on central projects, and renovation and transformation investment on local projects; production investment increased faster than nonproduction investment; key construction projects went well; construction funds reached where they were needed; and there were relatively bigger increases in newly installed fixed assets. The situation in transport has improved, and there was growth in post and telecommunications services. The Xining Railway Sub-Bureau halted a 10-month fall and pushed the cargo transport volume back up to a level 2.1 percent higher than that in 1992. The road cargo transport volume was down 7.9 percent from 1992. Post and telecommunications services of the whole province rose 24 percent from 1992. Market sales were stable; foreign trade improved; new headway was made in opening up to the outside world; and prices rose by greater margins. The total commodity retail sales of the whole province were up 13.6 percent from 1992, or 1.2 percent allowing for price rises. The pattern in commodity retail markets was: Retail sales in consumer goods were relatively brisk; corporate spending was brought under control; markets in urban areas were prosperous and vibrant; sales in rural markets were sluggish; increases in the retail volumes of state-owned commercial units slowed and retail sales decreased in proportion. Foreign trade reversed the falling trend in the fourth quarter and rose 19.71 percent from 1992 in annual import and export value; of which exports grew 12.51 percent. In 1993, our province registered 53 companies as foreign-invested enterprises and imported $17.6 million of foreign capital. It was the year in which foreign-invested enterprises developed the fastest since reform and opening up. The provincial market price index in 1993 rose from 107.9 in January to 116.6 in December. Initial calculations estimated that the overall retail price level would rise 12.3 percent from 1992. Local financial revenue increased and financial order improved further. Local financial revenue for the whole province amounted to 1.135 billion yuan, up 39.1 percent from 1992. By the end of 1993, the total savings balance of all banks was 8.531 billion yuan, 17.86 percent higher than early in the year. Cash income for banks of the whole province increased 44.7 percent from 1992, while cash expenditure was up 45.1 percent. Income for urban and rural residents increased. A survey of a sample of urban residents showed that the per-capita income for living expenses of the province's urban residents was 1,879.29 yuan, up 19.77 percent, while per-capita consumption expenditure was 1,817.68 yuan, up 22.1 percent. The per-capita net income of the province's peasants and herdsmen was 672.33 yuan, up 11.4 percent from 1992.
