FR940921-2-00072 FR940921-2-00063 The proposed change in APRM setpoints T-factor permits implementation of appropriate reactor stability controls and maintains adequate off-rated LHGR margin for all operating conditions. This change, therefore, does not involve a significant increase in the probability and consequences of any event previously evaluated. 2. The request does not create the possibility of occurrence of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This change only redefines the APRM setpoints T-factor. The proposed changes do not involve any new modes of operation or any plant modifications. The ability to implement reactor stability controls do not result in any new precursors to an accident. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 3. The request does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change in the APRM setpoints T-factor definition allows the implementation of reactor stability controls during reactor operation at off-rated conditions which significantly improve the reactor stability performance. This is accomplished by achieving very stable power distributions outside the stability excluded region. Since the initial reactor conditions are very stable, the severity of a postulated reactor instability event is significantly diminished. The modified APRM setpoints T-factor accommodates higher power peaking to support the required stability controls. The modified APRM setpoints T-factor has been confirmed to provide adequate LHGR protection. Operation with higher peaking without APRM gains or flow bias trip setpoints adjustment does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety because the higher power peaking resulting from the APRM setpoints T-factor modification are below applicable LHGR limits. For power peaking conditions that result in APRM setpoints T-factor less than one, an adjustment to the APRM gains or trip setpoints is made to provide additional LHGR protection. Additionally, an upper bound is placed on power peaking by the modified APRM setpoints T-factor definition. Therefore, the modified APRM setpoint T-factor does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety because the higher power peaking resulting from the APRM setpoints T-factor modification is below applicable LHGR limits. Protection of other thermal limits for all previously analyzed events is accomplished by specific limits that are independent of the T-factor. These are the power and flow dependent MCPR Operating Limits which provide protection from fuel dryout and the rated MAPLHGR limit which provides protection of the peak clad temperature for the DBA LOCA. The proposed change does not result in an increase in core damage frequency. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety evaluated. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes the determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By October 21, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
