The defense ministers of the two states had an exchange of opinion on bilateral cooperation between the Czech Republic and Lithuania. According to the Czech defense minister, Antonin Baudys, his country can sell Lithuania arms, if Lithuania expresses such a wish. Mr. Antonin Baudys said that the situation in Europe was complicated, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and owing to the unending military conflict in the Balkans. The war actions in the Balkans make NATO be cautious about admitting post-communist states to the organization. The Czech minister of defense, Mr. Antonin Baudys: [Begin Baudys recording in Czech, fading to English translation] The government of the Czech Republic considered the issue of NATO membership all through the year 1993. Therefore the American Partnership for Peace initiative did not surprise us. We realised that this is the maximum that can be achieved in Europe. We were the first to approve the project. We understand that NATO must treat Russia as an economic and military partner. [end recording] [Announcer] According to the Czech minister of defense, the Visegrad states, namely Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, as well as other East European states, seek NATO membership, striving to ground [as heard] that cooperation on a democratic state system and market economy. The Czech Republic also speaks up for the preservation of the existing state borders in Europe, and against the formation of any new military blocs on the continent. According to the Czech defense minister, the U.S. Partnership for Peace project makes it possible to put into practice the potential of East and Central European states, without doing harm to the peculiar interests of a given country. According to the Czech minister of defense, Antonin Baudys, it was accentuated during the visit of the American President that the Partnership for Peace initiative did not only mean cooperation in the military sphere: [Begin Baudys recording] The words uttered by the U.S. President during the visit to the Czech Republic witnessed that the United States will support European states by way of economic programs and investment. A draft of such cooperation has already been worked out and it will soon be submitted to the Czech Government. [end recording] [Announcer] According to the Czech defense minister, each East European state must draw up its individual program of participation in the Partnership for Peace project. Lithuanian minister of national defense, Linas Linkevicius, told Radio Vilnius that new links of partnership with the Czech Republic were going to be established. [Begin Linkevicius recording] Five groups of Lithuanian officers will go to the Czech Republic to gain experience there. At present, deputy minister of defense and the commander of the Air Force are having a course in that country, too. We expect Czech assistance in the sphere of armament development. Cooperation between the two states is concrete and fruitful, and that is most important. [end recording] [Announcer] The defense minister of the Czech Republic will stay in Lithuania until Wednesday.
