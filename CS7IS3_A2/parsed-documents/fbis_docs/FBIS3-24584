Kolosovskaya; UDC 621.372.8] [Abstract] A solution was obtained for the problem of electro-optic interaction of the fundamental mode of a channel waveguide with the field produced by electrodes. Generalized variables were used for the solution. Computations were made for one of the most promising class of integrated optical devices - modulators on ferro-electric LiNbO[.sup]3[/] type crystals, where the wave structure is formed by diffusion of additives from the applied thin film. Based on the analysis of the solution, the combination was found of the waveguide - electrode system parameters, which provide the least possible half-wave voltages U[.sup]�[/]. It was established that the factor theoretically limiting from below the U[.sup]�[/] values in the red and infrared spectrum region is the maximum value of the increment of the refraction index attainable in a diffusion waveguide. The relationship of the minimal U[.sup]�[/] as a function of _l_ was constructed for the Ti:LiNbO[.sup]3[/] waveguides. Introduction of a buffer layer does not change qualitatively the results of the analysis. Figures 8, table 1, references 19: 7 Russian, 12 Western.
