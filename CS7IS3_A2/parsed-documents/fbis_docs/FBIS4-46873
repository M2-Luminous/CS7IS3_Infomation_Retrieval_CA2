This decree had the stamp "not subject to publication," and, although the news agencies rather quickly informed the public concerning the creation of this commission, all its subsequent activities have been veiled by secrecy and truly nothing "has been subject" to publication. Certainly, no one today doubts the necessity of overcoming hyperinflation in Ukraine. From this standpoint the creation of a commission to develop a plan for financial preparations appears to be completely normal. As much as the appearance of this commission, structured as it is, is logical, there is a more complex question (members of the commission are the presidential adviser Valentyn Symonenko-the head of the commission, Mykola Syvulskyy deputy head of the agency for international cooperation and investment, Israeli ex-finance minister Itzak Moday, two entrepreneurs - Boris Hubskyy, the head of the center SLAVUTYCH and Viktor Medvedchuk, the president of the association of lawyers in Ukraine.) In the view of some professionals, what seems strange is that the commission contains no representatives of the Ministry of Finance or any professionals from the National Bank. But according to others this is precisely what the makeup of the commission should be - a minimum number of people (for productivity), a maximum of expertise and an almost obligatory presence in the commission of representatives of the executive departments. The last is not without sense: many economic reforms were prepared by one or more people, were enacted by a command, headed by a totally different person (according to some sources, the legendary Ludwig Erhard worked to the recommendations of two American economists). There is a different problem, that of personalities. The riddle remains, for example, as to why Valentyn Symonenko was appointed head of the commission, a man who was not known for any prominent achievements as an expert on financial questions (obviously, in this case the President relied on his adviser as a person in whose bureaucratic talents he had full confidence). One member of the commission who is truly an authority on finances on the Ukrainian side is Mykola Syvulskyy. The appearance on the commission of Boris Hubskyy, Hryhoriy Surkis and Viktor Medvedchuk seems strange, in as much as, certainly not one of them until now has been known as a prominent financial expert. According to the words of one Ukrainian official, who considers himself as well informed, these people were included on the commission as practical men, who well understand the "loopholes" in the law, and how to circumvent them, and therefore can protect the program for financial stabilization against the appearance within the plan of such "loopholes." This argument is original, but it is necessary to admit the following: to compete with the above mentioned trio as with "practical men" is really quite complicated: how valuable is just the battle for the Kiev "Dynamo", won by Hryhoriy Surkis but not without the help of Viktor Medvedchuk, Borys Hubskyy and other business partners (after Viktor Bezverkhyy, president of the football club "Dynamo," emerged untouched from the scandal "on the level of Interpol," associated with the sale of Protasov and Lytovchenko, it seemed that no force could be found which would defeat him - but one was found, and it turned out to be Surkis and his partners). Besides that, one can speculate that this selection was not accidental, yet for another reason: Viktor Medvedchuk heads the Ukrainian-American-Israeli attorney's office of BIM; the makeup of the committee includes the ex-finance minister for Israel - therefore, evidently, this could also be a question of definite Israeli capital interests in Ukraine. But, absolutely, the most interesting figure on the commission is the former Israeli finance minister Itzhak Moday. A man who has three advanced degrees (in engineering, jurisprudence, and economics), a highly qualified financier, Itzhak Moday acquired in Israel a reputation as a brilliant organizer. Becoming minister of finance in 1984, when inflation was coming close to 500 percent per year, he left the post in 1986, when inflation was at 19 percent. During his second tenure in this position during 1990-1992, inflation was reduced from 18 percent to just under 10 percent. As was recently reported by one of the influential Israeli newspapers "Maariv," in January of last year, on Itzhak Moday's 67th birthday, his former secretaries arranged a "surprise" party: on a huge cake was written "9.4 percent inflation - thank you. We have not forgotten." The fact that many other people in Israel "did not forget" the achievements of the minister is certified by the number of legends which are associated with his name. Ukrainian financiers have also been able to convince themselves of the exceptionally high professional level of the Israeli ex-minister. According to Viktor Yushchenko, head of the directorate of NBU [National Bank of Ukraine], only a few among those with whom he has had dealings have such a keen sense of financial problems, and can so brilliantly generate ideas in this area. Thus, having united into one commission according to the directive of the President, these people were to develop, in a month and a half, a plan for the financial stabilization of Ukraine and give it to the President back in February. According to Mykola Syvulskyy, the members of the commission came together on the position that today's inflation in Ukraine cannot be subdued purely through monetary methods, that is, only through a severe restriction on the supply of money; a real effect must be induced by the policy of a steady reduction of inflation from month to month, at 5-10 percent, depending on the status that prevails in the production sector. The money supply is also to increase, confirms Mykola Syvulskyy, corresponding to the supply of goods in the market, but at the same time, not in proportion to the rise in prices (if you are to have, for example, a guideline of a monthly reduction in inflation by 40 percent, then the aim is to increase credit deposits by 30-35 percent). What the other steps are that have been included in the program, we were unable to determine either from Mykola Syvulskyy or from Itzhak Moday, nor from the other members of the commission, in that all of them believe that publication of the details of the program at least until the beginning of its implementation is premature. How will the Israeli experience of overcoming inflation be adopted and what will be the role of Itzhak Moday in case the program is approved? It is not simple to give an answer to the first question in that the tactics announced by Mykola Syvulskyy do not totally match with the stabilization which took place in Israel during the years 1985-86. (As is known, the program of stabilization which entered history as the "plan of professor Bruno," first of all provided for a strict financial policy, a sharp reduction of the budget deficit, subsidies and privileges, and an increase in taxes against a background of a decrease in the real income of the populace. At the beginning of the reform, three way deals were made between the government, employers, and the trade unions according to which the trade unions temporarily halted strikes and were actually agreeing to the freezing of wages, the entrepreneurs were agreeing to the actual freezing of prices, the government took upon itself to control 90 percent of prices and to maintain the frozen exchange rate of the shekel at the same level (although it is true, not without the help of the USA in the form of 1.5 billion US dollars for the stabilization fund). Specifically due to such dynamics and strict methods, the country was able to knock down inflation to less than 20 percent per year and to reduce the price of credit on the world market from 880 percent to 53-55 percent.) Considering this, the role of the minister of the country that emerged from a crisis via such "silken" methods appears to be rather unique in the realization of a plan for a progressive surmounting of inflation in a different country. Considering the high professional level of the ex-minister of finance for Israel, one can suppose that he sees in our realities a basis for this. One thing which at the moment Ithzak Moday is emphasizing is the essential need for him to be personally present in Ukraine if the program is going to be carried out: "Economics - this is a living entity which reacts very sensitively to all changes. This is why the creator of the program needs to oversee his creation, in order to have the ability to make essential corrections and modifications to its behavior." And the last question - what fate awaits the program? The answer will depend on how developments in parliament will unfold, who will join the government and who will head it. (It is interesting that three members of the commission - Mykola Syvulskyy, Viktor Medvedchuk, and Valentyn Symonenko - ran for the new parliament, but only Valentyn Symonenko succeeded). Thus the plan can be buried as easily as it was created, once again testifying to the simple truth that in Ukraine you can create as many programs as you wish, but this does not mean that they will mean anything in this country.
