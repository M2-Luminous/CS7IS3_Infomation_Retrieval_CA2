Minutes before the Cuban foreign relations minister arrived at the Protocol House of the Vietnamese Government, Cam told PRENSA LATINA that the traditional ties of friendship and cooperation between the Caribbean island and the Indochinese nation received a major boost in the past 18 months. The usually phlegmatic chief of Vietnamese diplomacy displayed a big smile and gave Robaina a strong embrace upon his arrival at Noi Bai Airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We know that your Asian tour has been exhausting, but we are happy to have you here and are convinced that your stay in Vietnam will further strengthen our bilateral ties in all areas, Cam told Robaina. Meanwhile, Robaina emphasized that visiting Vietnam was not only an inescapable duty but an enormous pleasure, because it involves an undying friendship and a mutual desire to further advance collaboration and exchange in the economic, commercial, and scientific-technical areas, as well as in all possible areas. He pointed out that as a reflection of its indestructible ties with the Asian nation, Cuba has in recent times felt the love and solidarity from it through specific and very significant actions. Afterward, Robaina, accompanied by adviser Carlos Amores and Cuban Ambassador to Vietnam Tania Maceira, started official talks with his counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam. The visitor will also be greeted by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who visited Havana last July and is among the main promoters of the expansion of ties between the two nations. Tommorrow, the Cuban delegation will lay a wreath at the mausoleum of national hero Ho Chi Minh and will hold a number of meetings with Dau Ngoc Xuan, president of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investments, and with Nguyen Cong Tan and Le Van Triet, ministers of agriculture and food industry and of commerce, respectively. Robaina, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, will meet with leaders of Vietnamese political and mass organizations, which have promoted campaigns of solidarity with the island in recent times to collect rice and school supplies. The Cuban leader will also meet with Hong Ha, chief of the Foreign Affairs Commission and secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). On the same day Robaina will meet with CPV Secretary General Do Muoi. The visiting foreign minister will grant a news conference before departing for Ho Chi Minh City on 23 March. In the southern capital city, the delegation will meet with Vo Tran Tri, CPV first secretary in that province, and Pham Chanh Truc, vice president of that city's Parliament. In Ho Chi Minh City Robaina will end his Asian tour that started on 8 March and included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
