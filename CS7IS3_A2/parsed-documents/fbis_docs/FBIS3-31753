During the course of the night members of the peace forces blocked key positions on the Okucani-Gradiska upon Sava road with armored personnel carriers and infantry, preventing pedestrians and vehicles from passing through, thus bringing the crisis that has emerged near the Sava bridge to its most extreme stage, one that threatens to become an open clash between the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and the Serbian people of Western Slavonija. At this moment are 10 UN armored personnel carriers on the highway, near a place called Dubovacki Nadloznjak. When asked who ordered the latest show of force, sadly not the only one, the UNPROFOR members replied that this was the order of the peacekeepers' supreme command. Let us recap, UNPROFOR command yesterday issued an ultimatum to the Krajina police to surrender control of the bridge on the Sava River that links the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and the Serbian region of Western Slavonija with the Srpska republic to the UN forces. This deadline expires today. The RSK government's ultimatum was that the members of the Jordanian, Nepalese, and Argentinian Battalions must withdraw their men and military hardware from the Okucani-Gradiska upon Sava road within 24 hours and this deadline expired at 1900 [1800 GMT] yesterday. This latest action of violence by the Blue Berets has only complicated the already critical situation in Western Slavonija that has emerged in connection with control over the bridge on the Sava River linking Stara Gradiska and Gradiska upon Sava, which threatens to escalate and may result in clashes. For the time being, we have not observed a concentration of new troops from other UN Protected Areas [UNPA] in the region, beside those who regrouped from some parts in UNPA Sector West. It has been learned, however, that there have been indications that the existing UNPROFOR troops in the crisis zone of Western Slavonija could be strengthened by additional forces.
