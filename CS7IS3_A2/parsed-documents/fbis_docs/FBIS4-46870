Facilities being privatized cost more than a billion coupons, and this could make not only work collectives insolvent, but also newly appeared businessmen and entrepreneurs. Some of these fat moneybags with dubious credentials have begun to fear that the appropriate organs really will insist upon declarations regarding their incomes--something which the police chief has already threatened. But here's an unprecedented occurrence, which is included neither in this scheme nor in our understanding of business. One private firm withdrew its application to participate in a recent auction because the required packet of suitable documents... does not provide for the submission of a declaration regarding income. Just what is all this about? Teodor Dyakiv, the general director of this firm--which is named Formula--has interpreted the motives for his action as follows: "If the people's patience snaps, business will be ruined; it will not be explained that some of us are conducting it honestly, and all of us will be completely wiped off the face of the earth. We have to bear this in mind if we wish to preserve and safeguard our own business affairs. The situation in Ukraine's business nowadays is such that it allows questionably obtained money (shadow capital) and illegally acquired foreign currency to be used for the purpose of buying facilities to be privatized. And, as a result of this, mafia-type groups are able to legalize their own capital, and foreign firms can buy our properties at prices that are as low as one-hundredth the amounts required from Ukrainian buyers." The fact that privatization in Lvov has started down an illegal, criminal, anti-Ukrainian, and antistate path is no secret for its organizers. At a recent seminar on the topic of market reforms Mr. Pakholyuk, the former head of this city's Communal Property Fund, openly declared that the legalization of stolen money was being allowed, and predatory foreign capital was being brought into Ukraine during the course of privatization. This unprincipled attitude runs through practically every briefing in the city administration when matters come up regarding the auctions, privatization, municipal problems, or the budget. The treasury needs money, and the mayor's office views the sale of certain nonresidential facilities as a source of it. Nor do they look too closely at those persons or firms who pay more for a hotel, barber shop, or store. But what will be the political consequences of such an approach? What will be the reaction of the population to this kind of privatization? Can a so-called middle class of property-owners--the foundation of economic stability--be created by following such a path? None of this coincides at all with Mr. Dyakiv's plans to begin a national business in Ukraine--one which would not reduce the people to rags, but rather help to raise their standard of living. For--sooner or later--we will have to eradicate the mafia from Lvov, before it has eradicated us. The only surprising thing is that the process of small-scale privatization--which would be more suitably termed grabbing--is being carried out under the monitoring controls of the IFC [International Finance Corporation]--an independent member of the World Bank that is working together with 101 of the world's countries. In order to understand what kind of a goal this corporation has set for itself, all we have to do is become acquainted with an interview that Roberta Feldman--an IFC expert--granted to the newspaper DILO. She openly stated that consultants for privatization projects are recruited and selected for the corporation based on the following three criteria: "knowledge of the country's language, a fundamental knowledge of economics, and the desire to live in the country concerned. Experience in small-scale privatization is not a mandatory requirement inasmuch as very few people have such experience." And so these are the consultants! All they have to be is an unemployed economist in the world, and they can come to someone else's country and teach the people there something about which they themselves have not the slightest idea! No wonder we have such lamentable results with regard to our market reforms. Nor did Ms. Feldman conceal the fact that the program entitled "Small-Scale Privatization in Ukraine" is a high-priority item for the corporation, as well as for the American Government, which is compensating the IFC for more than half of its total expenditures on this project. It would be naive to expect the United States to throw away a packet of "greenbacks" for the sake of helping the prosperity of Ukrainian business. Where the interests of Dyakiv's entrepreneurs and those of Genshaft [as transliterated] clash, for example, Mr. Teodor Dyakiv can hardly expect aid from the American Government. Therefore he is knocking on Ukrainian doors for the time being by way of acknowledging his subordination to the local authorities. Also lying on the desks of many persons in high municipal and oblast-level posts are numerous statements of his and "notes of protest" against the methods of small-scale privatization, which--in fact--constitute the great grabbing in Lvov. Mr. Teodor Dyakiv considers that such a document on the privatization of communal property as "A Declaration on the Distribution of the Statute Fund Among Its Founders" unconditionally permits private firms to buy up real estate at reduced prices on the accounts of other--as a rule--foreign firms. The authors of a packet of these documents (including some from the IFC)--to Mr. Dyakiv's way of thinking--do not know either the principles of the financial functioning of enterprises with various different forms of property ownership, or the actual possibilities of the tax inspectorates within the bounds of their jurisdiction. Therefore, he has proposed that the participants in an auction submit a "Declaration on the Origin of Capital," which would include a paragraph to the effect that the results of a buying-and-selling transaction can be revoked by a court if the winner at an auction has concealed the actual origin of his funds. Teodor Dyakiv considers that competitors will make sure that attention is drawn to the revelation of such facts. In his opinion this endeavor will lower the astronomical prices on the facilities being privatized, increase the real chances of buyers' associations, and weaken the justifiable opposition to these auctions on the part of the population. But the most important thing is that it will impel business toward playing the game honestly. Mr. Dyakiv has his own plan for carrying out small-scale privatization. He is proposing that an appraisal be made of the value of each particular facility, based on a 100-point scale. Potential participants in an auction would have to have an independent auditing firm verify the legality of their income and the absence of unregistered foreign capital. Provisions are made for according certain measures of relief and assistance to workers' collectives for the purpose of buying property. As to the integrity of real estate nowadays, his proposal would see that facilities located within certain buildings are to be resold as private property together with the land plots on which they are situated. And for those persons interested in locating their businesses there it is proposed to introduce a "leasing certificate"--a security for restricting the right of property ownership. However, this certificate would also guarantee the return to the owner of expenditures (for example, those spent on repairs) by way of selling the certificate in case its owner should decide to terminate his business at that location. After a certain length of time the "leasing certificate" would be exchanged for a document of ownership, whereas the leasing payment would be replaced by a tax on the real estate involved. All these provisions--in the firm opinion of this Ukrainian entrepreneur--would return business to a place within the framework of the law. They would also attract a wider circle of buyers to privatization, as well as making the latter genuine, accessible, and suitable for a market economy. Well now, we can only rejoice that some white crows will be appearing in our business, which--in the imagination of the masses--is black.
