FR940630-0-00023 FR940630-0-00008 Grant programs_housing and community development, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR parts 905 and 990 as follows: PART 905_INDIAN HOUSING PROGRAMS 1. The authority for part 905 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 25 U.S.C. 450e(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437aa, 1437bb, 1437cc, 1437ee, and 3535(d). 2. In §905.715, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to read as follows: §905.715 Computation of utilities expense level. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) If an IHA takes action, such as a wellhead purchase of natural gas, or administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings to reduce the rate it pays for utilities (including water, fuel oil, electricity, and gas), then the IHA will be permitted to retain one-half of the cost savings during the first 12 months attributable to its actions. Upon determination that the action was cost-effective in the first year, the IHA may be permitted to retain one-half the annual cost savings for an additional period not to exceed six years, if the actions continue to be cost-effective. See also paragraph (f) of this section and §905.730(c). * * * * * 3. In §905.720, the text of paragraph (b) following the heading is designated as paragraph (b)(1), and new paragraph (b)(2) is added, to read as follows: §905.720 Other costs. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (2) Units approved for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities are eligible for operating subsidy under the conditions provided in this paragraph (b)(2), and the costs attributable to them are to be included in the operating budget. If a unit satisfies the conditions stated in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (v) of this section, it will be eligible for subsidy at the rate of the AEL for the number of months the unit is devoted to such use. Approval will be given for a period of no more than three years. Renewal of the approval to allow payments after that period may be made only if the IHA can demonstrate that no other sources for paying the non-utility operating costs of the unit are available: (i) The unit must be used for either economic self-sufficiency activities directly related to maximizing the number of employed residents or for anti-drug programs directly related to ridding the development of illegal drugs and drug-related crime. The activities must be directed toward and for the benefit of residents of the development. (ii) The IHA must demonstrate that space for the service or program is not available elsewhere in the locality and that the space used is safe and suitable for its intended use or that resources are committed to make the space safe and suitable. (iii) The IHA must demonstrate satisfactorily that other funding is not available to pay for the non-utility operating costs. All rental income generated as a result of the activity must be reported as income in the operating subsidy calculation. (iv) Operating subsidy may be approved for only one site (involving one or more contiguous units) per Indian housing development for economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs, and the number of units involved should be the minimum necessary to support the service or program. Operating subsidy for any additional sites per development can only be approved by HUD Headquarters. (v) The IHA must submit a certification with its Performance Funding System Calculation that the units are being used for the purpose for which they were approved and that any rental income generated as a result of the activity is reported as income in the operating subsidy calculation. The IHA must maintain specific documentation of the units covered. Such documentation should include a listing of the units, the street addresses, and project/management control numbers. * * * * * 4. In §905.730, paragraph (c)(1)(i) is revised to read as follows: §905.730 Adjustments. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) Rates. (i) A decrease in the utilities expense level because of decreased utility rates_to the extent funded by operating subsidy_will be deducted by HUD from future operating subsidy payments. However, where the rate reduction covering utilities, such as water, fuel oil, electricity, and gas, is directly attributable to action by the IHA, such as wellhead purchase of natural gas, or administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings, then the IHA will be permitted to retain one-half of the cost savings attributable to its actions for the first year and, upon determination that the action was cost-effective in the first year, for up to an additional six years, as long as the actions continue to be cost-effective, and the other one-half of the cost savings will be deducted from operating subsidy otherwise payable. * * * * * PART 990_ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR OPERATING SUBSIDY 5. The authority for part 990 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437(g) and 3535(d). 6. In §990.107, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to read as follows: §990.107 Computation of utilities expense level. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) If a PHA takes action, such as wellhead purchase of natural gas, or administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings to reduce the rate it pays for utilities (including water, fuel oil, electricity, and gas), then the PHA will be permitted to retain one-half of the cost savings during the first 12 months attributable to its actions. Upon determination that the action was cost-effective in the first year, the PHA may be permitted to retain one-half the annual cost savings for an additional period not to exceed six years, if the actions continue to be cost-effective. See also paragraph (f) of this section and §990.110(c). * * * * * 7. In §990.108, the text of paragraph (b) is designated as paragraph (b)(1), and new paragraph (b)(2) is added, to read as follows: §990.108 Other costs. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) Units approved for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities are eligible for operating subsidy under the conditions provided in this paragraph (b)(2), and the costs attributable to them are to be included in the operating budget. If a unit satisfies the conditions stated in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (v) of this section, it will be eligible for subsidy at the rate of the AEL for the number of months the unit is devoted to such use. Approval will be given for a period of no more than three years. Renewal of the approval to allow payments after that period may be made only if the PHA can demonstrate that no other sources for paying the non-utility operating costs of the unit are available:
