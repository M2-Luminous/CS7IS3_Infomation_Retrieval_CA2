A peace treaty was signed a few minutes ago with the government following five months of negotiations. The ceremony for the signing of the peace process that involves 650 militiamen from three groups in this city is going on right now at El Granizal Playground of Medellin's Nororiental Commune. There are thousands of people at the playground. They are the guarantors that the peace process that begins today becomes a reality. The militiamen will turn over their weapons as soon as the government minister and the governor of Antioquia arrive. They will deliver 150 weapons and at the same time they will become part of a process in which they will work for the community. [Begin Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos recording] The national government has the commitment of contributing to the continuation of this process, to a permanent presence in the process, and to a continuous evaluation of the process to insure its continuation. [end recording] The process that concludes in Medellin today is the beginning of a new one which involves a dialogue with five other militia groups in Medellin. Early this morning, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] militants who chose not to participate in this process protested by carrying out terrorist activities in Medellin. Eight urban buses were set on fire in several parts of the city, causing losses amounting to 120 million pesos. The urban guerrillas have threatened transport owners and have paralyzed 20 percent of the transportation services to the downtown area. The situation returned to normal around 1000. The militiamen who did sign the agreement are optimistic. With the agreement, they secured not only guarantees that their lives will be respected but also committed the state to making social investments in the communes. During the past five months of direct conversations with the state, the 650 young Medellin militiamen promised to turn over their weapons in exchange for social investments. This is what they secured: [Begin reintegrated militia man Felipe recording] The creation of the Technological Institute, the [words indistinct], the creation of the Carpinelo Health Center. [end recording] In addition to this, the national government must create more health centers, a human rights office, and family offices, and it must improve education centers and control the creeks in the Nororiental Commune. During the next two years, the reintegrated militiamen will earn 150,000 pesos monthly, will receive loans for 3.5 million pesos for mini enterprises, will have a two-year insurance policy, and militiamen in prison will be pardoned. The church will employ 50 of them in church social work. [Begin Father Hector Fabio Henao recording] The militia's citizen security work, which includes providing security to some neighborhoods, has been acknowledged. They also won something else that is very important: They can become a political alternative and they also can be a tool for making social well-being and investments available to the communities, if they remain in the framework of democratic participation and if they are able to open communications channels with the communities, as is expected. [end recording] But the big and new reward of the militia agreement is that it definitely sets in motion the law that created the Cooperatives for Community Protection. The young militiamen will now use their weapons with the blessing of the state to protect their neighborhoods. The Adult Education Center of Santa Cruz Neighborhood will be the main headquarters of the Cooperatives for Community Protection. From this center, 300 young persons will patrol six zones of the Nororiental Commune. They will wear a uniform and carry a weapon. The people will continue calling them The Boys. Starting today, they will show their faces and everybody will know their names. [Begin cooperative Director Diego Restrepo recording] Our men are trained to handle any kind of weapon. Now that we have become legal, we have to behave in line with different guidelines and must have a change of attitude. We are going to work with a different strategy. [end recording] They have taken seven months of human relations and community work courses. They will take care of the streets of six neighborhoods of the Nororiental Commune, the same streets they used to protect when they were militiamen. [Begin commune leader Juan Sepulveda recording] The state has legalized the protection of these neighborhoods by creating a protection corps. These young people will be under the control of the Private Protection Superintendency. We are going to know how many young people there are, in what zones they work, what kind of weapons they have, and what kind of identification markings they and their vehicles have. [end recording] They will work together with the police. They will support each other. The community gave them a location to set up their headquarters. Some neighbors still have their doubts. [Begin Luiz Mila Taboada recording] Some people trust what they see and what the militia people will do, but other people just do not believe and are afraid. [end recording] This will be the country's largest protection cooperative. It will be supervised by the townspeople and The Boys trust. From now on, they will not have to scrawl the names of their dead on the walls of the neighborhoods.
