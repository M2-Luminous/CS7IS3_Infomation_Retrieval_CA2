The organization said the study will be made under a new action program to be adopted at a national congress scheduled for the fall. Zenchu is concerned that the views of farmers may be neglected in the process of political reforms, and it has become more important than ever to strengthen the unity of farmers and restructure the agricultural movement effectively, Zenchu officials said. The officials said the union was upset by the failure to prevent the opening of the rice market under the Uruguay Round of trade talks organized by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They said the union will seek to have the government review a new agricultural policy, including reorganization of the agricultural industry. The officials said the organization will try to prevent the ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement by the Diet. The Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance is the first among Japanese concerns on development of flash memory chips, although some Japanese firms have teamed up with foreign companies on flash memory chips. Hitachi and Mitsubishi did not disclose how much money they would spend on developing flash memory chips, but industry sources said the two companies are likely to spend at least 50 to 60 billion yen for a 64-megabit chip alone.
