During his talks with the Leningrad Military District commander, Colonel-General Sergey Seleznev, the two generals agreed that considerable progress has been made in military political relations between Germany and Russia, including new, mutual beneficial forms of partnership. Germany is, for example, assisting the North- Western Military District in building housing for Russian troops withdrawn from Germany. The Russian general spoke about his country's participation in the Partnership for Peace program, and stressed that cooperation between the two countries was of vital importance for stabilisation in Europe as a whole. Both generals agreed that it was necessary to look for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. The Bundeswehr general visited the city's historical and cultural landmarks, including museums and theatres, and the Piskarevskoye memorial cemetery where he put wreaths and flowers at the tombs of the victims of the Nazi blockade of Leningrad. Klaus Naumann will be leaving for Bonn later today.
