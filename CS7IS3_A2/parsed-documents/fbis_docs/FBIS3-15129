Boris Yeltsin only partly took advantage of this opportunity. This is what Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and deputy director of the Central Economic-Mathematics Institute, believes. The president's message to the Federal Assembly, he said in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, fairly fully reflects the range of questions which must be solved in order to extricate the country from the economic crisis, but it does not indicate how to do this. The scientist believes that the message does not reveal the mechanisms ensuring that inflation is curbed and the production slump is halted, and the method of implementing the idea of state regulation of a market economy is also unknown. The scientist was expecting greater clarity regarding tax questions. "In my opinion," he stressed, "our tax system is flawed. No less than two-thirds of all crisis factors are associated with it. All sociological polls show that the tax question is what worries both businessmen and ordinary workers most of all. If they escape with only minor changes in this matter, that means the noose around industry's neck will be pulled ever tighter. The present tax system must be changed radically. The tax problem is the same as the problem of the banking system's financial stabilization, and should be given utmost priority." A large part of the message, Lvov observed, is taken up by the question of combating inflation. But here too, in his opinion, there are many uncertainties and even contradictions between the position of the president and the government. The Ministry of the Economy, for example, plans to reduce inflation to 7-9 percent by the end of the year, while the president's message demands that it be cut to 5 percent. "I have formed the impression," the scientist says, "that the president's figure is an obsession and has no economic basis. There is a vast gulf between the government's and the president's figures which represents many trillions of rubles. False interpretations are impermissible here."
