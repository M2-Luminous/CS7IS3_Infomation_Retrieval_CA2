With the defense ministers of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan he will observe the course of the tactical exercise by the collective peacekeeping forces and Russian Border Troops in the Republic of Tajikistan. As we know, the main aim of the exercises is to improve the system of management of the collective peacekeeping forces and also to rehearse combat teamwork training and collaboration with the Russian Border Troops units. The first stage -- putting the units in a state of heightened combat readiness, advancing into the region of the exercises, and field fortification -- has been completed. As Colonel General Grigoriy Bessmertnyy, chief of staff of the collective peacekeeping forces, stressed in an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, all troops taking part in the exercise have taken up their positions and are prepared to research defense operations. It is planned later in conjunction with the border guards as the tactical training situation proceeds to switch from defensive operations to a counterattack -- to "restore the situation along the Republic of Tajikistan state border." Grigoriy Bessmertnyy stressed that the exercise which is being conducted is not connected with the complication of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and is a planned one. The joint command had given advance notification of the start of the exercise and had invited numerous observers, including through UN channels, and the ambassadors of Russia and the United States to the Republic of Tajikistan. He also denied rumors which had appeared in various mass media that the troops' actions could cause serious harm to the natural resources of the "Tigrovaya balka" state nature reserve. The collective peacekeeping forces chief of staff stated that the region of the exercise had been agreed in advance with the leadership of the Republic of Tajikistan and with environmental specialists. The rumors which have appeared are all the more unfounded in that the area where the exercise is being conducted is in the Northern regions of "Tigrovaya balka" and more than 15 km from the borders of the state nature reserve. Touching on the progress of the exercise, Colonel General Grigoriy Bessmertnyy noted that it had entered its most active stage 23 March. Our correspondent visited the Russian border guards on the eve of the study, and in particular the tragically famous 12th border post, which now bears the name of 25 heroes. According to Lieutenant Aleksandr Orlov, acting chief of the post, the situation here remains complex. On 20 March Tajik gunmen and mojahedin had yet again shelled the mobile observation point. The border guards put an end to the act of provocation with return mortar fire. There were no casualties among the border guards. Here, at the 12th border post, Russian servicemen of the 201st motorized rifle division are serving -- tank crews under the command of Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Nekrasov.
