So said Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belorussia [Belarus], in an interview with a RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent. "The rate of exchange for `hares' [popular term for Belarusian currency] and rubles has not yet been agreed," S. Bogdankevich said. "Belorussia would like it set at purchasing power parity for the Russian and Belorussian monetary units plus the market cross-rate for these currencies against the U.S. dollar. The ratio then would be 3:1. But according to the Russian `arithmetic mean' method, the rate would be seven `hares' to the ruble." S. Bogdankevich believes this option would be lethal for the Belorussian economy, because it would then be necessary to reduce real pay accordingly, so that the prime cost of products did not rise. Stanislav Bogdankevic continues to insist on the amendment of Article 5 of the treaty, whereby all Belorussian assets and liabilities are to be transferred to the Central Bank of Russia and the National Bank of Belorussia is to be abolished, becoming a branch of the Central Bank. The chief of the National Bank of Belorussia believes that questions of coordination of the issuing of money, the budget deficit, credit rates, and the rest can be decided on agreement between the two sovereign banks. At the same time, Stanislav Bogdankevich was positive about the agreement that had been reached on lifting customs barriers between the two countries. "As a result of this point," he said, "our states will now be spared lengthy talk about who owes whom more and they will bring their trade balances closer together." As the text of the document says, the treaty will come into force "on the date of the final notice by the contracting parties to one another of the implementation of the intrastate procedures necessary for its coming into force...." What this implies for Belorussia is approval of changes to the Belorussian Constitution by an extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet before the end of April. S. Bogdankevich's theory is that the requisite two-thirds parliamentary majority will not be obtained, so the question of unifying the monetary systems will be postponed until a referendum. At the same time, the chief of the National Bank of Belorussia believes that the treaty will not actually be implemented by Russia until the outcome of the presidential election in Belorussia is known. And even after the election certain treaty provisions may not come into force before next January. This applies, in particular, to the extension to Belorussia of Russian domestic prices of energy sources and basic types of products from Russian enterprises. Otherwise, Russian enterprises could find themselves on the verge of collapse.
