In 1993 Ukrainian nuclear power plants produced 75,238 million kilowatt/hours, which is 33 percent of the overall Ukrainian electricity output, he said. The electricity production amounted to 111 percent of the planned targets. In the words of Umanets, there were no accidents at nuclear power plants in 1993, although there were some malfunctions eleven of which were estimated as the first level and one -- second on the international nuclear accident scale. A radical factor for the development of Ukrainian nuclear power engineering is a resolution of the parliament to cancel moratorium on construction of new units of nuclear power plants and further operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, said the official. The resolution provides for the postponed termination of Chernobyl plant halt with due account of technical and radiation safety. A major problem of Ukrainian nuclear power engineering remains fuel, which Ukrainian nuclear power plants continue to receive from Russia. Ukrainian scientists and specialists have been instructed to create national fuel.
