They discussed Nigeria's border conflict with Cameroon, the Liberian peace process, and the devaluation of the CFA franc, and the economic and social consequences for the West African subregion. At a news conference after the talks, Babagana Kingibe said the desire of the Nigerian Government is to seek accommodation and reconciliation and to resolve the conflict with Cameroon through dialogue. He said as part of efforts to find a peaceful solution to the dispute, the two countries have been invited to Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday [16 March] by the OAU Conflict Resolution Committee. Babagana Kingibe said Nigeria will cooperate fully with the committee to see to a peaceful resolution of the dispute. On Liberia, he expressed confidence that things will go well with the peace process this time because indications are that all the factions are eager to see peace prevail in the country and will therefore adhere to the Cotonou accord. The deputy minister designate for foreign affairs, Dr. Mohamed ibn Chambas, said the role of France in the dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon is being viewed with concern by Ghana. He said the French, by their action, are meddling in the affairs of two sister African countries. They should, therefore, leave the problems to Africans to solve.
