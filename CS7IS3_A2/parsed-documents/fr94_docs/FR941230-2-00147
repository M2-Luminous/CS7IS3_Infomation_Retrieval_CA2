FR941230-2-00147 FR941230-2-00072 Juveniles in the Criminal Justice System Policymakers and legislators seeking data on how juveniles get to criminal court and on rates of conviction and sentencing, treatment, and conditions of confinement have found that existing information is often inadequate to help them make decisions about legislation, policy, and program development. OJJDP, in cooperation with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), proposes to identify and fill these data gaps by working collaboratively with interested State and local officials. Through OJJDP's Juvenile Justice Statistics and Systems Development Program, a series of meetings would be convened involving prosecutors, judges, corrections officials, State Statistical Analysis Centers, researchers, and staff from OJJDP, NIJ, and BJS. The purpose of the meetings would be to plan multijurisdictional studies of the transfer process and its outcomes. The project also would identify information needs to recommend for inclusion in the BJS National Survey of State Prosecutors. A number of multi-agency planning teams would be invited to assist in the collaborative design of the studies by identifying core data elements and definitions for cross-jurisdictional collection and analysis. The design process would be informed by a literature review and the identification of existing studies and data sets for secondary analysis to fill immediate gaps. A detailed review of the Government Accounting Office's pending waiver study would inform the project as to the feasibility of certain options. National Program Directory To further develop OJJDP's statistical capability, OJJDP proposes the creation of a National Program Directory. This directory would contain the names and addresses of specific juvenile justice programs along with important identifying information. The director would include prosecutors, juvenile probation departments, juvenile court judges, mental health agencies, youth welfare agencies, and other executive branch juvenile justice agencies. The directory would form the sampling frame for future OJJDP surveys. An important feature of this project would be a series of Quick Response Surveys (QRS). Each QRS would address a specific problem and be directed to a specific group of respondents. The goal of each QRS will be to provide vital information quickly on emerging problems and issues. QRS would be made possible through Census Bureau development of program and facility directories on juvenile courts, detention centers, and long-term State confinement facilities. These surveys would address such issues as: characteristics of assaultive behaviors, juveniles in police lock-ups, juvenile sex offenders, family issues, and overcrowding. The initial phase of this project would focus on developing a directory structure, collecting core information, and developing a QRS strategy. Integrated Juvenile Justice, Mental Health and Child Welfare Data Collection Recent research has documented the co-occurrence of delinquency, mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and child abuse and neglect. However, current data collection mechanisms do not permit linking client data from the juvenile justice system with data from the mental health and child welfare systems. Information is needed on how the child welfare and mental health systems function as diversion programs and as providers of alternative incarceration for problem youth not served by the juvenile justice system. Ways of linking these data collection systems would be explored in order to (1) understand the interrelationships of the three systems, (2) develop models that coordinate the actions of the three systems, and (3) integrate them into a continuum of care. OJJDP proposes to support a planning effort to map out steps toward integrated juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare data collection. OJJDP would carry this work out in collaboration with other Federal agencies that have an interest in the objectives of this program, including the National Institute of Mental Health; the Center for Mental Health Services; the National Institute on Drug Abuse; the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse; the Administration on Children, Youth and Families; and the Social Security Administration. This project would also involve practitioners and researchers from the mental health, juvenile justice, and child welfare fields. OJJDP's Statistics and Systems Development Program will provide staff support for this planning activity, including conducting a literature review, identifying useful data sets for secondary analysis, and convening planning meetings. The results will include recommendations for future implementation steps. OJJDP's current Statistics and Systems Development Program grantee, the National Center for Juvenile Justice, would conduct this program activity. No additional applications would be solicited in fiscal year 1995.
