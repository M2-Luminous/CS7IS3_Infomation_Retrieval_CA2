Here is what he told newsmen at the airport: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What is the significance of the visit to Estonia? [Walesa] I had to sort out matters in Europe. We have to take all opinions into account, because we are building democracy, after all, and on this road a revisit to Estonia was in order. I think that that country indeed has many possibilities, and it would be worth doing a bit of business with it. And I think that after my visit, some such business will be done. [Reporter] Is cooperation with the Baltic states the direction for Poland and the central-eastern European states? [Walesa] Well, it isn't the only direction, but it's nevertheless quite an important one. The Scandinavian route -- via the Baltics, as they call it -- the whole idea is a very good one, and I think Poland should join it as quickly as possible. [end recording]
