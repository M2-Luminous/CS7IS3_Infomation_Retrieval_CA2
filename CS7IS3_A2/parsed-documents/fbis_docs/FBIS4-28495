FBIS4-28495 "dreas112__a94030" FBIS-EAS-94-112-A Daily Report 28 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Falling Sales Force Mazda To Reorganize Falling Sales Force Mazda To Reorganize New Restructuring Plan Issued 942A0284B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 May 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0284B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Mazda revealed a new restructuring policy on 27 May. Considering that hiring of university graduates in the spring of 1995 and 1996 will in principle be zero, it will accelerate personnel reductions and condense fixed costs. Along with making a 30-percent reduction by gradually reorganizing existing vehicle classes with full model changes implemented in the future, Mazda will increase the ratio of shared parts with old models to over 50 percent, and proceed with large-scale cost reductions. Making these take root, it will turn to an ordinary surplus in fiscal 1995, and thereafter, it is prepared to aim at "a management constitution capable of paying dividends even with a 70-percent operation" (Vice President Makoto Miyaji). For the new-graduate hiring program, it had worked out zero university graduate hiring in the spring of 1995, but the policy is to continue this in the spring of 1996 also. In the plan to reduce employees from 30,000 to 27,000 in the three-year period from 1993 to 1995, no more than a total of 60 university graduate BA's and BS's were hired this spring. Zero hiring for two consecutive years is unusual, even in the auto industry. To decrease the cost of vehicles, it is promoting in the mid- to long-term 1) a 30-percent reorganization of existing car classes (26 classes), 2) 30-percent reduction in platforms (17 types) which are the basic frame of the vehicle, and 3) making the parts diversion from old models to new models over 50 percent. In particular, it will review existing methods from the vehicle planning stage and have drastic cost goals, with the idea to "aim at a profit improvement of 10 percent more than for existing cars." Regarding reorganization of sales channels, which has become an urgent task, it will maintain the present five-channel system, but improve earnings by reorganization of stores in important sales regions and expanding the "combined sales system" of selling the same car classes in several channels. Regarding their relationship with Ford Motor of the United States, it considers it "an important key supporting business in the mid- to long-term" and is studying joint development, reciprocal adaptability of parts, and joint enterprises overseas. Furthermore, in the short term, at the same time as proceeding with a move up in cost decreases such as VA (value analysis) and VE (value engineering) activities, it will hold the amount of facilities investment for the time being to under 50 billion yen a year. The policy also is to expand the reduction scale for the personnel reduction of 3,000 people in the plan by rationalization of plants. The goal is to have a constitution which can pay dividends even with 70-percent operation (production capability of 1.1 million cars per year) in the next three to four years.
