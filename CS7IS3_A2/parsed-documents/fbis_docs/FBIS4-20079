FBIS4-20079 "drweu080_p_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 GREECE * Pessimistic View of Relations With Albania * Pessimistic View of Relations With Albania 94P20685 94P20685 CSO [Editorial Report] In an article in the 16 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Pavlos Nathanail quotes an unidentified, "well-known" Albanian intellectual as saying that "the Greek minority [in Albania] is useful, because it includes progressive elements that contribute to the country's development." However, the intellectual is further quoted as saying that "the difficulty is that some of them are influenced by extremists in Athens." There are many moderate Albanians who espouse these views in private, Nathanail continues. At this time, the problem of Greek Albanians is beginning to be of concern to both Europe and the United States because it is one of the foci of crisis in the Balkans, as demonstrated by the recent border incident in which allegedly Greek masked gunmen raided an Albanian guard post. While the Greek Government stresses its wish to improve bilateral relations with Albania to improve the condition of ethnic Greeks, the existence of extremist elements in both countries can seriously undermine this effort at rapprochement, Nathanail comments. Regardless of their ideological stance, Albanian President Berisha and Prime Minister Mexi would like to solve the country's economic problems with the assistance of countries that do not have direct differences or common borders with Albania. Given the Albanians' traditional suspicion that Slavs and Greeks have territorial ambitions against them, they believe that such assistance must necessarily come from other large countries such as the United States first, followed by Turkey and Italy, even at the cost of certain disadvantages, Nathanail writes. As a result, he continues, Washington is expanding its penetration of Albania, as is Turkey, since two-thirds of the Albanian population are Muslims. Based on the above, it is impossible to be optimistic for the immediate future of Greek-Albanian relations, Nathanail writes, pointing out that according to experts from the Greek Center of International Studies, bilateral relations will worsen before entering a far-off period of relaxation when Albania realizes only Greece can save its economy. Until such time, he says, the Greek minority must survive to be able to play its historical role.
