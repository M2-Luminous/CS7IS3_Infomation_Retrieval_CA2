[passage omitted] Founded on the concept and the background of the "Ch'uan-Min Tien-T'ai" [All People's Radio Station] in the Taipei area, the development of the Voice of Southern Taiwan has been rather similar. In the same way, it has first locked onto taxi drivers and metropolitan factory workers as its listeners. The age distribution is concentrated at 20 to 35 years of age, and it seeks men as its principal market. Based on the reaction from the listener hotline in the more than two months since it began broadcasting, the Voice of Southern Taiwan has attracted the market goal that it originally locked on to, and has gradually taken the opportunity to expand to every level. So, the Voice of Southern Taiwan not only extended its five hours of programming to from seven o'clock in the morning to eleven o'clock, deep into the night, but established a broadcasting studio in Taipei and used the "hotline telephone" of the telephone and telegraph office for hosts in the south and the north to conduct simultaneous immediate on-site broadcasts and become a new non-main line voice suddenly appearing in the southern air. Because they have a shortage of funds, resources, and manpower, the program content first concentrates on innovation and defeating the opponent by surprise moves, like the use of the telephone hotline for simultaneous north-south conversations to overcome the drawback of the heavier concentration of political, economic, cultural, and social resources in the north of Taiwan than in the south. In the past it was necessary to spend time and money to invite famous people and famous spokesmen down. At the Taipei studio of the Voice of Southern Taiwan, they also can make immediate on-site broadcasts and at the smallest cost break the limitations of time and space and satisfy the southerners' need to probe regional subjects. And they select 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm to broadcast this "Southern Taiwan at Dusk" program, because this period is precisely the "golden opening" when the evening newspaper is already published, and the parliament and government are in recess, and the television news still has not appeared, cleverly standing out in a gap in the market. In addition, like what began on 28 February, the Voice of Southern Taiwan has especially made a special series that spans seven days, including lively historical data, oral stories, reports of commemorative activities in various places, scholars' expert commentary, and field survey reports. Particularly valuable was the first revelation of a diary of Uncle Wu Po-hsiung [0702 0130 7160] the year before he was murdered in the 28 February Incident. In it he recorded in great detail such sadnesses of the time as the descriptions of government officials, fluctuating prices, the sound of gunfire all around, and the anxiety in people's hearts. It was valuable "field historical data" of the 28 February Incident. When the announcer read that on 16 March 1947, the day the author was caught, it was "blank"---and later Aunt Wu Po-hsiung added the blood-stained words: "...he died and his body floated to the side of the river." Readers were choked up and listeners noses were stinging. [passage omitted] The Voice of Southern Taiwan has 200 watts of transmitting power (All People's Radio Station only has 100 watts), and is expected to expand its power to 400 watts before early March, and increase it to 800 watts in April. At that time, its transmitting range could extend to Chia-I, P'ing-tung, and the P'eng Hu offshore islands from the present greater Kaohsiung area, becoming the greatest electronic medium of the out-of-office forces. (The area has 5 million residents.) At the same time, the Voice of Southern Taiwan also has begun a "program exchange" with All People's Radio Station to expand its dissemination. Within the next few days, it will overcome equipment and technology problems by conducting southern and northern simulcasts. In the future, after the establishment of the Taichung station planned by Hung Chi-ch'ang [3163 1142 2490], northern, middle, and southern broadcasts will be formally joined and they will be moving toward the goals of a total island linkup and a local medium and truly put an end to the era of mainline monopoly of the electronic media. As the influence of the Voice of Southern Taiwan progressively increases, although such people as Huang Chao-hui [7806 2507 6540] and Ch'en Chu [7115 5468] are putting their support on the table, there are only four people who have put their whole heart and soul into it, and they all were formerly laymen--the station master, Kuo Chien-chih [6753 1696 2535]; the program designer, Lin Ti-chuan [2651 3336 1227]; and broadcast engineers Huang Po-ch'ao [7806 0590 6389] and Wu I-chao [0702 0310 0340]. Station master Kuo Chien-chih smiles and says that he studied economics and formerly ran his own factory and knows nothing about a radio station. With Huang Chao-hui "bravely giving orders" and driving them on, after more than two months preparation, they had a trial broadcast and immediately formally began broadcasting. Everyone is learning as he works. Now it is generally considered that they have achieved a little bit of grueling success and the greatest joy is receiving encouraging calls from listeners every day. He recalls when they first began at the end of last September, for fear of interference and obstruction, everything was done in secret. In particular, transmitting and broadcasting equipment was all first broken down outside the country and made into parts, and after being transshipped through two countries as hardware, it entered Taiwan. After that, technicians were engaged at a high price to come south from Taipei to reassemble them at a secret location, and they were transported to the station and hurriedly set up. Since broadcasting formally began last 10 December, station workers all have discovered that a number of faithful listeners follow the development and growth of program content, and in the short period of over two months, it has seen surprising results. Lin Ti-chuan, who studied politics and is program planner and hostess asks with total confidence, "Who would still dare to say that our station's listeners do not have standards?!" She brought up an example as explanation. When they first began broadcasting, because some of the criticism programs were misunderstood to "torture" the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), quite a few habitual listening "open platform political view club" DPP supporters one after the other called the station to protest, scolding by linking the Three-Character Classic and threatening wording. However, with the patient explanation of the programming people, one by one they demanded that "they themselves turn around and respect their weakness and maintain their poise." From observing recent on-site hotline dialogues, these formerly easily emotional listeners, because they themselves had been respected, had clearly begun to learn to use reasonable and democratic methods to participate and discuss. Lin Ti-chuan and Kuo Chien-chih both believe that this proves that it is only necessary to give people respect and they will have higher standards, and not blindly doubt and put them down. In the period that they began broadcasting, one of the things that was most gratifying to station personnel was to have a taxi driver affirm his support for the Voice of Southern Taiwan by especially sending a large cake to the station on 10 January, the day that they "completed a month" of broadcasting, at his own expense mimeograph advertising flyers for the station and distribute them everywhere, and send each of the hosts a card on Christmas day. He is considered a "deathly loyal and sworn" supporter. Once after a program was broadcast in which K'o Ch'i-hua [2688 2475 0553] personally described the situation at the time of the White Terror, several listeners immediately called in to the hotline with choking voices to encourage old Mr. K'o to persevere. The station workers were extremely moved. Since last year when broadcasting in the central area began to greatly increase and a share of listeners' two-way dialogues on the hotline have been directly broadcast live, the interactive relations between the broadcast media and listeners have become closer than ever. Lin Ti-chuan also believes that this is Taiwan's newest wave of revolutionary consciousness movements. Listeners' rights and voice have never been given so much importance and enhancement. Moreover, the effect of the broadcast hotline has been more absorbing than the effects of television and the flat medium.---Because the "reader reaction" pages in the press are less timely than the electronic media and the "viewer hotline" on television often appears to lack strength and be loosely organized and unnatural, because the picture is dull. [passage omitted] So, the Voice of Southern Taiwan like the All People's Radio Station, as distinguished from the mainline media accustomed to their own speech, expands "listener time" as much as possible in several of their programs. It concentrates its funds on assembling "collective line microphone systems" that other stations do not have and emphasizes strengthening dual or even three-way or multi-directional interaction of the station, listener, and balanced oversight objectives to act as the most effective "people's public instrument." Presently, the Voice of Southern Taiwan programming still is mainly political, topical, and local and daily life information, but as they attract manpower and resources and after they are legalized, their foundation will change to a company organization and seek a special and a higher station site, increase the injection of youth, news, and cultural programs, and increase the purchase of on-site relay vehicles to utilize important materials and select information for reporting. All of this is to gradually orient their efforts into the system. Although the initial period has been short, the Voice of Southern Taiwan already has moulded a few "famous voices": Like Lin Ti-chuan with the sharp diction; Su Jung-jui 5685 2837 3843 with the pleasant clear-toned voice and precise facts; and old Mr. Ou Ming-lang 2962 2494 2597, the eighty-year-old host of "Uncle Talks About Antiquity." They all have their regular listeners, and they often have listeners write letters to the station pouring out their aspirations. These are the intangible fruits of "righteous work."
