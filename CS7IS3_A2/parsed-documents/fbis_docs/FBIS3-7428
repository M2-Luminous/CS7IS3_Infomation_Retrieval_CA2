The committee will come under the framework of the Thai-Cambodian Joint Committee and will begin work at the same time as the demarcation work said a senior official. Sqn Ldr Prasong said after an hour-long meeting with his Cambodian counterpart, Prince Norodom Sirivut, that several committees would be set up to cooperate on such things as fisheries, investment, trade, and the exchange of technical personnel and senior officials. "We're now ready to sit down and create a legal framework. We don't know the procedure but we'd like to solve problems in a peaceful way through joint development cooperation, not to use confrontation," said Prince Sirivut. He said problems, including the Koh Kong incident and the refugee problem, between the two countries would be solved at a state-to-state level through the committees which would be established as soon as possible. "We don't think the Koh Kong incident is a real-estate affair. We don't want local authorities to jeopardise our good relations." Prince Sirivut said there was a lot of contradictory information and it was not appropriate to comment on this until both sides had held a common investigation. "Situations can change. I hope his excellency (Prasong) will meet me again. We'll wait for the result." The Thai government yesterday handed over 35 pieces of equipment used in vocation training involving machinery, electrical goods, electronics and steel-linkage, worth a combined 627,060 baht. Both foreign ministers witnessed the initial endorsement of a cooperation agreement between their Boards of Investment [BoI]. The agreement was signed by BoI Secretary-General Sathaphon Kawitanon and Vichit It. The agreement, to take effect in two years, will stress training activities, the exchange of information and investment promotion which will lead to more serious deals between the two countries, according to a BoI press statement. The initial agreement will be proposed for further approval by the two governments, it said.
