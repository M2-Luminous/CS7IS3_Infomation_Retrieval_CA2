Some cameras, which have been monitoring North Korea's nuclear facilities and material, are no longer running, he said. It is becoming more difficult for the IAEA to confirm that North Korea is not diverting declared material from peaceful purposes, Blix told the board. It has become impossible for the IAEA to have meaningful assurance that North Korea is using its nuclear material and facilities for peaceful purposes, he said. If North Korea does not cooperate with the IAEA, he warned, the inspection continuity of the nuclear safeguards might deteriorate to a state from where it cannot be restored. The IAEA must visit and inspect nuclear material and facilities in North Korea to determine if North Korea has diverted declared material from peaceful purposes. North Korea has not allowed the IAEA to do normal inspection activities at its nuclear facilities since February and the situation is worsening as time goes by, he said. He said that the IAEA is ready for dialogue and consultation with Pyongyang and to send an inspection mission anytime North Korea is ready to accept it to carry out its work for full-fledged implementation of nuclear safeguards, including access to additional information and visits to additional places.
