Public opinion held that the three issues mentioned above have been unresolved problems for years in the United States, as well as old problems which Clinton had wished to solve but has not yet solved. For a long period of time medical and health expense in the United States has been increasing year after year, so has the number of those not covered by medical insurance. In fiscal 1993, the nation's expense in this area exceeded $900 billion, which accounted for 14.6 percent of the GDP, up from 9.6 percent in 1981. Last September, Clinton proposed a reform plan to Congress, suggesting insurance for the whole people with costs to be shared by the state, enterprises, and individuals. Since announcement of the plan, most people have expressed support for its general goal, but responded differently to the concrete measures. Some medical and health insurance companies and some pharmaceutical factories are not happy with the possible loss of income due to the reform; small enterprises which in the past seldom or never provided insurance for their employees, have expressed grievances against the government's demand that they provide their employees with a large portion of insurance premium. In Congress, the Republicans argued that the plan allows too much government intervention, involves too much money, and leads to a tax increase. Among the Democrats there are also those who are opposed to the plan, and they say the plan makes small enterprises pay a lot of expense to the extent of affecting employment. Clinton pointed out in his State of the Union address that no matter what kind of plan, it has to guarantee insurance for the whole people, otherwise, he will exercise a presidential veto on the adopted bill. Clinton's intention in reforming the current social welfare system is: Lightening the load of government and changing the burden into a motive force. According to the current social welfare system in the United States, apart from providing low-income families with medical subsides and the aged and disabled with medical care, the government also has to provide $350-400 of relief money to the poor families which have juvenile children, as well as food coupons of $70 to each of the destitute every month. At present, some 5 million families in the country are claiming relief money, and about 27 million people are receiving food coupons. These two "contingents" are still growing in strength, the government's expense has increased year after year, and currently the annual expense on relief money and food coupons has reached $45 billion. Clinton thinks that this growing burden not only affects the effort to cut the deficit, but is also harmful to economic development. Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that in the spring of this year, he will submit to Congress an overall plan of reform of the social welfare system. According to information, the plan mainly includes: Poor people who have ability to work will only be provided with relief money for two years; free training will be provided to those who have no job skills or have low educational attainment; baby sitting allowances will be provided to the women who have young children; the government will allocate funds to open service industries, to provide job opportunities to the above-mentioned people; and efforts will be made to encourage private enterprises to arrange jobs for the above-mentioned people. The plan will enable 1.5 million to 2 million adults (mostly single mothers who have juvenile children) to eventually part with government relief. Most people think that Clinton's move is in the right direction, but they are skeptical about a swift solution of this difficult problem which has existed for years. Crime, especially violent crime, is an old problem causing the most terrible headache for those within and outside the government in the United States. From 1980 to 1992, the number of violent crimes in the United States increased 27 percent, and the number of those serving their terms in prisons increased 180 percent. Last year, various kinds of violent incidents became more frequent, and murders and kidnappings became numerous. Clinton stressed repeatedly that the economic losses caused by crime in the United States reached $425 billion a year, in particular, crime increased medical expenses. Last year, the Clinton administration was able to urge Congress to pass the "Brady bill on control of firearms," and to allocate $50 million to boost police strength in some parts of the country. But in the face of violent crime, these two measures are obviously ineffective. Therefore, he once again stressed in his State of the Union address that it is necessary to pass more, tougher anticrime measures. He asked Congress to pass a bill which will make criminals have no guns in their hands, send those who commit serious crimes three times to life imprisonment, build more prisons, harshly punish drug-related crimes, and increase the police by 100,000 men. Public opinion holds that for Clinton to achieve the above-mentioned goals, he will meet a great many difficulties. For example, regarding the problem of gun control, so long as selling and buying guns are not banned nationwide, it will be very difficult to ensure that criminals have no guns in their hands. In addition, "it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep," when the root cause of crime in the society is not removed, the measures to control crime are only tackling the symptoms but not the root cause. President Clinton has proposed these new measures to deal with those old problems in the beginning of a new year. What will be the result? People are waiting to see.
