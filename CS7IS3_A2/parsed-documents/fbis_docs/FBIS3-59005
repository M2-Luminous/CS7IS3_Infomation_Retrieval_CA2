This evokes pictures of a horse-drawn carriage, curtains drawn, that takes Mary from the ballet to the crown prince's chambers. Good for tourism, bad for the republic. Seriously: The image of a scandal-ridden operetta-like Austria, unable to govern itself properly, suits the plans of certain political groups very well. The Vienna correspondent of the nationalist conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE has been writing for years that only the German nationalist Joerg Haider can "renew" the country. Haider's Pan-Germanic guru Andreas Moelzer justifies his anschluss fantasies with the argument that Austria "is unable to survive without outside help." A "pink scandal in the presidential office" perfectly suits the plans of a change to the "Third Republic."
