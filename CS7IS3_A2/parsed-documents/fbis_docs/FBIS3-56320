This was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov in an interview with INTERFAX. He noted that the Russian troops stationed in Latvia and put on high alert following the incident did not leave their base area and did not undertake any aggressive actions. According to Sergey Krylov, this gross and unprecedented action was possibly aimed to provoke Russia into taking retaliatory measures. It is regrettable that it took place at the time of the Russian-Latvian talks in Riga, when progress had just emerged on the key aspects of the issue of Russian troop pullout. The diplomat stressed that Russia is not intent on tough confrontation and is not interested in seeing the talks disrupted. He also noted that the incident in Riga coincided with the NATO summit in Brussels. "It is not ruled out that Russia's sharp retaliatory moves could have become a weighty argument for Latvia in favor of the earliest possible accession to the North Atlantic alliance." The deputy minister suggested that this was precisely the design by the action's organizers.
