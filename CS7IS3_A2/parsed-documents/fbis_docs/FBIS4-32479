During the conversation, which was held in a friendly atmosphere, Meksi thanked Van der Stoel for his continuous commitment to Albania and for the objective reports he has presented. Meksi went on to brief the CSCE official on the situation of the Greek minority, the advanced standards of freedoms and rights guaranteed to them, and the activity of state institutions, which aim for continual perfection. He particularly informed Van der Stoel about the equal treatment granted to minority members in all fields and commented on the special measures that the government has taken to develop their identity in the fields of education, culture, religion, and others. Dwelling on the problem of minorities in a broader framework, Meksi stressed that, in our endeavors, we often run across problems that arise due to the illegal and anticonstitutional activity of certain minority people instigated by Greek ultranationalist circles. Meksi stressed the importance of Tirana-Athens bilateral relations for the climate in the Balkans and the political atmosphere in our region. We are for maintaining friendly relations with Greece, but always by respecting the fundamental principles of international relations and the reciprocal interests of other countries. The CSCE high commissioner assessed positively Albania's readiness to receive him and create the necessary conditions for his mission. After each visit, he stressed, I see positive changes in the Greek minority's position. The most positive feature is the harmonic, interethnic coexistence between the Albanians and the Greeks, and that is why I value your policy for preserving and further consolidating it. Meksi and Van der Stoel then viewed special aspects of the minority's position in the fields of education, exercise of religion, etc. The situation in the region and Albanian-Greek bilateral relations were other topics on which they exchanged opinions.
