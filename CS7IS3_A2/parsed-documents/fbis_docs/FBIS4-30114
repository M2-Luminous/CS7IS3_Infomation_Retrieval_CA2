Kakizawa and Kantor agreed to hold a working-group meeting on the framework talks in the middle of next week in Washington, the officials said. The cancellation was decided because the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion earlier in the day to the House of Representatives against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, they said.
