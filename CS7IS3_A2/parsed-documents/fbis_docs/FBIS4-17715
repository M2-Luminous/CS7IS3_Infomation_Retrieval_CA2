The Afghan Foreign Ministry's head is also to visit Tashkent on Wednesday [27 April]. The situation on the Afghan-Tajik border causes serious concern to the Kirgizia [Kyrgystan] because its troops are among the CIS peacekeeping forces guarding the border. Secondly, drugs and arms are illegally transported from Gorno Badakhshan in Tajikistan to Kirgizia. Besides, residents of Kirgizia's southern regions are concerned over rumours about opposition spring offensive on Badakhshan located not far from Kirgizia and home for a lot of ethnic Kirgizians. Officials from Kirgiz security services state that the rumours about a forthcoming conflict in neighbouring Tajikistan do not correspond to reality. President Askar Akayev calls on the warring sides to begin negotiations. Nevertheless Kirgizia is concerned over every little change in the situation in Gorno Badakhshan.
