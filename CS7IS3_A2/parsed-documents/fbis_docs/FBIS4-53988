As an example of the effectiveness of Indonesian diplomacy, he pointed to the cancellation of attendance of the French and Portuguese first ladies who were originally scheduled to deliver a keynote address at APCET in Manila, May 30-June 2. "With the cancellation of the attendance of the two first ladies, we have won 60 percent," said Da Cruz, who has just arrived back from West Europe where he joined a religious occasion. Furthermore, with Philippine President Fidel Ramos banning foreign participants from taking part in the conference, Indonesia has achieved a 90-percent victory against its adversaries, namely those who were against the integration of East Timor into the Indonesian territory. "Let us consider the remaining 10 percent is a `present' to them," he said with a broad laugh. Lopes Da Cruz, who knew a lot about Ramos Horta, the chief adversary against the integration, said further that actually all the international activities with regard to East Timor were merely Horta's means of collecting money. "He has nothing to do, and it is only from the seminars on East Timor which he made a project that he could survive," he said. Da Cruz also said that Ramos Horta was very shrewd. He now turned to Asia for his East Timor seminars after failing to turn the issue of East Timor into an international topic in Europe. Da Cruz concluded that now Indonesia has the upper hand in dealing with APCET.
