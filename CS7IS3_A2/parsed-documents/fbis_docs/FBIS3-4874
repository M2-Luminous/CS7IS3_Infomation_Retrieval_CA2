Contrary to the U.S. expectations that Japan would eventually back down, the summit meeting 10 days ago ended in failure -- the first occurrence in the history of such meetings between Japan and the United States. But according to several Japanese Government officials who participated in the negotiations, at least where the areas of medical technology, telecommunications, and insurance were concerned, they were supposed to be "close to reaching agreements." The breakdown of the talks was due to misunderstandings by both Japan and the United States on a "phantom compromise proposal" suggested by the United States. Acceptable Plan On the afternoon of 8 February, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who was exasperated by the stubborn resistance of Japanese bureaucrats, announced a unilateral suspension of negotiations, saying: "No progress can be expected through further talks among the bureaucrats. We will wait for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who leads the negotiations, to arrive in the United States." The following evening, on 9 February, when Koichiro Matsuura, deputy-vice minister for foreign affairs, was about to leave the conference room after a day of talks, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the President, stopped him, and asked, "Does Japan want to finalize these consultations?" "Of course," Matsuura responded. Saying "If that is the case," Cutter orally informed Matsuura of a U.S. compromise proposal. His words were: "Let us finalize the talks on macroeconomic issues and government procurement and insurance sectors without including numerical targets, and then round up the talks on the automobiles and auto parts within one month after the summit meeting is held." Matsuura believed the compromise proposal had the final approval of the U.S. Government, and thought, "that should be acceptable." Subsequently, he notified Zosaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice-minister of international trade and industry, and Kosuke Nakahira, deputy vice-minister for financial affairs, that "the United States has backed down." For a moment, however, a puzzling thought entered Okamatsu's mind -- this position seemed so different from the rigid stance taken by the USTR. Clash in the Second Meeting The first meeting of Hata and Kantor opened at 0730 on 10 February. Kantor said: "Let us aim for the goal of reaching agreements." To this, Hata, who had been apprised of the Matsuura-Cutter meeting, responded, "I understand what you mean. (These things can be taken care of at the working-level talks.) That is about it, right?" Therein occurred a misunderstanding. Kantor interpreted Hata's response as a concession by Japan. But what Hata really meant was to aim for the goal of reaching agreements by allowing working-level officials to resume their talks. He proposed reopening working-level talks, and Kantor accepted. This meeting [between Hata and Kantor] was attended by Matsuura and Cutter as well. But Matsuura could not at all detect in Kantor's remarks any sign that the United States was making concessions, as suggested by Cutter's proposal. The harried Matsuura contacted Deputy USTR Charlene Barshevsky, but her reply was heartless: "the USTR's position has not changed." In a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) on the morning of 10 February, Kantor reported that there was a feeling that "Japan is backing down." President Clinton instructed him "to proceed with the negotiations according to the policy of the past." Later that afternoon, Matsuura, Okamatsu, and Nakahira resumed vice-ministerial-level talks in their respective fields. The compromise proposal received the day before was still in the back of their minds. But the atmosphere of the meetings was unusual. The United States once again came out pushing for numerical targets. At 1600 on 10 February, a second meeting between Hata and Kantor began. Hata charged: "Discussions are on a completely different track from our meeting this morning. Why has wrong information been provided at the beginning of the vice-ministerial-level talks?" Kantor glared back at him, saying, "When I said we should aim for the goal of reaching agreements, did you not say `I understand'?" Hata did not yield, retorting, "I did not say anything to the effect you imply." Hata had an appointment with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen at 1700, but Kantor phoned the latter to have the appointment cancelled. According to Kantor, "such a meeting was not needed." Fierce arguments [between Hata and Kantor] went on for more than two hours. The United States did not bend from its rigid stance. The Hata-Bentsen meeting eventually started at 1900, with Bentsen assailing Japan's overall economic measures. He insisted that the joint statement issued by the summit should include an expression saying "macroeconomic measures [taken by Japan] are inadequate." Hata rejected this, saying, "If that happens, the cabinet will collapse." It was decided that no joint statement would be issued. `I Am Tough, But...' A third meeting between Hata and Kantor was held at 0100 on 11 February. Hata spoke to reporters hopefully, saying, "I do not see why we cannot reach a compromise," but Kantor remained stiff. This did not mean that Hata thought there were chances for a compromise. After the meeting, Kantor consoled Hata, saying, "I am tough, but I cannot beat you." But overnight talks did not bear fruit, and the failure of the economic consultations became a certainty. "The 10th [of February] was really a devil-haunted day. We do not know who crushed the phantom compromise proposal. Maybe the dovish group has been overridden by the hawkish group." This was stated by a member of the Japanese negotiating team. The best guess is that during the half day which elapsed from the time Cutter offered the compromise proposal to the time the Hata-Kantor conference began, there was a power struggle within the U.S. Administration between Cutter and Kantor, with Clinton choosing Kantor's approach.
