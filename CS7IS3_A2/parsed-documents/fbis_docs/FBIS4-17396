After completing his three-day visit to Turkmenistan, the Chinese governmental head left for Bishkek where he will have talks with Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev on Saturday [23 April]. Although during the visit no agreement was concluded on the "project of the century" -- the installation with Chinese participation of a super gas pipe to connect wells in the Karakum deserts to gas rings on the islands of Japan -- the parties agreed to "continue to study seriously" the project. A protocol on intentions was signed between Turkmenistan's Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Chinese national oil corporation that envisages the creation of a Sino-Turkmen-Japanese commission of experts. In the opinion of experts, Turkmenistan may boost its yearly gas extraction to 230 billion cubic meters in the next 15 years. A press communique on the visit's results distributed by the Chinese delegation notes both countries' intention to build long- term, stable relations on the basis of principles of world coexistence emphasized at the talks. The Chinese Government voiced support for Turkmenistan's efforts to defend state independence and sovereignty and to stabilize the situation in the country and region. Direct links between the partners in the trading and economic sphere would be encouraged. There was a "positive attitude" to opening direct air links between China and Turkmenistan. An agreement on granting Turkmenistan a Chinese loan and a protocol on regular consultations between the two countries' foreign ministries were signed in the presidential palace today. The Chinese Government will also grant material and technical assistance free of charge. Both the contents of the latter and the value of the loan are unknown. Li Peng, who has already been to Uzbekistan, will also visit Kazakhstan and Mongolia in the course of his present 12-day trip.
