Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Churkin expressed regret that the sides could not reach an agreement on cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the front line due to objective reasons. At the same time, he said that the meeting has confirmed the existence of an entirely new "format of mediatory activity." Russian, U.S., EU and UN mediators who took part in the talks acted jointly. This allowed them to influence the sides' behaviour in a constructive way and help the sides find common positions at the most critical stages of the negotiation process. The Zagreb talks have confirmed the correctness of the chosen priorities in reaching a final settlement of the Yugoslav conflict. Mediators believe that ceasefire agreements are a top priority. The next step would be normalisation of economic ties between Croatia and "districts with the capital in Knin." This will create favourable conditions for determining the political status of these districts, he said. Disagreements in relations between Zagreb and the "Serb capital in Knin" are fraught with a situation in which "any prospects of settlement in the former Yugoslavia will be buried," the diplomat said. He said the mediators will use the remaining time before the next round of talks scheduled for 29 March to try to bring the warring sides to the realisation of the need to find constructive approaches, he said.
