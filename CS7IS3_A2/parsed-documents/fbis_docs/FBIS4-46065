Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to separate the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later inspection have not been confirmed, sources said. The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added. The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other way, they said. "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the reactor are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks," one source said. Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude. Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.
