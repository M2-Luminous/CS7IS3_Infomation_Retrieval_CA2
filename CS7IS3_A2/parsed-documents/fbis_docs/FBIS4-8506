[Nekvasil] Currently, there are 34 graduates of former Soviet universities, and, of these, 14 are graduates of the General Staff Academy of the former USSR. Some of them are graduates of two schools. At present, we are not sending our experts to Russian schools. Nineteen people have graduated from foreign military academies (in the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Poland). Twenty are still studying there. The difference is that formerly people who had some languages were sent to schools abroad, while now we are organizing courses for people in whom we are interested. They are people who have the ability to command and the moral qualities to be useful in the Army.
