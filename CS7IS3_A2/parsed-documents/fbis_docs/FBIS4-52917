FBIS4-52917 "dreas094_d_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 South Korea Sources Report Russia Bans Barter Trade With DPRK Sources Report Russia Bans Barter Trade With DPRK SK1405021494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0121 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405021494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 13 (YONHAP) -- Adding to its worries of extreme food shortages, North Korea is reportedly having trouble importing and exporting industrial goods since Russia banned barter trade with the communist country early last month. To make up for their loss in Russia, North Korean trading companies run by the defense and public security ministries are scurrying about Beijing seeking partners from Japan and Southeast Asia as well as South Korea, trading sources based here said Friday. Moscow banned barter trade with North Korea on April 1 and raised import tariffs more than 30 percent, in effect blocking trade with the Stalinist country, a Russian trader said. The action was designed to protect Russian companies from incurring damages due to slow payment and delays in dealing with North Korean smugglers, he said. Many North Korean companies, too, are said to have been cheated by bogus Russian traders, another source said. For example, a North Korean trading firm lost 3 million U.S. dollars while trying to import a truck from Russia last year. The trade friction between North Korea and Russia is reflected in Pyongyang's efforts to diversify its trading sources, South Korean traders here observed. North Korean traders belonging to defense or security agencies have approached South Korean companies in Beijing, they said. A trader here said North Koreans were proposing to trade almost anything -- from fisheries to antiques -- these days.
