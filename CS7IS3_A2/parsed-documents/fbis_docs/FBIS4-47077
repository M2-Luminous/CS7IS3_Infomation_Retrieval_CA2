Is it not too early? It seems that it is not. Not much time is left before the date--autumn 1996--that is cherished by some political leaders. But in the struggle for power, as is well known, the one who begins to prepare the sleigh well ahead of time wins more often. The confrontation in the upper echelons of power is also coming out in the open. The campaign is already developing in earnest. All of the groups that are involved in this process are actively preparing reliable springboards for their candidates. The arrangement of forces is being publicly counted, and the newspapers indicate with an accuracy of up to one-hundredth of a percent the representation in the government of natives of one or another region. Every slight shortcoming of a potential candidate for the first post in the republic is recorded and filed in a dossier. Without a doubt, the assembled compromising material will be reported to the voters at the necessary time. So who could end up on the voter's ballot within two years? Besides Feliks Kulov, the former vice president (this candidacy has already been examined in previous issues of NYG [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA], there are three real aspirants: Askar Akayev, the current head of state (despite the statement that he does not intend to take part in the new political show); Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Medetkan Sherimkulov; and Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov. These three are well known to the people, and each of them has his strong and weak points, and pluses and minuses. Carte Blanche of the Communists The most real political force in Kyrgyzstan today is the party of the Communists. To all appearances, it is counting on M. Sherimkulov, speaker of the parliament. Dzh. Amanbayev, the former leader of the Communists and the present deputy prime minister, in fact, crossed himself off the list of aspirants to "father of the nation" with his own hand. The deputy prime minister, while on a working trip to the south of the republic, allowed himself a whole number of rather imprudent statements. Speaking to the aktiv of two agricultural oblasts, in the past an ardent supporter of the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system, he suddenly declared publicly that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes are a "thing of the past." The state, he said, is not in a condition to finance unprofitable production. Of course, they can exist in the event that they do not request money from the authorities for subsistence. And he noted in passing that the government allocated a total of 150 million soms for spring field work. This, he said, is all that it is possible to do in the given situation. The Communists will hardly forgive their former leader for betraying the general party line. It is still fresh in people's minds how the willful Communist Dzh. Amanbayev did not let an occasion pass to goad the president for badgering the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and he was one of A. Akayev's most serious opponents. But a lot speaks in favor of M. Sherimkulov. First, which is quite important, he is the only representative of the party elite in the higher echelons of power. (In the former regime, Sherimkulov occupied the post of secretary of the Central Committee of the KPK [Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan] for ideology. Second, which is no less important, he is an intelligent, subtle, and very experienced politician. While holding the position of speaker of parliament, Sherimkulov collected a lot of points, skillfully analyzing all of the stratagems of eastern politics. During this time, the speaker worked on foreign policy as well as on domestic policy. He proved himself to be a peacemaker in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. M. Sherimkulov is a very strong trump card for the Communist Party. If the Communists will unanimously and to the last come out for the speaker, they will acquire a good opportunity to enter the White House on the shoulders of the head of parliament and thereby return to grand policy. And with respect to everything else, the speaker in his position is in a more winning situation than his two nearest rivals: because he is associated far less than A. Akayev and A. Dzhumagulov with the republic's economic problems, and all of the troubles and problems of the population will be attributed to the account of the latter two. Will the Prime Minister Sit in the President's Chair? Abbas Dzhumagulov, the former perennial second in the communist system and present prime minister, having tasted freedom, is beginning to conduct himself in this eminent company in a more and more relaxed manner. He understands perfectly well that there will be no break in the economy for the next three to four years. Unemployment is increasing. Seventy large enterprises have been stopped, and of these, four are grandees of the defense industry, where, incidentally, mainly highly qualified Russian specialists work. Deprived of earnings, they will leave Kyrgyzstan. In order to stop the specialists, it will be necessary to put the dying plants into operation. But the republic does not have the resources for this. And Russia has declared openly that it can keep only 30 percent of Kyrgyz defense industry occupied. The situation in the economy of the republic shocked specialists of the IMF. Money that is earmarked for production disappears in the sand. The government is not in a condition to retrieve it, inasmuch as only altruistic businessmen make tax payments to the treasury. The rest either hide their incomes or procrastinate as long as possible. But many, after receiving credits, disappear in unknown directions. The prime minister, naturally, could not agree to the demands of the IMF to freeze wages fully. He promised that excise taxes on a whole series of commodities would be introduced. The state once again will become a monopolist in the production of vodka. The sale of alcohol will be prohibited. In the near future, the output of commodities will be prohibited that do not meet quality standards. A. Dzhumagulov intends to make essential consumer goods accessible in price and to make it up in volume. The intentions are good, but they are not new. There is no doubt that the Kyrgyz homegrown "marketeers" will find a way out of this situation and a method for duping the state. And the Kyrgyzstan Government will once again slip out behind the flags that the IMF sets up. It is quite possible that right after the minister of finance, several other members of the cabinet and rayon managers will "disappear." Life will make it also necessary, probably, to reduce the number of oblasts and rayons and to eliminate them entirely in the future. The prime minister will certainly come out with a new administrative structure at the next session. He has no other way out. Otherwise, the prime minister is deprived of all prospects for the future, and he will be compelled always to remain in secondary roles, carrying out the instructions of more resolute politicians. Today the First, but Tomorrow.... President Akayev has a no less, if not a more, difficult situation. His team is composed of the second echelon of the Communist nomenklatura. There is not one representative of the party generals next to him. The trump ace of the president is foreign policy. He was able to place himself in the rank of CIS leaders whose opinion is heeded. But today, it is necessary for A. Akayev to score in the republic also. Seeing that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes are not making a go, A. Akayev is counting on the farmers. In the future, the association of farmers could become a powerful political force and constitute a serious competitor to the Communists. The president will have to "grapple" with the prime minister very soon. If the government, in unison with the parliament, tries to subordinate the National Bank under it, the president will be deprived of a lot. The "golden" question will once again become the urgent argument in the hands of the opposition. In the next few days, one more project will come into doubt that is being concluded by the government with the support of the president--a contract for the development of the very large Kumtor gold field. In the president's opinion, the break with Kameko [name as transliterated]--a Canadian firm--promises the republic a lot of unpleasantness. In addition to the fact that it will be necessary to pay a huge penalty to the firm, Kyrgyzstan's authority will be fundamentally tarnished. Information concerning the fact that the firm is already investing resources in the uranium production of a neighboring republic sounded like an alarm bell for the defenders of the Kameko project. However, Kameko is associated with Seabeco. And everyone knows this. Among the opponents of the president, political considerations will dominate over common sense. Personnel policy will also seriously let A. Akayev down. In the opinion of many, the staffs of the president and the government are insufficiently professional, not to mention the managers in the localities. In the opinion of Professor N. Eshmambetov, an assistant to A. Akayev for economics, the intellectual level of the staff leaves a lot to be desired. These are the starting positions in which the real aspirants to the second successive post of president of Kyrgyzstan find themselves. Of course, many are disturbed by the fact that the current president, speaker, and prime minister are natives of the Chuiskiy Valley. But it is easy to correct this reality. In the event of a victory of one of them, the three branches of power--presidential, legislative, and executive--simply will be divided among the three largest regions of the republic--Chuiskiy--Talasskiy, Issyk-Kulsko--Narynskiy, and Osha--Dzhalal-Abadskiy. It is impossible today to say unequivocally who will become the next head of state. But fortune will smile on the one of them who uses the remaining period to maximum advantage for himself.
