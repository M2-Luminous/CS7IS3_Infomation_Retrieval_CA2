The UN Protection Force stepped up its presence in the city, while spokesman Colonel Richard Pernod said the UN troops had been ordered to riposte if attacked. Bosnia's Serbs on Thursday rejected the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's ultimatum to end their siege of Sarajevo or face air strikes, and said their heavy weapons would not be removed from around the city. "Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready to retaliate." And in what appeared to be an early Serb reaction to the NATO deadline, Toholj confirmed the Serbs were preventing UN refugee workers from following UN orders and leaving Serb-controlled zones. "This decision was taken on the orders of the deputy commander-in-chief of the Serb army," General Milan Gvero, he said. However, the UNHCR denied its staff were being held hostage. "We are having problems at the checkpoints but they are not hostages," said spokesman Kris Janowski here. The aid agency Wednesday [9 February] recalled to Zagreb or Belgrade two thirds of its staff stationed in Serb-held areas of Bosnia. "The reason for this recall is next week's visit here of the High Commissioner and overall tense situation," he said. Toholj described Wednesday's threat by NATO to hit Serb positions with air strikes if the artillery is not pulled back within 10 days as "a terrorist threat," adding that the Serbs would respond "by all means" to any attack.
