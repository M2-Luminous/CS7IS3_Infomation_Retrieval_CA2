In a commentary in its Tuesday edition, the paper says that many observers think that this decision is not prompted by a desire to return to what is right nor does it mean that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has repented. The decision has another purpose. It shows the failure of the Iraqi regime's repeated attempts to end the UN sanctions that have been in effect since the crime of the invasion of Kuwait. It also reflects the Iraqi regime's desire to bring about the release of its frozen assets in some world countries and resume the exportation of Iraqi oil. AL-AKHBAR concludes by saying that irrespective of the Baghdad regime's intentions in making this surprise announcement regarding its attitude to Kuwait, the departure of Saddam Husayn remains the basic condition for the resumption of normal relations with Iraq by the majority of the Arab world.
