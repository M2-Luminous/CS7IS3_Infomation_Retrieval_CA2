FR940913-0-00033 FR940913-0-00009 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. For swashplate support assemblies that have 1,500 hours or more total TIS, this AD requires an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying glass within 25 hours TIS. Also, for swashplate support assemblies with less than 1,500 hours total TIS, this AD requires an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying glass prior to attaining 1,525 hours total TIS. Thereafter, repetitive inspections of the affected swashplate support assemblies are required at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. If a crack is suspected, a dye penetrant inspection is required. Replacement of cracked swashplate support assemblies with airworthy swashplate support assemblies is required. Installation of an airworthy swashplate support assembly, P/N 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;113, constitutes a terminating action for the requirements of this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. Due to the criticalness of the swashplate support assembly and the short compliance times, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;22&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
