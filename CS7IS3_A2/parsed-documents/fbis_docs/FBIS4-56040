"By conditioning the venue for the negotiations, Croatia is trying to impose a political approach which does not comply either with the principles which we have advocated, or with the building up of mutual confidence founded on interest," Babic said on Wednesday, after an R.S.K. government session. He expressed regret that the deputy co-chairmen of the conference on former Yugoslavia had not yet found a compromise solution for overcoming this problem, but were holding out solely for proposals by the Croatian side. The key to the final resolving of relations with Croatia is in the recognition of the R.S.K. by the international community and in the signing of a peace accord with Croatia on that basis, Babic said.
