Lawrason D. Thomas, who is attending the China Petroleum Investment Conference held here today and tomorrow, added that Sino-U.S. relations are, from the viewpoint of global strategy, a parallel partnership. He believed that human rights and trade should not be linked together, hoping that the U.S. and Chinese Governments could solve the problem of human rights and trade through talks. On Amoco's attitude toward the renewal of China's MFN trading status and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Thomas said that his company is making efforts toward these two goals. He himself has already discussed the issue with some administrative officials of the United States. Thomas said that he had a discussion last Thursday [10 March] with three U.S. senators in Washington on the same issue. "Different people think of human rights in different ways. My suggestion is that we have people from both sides, the United States and China, sit down and discuss the issue and find areas of common agreement," Thomas stressed. For those who have poor knowledge about China, Thomas suggested that they come and see China with their own eyes. "Seeing China firsthand is a lot different from reading about it in the newspaper," he said, adding that many people change their minds after coming to China. C. Patrick Chu, president of the Amoco Orient Company, told the press conference that he had met with dozens of visiting U.S. senators and over 20 U.S. Congressmen in Beijing to discuss the MFN trade issue with them. Chu hoped that the human rights issue could be separated from trade and China's MFN trading status renewed. Both in Washington and Beijing, Amoco is making efforts to this end.
