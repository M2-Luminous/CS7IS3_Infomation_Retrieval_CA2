Anselmo Sule was designated president of the Radical Party (PR) to deal with the crisis created by the results of the latest intraparty elections and to prepare for internal elections called for 30 May. The solution was reached after lengthy and tense negotiations with the sector led by Ricardo Navarrete and Enrique Silva Cimma, with the group obtaining a vice presidency and strong representation on the Governing Board. In the tumultuous Council meeting, held in the Diego Portales building, only the regional councillors, members of Congress, and the Governing Board took part. Mid-level PR officials and rank and file militants were not included, in accordance with the bylaws. This caused severe criticism from the Radical rank and file, who gathered outside the building with signs. The leadership summoned the Carabineros to disperse the demonstrators and encourage them to make an orderly entry into the building. The final agreement on the Governing Board was reached after 1930, following complex negotiations in which Navarrete's group conditioned its support on obtaining an important position, such as the General Secretariat or a vice presidency, and a significant presence in the directive bodies. The outcome was that the faction led by Navarrete and Silva Cimma will fill six of the 14 seats on the Emergency Board, while the group led by the current president of the PR, Carlos Gonzalez Marquez, and Sule, will hold the remaining eight. The Governing Board was constituted as follows: president, Anselmo Sule; vice presidents, with equal authority, Ricardo Navarrete and Sergio Carrasco; secretary general, Ernesto Velasco, one of the party's new faces; secretary of organization and control, Aldo Bruzzone; and the national directors: Mireya Alfaro, Gaspar Bernales, Jaime Campos, Jorge Millan, Moises Signorelli, Wilson Tapia, Milton Vergara, Mario Weitzel and a fourteenth director to be designated tomorrow. The Political Committee will be made up of Alex Acosta, Mario Cabezas, Patricio Tombolini, Sergio Villegas, and members of Congress Mario Devau, Dionisio Faulbann and Jose Pena. Outgoing President Carlos Gonzalez Marquez congratulated the councillors for the manner in which they conducted the difficult negotiations. "This agreement was proposed basically by the leadership of the party's rank and file, the regional councillors. We want the rank and file to regain sovereignty and this is why we are going to have an election on 30 May, so that the rank and file can elect its new national officers.... There has been a profound, frank, serious, and painful examination, but it was worthwhile doing." The new president, Anselmo Sule--the only Radical senator who will retain his Senate seat after March--announced that the new Governing Board's work program and the Council's final accords will be made known next Tuesday, 11 January. He expressed appreciation for the support and concern of militants, "at such an important moment, when the Radical Party is passing through a serious crisis. We expect to come out of it strong, with great vigor, and we hope that in the next national election we will again become, in number of votes and elective offices, one of the country's principal forces."
