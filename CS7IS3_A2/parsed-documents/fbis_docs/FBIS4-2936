The Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress held a meeting this morning, accepting Jia Qinglin's resignation. Jia Qinglin, 54, ssumed the offices of standing committee member and deputy secretary of the Fujian CPC Committee when he was transferred to Fujian in 1985. Replacing Wang Zhaoguo in November 1990, Jia took charge of the work of the Fujian Government and successively assumed the office of vice governor, acting governor, and then governor in April 1991. When party secretary Chen Guangyi was transferred to the post of Civil Aviation Administration of China chief at the end of last year, the CPC Central Committee appointed Jia Qinglin as party secretary. At the meeting of leading cadres held at that time, Jia urged his subordinates to "regard wholeheartedly serving the people as their fundamental purpose and working for the interests of the people as their motto." Local people say that Jia Qinglin is honest, kind, upright, and prudent. He sets strict demands on himself and enjoys a high reputation. The Fujian People's Congress Standing Committee accepted Chen Guangyi's resignation from the office of chairman of the people's congress on 6 April. It has been reported that the Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress will hold a meeting on 16 April to elect a member and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fujian People's Government.
