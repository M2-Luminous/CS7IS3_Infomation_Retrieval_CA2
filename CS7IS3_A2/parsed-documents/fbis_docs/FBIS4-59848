The Islamic Republic of Iran's ambassador in New Delhi, who was one of the members of this delegation, criticized the obstructionist behavior of the Indian officials and their attempts to prevent the main objective of the trip, which was to assess the true situation in Kashmir. In view of this stance, the Indian External Affairs Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador and informed him that "his allegations were not in conformity with the facts." We wish to draw the attention of the Indian authorities to two important points: 1. The Indian authorities for many years have opposed the visit by Iranian journalists to the crisis-ridden Kashmir region. Now that a diplomatic delegation has gone to that region, the Indian Government is trying to cover up the pressure it is exerting on Kashmiri Muslims by resorting to fallacious propaganda and "disseminating news without any truth," despite the fact that every day there are alarming reports of disastrous occurrences in Kashmir. 2. It appears that the Indians did not expect anyone to react to the actions of the Indian Armed Forces in Kashmir. Why should the free statements of a diplomat regarding Kashmir upset the Indian authorities? If the Indians are apprehensive about the revelations of their atrocities in Kashmir, they should seek a path other than intimidation. Their allegation that "the Iranian ambassador was the only one who complained" does not change anything, as the Indian External Affairs Ministry has not refuted his allegations. In any case, the Indian officials should know that one cannot cover up facts for a prolonged period of time and that the only path is to officially grant rights to the people of Kashmir.
