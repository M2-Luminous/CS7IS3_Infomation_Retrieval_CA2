He said all Interior Ministry organizations will apply new measures in this regard as of the day after tomorrow, Sunday [1 May]. Hammad made these remarks during a tour of the al-Husayn Bridge this morning. During his tour, he inspected the reception halls for arrivals and departures. He also listened to the requests of arrivals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hammad added: Pursuant to the instructions of His Majesty King Husayn, and in light of the inspirational and culturally significant statements made by His Highness Crown Prince Hasan last week on the need to reconsider the regulations issued by the Interior Ministry with regard to the residence of West Bankers and Gazans in Jordan, the Interior Ministry has decided to thoroughly reconsider all measures and regulations issued by the Interior Ministry in this regard. The new measures will facilitate things for arrivals. The interior minister said all the measures enforced thus far were intended to firmly promote the steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied territories, safeguard Jordan's national security, and thwart the implementation of displacement schemes the Israeli occupation troops sought to carry out. Hammad went on to say: The Interior Ministry has enforced the old regulations pertaining to the residence and transit of West Bankers and Gazans within the context of Jordan's firm pan-Arab outlook vis-a-vis the kinsfolk and brothers. Jordan, which was careful to keep the bridges with the occupied territories open since 1967, has contributed to maintaining pan-Arab cohesion and deepening the pan-Arab sentiments of the kinsfolk, who are holding out in the occupied Palestinian Arab territories, although this policy was the object of criticism by some parties in the past. Hammad said: Jordan, which is proud of its Hashemite leadership, has striven to promote the spirit of Arab renaissance and sought to make Jordan an exemplary homeland that embraces pan-Arab sentiments, and that inspires others with its ideas, instead of exporting them, as His Highness Crown Prince Hasan has noted. Jordan's historical ties with the kinsfolk in our occupied homeland have always required the best formula and best way to mitigate the agonies brought about by the occupation. Hammad added: Given the fact that the reasons that prompted the Interior Ministry to issue its old regulations are about to become a thing of the past, and since the Palestinian brothers are about to realize their aspirations, the Interior Ministry, in implementation of directives issued by His Majesty King Husayn, will revoke these regulations. Besides, it will strive to reconsider the regulations governing the renewal of the passports carried by West Bankers and Gazans. It will also introduce the system of cards [not further identified]. This will allow for the movement of students across the bridges to further their education. The ministry will later announce additional measures in this regard. The Interior Ministry will thoroughly examine the usefulness of using cards. The new regulations will take effect as of the day after tomorrow, Sunday. Salamah Hammad began his tour this morning by chairing a meeting at the Bridges Administration Office. The meeting was attended by the officials concerned. The interior minister informed them of the new regulations. He was also briefed on the measures the Bridges Administration Office will enforce this summer. During the meeting, Colonel 'Abd-al-Salam al-Ja'afirah, director of the Bridge Security Centers, said the bridges will remain open for 18 hours every day, and that there will be a chance to make reservations ahead of the actual crossing time, to ease the burdens placed on citizens. He said the number of reservation offices in all the governorates will be increased. The minister of interior also inspected the new reception hall, which has room for 600 passengers. He also met with departures and listened to their remarks. He received several arrivals, including a delegation of Gazans that came to offer condolences on the death of the late Queen Zayn al-Sharaf.
