He was notified of a complaint in the name of the Albanian Foreign Ministry regarding completely unfounded claims on the alleged new arrests of Albanian citizens of Greek origin. Mr. Tsalikis was also told that if the Greek side is not interested in misinforming its own public, as well as the international public, by spreading lies, then the Greek side should contact the proper Albanian organs to be informed correctly. Mr. Tsalikis was further told that the dissemination of false information and the threatening tones of members of the Greek Government causes one to think that they are an expression of a lack of will on the Greek side to overcome the present difficulties in relations between the two countries.
