However, he told today's meeting with the chiefs and staffers of the foreign intelligence service, "it is now particularly important to draw a distinction between partnership and attempts to dominate or to foist on us their own actions, which run counter to Russia's interests. It is unacceptable to Russia." Russia, stressed Boris Yeltsin, has its own view of the priorities in the foreign and domestic policies and it also has interests of its own on the international arena. This is convincingly shown in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis and Russia's activities in close neighboring countries. However, noted the president "we have recently come to see clearly that such activities by Russia do at times cause irritation." Boris Yeltsin expressed the thought that the political campaign surrounding the so-called "Ames" affair illustrates this clearly. The real motives and goals of this anti-Russian action, continued the president of Russia, have clear political overtones. Boris Yeltsin said that American intelligence is stepping up its efforts to acquire an agent network in Russia, but U.S. special services think that the foreign intelligence service and its military colleagues from the GRU have no right to act in the same manner. "I can give assurances," said the President, "that Russia is no longer prepared to reconcile itself with this kind of discrimination. We are ready to take all the measures provided for in international law to rectify the situation." "Russia," stressed Boris Yeltsin, "is for an equal and mutually advantageous cooperation and mutual respect, and I believe that our partners will learn to take account of our position."
