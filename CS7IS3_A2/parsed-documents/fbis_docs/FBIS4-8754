[passage omitted] RDP-1 has learned that the city is under heavy fire, tens of thousands of people fleeing. There have been more than 1,200 casualties since the beginning of the Serb offensive. The Serbs have entered Gorazde with combat vehicles, as UN spokesman Manuel Almeida told us. [Begin recording] [Almeida] We were informed by our colleagues in Gorazde that the local people had told them that the Serbs were entering the city with tanks. [passage omitted] We did not see this because we are in shelters as the city is being bombarded. Our colleagues are in protected shelters and the local people went to see them and tell them. Also, what we can see is that the population is in a great panic. This is understandable since we estimate that during the offensive of the last few days, last two weeks, about 25,000 people have been moved within the Gorazde enclave; the great majority seeking refuge in the city of Gorazde or in its outskirts. The city does not have the conditions to receive so many people, many buildings have been destroyed. [Announcer] How many casualties are there? [Almeida] There are about 1,200 people dead or injured.
