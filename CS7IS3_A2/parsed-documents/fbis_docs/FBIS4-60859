At present, according to the amendment, it bans the use of US governmental assistance to Azerbaijan. This ban also restricts assistance vis-a-vis projects addressing peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. "The solving of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict within the CSCE Minsk Group framework is the best way to annul" the Freedom Support Act, said the President. In his reply to President Aliyev, the US President said that he opposes such restrictions since they limit the activity of the United States that is aimed at the support of reform and the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict. President Clinton said that transport communications following the Armenia-Nakhichevan route must be unblocked so as to deliver humanitarian assistance to the peaceful population in that region. The letter also contained an announcement about the newly appointed US representative to the CSCE Minsk Group, Joseph Prescelli, who, according to the US President, will "closely cooperate with representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia and other states to put an end to the war by diplomatic means". The US President assessed President Aliyev's adherence to settle the conflict within the framework of the Minsk Group and expressed hope that it will establish close cooperation to achieve peace. The amendments to the "Freedom Support Act", which also includes a ban on humanitarian assistance delivery from US governmental agencies to Azerbaijani governmental entities, was adopted by the US Congress in October 1992. In March 1994 Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the US Senate, in which it asked for an annulment due to difficult situation of Azeri refugees.
