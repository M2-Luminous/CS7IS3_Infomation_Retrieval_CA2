FR940328-2-00116 FR940328-2-00065 [FAR Case 91&hyph;105] OMB Clearance Request for First Article Testing and Approval Waiver AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of new request for OMB clearance. SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information collection requirement concerning First Article Testing and Approval Waiver. DATES: Comments may be submitted on or before May 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Mr. Peter Weiss, FAR Desk Officer, OMB, room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose Under the proposed rule, a new solicitation provision, ``Waiver of First Article Testing Requirements'' is proposed for addition to the FAR. The solicitation provision will be prescribed at FAR 9.308(a) for inclusion in all solicitations which contain a requirement for First Article Testing and Approval (FATA), unless it is known at the time of solicitation that FATA will not be waived. As provided in FAR 9.302, FATA may be required during contract performance to ensure that the contractor can furnish a product that conforms to all contract requirements. In situations where the contractor has provided the same or similar items to the Government under a previous contract, the Government may waive the requirement for FATA. In order to determine that waiver of FATA is appropriate, the offeror is requested, under the subject solicitation provision, to identify the contract under which the items were previously furnished. The information is used by contracting officers to determine whether or not FATA requirements can be waived for an offeror. If the information is not obtained, the contractors and the Government may incur additional expense and administrative delay by imposing unnecessary testing demands on contractors who have proven their ability to manufacture the required items. B. Annual Reporting Burden Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 6 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 3,750; responses per respondent, 20; total annual responses, 75,000; preparation hours per response, 1; and total response burden hours, 7,500. C. Annual Recordkeeping Burden The annual recordkeeping burden is estimated as follows: Recordkeepers, 37,500; hours per recordkeeper, 5; and total recordkeeping burden hours, 18,750. Obtaining Copies of Proposals Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501&hyph;4755.
