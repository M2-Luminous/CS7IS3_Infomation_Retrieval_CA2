FBIS4-58413 "drnes086_m_94008" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 JORDAN Presence of UN Observers at al-'Aqabah Rejected Presence of UN Observers at al-'Aqabah Rejected JN0305140794 Amman AKHBAR AL-USBU' in Arabic 3 May 94 p 7 JN0305140794 Amman AKHBAR AL-USBU' Arabic BFN [Text] Amman--A responsible Jordanian source has stressed Jordan's rejection of any agreement with Lloyds Register that encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty over its territory and its right to inspect incoming ships. In statements to the press, the source said that Jordan insists on not giving Lloyds Register the right to inspect ships and that this international company's duty is to carry out inspections at the docks in the Port of al-'Aqabah and to allow or disallow any imported goods into the country. The source noted that the cost of the inspections, which could reach $3 million dollars per year, is not Jordan's responsibility. This is because the inspection procedure was not imposed by Jordan but by the United Nations, which, therefore, should cover the inspection costs. However, an agreement on this issue could be reached later. The source said that Jordan rejects the stationing of international forces to supervise the work of the international company and also rejects the presence of international observers at the Port of al-'Aqabah. Some international sources have called for this in order to secure direct international supervision over the inspection operations. According to them, these operations are being conducted by a civil rather than an international authority and an international presence alongside this civilian authority is required. Diplomatic sources in Amman said that inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah's docks will create many problems for Jordan. These sources believe that inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah will not take place because the United Nations cannot totally delegate UN Security Council duties to an international company. These sources noted that, during the press conference with His Majesty King Husayn after agreeing to delegate Lloyds Register to carry out the inspections, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher reiterated twice that through this agreement, the embargo on Iraq will become more effective. The sources added that the U.S. secretary meant that the inspections that were carried out at sea, sometimes in a random and inaccurate manner, will now be carried out at the docks of the port and cover each and every piece of imported goods under UN supervision, which would require the stationing of an international force at the port or at least one international officer or observer with permanent residency in Jordanian territory. The sources said that the Jordanian-U.S. agreement does not seem practical and that it will reignite Jordanian-U.S. differences once implementation begins.
