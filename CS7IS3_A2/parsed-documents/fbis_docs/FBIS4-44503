The growth of exports slowed down, but industrial production was up. The gap between revenues and expenditures is inconsistent with the situation in trading, and the economic situation is unclear. Hsueh Chi, deputy director of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, Executive Yuan, described the current economic situation as "strange and changeable" on 22 April. He decided to invite the Central Bank of China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to join their efforts in finding the crux. Hsueh Chi pointed out first that our exports in the first quarter this year only rose 0.4 percent over 1993, and we rank at the bottom of the four small dragons in Asia. "The global economy is gradually reviving, but our country shows little momentum. It is unusual," he added. Hsueh Chi said that the current economic situation in our country is extremely strange and changeable. No one is able to make head or tail of it. For example, the growth rate of exports for the first quarter of this year not only failed to exceed that of the same period last year, it actually dropped a great deal, and fell far below the 4.63 percent estimated by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. Second, the annual growth rate of export orders during the fourth quarter of 1993 amounted to 4.9 percent. Although it was not very high, it often indicates the exports for the first quarter of this year. It should not be as low as 0.4 percent. Hsueh Chi said that the reason as to why there are more merchandise ordered than that actually exported is perhaps because of the situation whereas orders are placed to Taiwan, while merchandise is shipped out from a third country. Nevertheless, we will have to verify what actually happened. Third, the exports growth rate during the first quarter of 1994 is the lowest one since the third quarter of 1990, but the industrial production index is the highest since 1992. If there are less demands abroad, how can we still maintain a high growth rate in industrial production? Both the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and Development simply do not understand. The fourth question raised by Hsueh Chi is that the export orders for textile products received in March this year rose nearly 20 percent as compared with those in February. Since the textile industry in which a great many factories had already moved out of the country can still receive more orders, why are other industries in our country less competitive? Li Kao-chao, Director of the Economic Research Department of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, also pointed out a strange phenomenon. That is, there was no loss of momentum in exports in last March, but exports in March this year showed a decline of 5.2 percent as compared with the same period in last year. In addition, there is a big gap between the favorable balance of foreign exchange earnings and outlays and the favorable balance of customs imports and exports. The Central Bank of China fails to understand this. Right now, it is checking to see if it is because of the interference from other cash outflowing channels, which creates the gap between total volume of export orders and the growth rate of exports. In face of the unclear situation in trading at present, the Council for Economic Planning and Development will hold a consultation committee meeting next week and invite scholars to discuss the "current situation in trading and outlook." Hsueh Chi hoped that all economic research departments of the Central Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics would vie with one another to find out the cause of disease in the current economic situation. Right now, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are studying and analyzing the situation. Hsueh Chi pointed out: It may not be difficult to find the problem in our current economic situation. It is possible that minor issues which had been ignored in the past have become today's big problems.
