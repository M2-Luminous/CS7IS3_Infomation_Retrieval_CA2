FBIS3-34368 "drnes026dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 Palestinian Affairs Talk Stresses Inevitablity of Liberation, Independence JN0802080894 Baghdad Voice of the PLO in Arabic 1700 GMT 7 Feb 94 JN0802080894 Baghdad Voice of the PLO Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] Brothers, the reality is that the enemy can no longer obliterate or send into oblivion, that it swims against the current, and covertly and overtly carries out actions which contradict its statements. The ruling authorities in Israel still believe they can set the clock back and that it is possible to perpetuate the occupation while stepping up their talk about peace, as if it's realization is imminent. [word indistinct] the uproar continues. Through all this, it becomes evident that what the Israelis want is to drag the peace process into mazes that, in case the peace process continues, will only undermine and destroy its very foundations. From this premise, the enemy's procrastination and delaying tactics on the one hand, and the escalation of its terrorist operations against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland on the other are signs as to how official Israel approaches the peace process and its requirements. Official Israel's illusion has reached the point of believing it is possible to bypass, or distort the inalienable Palestinian rights under the slogan of introducing amendments to the Declaration of Principles. Five months after it was signed, Israel has not yet offered any evidence that it abides by the implementation of its provisions. While we view the Declaration of Principles as a first step on the road to peace, we are aware, and emphasize that this agreement is not the end of the road, given that it is an agreement for a transitional stage and does not, as yet, respond to all our national aspirations for liberation and complete independence. In spite of all the above, we stress to the enemy before anyone else, that we have the necessary potential, will, and confidence in victory that make us say with a resounding voice that Israeli blackmail will be to no avail, and that occupation will inevitably be eliminated. Let the enemy wallow as much as it wants in its illusions. However, it must realize before it is too late that its illusions will founder on the rock of our people's steadfastness and their unflinching faith in the inevitable victory and independence on the liberated land of Palestine.
