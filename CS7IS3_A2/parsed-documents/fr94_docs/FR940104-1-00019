FR940104-1-00019 FR940104-1-00004 The Commission is proposing to eliminate a series of requirements for posting information obtained from the transportation request on the source and destination of gas. 21 Information from the transportation request form on source and destination should no longer be of much value since the Commission has required pipelines to provide for flexible receipt and delivery points. By making use of alternate receipt or delivery points, shippers will be able to transport gas between a variety of sources and destinations, regardless of the source or destination information provided on the transportation request form. The Commission, however, is retaining the requirement that pipelines post the quantity of gas at each delivery point for discounts actually granted. 21 Current §§250.16(b)(2) (vii), (ix), (xi). The Commission has not proposed to delete certain information relating to requests for service, such as the position of the request in the transportation queue and the disposition of the request. Nevertheless, the Commission is unsure about the value of retaining the requirements for posting information concerning the requests for service and solicits comments on whether they should be deleted as well. In Order No. 636&hyph;A, the Commission addressed the requirement in current §250.16(b)(2)(xiv) for reporting whether gas sales are being made below cost. 22 A commenter had requested additional protection against affiliate abuse, contending that, after unbundling, a pipeline could avoid the Order No. 497 requirement to post transportation discounts by charging its affiliate the maximum transportation rate to deliver the gas, but selling gas to its affiliate at a loss. As part of its response, the Commission stated that concealment of such an arrangement would be difficult in light of the §250.16(b)(2)(xiv) requirement for pipelines to report whether affiliated marketers or their blanket sales operating units were selling gas below cost. 22 Order No. 636&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,622&hyph;23. However, after further consideration and review of experience under Order No. 497, the Commission is proposing to eliminate the sales below cost provision, because it has not proved meaningful in evaluating discounts granted by pipelines. The Commission understands the pipelines obtain the information on below cost sales from the affiliated marketer in its initial request for service. The information reported by the pipeline, therefore, would not provide current below cost sales information that can be directly related to the current transportation arrangements posted in the log. Experience also shows that 98% of the time pipelines report this information as ``no'' or ``unknown''. The Commission has no evidence that the manipulation of gas and transportation prices, as suggested by the comment in Order No. 636&hyph;A, has occurred or resulted in discrimination. Moreover, the Commission seriously doubts whether, in the competitive market for gas sales, any pipeline reporting requirement would permit monitoring of the ever-changing price which shippers, whether affiliated marketers or others, will be paying for gas. Shippers in the market are in a better position to obtain information on gas prices and to file complaints with the Commission if they believe a manipulation of gas and transportation prices results in an undue discrimination relating to the transportation component. The Commission also is proposing to clarify the reporting requirements by requiring the provision of information on whether an affiliate or sales operating unit is involved in the transportation transaction and its role. Current §250.16(b)(2) (revised §250.16(d)) already requires pipelines to report transactions in which an affiliated marketer is involved, even if it is not the shipper. For example, an affiliate or pipeline sales operating unit could be involved in a transaction as a seller of gas or as an agent, but not as the shipper. The requirement to report the extent of such involvement would ensure that those obtaining the affiliate information would know the role of the pipeline affiliate when it is not a shipper. b. Access to the affiliate and nonaffiliate information. The existing regulations require pipelines to file transportation logs at the Commission. The Commission is proposing to conform these filing requirements to the requirement, established in Order Nos. 497&hyph;D and 497&hyph;E, that pipelines post affiliate information on their EBBs rather than submitting it to the Commission. 23 23 Under Order No. 497&hyph;E, the requirement for filing transportation logs at the Commission terminates the earlier of 90 days after a pipeline is in compliance with Order No. 636 or June 30, 1994.
