Arguing that attempts at negotiation with Pyongyang had failed, he said: "We are insisting that the West unite behind a strong position because the risks are considerable. If we continue to let North Korea develop its nuclear arms potential, it risks destabilizing the whole of the Korean peninsula and the region," he said, after a meeting with the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly. "Seoul is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the demarcation line, so there are all the elements of a powder-keg," he said. "We need a rapid and clear display of the determination of the international community," he said, adding that it could not "let North Korea continue to violate its international commitments." He spoke as the United States prepares to present a resolution seeking UN sanctions against North Korea.
