Pinto said that "this Free Zone respects the decisions made by the government" in regard to situations that affect the democratic development of any country, in this case Haiti. Galo Pinto said that "users of the Free Zone are studying the effects the suspension of commercial exchange will have on that Caribbean nation." Meanwhile, a reliable source who requested anonymity said that "Haitian businessmen are among the top clients of the Free Zone; they invest thousands of balboas to purchase products that are later reexported" to that French-speaking nation. According to the spokesperson, "Haiti currently has one of the biggest markets in the Caribbean and ranks among the 10 biggest Free Zone purchasers." For the second time, the Colon Free Zone, third-largest free zone in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore, will respect the UN decision against Haiti. The UN sanctions on Haiti are aimed at restoring democracy in that country and ensure the return to the country of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The Association of Colon Free Zone Users is currently studying the dispositions being implemented by other Latin American governments against Haiti.
