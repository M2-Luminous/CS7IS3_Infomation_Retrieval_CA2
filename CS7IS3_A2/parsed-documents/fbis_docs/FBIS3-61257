Gorincioi, minister of agriculture and food of the Republic of Moldova, by Yu. Khudoley; place and date not given; published under the rubric "Interview at the End of the Year": "The Market Breaks Down Stereotypes"] [Text] [Khudoley] If you do not object, Vitalie Vasilyevich, let us begin our discussion with the results of the agricultural year. After all, no matter what happens, the food complex is the sphere of material production in whose situation everyone without exception is interested. The more so during our difficult and complicated times, and on the threshold of winter at that. True, reports and comments about this appear in the mass media from time to time. But these have all been fragmentary, scattered information, although even from this it is clear that the preliminary prognosis was not fully justified. Is this true? Our readers would like to know about this, as it were, first hand.... [Gorincioi] Indeed, there were quite a few optimistic predictions during the spring and summer. But most frequently they did not come from agrarians and certainly not from our ministry. Both traditional peasant customs and the unpredictability of production out under the open sky make it impossible for a serious agrarian to give out easy promises. So there is no need to ascribe others' sins to us, we have enough of our own. If there is something for which many of us can be reproached, it is the habit of looking for reasons why the results promised by the politicians were not achieved. Most often we blame the unkindness of nature. In this case that would not be altogether true. Of course, in the spring there are always strong rains that wash away part of the planted areas, and during the summer--hail in the first half and drought in the second. But on the whole the year was not that bad. Especially for the good farms. The problems were on a different plane. Above all there was the poor supply of fuel, mineral fertilizers, means of plant protection, and containers. But, I repeat, looking at the larger picture, the year was favorable. And the results were generally not bad. Take just the indicators of the first grain harvesting. More than 42 quintals of high-quality wheat grain per hectare--Moldova has never had such a yield before. And it was on a larger area than usual. According to preliminary calculations, the gross grain yield from all categories of farms, that is, including private, will be about 3 million tonnes. Will this be sufficient or not? Of course, having learned from last year's bitter experience when because of the drought the livestock experienced a critical shortage of manufactured feed concentrates during wintering, many owners have been storing up grain. Nonetheless, more than 400,000 tonnes have been sold to the state. State procurements would probably have been greater if the banks had been able to allot sufficient credit resources. But the main thing is that the population has bread to eat. Thus the kolkhoz and sovkhoz workers alone have been issued about a million tonnes of grain in the form of in-kind payments and preferential sales. In many villages, particularly in Drokiyevskiy Rayon, agricultural enterprises have extended this benefit to pensioners, teachers, and medical workers as well. But although grain may be on everybody's mind, man needs many other things as well. For instance, the peasants have tried to give the food industry all the raw material it needed. In spite of the fact that, as I have already said, the rains eroded a considerable area planted in sugar beets, the productivity of this crop is fairly high. The quantity of sugar beets processed this season will be 1.8 million tonnes. This means that the output of sugar will reach 210,000-215,000 tonnes. Half of this what they call strategic product will be taken into state resources. It is intended for sale to the population at fixed prices and also for hospitals and other closed institutions. As for other agricultural crops, the results have varied here too. For sunflower seeds, say, the indicator is mediocre. In any case the yield was lower than was expected in the spring and the beginning of the summer. Nonetheless we managed to grow them and harvest 185,000 tonnes of this oil-bearing raw material. True, the agricultural enterprises have had to keep most of these agricultural products, since the processors do not have the credit resources to buy them. Incidentally, it is only in our country that until recently the state has tried to buy up all the agricultural products from the farmers all at once and at any price. And procurement prices for them have been established at the very beginning of the harvest. Experts from the International Monetary Fund and other European organizations do not conceal their surprise at this. Incidentally, at first glance such a procurement system seems advantageous to the agricultural enterprises since they can immediately obtain large sums of money. But in reality, under conditions of inflation and late settlements, the agricultural enterprises only stand to lose. There is no doubt that today it is more expedient to have stage-by-stage sale of products in batches with the corresponding price regulation. For instance, for sunflower seeds the sizes of the procured batches are determined by the monthly productivity of the processing enterprises. With such a system of credit resources in the first stage it was necessary to purchase only 35,000 tonnes of raw material, and the rest of the batches of it were acquired with earnings from the sale of the oil. This summer the farmers' concern about difficulties with the harvest and the sale of the fruit and vegetable crops has frequently shown through in the newspapers. True, the gross yield of these products is not a record, but there have indeed been additional problems with them. It would seem that the demand for fresh fruits should increase. Because perhaps for the first time Moldovan orchard growers have managed to obtain an intensive type of almost ecologically pure fruits in their planted areas. Nonetheless, there were frequent cases where our traditional customers refused our fruit last year. Incidentally, more and more frequently the suppliers themselves have been forced to reject partnership with nearby foreign countries. The main reason is the excessively high rates for rail transportation: It costs one-half to one-third as much to buy a kilogram of apples as it does to ship them to the Urals. And so it has turned out that of the 750,000 tonnes of fruit that were harvested, less than one-third was delivered fresh, and the rest of it was processed at our own enterprises. Of course, this is not the best solution, but there simply was no other. True, the demand for dried fruits was good, but they are an even more energy-intensive product than the preserves and compotes. Since the beginning of the year canners have produced more than 1 billion conventional containers of products, and by the end of December the output will exceed 20-25 percent of the level of any past year. And this is under conditions with an extremely critical shortage of energy and material resources. After all, not all the banks followed precisely the parliament's decree on granting credit to agricultural enterprises for acquiring containers, and the canning plants--for buying glass jars, lids, and so forth. Grape and tobacco growers were counting on hefty incomes this year. But industry was able to accept from grape growers only half a million tonnes of their products. The rest--about 200,000 tonnes--was sold to the population or turned over for processing to be returned to the suppliers later, thus partially eliminating the immense interest on credit. Incidentally, grape growers cannot count on anything even for the raw material that has been shipped: So far the agricultural enterprises have been paid only 15 million lei. They are promising to repay their debt of 45 million as they receive their earnings from the wine that is sold. The shortage of credit resources drove the tobacco growers into a corner as well. Agricultural enterprises grew about 50,000 tonnes of dried leaves and are gradually selling them, but the specialized association is first paying for 15,000 tonnes for the tobacco combine and then 10,000 tonnes to be exchanged for grades that are in short supply for cigarette production. The rest of the raw material is being processed, and as customers are found, the money is returned to the farms. [Khudoley] So even in the autumn the agricultural enterprises, leaseholders, and farmers did not get especially rich. [Gorincioi] If you keep in mind that under current conditions settlements for raw material are made not in advance but as the final products are sold, of course, immense one-time receipts of money into the accounts of the farms are not to be anticipated. But still the deficit of credit resources has ultimately worked to their advantage. If the old practice continues, neither the agro-industrial complex nor, above all, the processing branch will ever be able to get out of debt to the banks, with their enormous interest rates on credit which erode incomes and make products more costly. It is important to get away from intermediate credit at any price. With the creation on the basis of the processing enterprises of joint-stock companies involving the participation of agricultural enterprises, one must assume that this need will fall away. But the situation requires that we reduce the use of bank credit to a minimum even today. Understandably, it is difficult to break old traditions, including the procurement mechanism that has been established, but there is no other way. What kind of effectiveness can there be if, for example, the agricultural enterprises ship grain to the elevators during July-August and are not paid for it until the beginning of November! And such delays have become a part of the system. So it is better to switch to stage-by-stage procurements with revised prices for raw material. To a certain extent the mechanism for procuring animal husbandry products is like this, and the ministry is making sure that it is strictly observed. In a number of cases it has even been necessary to resort to such a measure as suspending the issuance of wages to those processing enterprises that do not pay for their raw material for a long time. It seems that in time the contractual-financial discipline of the partners will straighten out. But the situation is indeed critical within the animal husbandry branch itself. It has set the goal of producing 800,000 tonnes of milk per year, but from all appearances it will produce no more than half a million. The public sector of agriculture will produce 120,000-130,000 tonnes of meat instead of the earmarked 200,000. True, taking private farms into account, there will be more of these products. After all, the overall number of head of livestock in the republic has not decreased. The reasons for the decline are known. Above all, last year's drought took its toll, leaving many farms on a starvation ration. And large complexes were left to the will of fate by farm-shareholders after the administrative-command system, which sustained them during difficult periods, collapsed. One must assume that these complexes could have adapted to market conditions as well were it not for all kinds of restrictions. In particular, holding down the prices of animal husbandry products did not work to the advantage either of the branch or of the consumers. Regardless of how high they may have been against the background of the low buying power of the majority of the population, expenditures of agricultural enterprises are still not being covered, and there is nothing with which to compensate for the state overexpenditure. And yet one must keep in mind that the agro-industrial complex, above all animal husbandry, is not working solely for the domestic market. Meat, powdered milk, butter, and so forth are practically the most marketable goods for which we can obtain the energy resources we need so much. For this reason alone we must produce them even at a loss to ourselves. [Khudoley] Judging from the reports from agricultural enterprises, perhaps this is the first time so many of them have kept up with the fall complex of field work.... [Gorincioi] It would be more correct to say this: We are speaking for the first time about the adversities suffered by the peasants. We said nothing when the sugar beets were delivered to the plants several months after they had shut down, when the corn was processed in the fields, when thousands of hectares of vineyards with unharvested grapes were covered with snow, or when areas planted in tomatoes and table beets were left to freeze. Unfortunately, we have not managed to avoid losses now either. About 1,400 hectares of sugar beets and almost 3,000 hectares of corn suffered from severe frosts. But if there is hope of saving these products (in particular, the harvesting of corn has not ceased for a single hour), it is impossible to save frozen fruits. The only thing they might be used for is jam. But the most alarming thing is that 200,000 hectares of land on agricultural enterprises and about 80,000 hectares turned over to private possession of the peasants under Article 82 of the Land Code went unplowed. There are also farmstead plots that need to be plowed. This happened because initially there was no fuel or lubricants, and then severe frosts struck unexpectedly at the beginning of November. Now the fuel necessary to complete the plowing has been shipped in. There is also technical equipment. If there are "windows of time in winter" (and they are not a rarity in our region), we will be able to finish this work in 10-15 days. In any case, that is what the machine operators think. For, be that as it may, land plowed poorly in the fall is better than land plowed well in the spring. It is especially important to do this work more quickly in the southern zone, where there are frequent dry winds in the spring and the only way of counteracting them is to plant in such a way that the plants have already developed roots and become strong by this time. [Khudoley] Is it not too early for the state to abandon its concern about resource support for the farms? Does the ministry have an effective alternative that would make it possible to ensure their normal functioning? Or does everyone have to fend for himself? [Gorincioi] Indeed, when encountering the shortages and the high cost of fuel on the market, many agrarians more and more frequently ask the question: What next? If the fuel problem is exacerbated so much, will there be a need for technical equipment, which becomes more difficult to restore each season? Is there any point in expending so much money and food in order to start running hundreds of thousands of motors in the fields, farms, and orchards? If anyone is interested in my opinion, it is simple. If a person assumes that today it is possible to work the land without machine technology, he is deeply deluded. That would mean failure. Of course, it is useful to keep horses and oxen. But you will not plow very quickly or very well with this kind of power, and in general you will not receive a good harvest. Therefore it is necessary to look in a different direction for a way out of the crisis--namely in modern technologies and the latest achievements of scientific and technical progress. On each agricultural enterprise and in the republic as a whole we must decide right now what we will do next year. Which structure of the planted areas will be most expedient? What should we grow in order both to satisfy the domestic market and to earn good money by selling products abroad? Even today we must know precisely what to sell and where and how to sell it. Incidentally, we must spend intelligently as well. As for the major expenditure item, it is energy sources, as usual. They cost Moldova almost $600 million, and the agro-industrial complex can and does provide the lion's share of these funds. But still, it is time to utilize these resources efficiently and move from slogans about economizing to practice. I have in mind not only guarantees against all kinds of losses but also a combination, especially on small farms, of modern machines and mini-equipment and horses. In many operations it is impossible to do without manual labor. But on most of the areas we must continue to rely on mechanization, chemization, and land reclamation. [Khudoley] What is your assessment of the agrarian reform in Moldova? How accurate are the suggestions from experts of the European Community regarding the mechanism for economic reforms in your branch? [Gorincioi] Reforms in agroeconomics are not simply mechanical redistribution of the land. Their meaning lies in completely different relations between the sphere of production of raw material and the sphere of its processing, between the producer and the state. Completely different relations are required today within the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes as well. In a word, the purpose of the reforms is by no means to divide up collective or state wealth and drag it off into our own little corn bins and then rejoice in such "innovation." We need a reform that will provide for increased production and high labor compensation. And it is possible to interest the peasant in efficient management only if he feels that he is working for himself. That is, as it were, the internal side of the reforms that are taking place. But today it is apparently not without reason that we are asked this question: "What are you doing in order to enter a qualitatively different orbit of relations with the West?" For now we must admit that only the first steps are being taken on this plane. They come to us from there with one goal in mind--to earn more. And they will really cooperate with us when they see us as equal partners with good intentions and good potential. But there has been a breakthrough in the creation of joint ventures. In particular, in the sphere of meat production and processing, where there will be an entire group of these productions with the participation of American capital. One of them is already being formed in Oknitskiy Rayon. A protocol of intentions has been signed. In grape growing and wine making, common interests with Dutch, British, German, and other firms have been discovered. There are proposals for joint production and processing of tobacco from an Australian firm, but its conditions (it demands 51 percent of the authorized capital for itself) do not suit us. We are working on the question of building a glass bottle plant which will be financed both by enterprises of the republic and foreign banks. This plant is extremely necessary. But when accepting assistance we must remember that it will be necessary to pay for it.... Incidentally, the special demand of producers of energy sources for animal husbandry products forces agricultural enterprises and organs of local self-government to revise their attitude toward complexes. People can say to me that this initiative must come from the ministry or even from the government. But most frequently that is what happens; we are convinced of this by the special-purpose allotment of preferential credit and taxation, the writing off of debts on credit, subsidies, etc. It is another matter, apparently, that we should not disperse this assistance but concentrate it in the leading areas and positions. If only to provide goods for the domestic food market. And in general the initially forced reduction of subsidies and compensations for agriculture brought about by the state budget deficit is also exerting a positive influence. People are gradually breaking the habit of placing their hopes in the state and learning to manage efficiently themselves, taking their capabilities and reserves into account. In a word--doing what a market economy requires. All the plans for technical assistance developed by experts from the European Community are aimed at reforms that provide for a transition to the market. They have now begun to be implemented and this is sensitively reflected in the standard of living of the underprivileged. In order to weaken the negative consequences, the government is trying to take advantage of every opportunity to strengthen the social protection of the underprivileged segments of the population. Precisely because the reforms affect these categories of citizens first of all, the government is forced to be extremely cautious in implementing them. Throughout this winter (during the summer and autumn the peasants were not up to reorganizing) we suggest taking the fundamental measures of agrarian reform. We have already begun to transform the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that wish to create independent peasant farms. We are also prepared to integrate the production of raw material with processing in joint-stock companies. Under modern conditions the ministry's role has also changed from what it was when it mainly distributed funds. We see our task in implementing the corresponding section of the government program for bringing the economy out of its crisis.
