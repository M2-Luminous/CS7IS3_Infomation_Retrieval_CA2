FR940719-2-00095 FR940719-2-00058 Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery Programs for Fiscal Year 1994 The Health Reserves and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference, Grants for Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery Programs, for fiscal year (FY) 1994, funded under the authority of section 822, title VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of Public Law 102&hyph;408, Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, dated October 13, 1992. Purpose Section 822 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, authorizes grants to meet the costs of projects to: (1) Plan, develop and operate new programs; or (2) Maintain or significantly expand existing programs for the training of nurse practitioners and/or nurse-midwives who will, upon completion of their studies, be qualified to effectively provide primary health care, including primary health care in homes and in ambulatory care facilities and other health care institutions. Statutory General Preference As provided in section 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended for approval by the peer review group. Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' A proposed notice was published in the Federal Register on September 30, 1993 at 58 FR 51092. Two comments were received prior to the end of the comment period. The comments will be discussed below. Comments on issues that were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this notice. One respondent suggested that ``significant increase in the rate'' should be defined as a 25 percent increase rather than a 50 percent increase as was proposed, because a large program would have a difficult time showing a 50 percent increase. The definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' will remain at 50 percent because a program is required to meet only one of the two criteria in the statutory preference in order to receive the funding preference. If a large program can demonstrate that 30 percent of the graduates have been placed in medically underserved communities (``high rate''), the application can receive the funding preference without any increase in the rate of placing students in medically underserved communities. The respondent also recommended deletion of the requirement that 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year should be working in these settings to receive the preference based on ``significant increase in the rate,'' because the statute does not require this provision. The 15 percent requirement is intended to emphasize provision of substantial care in medically underserved communities and will be retained. The final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed and are presented below. ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 30 percent of graduates in academic year 1991&hyph;92 or academic year 1992&hyph;93, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase on the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.
