The INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported that the three warships of the Russian Baltic Fleet left Liepaja Port of Latvia for Baltiysk Port in Russia. Only a dozen Navy workers stayed behind to deal with remaining financial issues, INTERFAX said. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said at a ceremony to mark the departure that Latvia and Russia are now embarking on a road of normal good-neighborly relations. He said this can be proved by the Russian Navy's withdrawal today and Russia's granting of Latvia the most-favored-nation trade status, which has already taken effect. In the wake of the Navy's pullout, the other services of the Russian Armed Forces will also complete their withdrawal by August 31.
