That, according to him, is enough reason for the PFL not to agree to participate in a coalition unless it is part of the majority slate. In other words, the PFL wants the vice presidency, and if it does not get that spot on the ticket, it will nominate Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for president. Despite resistance from sectors of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] to a rapprochement with the PFL, Bornhausen is not worried and almost disregards the subject. He says that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is modern and in tune with the liberals. The former minister respects his former partner in the Democratic Alliance, the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], and said people must not underestimate the strength of the party in the coming campaign, but his judgement on the PT [Workers Party] is different. Bornhausen believes the PT is tied to communism and that Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is not sufficiently prepared for Planalto Palace. Although he has definite opinions about his opponents, his position regarding Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] is an unknown. Bornhausen was in Sao Paulo this week to explain the PFL's negotiations with Fernando Henrique to his friend. At the same time, the former minister does not rule out a coalition with the party of Maluf, which he says is the PFL's natural ally. Maluf's PPR has the platform that most closely resembles the PFL's system of ideas. [Tavares] Does an alliance between the PFL and PSDB necessarily mean that the PFL would occupy the vice presidential spot on a slate headed by Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso? [Bornhausen] I believe that the PFL, with about 3 million members, 18,000 city councilmen, over 1,000 mayors, about 200 state deputies, more than 100 federal legislators, and nine governors is in a position to run its own candidate for president. In fact, it has a natural candidate in Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. If any alliance is to be made for the sake of this country, it is obvious that a political organization with this kind of strength cannot be left off the presidential slate. [Tavares] If the PFL were to be given ministries and influential state enterprises in the composition of the future administration, wouldn't it have an important and sufficient role? [Bornhausen] It must be very clear that the PFL is not going to discuss participation in the government. The PFL is going to discuss its plan for governing. We adopted a course of action at the convention: the party would first develop a platform; only later would it select its candidate for president. We put together a team of Brazilian notables: Drs. Daniel Dantas, Paulo Guedes, Paulo Rabello de Castro, Roberto Procopio Lima Netto, Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, Nilton Molina, as well as our distinguished colleague Mauro Salles, are all members of this committee. I plan to have this document ready by the end of March, and we are absolutely not concerned about what posts we might hold. We want Brazil to experience a resumption of development, to see jobs being created again, because Brazil's social problem cannot be resolved by paternalism. Not at all--unless new jobs can be created, Brazilians will not really be able to exercise citizenship. It is a platform that gives preference to education. [Tavares] Won't it be necessary to hold high office in order to carry out this platform? [Bornhausen] The PFL is not worried about holding office in this or that state enterprise. On the contrary: we want them to disappear, for there to be as few as possible of them. We want a smaller state. We want privatization. We want a modern state where the citizen is respected, a state devoted to education, health, and safety. There is no need to talk about any coalition in terms of ministries. However, the political participation and political influence of the PFL demand that it be part of the presidential slate. [Tavares] Has the platform changed the identity of the PFL in any way? What is the party's identity today? [Bornhausen] The PFL was not born at a meeting of a group of liberals who formed a political party. It was born at an historic moment when the members of a political organization decided they could not tolerate the absence of freedom to select their candidate for president. Therefore, it was born so that the transition to the democratic system could take place. The PFL platform is a liberal platform. I was the coordinator of that platform. But the party was not born of those ideas exactly; for that very reason, we have taken some very difficult positions at different times, because the party was not preaching what was in its platform. [Tavares] On what occasions did that happen? [Bornhausen] We went so far as to have, in 1989, a candidate for president who had nothing liberal about him, a man who even today defends the monopolies every chance he gets. Although he is a man of the greatest political integrity, Dr. Aureliano Chaves is in no sense a modern and progressive liberal. He is really a statist. So now, the PFL is living according to its program. The opportunity provided by the constitutional revision was precisely what enabled us to put the party on the road to modern and progressive liberalism and be a party that truly wants to solve Brazil's problems, via the market. The PFL knows that is the only way to actually achieve a breakthrough on those serious social problems that exist in Brazil. So we are in a new phase: that of identity with our platform. And for that very reason we do not want to discuss possible government posts. We want to talk about ideas. [Tavares] Isn't there a contradiction in that reasoning? Former Minister Aureliano Chaves is now a member of the PSDB, a party the PFL is talking about allying with for the presidential race. And there are strong factions in the PSDB that think the same way as the former minister does. Isn't the PFL, once again, giving up its platform? [Bornhausen] I want to make it very clear that the PSDB has its own platform and that certainly if there is any alliance--remember, there is none as yet--we will have to sit down at the table with each party's platform and see what the common points are and pick out the parts that Brazil needs. And I believe the PSDB leadership is modern enough to find these points. [Tavares] Would you say that, right now, the party is leaning more towards running its own candidate, or towards forging a coalition? [Bornhausen] As a result of what I am doing right now with Senate leader Marco Maciel and Chamber leader Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, and with the party's secretary general Deputy Eraldo Tinoco--which is to listen to the senators, and the federal and state deputies, the chairmen of the party executive boards, and the governors--I can say, after consulting the delegations from the south, southeast, and west central regions, that the party prefers to run its own candidate and that, if he wants to run, the governor of Bahia is the natural candidate of the party without any reservation. He would have the support and enthusiasm of all the units of the PFL. That is really what the PFL prefers. [Tavares] What happened? Until last week, even Governor Antonio Carlos was publicly advocating an alliance with the tucanos. Is it resistance from parts of the PSDB that hinders this coalition? [Bornhausen] I believe the ideal is for each party to have its own candidate. Governor Antonio Carlos announced his candidacy, but added that it was not irrevocable and that, in his view, the country should look beyond partisan interests. That gesture was typical of a public figure. So we came to the conclusion that it was possible to study not only whether to run a candidate of our own, but consider alliances as well. Incidentally, we never ruled out alliances with any party. [Tavares] Is there a possibility of a rapprochement with the PMDB? [Bornhausen] It is very unlikely at the moment, because the PMDB is experiencing internal conflict that will be decided at its convention. If you don't know how the convention will turn out, you cannot sit down at a table to negotiate. That's the problem, but we are moving in the direction of several accords with the PMDB. [Tavares] For example? [Bornhausen] At the state level--Pernambuco, for example. [Tavares] How do you explain the fact that the PMDB, the PFL's former partner in the Democratic Alliance, is not much of a factor in the presidential succession contest? [Bornhausen] I do not think the PMDB is a weak party. I see strong grass-roots support there. It is going through internal difficulties, there is internal dissension, and that really is not good for the party. But to underestimate the PMDB is not to understand Brazilian politics. It is a party with a very significant number of members, of city councilmen, of mayors...and it certainly will not fail to have a role in this campaign that bears watching. [Tavares] What can be done to circumvent some of the resistance that has emerged among some tucanos to a rapprochement with the PFL? [Bornhausen] I think each party has its own life and should live that life within its own walls, following the path of its particular position. It is not appropriate for me to comment on the behavior of A or B, because that is something that has to be resolved internally. Just as I would not accept comments on behavior within my party, it is not right for me to comment on things outside my party, because it is a matter interna corporis for the PSDB. I just don't think there should be intrigues at this point. That's all. [Tavares] Do you see Minister Fernando Henrique as an antidote to the candidacy of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva? [Bornhausen] I don't believe people in this country should ever think about being against someone. What we need to be is pro-Brazil. We need to opt for a platform that makes Brazil resume its development, that admits this country into the world, because today we are a country that is very closed toward what is most modern in the world and we really must find a candidate who is prepared to carry out an open program. Not to think against others, but to think in favor of Brazil. [Tavares] So Lula's candidacy doesn't scare you? [Bornhausen] No, it is a respectable candidacy from the election politics standpoint. I do not believe, however, that Lula is well-prepared to be president of Brazil and I do not believe that his party has overcome the reasons that led to its creation. It is still attached to what is most backward in the world, which is communism. [Tavares] What does Lula lack? [Bornhausen] I think Lula lacks administrative experience, political ability, and a modern party. [Tavares] How strong do you think Fernando Henrique Cardoso is as a candidate today? [Bornhausen] In the first place, I do not think his candidacy can be assessed until it actually exists. In other words, we must wait until Minister Fernando Henrique says he is a candidate, leaves the ministry, goes out into the public square, and returns to the Senate to play the additional role of working for his plan which is to modernize this country, in the constitutional revision. Then we can evaluate him. What I believe is that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a man who is prepared to be president of Brazil. [Tavares] Isn't there a risk that the minister might be seen as a candidate of the more intellectual segments of society, that he might not have popular appeal? [Bornhausen] I think that a candidate for president of Brazil should be as well-prepared as possible. I cannot fault someone who is cultured and intelligent. [Tavares] But do you think he has charisma? [Bornhausen] I think he has run for office before, he has won before, and he has lost before. Well, he has enough electoral experience and his language is suited to all strata of society. He is modern. Now, obviously, I have to say this does not mean that the PFL will take that road. I repeat: the PFL has a natural candidate in Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. The PFL has not closed the doors to an understanding with any party. This week, we visited the mayor of Sao Paulo. [Tavares] What was the significance of that conversation with Mayor Paulo Maluf? [Bornhausen] I believe that Mayor Paulo Maluf had been talking with the PFL, and with the PP [Progressive Party], and deserved to hear from us an explanation of our party's current position. By this I mean what we are doing, what we are finding out in this x-ray of our colleagues in terms of the progress of the presidential succession process. He has a deadline when he must make a decision and it is not my business to talk about that. But I did have an obligation to tell him what was happening in the PFL, and that is what I did. And my explanation was clear: there is a clear preference in favor of having Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes as our candidate. Only if he does not run will we discuss the problem of alliances. I think I made that very clear. [Tavares] Did Mayor Maluf suggest an alliance with the PFL? [Bornhausen] Of course. He proposed either supporting Governor Antonio Carlos for president, or receiving an indication of a vice presidential candidate on a slate he would head. I took this issue to my fellow leaders in the party. And that possibility can certainly not be ruled out. [Tavares] Historically, the PFL has always been more closely associated with the PPR than with any other Brazilian party. If the PFL could choose between a coalition with the PPR or with the PSDB, which road would it take? [Bornhausen] I think the partisan/political platform of the PFL is closer to the PPR than to the PSDB, but there are no insuperable problems between the platforms of the PFL and PSDB. Either road could easily be taken. [Tavares] Isn't there a point of conflict between the two parties, since part of the PSDB still favors some very statist ideas that go against the PFL ideology? [Bornhausen] In this case, I know the views of Minister Fernando Henrique, and they coincide with those of the PFL. [Tavares] Aren't you worried about this resistance within the PSDB? [Bornhausen] I think Minister Fernando Henrique has a position, and if he becomes the candidate, there is no reason for me to worry about some opposing minority views. [Tavares] You said the PFL still needs to reach a decision, internally. How much more time does the party need before it can take a position? [Bornhausen] I think we will decide within a month, at most, i.e., during the first half of April.
