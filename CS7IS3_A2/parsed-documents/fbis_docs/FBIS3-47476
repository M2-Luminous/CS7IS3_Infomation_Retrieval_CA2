The agreement is expected as early as January 17 when the Paris Club holds a meeting, the sources said. The Paris Club is an informal grouping of creditor nations which meet regularly in the French capital. Russia's official creditors so far have agreed to reschedule some 15 billion dollars of the country's foreign debt falling due last year for 10 years, with a five-year grace period for interest payments. They are also to defer Russian debt payments falling due in 1994 on condition that Russia and the International Monetary Fund agree on economic reforms needed for IMF loans. But a majority of Paris Club members now believe that a debt rescheduling deal for Russian debt payments falling due by April is needed unconditionally as a temporary measure because Russia faces slow progress in economic reforms due to political unrest, the sources said.
