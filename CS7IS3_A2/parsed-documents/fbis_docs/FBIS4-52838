Considered as having blackmailed the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and thus as having driven it out of the coalition, the party is now under heavy attack from its two supporting labor unions -- the Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] and the Yuai Council. Among party members there is now a growing sense of crisis that if a next general election is held under the current medium electoral district system, "the DSP will meet a catastrophe." It is becoming increasingly possible that the DSP party convention in June will become an arena where the party members go all-out demanding that Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa take responsibility. "How many party members can be elected without support from labor unions if the next election is held under the current medium electoral district system?" This question was asked at an emergency general meeting of DSP Dietmen held on 28 April when the Hata administration was inaugurated. A majority of party members argued, "Taking responsibility for causing the SPDJ to withdraw from the coalition, Chairman Keigo Ouchi and other party leaders should not take posts in the new cabinet." Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, put on the defensive, hurriedly called Ouchi to the meeting. The meeting was adjourned eventually after the matter was "left to the leadership" to decide. But the prevailing air is that this time things will not settle down easily by "letting the air out" as in the past. The DSP--which sent Ouchi (as the health and welfare minister) and Atushi Kanda (as director general of the Defense Agency) into the cabinet--initially sought to obtain three posts by also sending party Policy Board Chairman Kansei Nakano into the cabinet. A DSP source said that Ouchi had expected to land a post of the foreign minister or deputy prime minister in recognition of his "special constributions." A goal of the new floor group is said to be "to give strong support to the Hata administration" (according to Yonezawa). However, a ranking DSP official says, this in fact means "to take away the posts of the chairman of the [house] Budget Committee and the head of ruling parties' Tax System Reform Council from the SDPJ and to give them to people from the largest organization of the ruling parties. There was also the expectation that "if the new floor group is formed, the SDPJ will lose one ministerial post and the DSP will get it." In addition, Ouchi had a design of solidifying his base within his own party. Neither Ouchi nor Yonezawa had informed Rengo Chairman Akira Yamagishi and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo of this plan for the new floor group in advance because they were scared lest the plan, if exposed, should be crushed. As such, even the DSP members, who originally supported the plan, have misgivings about this "foul play" done on the SDPJ. A DSP Dietman of the House of Councilors said: "Once a politician betrays people, he is done with. The SDPJ might have agreed with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] on policy matters, but the former was an existence different from the latter in that sense." At the general meeting, the leadership persuaded members by saying: "To take responsibility, we should support the administration from within the cabinet. It is not a time for us to run away from problems." But many DSP members said: "The chairman and the secretary general used to have their way in controlling the party, but after 8 April when former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation, discontent erupted and the leadership no longer has power to control it." No doubt, the party leadership will have a tough time once the DSP Dietmen return from visits to their home towns during the national holidays [April 29-5 May].
