FR940804-2-00026 FR940804-2-00009 Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. Case History Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred. On February 4, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo provided the Department with the names of the firms producing SSB in Japan. To supplement this data, on February 7, 1994, counsel for respondents submitted volume and value statistics for eight Japanese companies. On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi), Daido Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido), and Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo). These firms accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On March 7, 1994, the Department met with company officials from Aichi, Daido and Sanyo at the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo. At this meeting each of the three named respondent companies stated that they did not intend to participate in our investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. On March 11, 1994, the Department received a request from an additional Japanese producer of SSB, Abe Bright Shaft Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Abe Bright), to be a voluntary respondent in this investigation. On March 11, 1994, we sent a questionnaire to Abe Bright. On April 4, 1994, Abe Bright submitted a letter withdrawing its request to participate as a voluntary respondent in this investigation. On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. ( See May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28, 1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15 (c) and (d). Best Information Available Because the three named respondents failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination on BIA pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act. As BIA, we are assigning 61.47 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (56 Fr 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, Slip Op. 94&hyph;1112 (June 30, 1994); and Allied Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); see also Krupp Stahl AG, et al. v. United States, 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.
