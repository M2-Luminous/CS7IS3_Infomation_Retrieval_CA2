Looking back at the literary world of 1993, amid the mishmash of discussions, one voice kept saying, the year of 1993 was flooded by waves of commercialism; the literary world was "unpoetic." Some critics said that behind the writers' frantic rush to get into the market were merchants deliberately playing up and at the same time obstructing the literary world. Thus the legacy of 1993 is a less-than-well-developed literary market in 1994. Others believe that "unpoetic" is a necessary loss. No matter what everybody is saying, no scholar can forget the emotions of 1993, even less can he or she stop mulling and pondering over and recalling and reviewing that year. I. Literature and Publication: A Romantic Dream Revisited Our research trailed behind; nobody predicted its arrival: Literature seems to be on the rise again. In taking big strides toward the market, scholars and writers have broken free from their self-love, self-pity, and their penchant to blame god and man--blame everyone but themselves, and they are actively and wholeheartedly joining hands with the publishers, who in turn have come to realize that perhaps literature is the cardiotonic that can save them. The popularity of Sao Tu is a very typical example. The author, Lao Cun [5071 2625], whose real name is Cai Tongkai [5591 6639 2818], is a middle-aged man living in Beijing without proper household registration. He was very poor. Many publishing houses' editors may have forgotten, but several years ago, a young writer from a village in Shaanxi Province was clutching his novel and knocking on doors, seeking help, but everybody ignored him, because there were many other young and middle-aged writers who were afflicted with the same "writer's syndrome." Cai Tongkai's lucky year was 1993. He was discovered--just like a movie star--by a book distributor. Sao Tu became the first Chinese novel to be published by the CHINESE LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE. Prior to that, the publisher was a part of the FOREIGN LANGUAGE PUBLISHING HOUSE. They took a chance with the book but owed its success to the management of a very capable distributor. Overnight, Sao Tu filled the main streets and the back alleys. Those in the business estimate that 60-70,000 copies have been printed. Sometimes the book is put alongside serious biographies in the book stalls, showing a new publication order for 1993. Lao Cun's life as a laborer is over. He said he wanted to be a full-time writer from now on. A fine example has boundless power. One set of books or even a single book can save a publishing house. At the end of 1993, book stalls were filled with literary smoke from big guns like Floating City [Fu Cheng] (by Liang Xiaosheng [2733 2556 5116]); Blue City [Lan Cheng] (SPRING BREEZE LITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE); Rainless City [Wuyu Zhicheng] (by Tie Ning [6993 0413]); Bitter World [Ku Jie] (by Hung Feng [3163 1496]); Naked Snow [Luo Xue] (by Cong Weixi [0654 4850 3556].) These books are everywhere; circulars are being handed out. Many works are by once-famous writers whom we have not heard from in a while. Here we cannot overlook the effects of the "invasion of the east by the Shaanxi army" on literature and publication in 1993. The "invasion" began early in the year and reached its peak in midsummer. People are beginning to refine their market choices. The development of the book market follows its own laws. Upon reaching saturation, all reading materials tend to show some inertia, and at that time anything that is new and vigorous will show vitality. That was how things took a turn for the better for literature in 1993. People with some education were fed up with seedy, pirated books and were losing their "appetite," because most reading materials had lost much of their spiritual content and there was nothing there to quench the readers' thirst. An ordinary worker-type young man bought a half-decent novel and said to his friends, "This stuff is pretty meaningless." In refining their tastes, people have also discovered that the market can be made and led. Works that are currently popular have made use of "packaging" to help them become a market success. If the successful "packaging" of the "invasion of the east by the Shaanxi army" had been unintentional, the massive advertisement and publicity of those that came later were deliberate. On 28 September of last year, writer Zhou Hong [0719 3163] signed a contract and "sold" himself to CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING HOUSE. That was the first time in decades a publisher "bought up" a writer and "packaged" him. It made quite a stir in media circles. It has been four months since he "sold" himself on a 3-year contract. What is the result of the market test? Both Zhou Hong and his publisher say that "it is very sweet," because the first set of books he sold after "selling himself," Sincere Advice on Life [Rensheng Zhonggao] was bought up by the Xinhua Bookstore for exclusive sales. Zhou Hong's top writer, Zhou Chengyi [0719 2429 5030], recently told this reporter that 110,000 copies of one book and 55,000 copies of two other books in the set had been printed. That made a total of 220,000 copies. In other words, CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING HOUSE never had to take any risk in this venture which was a first of its kind in China's publishing circles. It was a filling and comfortable meal. Didn't we say we wanted to get rid of the old publication system? Didn't we say we wanted to encourage the publishers to change from the production mode to the production-management mode? We cannot draw any conclusion yet. From the efficiency point of view, of course everything is perfect. Despite the ban on the buying and selling of book titles, and in the face of a general recession, the "purchase" of Zhou Hong has made money for the publisher and has made the writer rich too. Everybody is happy. But from the point of even higher expectations, what we have today is still the same old system, unless CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING HOUSE can come up with another new move or new gimmick this year. At the signing ceremony, a reporter asked how much Zhou Hong was getting. He never gave a straight answer, which led some people to wonder whether the publisher was paying him by the number of prints per book. That in essence would mean that Zhou was only "selling books" and that "selling himself" was but a publicity stunt to shock people. No matter what people say, the CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING HOUSE's buying and packaging of writers does have a positive effect on people out to explore China's best-seller mechanisms. Can literature be "sold" and writers be "bought"? Debates raged throughout 1993. What is gratifying is that while everybody "sat down to talk" it has not kept them from "taking action." From the literature point of view, Zhou Hong is not a pure literary writer and therefore cannot represent the pure literary writers in accepting the market's tests. Zhou Hong's work is but "cultural fast food," with young men taking part in division of labor. There is no need for strong artistic character, but their works meet a best-seller's need for general appeal. In exploring the beginning stage, doing the easy things first before tackling the tough problems is a wise move. What place does pure literature have in the market? The lesson was not dealt with in 1993. In Guangzhou, young critic Wang Gan [3769 1631] brought up the concept of "literature is not for sale." He said literary works are very susceptible to corruption by "commercialization" and therefore some people must escape from this humiliating "marriage" system. In the south where this concept was invented, price competition for manuscripts is raging like wildfire. Several large, so-called prima donna pure literary journals, such as SHIYUE, DANGDAI, SHOUHUO, HUACHENG, and ZHONGSHAN, are still tenaciously defending literature's spiritual fortress despite "repeated defeats," but not all of them are doing well. Some are selling as many as 100,000 copies while others are selling only a few thousand copies. At one time, there was news that SHOUHUO was in financial trouble and would not stay in business for long. Shanghai's writers were very much saddened. But SHIYUE's deputy editor-in-chief, Tian Zhenying [3944 3791 4481], said the magazine's subscription rate has actually gone up 3 percent. How do the readers choose what kind of pure literature they want? That indeed is a question for the experts to explore. II. "Suicide" or "Murder": A Writer's Choice Some critics have compared Zhou Hong's signing the contract to "sell" himself to a writer committing "suicide," killing his own artistry and ideal. They also compare writers who are being told what to do by middlemen to murder victims. There were many examples of this kind in 1993. "Suicide" and "murder" differ only in the way sales are being made. When it comes to choosing a marketing format, writers are showing more courage than ever before. The person most aggressive in trying new methods is Chen Jiangong [7115 1696 0501]. On 6 December last year, people noticed an eye-catching, front-page advertisement in BEIJING WANBAO: Buyer of TV or movie adaptation rights to Chen Jiangong's novelette Qian Ke sought. The company that planned this whole thing for Chen Jiangong and acted as his agent was Beijing's (?Aideer) Information and Consultation Company. Reportedly, this company handles public relations and provides investment and consultation services; it once sponsored the capital writers and reporters' "pen-exchanging" conference. Because the key managers of the company are former writers, it has kept close ties with those in literary circles. They want to take advantage of their speciality to launch a new business to act as middleman and agent for writers, scholars, and artists. Soliciting buyers for the adaptation right to Chen Jiangong's Qian Ke was a way to test the waters. This reporter recently visited the company and learned that a month has gone by and three buyers have entered the negotiation stage. Aideer [name as transliterated] Company will follow international practices and will get a percentage as commission in the deal. Following in Jiangong's footsteps is folk singer Hu Songhua [7579 2646 5478] who also has plans to work with Aideer. The company may become the agent for his made-for-TV art film, Changge Wanlihang. When the time comes, much will be done to package that product too. An Aideer [name as transliterated] Company manager told this reporter that writer's agents would have surfaced in China sooner or later. With the service of intermediaries or personal agents, the writers can rise above the interference of business matters, escape from their own impulses, and immerse themselves in their creative work. In fact, at the end of 1992, CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY had reported "the opening of the first press agency in the mainland." Xian's Chinese Book Agency Service Department hung up its shingle at the end of 1992. Its main business should have started in 1993, but unfortunately, the Shaanxi army had moved east: all the popular works had gone to Beijing. Reportedly the service department is a paid service organization set up by the Shaanxi Book Critic's Association. Its business scope includes recommending topics and print-worthy manuscripts to domestic and overseas publishers; soliciting contributions on behalf of publishing units; acting as agent for a specific work or on a retainer basis for writers at home and abroad; handling publication and distribution matters as requested by the writers. They make money mainly by charging the writers a 10-yuan handling fee plus 10-20 percent commission on the writer's remuneration for each book published. Shanghai has a writer's publishing agency too. Its business also includes finding enterprises to sponsor writers who have no money to get their books published. Everybody has also noticed the potential market for intermediaries who handle manuscripts. Their existence is premised upon the maturity of the cultural market. It has entered the minds of some literary writers of actual events to hire personal agents too. A certain top writer of a major newspaper is often besieged by manuscript seekers. He is totally confused about the names of newspapers and magazines, the different topics, and the deadlines for various manuscripts; he cannot remember who is who. In particular, a southern magazine once sent two woman editors on separate occasions. He cannot remember the name of the better-looking one. Meanwhile, another top writer has been working happily with a retired editor who is very conscientious and responsible and sends the writer's manuscripts in all directions so that every manuscript seeker gets what he wants. In effect the retired editor has become an agent. In addition to the need for agents, writers and scholars have discovered the importance of getting organized in order to keep up with the rhythm and the order of large industrial production. There are two approaches to getting organized: First, people who share the same goal use their names to create acronyms such as "Xue Mei Li" and "Zhou Hong"; in Wuhan, there is even a "Gong Bo Hou." At one time, Wuhan was considered the second channel in the wholesale gathering and distribution of books and magazines and often found itself unwilling to lag behind the bustling Beijing publishing circles. "Gong Bo Hou's" full-length book set The Devil [Mogui] ("Mogui Liansanjue," "Mogui Xiesantuan," "Mogui Nuerguo," and "Mogui Yehuchan") hit the market in October of last year. This reporter has learned that "Gong Bo Hou" had claimed that all of their work would be published exclusively by CHANGJIANG LITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE before October 1996. From the book titles, one can tell that they are targeting a different group of readers than those targeted by Zhou Hong and others. Another form of organization is the writer's bureau and creative center. In addition to the well-known "Haima," the Changan Movie and Television Script Writing Center in the northwest is another major movie and TV script-writing center today. Its building-block format is well-known to the public. The "Three Sisters" writer's bureau, known for its mastery in all areas from music, chess, literature, to painting has also added elegance and style to the 1993 literary world. Wang Fei [3769 5481] and his sisters are up-and-coming members of the capital's media circles. Reportedly, civilian-run bureaus comprising of famous writers have established themselves in Beijing and somewhere in Fujian. Their members include reporters and writers who can be commissioned to write books and manuscripts, biographies for enterprises and famous personages, and any other kind of writing. They remind us of the early kind of men-of-letter who wrote marriage contracts, land leases, and petitions and legal papers. But there has been no media report on how well these bureaus are faring. We had a huge contingent of writers and scholars last year. While some writers laid low, others were wildly popular. Cao Guilin [2580 2710 2651] was indeed a household name in 1993, but the media have disclosed the dark side of the writer's morals, and the public was bewildered. This article has no intention of getting entangled in what is true or false and has no intention of making moral judgments here. We are only interested in a trend in the 1993 literary world, and that is, how the successful ones were crowned kings while the defeated became bandits. People no longer care if there is a split between the writer's work and his character; they no longer care about the tempering and sublimation of the scholar's character. Is this corruption of the contingent of creative writers, or is this progress? As for the critics who lament that "we hear no ancient sage's cry in the wilderness," it is even more a case of the idealists putting unrealistic demands on the writers. The writers' loss of esteem is far less poetic than their "suicide" or "murder." People no longer cherish the title, "writer"; even the scholars are ashamed of themselves. III. A Virus in Publishing Circles: Piracy and Anti-Piracy Woman writer Tie Ning called her chief editor long-distance from Shejiazhuang telling him that just a month after her full-length novel, "Rainless City" hit the market, pirated copies were found in Shejiazhuang, Baoding, and other localities. Tie Ning angrily described the crude quality of the pirated copies which were full of mistakes. Her picture on the cover was ghastly. SPRING BREEZE LITERARY PULISHING HOUSE editor, An Boshun [1344 3134 5293], told this reporter, "This is totally unexpected." "Rainless City" was the second book marketed under the series Cloth Tiger [Bu Laohu]. It appeared that the pirated copies had gained a substantial market share. Pirated copies of the first book in the Cloth Tiger series, Bitter World (by Hung Feng), have also been spotted. On hearing the news of piracy everywhere, An Bochun is like someone whose home has just been burglarized. He is struggling in a "bitter world." "Publishers want their books to sell well. But hot-selling books are doomed to be victimized by piracy," said the chief editor. "A good book is not easy to come by. Our bureau worked very hard to come up with the Cloth Tiger series. We first tried to reach a consensus with 10 writers, and from selecting the topics to packaging and advertising the products and so on, we have put in a lot of work. We have even registered the name and logo, Cloth Tiger, as our trademark. Our intention was to create a famous name in publishing circles and use it to combat the seedy publications market. This was something nobody had ever done before in publishing circles. But pirates of books do not pay taxes; they do not pay for the manuscripts. All they put in is some money for the paper and ink. What they are after is huge profit." According to the editor, when Bitter World and Rainless City were still in the press, someone went to the printing shop to bribe a worker and went to the bureau to bribe the editor to try to get hold of a duplicate copy or sample. Someone even had the nerve to go straight to the editor's home and bargain with him: "Work with us and we will give you a cut of the profit. Other people pirate your books and you don't even get a penny; you won't even know who did it." It is learned that to track down the pirates, the news publishing department, the department of industry and commerce, and the public security department often must work together, and investigating cases across provincial, city, and regional boundaries is very difficult. Individual book dealers are a mysterious bunch; pirates are even harder to track down. They often use some small printing shops to reprint books illegally; they make a hit and clear out of the area immediately. The printing of pirated books often help revive the small, hard-pressed printers, and once the workers are paid their bonuses, local protectionism becomes an obstacle blocking any investigative effort. Even if the violators are apprehended, they are often fined and released. To them, the fine is nothing compared to the exorbitant profits they can make, but to the publishers, the human and material resources spent far exceed any compensation. This is one of the reasons the publishers feel helpless against piracy. Most book pirates are individual dealers; some are former editors who have left the publishing circles; a handful are members of publishing houses stealing from their own company. Of course if these people gang up, they can be a force to be reckoned with. The contingent of pirates is becoming increasingly specialized. They respond very quickly, assess the market accurately, and can anticipate the publishers' every move. It normally takes only a few days to pirate a book. They use deep discounts and high profit to squeeze the publishers out of the retail network. Those in the business estimate that for a relatively large law case of speculation and profiteering that generates 200,000 yuan in profit, one only needs to make 20,000 copies to earn back the money. Some book dealers say that they will not even bother with volumes of less than 100,000 copies. According to the editor of BEIJING PUBLISHING HOUSE, 11 different counterfeit versions of a best-seller they had published have been discovered; each version had at least 20,000 copies. Some books have been discontinued by the publishers, but they are still available in the market. Some pirates use camera-technique to make copies, and they look almost real. However, most copies are of very poor quality. A reader sent an angry letter to BEIJING PUBLISHING HOUSE because the book he bought was full of misprints and mistakes. He even sought 100,000 yuan in proofreading fee and threatened to go to the Consumer Protection Agency. The publisher was at a loss for words; they sent him an authentic copy to avoid the consequences. Recently this reporter obtained the latest news from the PARTY LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE that lawyers have been retained to take legal action against those who pirated Mao Mao's [3029 3029] My Father Deng Xiaoping. This probably is the most straight-forward legal case in publishing circles. The book's chief editor, Zhou Zhixing [0719 1807 5281], told this reporter that after My Father, Deng Xiaoping hit the market, pirated copies soon appeared in Chengdu, Wuhan, Changsha, Jinan and other cities. The Serious Warning put out by the PARTY LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE on the front page of XINWEN CHUBAN BAO on 8 November of last year pointed out that book pirating has ruined the reputation of the publisher and has hurt its profit and that the publisher has reserved the right to prosecute those engaging in piracy and seek compensation for economic losses. Awards were offered for leads, and anyone who could provide specific information on the case would be awarded 10,000 yuan by the publisher. Zhou Zhixing said the quality of the pirated copies was very poor, and erroneous wording has produced adverse political fallout. Currently, the piracy activities in Wuhan are being investigated by local relevant departments; most of the 10,000 copies uncovered so far have been turned into pulp. Pirating in Shandong is being investigated by the pertinent department there. Lawyers Zhang Yongyi [1728 3057 1355] and Cao Zhixin [2580 1807 2450] of Beijing's Dadi Law Firm have been retained by the PARTY LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE. Despite the increasingly rampant acts of piracy, the lawyers believe that the relevant laws and regulations governing the printing industry as promulgated by the state are detailed and specific, and if the industry would follow the state's laws and regulations strictly, they can cut off the crime of piracy at the first link. For example, when the pirates commission the printing job and when they pick up the books, they always pay cash; all necessary documents can be forged, and when one tries to find the person who commissioned the work, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If the printing shop would closely check the identity of the person commissioning the work, it would facilitate later investigations and in turn block the pirate's way out. When the editor of SPRING BREEZE LITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE heard the above news, he smiled sadly and said, "If they dare pirate that book, what wouldn't they steal?" As swords clash in the battle between piracy and anti-piracy, people can distinctly hear the jingling of pennies. The sound can be heard ringing loud and clear on many days throughout 1993. The loss of the sense of poetry is the loss of morality and the loss of order. The sense of poetry cannot be restored by artificial means or by sheer will. Society nevertheless is evolving toward civilization and wealth. The people's overall spiritual fatigue is but a transition; literature will eventually occupy a good place. We must remain calm and collected. Senior editor Tian Zhenying has enthusiastic praise for a group of young people. She told the reporter that 20-some young writers, including Liu Zhenyun [0491 7201 7189], Mo Yan [5459 6056], Chen Jiangong, Mu Guozheng [3018 0948 2398], Hua Shumin [5478 3219 2404], and Xu Mouqing [6079 6180 3237] are working with a publisher of pure literature on a trial basis to create a kind of "new experimental novels." Regardless of success or failure, their spirit is commendable. Despite the predicament pure literary publications are facing, these people are not laying blame nor complaining nor standing by doing nothing; instead they are stepping out to lend support to the publications and are trying diligently and seriously to accomplish something as they explore pure literary and artistic creations. It is most gratifying to find young people who are without sectarian biases and who are open-minded. Do the senior editor's words mean that after the shakeup in 1993, the literary world will become more mature? The beginning of the year is a time when people try to catch their breath. To find out what 1994 will be like, one must wait till spring.
