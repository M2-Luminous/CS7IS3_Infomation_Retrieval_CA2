From early morning farmers cut national Highway 12 near the town of Capiovy, some 130 kilometres from Posadas, on the road which links Misiones Province with the Brazilian border. The farmers, mostly yerba mate growers, are classed by the DGI Tax Bureau as being self-employed and are being pressed to pay pension arrears for the past 10 years. The poor farmers say that they have been severely hurt by the tax demands. The protesters, who had camped by the roadside, stooped traffic until a judge ordered the Border Guards to remove them. Three people were arrested and will be appearing in court on Tuesday. The farmers are demanding a fixed rather than market price for their crops.
