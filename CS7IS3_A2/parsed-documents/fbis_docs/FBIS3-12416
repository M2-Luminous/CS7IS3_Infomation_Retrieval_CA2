Israel accepted the President's invitation, but it is still not clear whether the Palestinians also accepted. The prime minister made these remarks to 70 ambassadors posted in Israel whom he summoned to his office in Tel Aviv in order to brief them about the Hebron incidents and the political situation. The prime minister called on the Palestinians to act like Israel and to totally separate between the Hebron incident and the continuation of the political process. Our correspondent Sheli Yehimovich reports the prime minister reiterated that as an Israeli, a Jew, and a human being, he is ashamed that an Israeli Jew perpetrated this massacre. He emphasized, however, that there is no proof that it was part of an organized action.
