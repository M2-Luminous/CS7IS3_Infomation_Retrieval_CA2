FR940803-1-00081 FR940803-1-00015 Larson et al. (1991) reported that there is no evidence that the species has been adversely affected by the commercial harvest of bait fish. The reported capture of predominantly large species (plains minnows) and the continued existence of the Arkansas River shiner in the South Canadian River, the drainage supporting the majority of the harvest, was the primary evidence used in arriving at this conclusion. Larson et al. (1991) suggested that slender-bodied fishes such as the Arkansas River shiner would constitute only a small percentage of the commercial harvest, assuming the commercial bait industry used large-mesh seines as the major mode of capture. However, other evidence indicates that the Arkansas River shiner, while perhaps not a highly sought commercial species, is being affected by the commercial bait industry. The rapid establishment of the Arkansas River shiner in the Pecos River, presumably from the release of bait fish, indicates that a large number of fish were released in a single event. Otherwise, if Arkansas River shiners occur only occasionally in the commercial harvest, several releases over a short period of time would be required to ensure that a large enough population existed to facilitate natural reproduction. In either instance, the evidence would indicate that shiners may occasionally occur in commercial catches in fairly large numbers. The capture of four individuals in the North Canadian River in 1990 also suggests that Arkansas River shiners are occasionally being harvested by commercial bait dealers. Lists of fish species reported captured by commercial bait dealers are not always accurate and likely fail to report the capture of Arkansas River shiners. Based on the large percentage of golden shiners ( Notemigonus crysoleucas ) reported captured by commercial bait dealers in 1989, Larson et al. (1991) believed the list to be suspect, since no locality was encountered in their collections where golden shiners comprised such a high proportion. In 1982, Peterson and Weeks (1983), stated that the river shiner ( Notropis blennius ) was the primary species harvested by commercial bait dealers in the seven river drainages for which they had data (South Canadian, North Canadian, Red, Salt Fork of Red, North Fork of Red, Salt Fork of Arkansas, and Cimarron rivers). However, the river shiner has not been recorded from the South Canadian, North Canadian, Salt Fork of Red, or North Fork of Red rivers (Miller and Robison 1973). Larson et al. (1991), in their survey for Arkansas River shiners, also did not report capturing a single river shiner from 128 sampling localities within the Arkansas River basin. Information provided by the commercial bait industry cannot reliably be used as evidence to suggest that commercial bait harvest is not impacting Arkansas River shiner populations. The sheer numbers of fish collected from the South Canadian River would imply that Arkansas River shiners could constitute a considerable percentage of the by-catch taken during commercial harvest. While there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that commercial harvest has contributed to the decline of the Arkansas River shiner, take of this species during commercial bait harvest may be significant and suggests that the effect of this factor warrants further investigation. C. Disease or predation. No studies have been conducted on the impact of disease or predation upon the Arkansas River shiner; therefore, the significance of these threats upon existing populations is unknown. There is no direct evidence to suggest that disease threatens the continued existence of the species. Disease is not likely to be a significant threat except under certain habitat conditions, such as crowding during periods of reduced flows, or episodes of poor water quality, such as low dissolved oxygen or elevated nutrient levels. During these events, stress reduces resistance to pathogens and disease outbreaks may occur. Parasites and bacterial and viral agents are generally the most common causes of mortality. Lesions caused by injuries, bacterial infections, and parasites often become the sites of secondary fungal infections.
