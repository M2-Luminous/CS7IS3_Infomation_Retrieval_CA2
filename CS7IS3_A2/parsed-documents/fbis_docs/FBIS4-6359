He said we have to respond to and correct the misunderstanding, otherwise it could damage Thailand. He said the Foreign Ministry and concerned agencies had been told to make clarifications on the matter. Asked whether it is time for Thailand to adjust its policy on Cambodia, the prime minister said Thailand's policy is to see peace in Cambodia. If there were no peace in Cambodia, Thailand's border areas would be plagued by the activities of Cambodian bandits. As for the current situation, the prime minister believed it was a result of a misunderstanding. Asked why the service of the joint Thai-Cambodian committee had not been used to settle the problem, the prime minister said there had been only an agreement to set up a joint committee. The prime minister however said we should not fall prey to the news media. He said that, instead of making charges, Cambodia should seek information from the Thai Foreign Ministry. It should ask Thailand to clarify the matter if there is any doubt about Thailand's behavior or if there is any impact on Cambodia coming from Thailand. Likewise, Thailand would seek information from Cambodia if it had any doubts about Cambodia. The prime minister said that Thailand must find out whether the report is correct and whether there was evidence substantiating the complaints made by Cambodian leaders. He said the foreign minister had been instructed to seek clarifications. Commenting on the same issue, Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit said there was no tension in relations between Thailand and Cambodia; relations remain good. He said there is no use getting angry with one another. He said words uttered by leaders of a country or government have great significance for international relations. One has to be careful when making statements because the country stands at risk of suffering damages. He said the army is unhappy with efforts by certain countries to create conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia. Besides, inaccurate news reports by the media will also have to be taken into account. The army chief said the Cambodian Government should seek clarifications from the Thai Government if it has doubts about Thailand's attitude instead of making accusations which are an insult to Thailand. He said the army cannot accept that. He stressed that the army will not support any faction, noting that the peace and happiness of the Thai people is most important. Thailand will resort to tougher measures if Cambodia's attitude remains unchanged and the two countries are unable to clear up the misunderstanding. Thailand might have to cut its assistance to Cambodia.
