Our correspondent interviewed Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. [Papp] The MDF has become quiet in the current period of the election campaign. Why? [Herenyi] I do not think or claim that the MDF has been pushed into the background; the focus of the election campaign has simply been moved somewhere else. Up until now, the MDF has been thinking in national terms, while we are now concentrating on local campaign tasks. [Papp] Does the performance of the 99 MDF candidates who are still in the contest have any import? [Herenyi] Naturally, very much is at stake in the second round. It will be decided here whether the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will form a coalition and whether the two parties will acquire two-thirds of the mandates. If the electors decide that the Socialists alone are to govern the country, then the specter of one-party governing will again emerge. On this basis, I can also say that if the MSZP and the SZDSZ together manage to form a two-thirds majority coalition, then the same tendencies may prevail that I have already mentioned. In my view, the best solution would be if the MSZP was not able to form a government on its own, and, even with the SZDSZ, its only possible coalition partner, they were not able to reach a two-thirds majority of mandates in parliament. [Papp] A deputy of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] announced that he would not adhere to the agreement signed by [MDF Chairman] Lajos Fur and [KDNP Chairman] Laszlo Surjan [on withdrawing some candidates in favor of the other in the second round]. Will the MDF continue to observe the agreement? [Herenyi] The MDF is naturally adhering to the former decisions. It has to be known that the MDF has more faith in the electors' wisdom than in ill-considered statements of certain politicians. People who place individual interests above all else do not meet the approval of the large masses of society. It is a fact that the individual view of one person cannot influence or change an agreement that was made between gentlemen. [Papp] Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP], has distanced himself from the MDF several times recently. What are your views on relations between the two parties? [Herenyi] In spite of Torgyan's various statements, we ask the voters who have national sentiments to strengthen the FKGP candidates' access to parliament in places where they are still in the contest in the second round of the election struggle.
