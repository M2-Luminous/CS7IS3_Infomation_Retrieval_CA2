He is not ruling out "any serious party." Nor does he want to indicate his preference. Yesterday, in a speech at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, he reproached his D66 colleague Van Mierlo for always emphatically having flirted with the "purple coalition," adopting the viewpoint that if the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] is stripped of its central power position, then "the whole face of the Netherlands will change." In response to the remarks made by Bolkestein, yesterday evening in Middelburg, D66 party leader Hans Van Mierlo said that he may be prepared to take the lead in forming a "purple" coalition including the D66, the VVD, and the PvdA. However, according to Van Mierlo, which party will have to adopt a leading role in this respect will depend on the outcome of the elections: "Three parties are involved in such a `purple' coalition. Furthermore, such an undertaking requires great wisdom and unanimity." [passage omitted]
