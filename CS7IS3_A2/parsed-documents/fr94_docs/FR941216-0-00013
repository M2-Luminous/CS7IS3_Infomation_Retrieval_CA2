FR941216-0-00013 FR941216-0-00004 Section-by-Section Analysis Section 172.3␣Definitions This section amends the definition of engineering and design services to reflect the wording used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A) and adds a definition of private sector engineering and design firms. One professional organization requested that the definition of engineering and design services be modified to cite the statutory definition of ``architectural and engineering services'' in 40 U.S.C. 541, as amended. Two State highway agencies requested that the definition specifically include ``environmental studies'' and ``construction engineering.'' These requests were not adopted in the final regulation as the modifications were not considered warranted or necessary. The FHWA has retained the revised definition of engineering and design services as proposed in the NPRM; this definition includes the contracted services as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A), and environmental studies and construction engineering would be permitted under this definition. The definition is intentionally broad and is not intended to list every specific assignment for which States may choose to contract with private sector firms for engineering and design services. A technical correction is made to the definition to replace the word ``and'' with the word ``or'' before the phrase ``architectural related services'' so that the definition reads the same as 23 U.S.C 112(b)(2)(A). Section 172.21␣Purpose and Applicability This section defines the purpose and applicability of subpart B, which implements the private sector involvement program and is applicable to all States using Federal-aid highway funds. One professional organization suggested that this section be expanded to include a policy statement consistent with the policy in OMB Circular A&hyph;76 and Section 306 of the Federal-aid Highway Act of 1958 (Pub. L 85&hyph;381, 72 Stat. 89) to require States to utilize the private sector for services such as surveying and photogrammetric mapping services, whenever practicable. The proposed change is not necessary and FHWA did not include the suggested policy statement because the intent of the private sector program is to encourage States to use private sector firms for engineering and design services which by definition include mapping and surveying services. In a second comment, relating to paragraph (b) of §172.21, the same professional organization suggested revising the applicability of the rule to include ``all engineering and design services contracts financed with Federal-aid highway funds or other non-Federal resources.'' We agree. For purposes of soliciting applicants and selecting States to receive allocations, the rule described in §172.23 allows applicants to supplement the information on the extent consultant services have been used on Federal-aid highway projects with the same information on non-federally funded consultant contracted services on projects ultimately to be built with Federal-aid highway funds. Section 172.23 is retained as shown in the proposed rule since the mandate of the program in the legislation is to encourage contracting with private firms ``in carrying out Federal-aid highway projects.'' Section 172.23 Evaluation and Selection This section outlines the procedures and criteria that would be used in the evaluation of State engineering and design programs for the purpose of allocating funds under the new private sector involvement program. Comments on the procedures and criteria to be used in the annual evaluation and selection of not less than three States to receive allocations under the private sector involvement program were received from five State highway agencies, two professional organizations, and seven private sector firms. One professional organization referenced a study in the ``Professional Services Management Journal'' which indicates that the ``percent of engineering contracted out'' was the only variable that correlated with the effectiveness of a State's program of using consultants. Three States suggested that improvements resulting from new, ambitious, non-traditional, and innovative practices which increased the use of consultant programs should be given weight in the selection process. Two States suggested that the size of a State's highway program should be considered in the evaluation of applications. Another State suggested that a State's past commitments to increasing the use of consultants should be considered. Most States supported the inclusion of State and local agency funding information to give a full picture of the use of consultants in all States. One professional organization suggested that several evaluation factors, such as quality, cost effectiveness, liability, and consultant selection process, be considered rather than the percentage of work contracted out to consultants. We have concluded that the intent of the program is to encourage the use of private sector firms. The FHWA recognizes that most States have not established a specific formal program to encourage the use of consultants, but may nevertheless have been effective in obtaining increased use of private sector firms. Recognizing the different decisionmaking processes used by SHA's, the evaluation process adopted for the private sector program will use as its primary basis of measurement, in determining which States have the most effective program for increasing the percentage of funds expended for contracting with private firms, the results of a comparison of all States' programs for the preceding year and the year-to-year results of each State's program for the preceding five years. The evaluation will focus on results rather than an evaluation of individual programs or processes. A State process or program that encourages the use of private sector firms would be consistent with the intent of this program; however, the FHWA is not in a position to objectively evaluate and compare different State approaches. Instead, the FHWA agrees with the suggestion that the evaluation process be confined to verifiable measures consistent with the intent of the program. The procedures will primarily consider the relative size of the State's highway program and the extent to which the State has contracted for private sector services in the preceding year and in the preceding five years, but will also consider any information which describes State efforts to encourage the use of private sector firms.
