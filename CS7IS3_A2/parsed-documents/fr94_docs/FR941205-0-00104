FR941205-0-00104 FR941205-0-00024 80. We also note that cable operators believe that broadcasters have an advantage in the negotiations for retransmission agreements due to their ability to assert their exclusivity rights, while broadcasters believe the reverse. Local broadcast stations are an important part of the service that cable operators offer and broadcasters rely on cable as a means to distribute their signals. Thus, we believe that there are incentives for both parties to come to mutually beneficial arrangements. Moreover, the allegations that local stations electing retransmission consent would not be carried due to their inability to successfully negotiate agreements with cable operators and then assert their exclusivity rights and deprive subscribers of programming was speculative at the time the reconsideration petitions were filed. Now that the retransmission consent provisions are in effect, there is no evidence that subscribers are being deprived of network programming. We note that there are only limited situations where local stations are not carried. Therefore, the dire consequences predicted do not exist and we continue to believe that stations should receive the exclusivity protection to which they are entitled. IV.
