Not, that is, unless the law is revised so that the 49 percent limit on foreign ownership of securities firms is lifted. Some Thai brokers point out that even Thai companies face restrictions in share trading because of limits on licences issued for stock market members. Sa-ngad Sataphattana, Baring Research's director, does not see full broker status for foreign companies in the next couple of years because, not only foreign firms, but also securities companies in the country cannot easily get brokerage licences. There are 40 full brokers in Thailand, while a bigger number are subbrokers which have been coveted to gain broker status. [as published] The Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] recently announced that it would grant another four broker licences to sub-brokers. The new brokers will be chosen from sub-brokers which have a good track record. "Whether or not the securities business will be opened to foreign countries depends on the readiness of securities houses in Thailand and the securities market size of the country," said Mr Sa-ngad. He added that few local brokers were in a position to compete with foreign firms. The development of the Thai capital market is not sufficient to cope with the entry of foreign securities firms. "Thailand has only one secondary market for stock trading. An over-the-counter market has not been established yet. Debt instruments, which lack liquidity, are at the fledgling stage," said Mr Sa-ngad. He said US securities firms did not have a commitment in Thailand's market. The demand by the US Treasury Secretary for the liberalisation of the securities business is only aimed at paving the way for the entry of US firms in the future. "The US securities business in Thailand is tiny when compared to that of European countries. Normally, US securities firms will send a team to handle big underwriting deals in Thailand, such as the recent underwriting of Bangkok Bank's debt instruments by Morgan Stanley," said Mr Sa-ngad. Seri Chintanaseri, the Stock Exchange of Thailand's president, who met with Mr Bentsen yesterday morning, said the US Treasury Secretary did not discuss anything about the possibility of foreign firms operating securities businesses in Thailand. Mr Seri said Mr Bentsen just wanted information about the SET index, listed companies and member companies of the SET and its computer trading system. Whether or not local securities firms are ready to compete with foreign companies, Mr Seri said, is a matter for the Government to decide in consultation with the SET. He said the liberalisation of the securities industry would have to be harmonised with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Rapi Sucharitkun, the Securities and Exchange Commission's spokesman, said Thailand had to revise regulations to liberalise the securities industry. "The maximum limit on foreign holdings in securities firm in Thailand is 49 percent. The limit has to be boosted to enable foreigners to be major shareholders before seeking broker seats," noted Mr Rapi who added that this would take a long time. A source at the Finance Ministry said the ministry was studying ways to liberalise the country's financial industry, including the securities business. "The possibility of securities liberalisation is still far away. But the US may apply pressure to liberalise financial services at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which will have a (finance ministers') meeting in March," said the source who added that most ASEAN countries did not want to open their financial markets to the US.
