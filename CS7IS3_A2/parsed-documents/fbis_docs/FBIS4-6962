The resignation paves the way for the election of Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 58, as his successor in the Diet on Monday afternoon and formation of a second coalition government. Hata is assured of winning the Diet vote for prime minister due to the coalition's majority in both houses. Hosokawa and his 20 cabinet ministers tendered their resignations in an emergency cabinet meeting that convened at 10 AM [0100 GMT]. The cabinet disbandment followed Friday's agreement among coalition parties to push Hata as a successor to Hosokawa. The Hosokawa administration turned out to be the sixth short- lived one in post-World War II Japanese political history after the cabinet of Kijuro Shidehara, who held power for 226 days in 1945 and 1946. Hosokawa, 56, leader of the Japan New Party, took office on August 6 last year as the first prime minister from outside the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its majority in the House of Representatives in the general election the previous month after a series of political scandals hit the LDP. He described his seven-party coalition administration as a "political reform government." In pursuing his avowed goal of cleaning up Japan's so-called "money politics," Hosokawa pushed a package of electoral and political reform bills through the Diet in January, which replaced multiseat districts in the lower chamber with a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Ironically, Hosokawa himself fell from grace after he came under fire over allegations that he had raised funds in dubious ways via a 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group in 1982 and purchase of shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). Hosokawa said that he repaid the 100 million yen loan and dismissed any corruption charges over the NTT share purchase, which he stated was conducted by his late father-in-law. A previous scandal surrounding Sagawa Kyubin helped topple the LDP from power, paving the way for Hosokawa's alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional opposition parties such as the Social Democratic Party to sweep to power. Hosokawa's public support ratings, higher than 70 percent immediately after he took office last August, plunged in recent weeks to sag below the 50 percent line in recent media polls. On April 8, he made his bombshell resignation announcement, citing "new suspicions" over his personal finances as a major reason for his decision to give up the premiership and said he would take "moral responsibility." Namio Yatsuka, an aide to Hosokawa, told reporters last Friday that the premier failed to report to tax authorities personal income of 29 million yen from stock and bond investments during a 10-year period from 1981.
