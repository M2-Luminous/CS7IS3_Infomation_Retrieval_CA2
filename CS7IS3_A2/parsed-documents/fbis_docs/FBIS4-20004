Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi and his aides discussed the matter at a meeting today and next week will also draft administrative matters. The protection of Italian farm products both at home and on European markets means defending job levels in Italy, according to Forza Italia spokesman Antonio Tajani. He claimed that production in this important sector of the economy has been buffeted, above all, by an invasion of South American farm products.
