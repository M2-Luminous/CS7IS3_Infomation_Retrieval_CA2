Food products in cities of the Northern Caucasus and Eastern Siberia experienced the greatest price increases (2.7-3.1 percent), while virtually no change was seen in food product prices in cities of Western Siberia, the Urals, and Central Chernozem. The rate of growth of prices for nonfood products was 3.1 percent, for services--3.5 percent. The following table shows price indexes for goods and services in the consumer market (as a percentage of the previous date): 28 Feb 5 Mar 15 Mar Average Average daily daily price price growth in growth in February March Consumer 101.5 101.7 102.4 0.27 0.34 goods and services including: Food products 101.2 101.5 101.7 0.23 0.32 Nonfood 101.9 101.5 103.1 0.32 0.34 products Paid services 101.7 104.8 103.5 0.54 0.48 to the populace Over the first 15 days of March, prices for goods and services increased by 4.1 percent (since the beginning of the year--by 38.4 percent), including the prices of food products--by 3.2 percent (36.7 percent), nonfood products--by 4.7 percent (29.5 percent), and services to the populace--by 8.5 percent (2.2-fold). Foodstuffs. Over the period 5 through 15 March, the rate of price increase in organized and nonorganized trade was 1.6 percent and 1.8 percent. The following table shows the change in prices for the main product groups: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Percentage of level for previous observation date | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Total |Organized trade o-|Nonorganized trad-| | | |nly |e only | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All food products |101.7 |101.6 |101.8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Meat and meat pro-|101.7 |101.6 |101.9 | |ducts | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fish and fish pro-|103.3 |103.4 |98.5 | |ducts | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Milk and dairy pr-|103.2 |103.5 |101.3 | |oducts | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Eggs |99.5 |99.3 |101.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sugar |99.8 |99.8 |99.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bread and bakery |101.7 |101.7 |- | |products | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cereal and macaro-|103.0 |103.1 |101.6 | |ni products | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vodka |99.3 |99.3 |100.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Potatoes and vege-|105.3 |106.1 |104.3 | |tables | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- In organized trade from 5 through 15 March, frozen fish, milk and dairy products, and certain varieties of cereal and macaroni products increased 3-5 percent in price; salt, fresh cabbage, and carrots increased 6-8 percent. Prices for vegetable oil, meat products, and sugar stood virtually unchanged. In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the largest increase in prices was recorded for vegetables and fowl (4-9 percent). Prices for dairy products virtually remained at their previous level. The average price of oranges dropped 4 percent. The cost of a selection of 19 basic food products rose 1.8 percent over the week, amounting to 43,000 rubles [R] per month as of 15 March. The differentiation factor between observed cities was 3.6. St. Petersburg and Moscow rank 35th and 36th out of 132 observed cities with respect to cost of the selection (R47,020 and R46,960 per month). Nonfood products. Over the period 5 through 15 March, the greatest price increases were observed for fabrics and medicinal preparations (4.7-6.2 percent), and garments and knitted articles (2.8-3.4 percent). Prices for footwear rose 1.8 percent, tobacco products--1.6 percent. Paid services to the populace. During the period of observation, the trend towards galloping rates for municipal and domestic services continued. Payment per square meter of municipal living space and for hot water rose by 34 percent on the average across Russia. A manyfold increase was seen in the level of payment in Vorkuta, Ukhta, Norilsk, Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, Kamyshin, and Voronezh. Rates increased 5-8 percent for certain varieties of everyday services (shoe repair, barber services, baths, and a number of other services). Costs of Producers of Industrial Production Output The index of wholesale prices for producers of industrial output was lower in February than in January, amounting to 116 percent. Prices increased 37 percent over the first two months of this year (as compared with December 1993). The following table characterizes changes in wholesale prices in February for sectors of industry: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |February 1994 as compare-|February 1994 as compare-| | |d with January 1994, per-|d with December 1993, pe-| | |cent |rcent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry, total |116 |137 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Electric power |116 |143 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fuel industry |122 |152 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ferrous metallurgy |112 |121 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nonferrous metallurgy |111 |125 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical industry |113 |141 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Petrochemical industry |118 |136 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Machine building |117 |141 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Timber, woodworking, and |113 |136 | |pulp and paper industry | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Building materials indus-|116 |140 | |try | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Light industry |116 |130 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Food industry |112 |128 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rate of growth of prices was lower in February than in January in practically all sectors of industry (except in ferrous metallurgy, the petrochemical industry, and light industry). At the same time, high rates of price growth were continued for fuel industry output. Prices for oil increased 28 percent in February, natural gas--24 percent, oil products--19 percent, and coal--9 percent. As of 28 February, the average price of coal was R13,000 per tonne, oil--R52,000, gas--R3,200 per thousand cubic meters, gasoline--R143,000, and diesel fuel--R132,000 per tonne. The increased prices for energy resources and their byproducts continued to exert an influence on the cost of electric power. Electric power rates increased 1.3-1.4-fold over the January-February period. As of 28 February, the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electric power came to about R25 on the average for all categories of consumers. In the machine-building sectors in February, the most significant price increases were observed in the output of tractor and agricultural machine-building (by 41 percent on the average), railroad, mining, and ore-mining machine-building (by 27 percent), and the bearing and bushing industry (by 29 percent). The price index was 116 percent for light industry--4 percentage points higher than in January, primarily due to the large price increases for cotton and flax fabrics, rugs and carpets, leather goods, sportswear, and certain other items. The price increase for food industry output in February was 12 percent (15 percent in January). The price rise was within the limits of 10-15 percent for basic food products--bread and bakery products, meat products, fats and oils; 18-20 percent for dairy products and butter. No change was observed in the prices of sugar and certain varieties of canned fruits and vegetables. On the whole, the increase in prices was lower for consumer goods over the two months than for technical production output. These indexes were 28 and 40 percent, respectively. Acquisition costs. The increase in costs, February over January, for basic varieties of material-technical resources acquired by industrial enterprises was 13 percent, including 12 percent--from suppliers in Russia, 22 percent--from CIS member states, and 16 percent--from countries of the far abroad. Over the first two months of this year, prices for the material-technical resources acquired by industry increased 34 percent. Costs for the acquisition of fuel resources rose by 13 percent over the month, including for oil--by 19 percent, natural gas--by 14 percent, furnace fuel oil and diesel fuel--by 15-18 percent. Enterprises of the oil processing industry procured oil at the price of R80,000 per tonne on the average in February (production cost--R52,000). The cost of natural gas used in the electric power industry came to R32,000 per thousand cubic meters on the average (production cost--R3,200); the average cost of energy-producing coal was R19,000, and coking coal--R50,000 per tonne, while the production cost of coal was R13,000. The price index for sale of livestock production output by procurement organizations in February of this year was lower than the January level and amounted to 112 percent. The average price (not taking subsidies into account) of one kilogram of livestock and fowl (live weight) in Russia was R773; a liter of milk--R145; 10 eggs--R688. Prices increased 29 percent over the two months (as compared to December 1993). The seasonal reduction in milk purchases was followed by a high rate of price increase with respect to milk sales in January-February (16-18 percent). Prices for livestock, fowl, and eggs increased 9-10 percent in February. Costs for the producers of agricultural output rose 10 percent in February, 28 percent--since the beginning of the year. This includes an increase of 27-38 percent for machinery and equipment used in plant-growing and livestock-breeding, trucks, and mixed fodders, and an increase of 46-51 percent for mineral fertilizers and electric power. Costs in capital construction. Actual costs for capital investments rose 17 percent in February of this year over the previous month's levels; for construction and installation work--12 percent. The increases over levels of December of last year were 46 and 50 percent, respectively. The rise in cost of building materials was more significant. Over the month, prices for materials acquired by contractor construction organizations increased by 26 percent. The increase was 51 percent since the beginning of the year. The costs of enterprises that produce building materials increased by 16 and 40 percent, respectively. The following table shows price indexes for the acquisition of main groupings of building materials: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |February 1994 as compare-|February 1994 as compare-| | |d with January 1994, per-|d with December 1993, pe-| | |cent |rcent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction brick |145 |198 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crushed stone and gravel |145 |194 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cement |154 |201 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ceramic tile |122 |172 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Linoleum |138 |178 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Window glass |126 |139 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Paints and varnishes |140 |161 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One of the basic reasons for the galloping price increases in acquisition of certain varieties of materials is the swift rise in cost of transportation, supply, and sales services. In February of this year, their share came to 14 percent of the acquisition costs on the average for basic types of materials, for crushed stone and gravel--about 50 percent; their share of the acquisition costs for cement, asphalt-concrete mix, asbestos-cement sheeting, and construction brick was over 15 percent. Industrial Production Over the first 13 days of March 1994, of 163 production varieties taken into consideration for periodic reporting, the average daily production volume as compared with the same period of March 1993: --increased for 16 entries, or 10 percent of the total (including city telephone network cable, polypropylene, movie film, magnetic tape, cotton fabrics, knitting machines, school notebooks, pencils, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, toilet soap, filter and nonfilter cigarettes, and shaving cream); --decreased for 142 entries, or 87 percent of the total. As compared to the same period of February 1994, this average daily production volume: --increased for 54 entries, or 33 percent of the total (including electric power, motor vehicle gasoline, diesel fuel, cast iron, steel, finished rolled metal, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizers, soda ash, synthetic ammonia, wheeled cranes, automobiles, tractors, sawn lumber, cardboard, slate, asbestos-cement pipes, sleeves, and joints, video cassette recorders, color televisions, knitting machines, cameras, motorcycles, flax, hemp, and jute fabrics, raincoats, footwear, butter, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, canned meats and milk, confectionery items, salt, food concentrates, and mineral water); --decreased for 104 entries, or 64 percent of the total. Proceeding from the dynamics of output of the most important production varieties, the average daily volume of industrial production for the period of March 1994 which transpired is estimated to comprise 73 percent of the level for the same period of March of last year. The following table shows data characterizing the output of the most important industrial production varieties for the first 13 days of March 1994: Output for Expressed as Expressed as the first 13 percentage of percentage of days of the same period same period in March 1994 in March 1993 February 1994 (average daily (average daily production) production) Electric power 37.1 98 100.3 produced by general-purpose electric power plants--billions of kilowatt-hours Oil, including gas 10.3 84 98 condensate, millions of tonnes Natural gas, billions 23.7 99.0 99.0 of cubic meters Coal, millions of 9.3 85 91 tonnes Steel, millions of 1.5 73 103 tonnes Finished rolled metal, 1.2 75 107 including stock procured for export, millions of tonnes Steel pipe, tonnes 98,200 45 76 Major electrical 55 58 73 machinery, number of items Metal-cutting machine 131 29 80 tools, number Trucks, number 8,300 39 160 Automobiles, number 28,900 86 119 Tractors, number 688 15 3.8-fold Chemical fibers and 6,500 45 102 filaments, tonnes Mineral fertilizers 231,000 74 102 (converted to 100-percent nutritive substance), tonnes Motor vehicle tires 641,000 48 86 for agricultural machinery, motorcycles, and motor scooters, number Commercial timber, 2.4 59 98 millions of cubic meters dense Sawn lumber, cubic 360,000 66 112 meters Paper, tonnes 74,300 62 96 Cement, millions of 1.0 69 100.2 tonnes Slate, millions of 46.1 35 115 conventional tiles Construction brick, 267 72 94 millions of conventional bricks Soft roofing and 8.2 40 73 insulation material, millions of square meters Fabric, total, 75.6 74 86 millions of square meters Socks and hosiery, 9.8 63 84 million pair Knitted wear, millions 5.5 62 81 of articles Footwear, million pair 1.5 37 100.4 Television sets, units 75,900 72 95 Radios, units 16,000 25 83 Refrigerators and 70,300 71 74 freezers, units Electric vacuum 17,500 19 63 cleaners, units Washing machines, 48,200 48 93 units Meat, including 47,600 64 93 group-1 by-products, tonnes Whole milk output, 217,000 80 99.0 converted to milk, tonnes Butter, tonnes 9,700 65 118 Granulated sugar, 26,700 31 75 total, including that processed from customer-supplied raw material, tonnes During the first half of March 1994, there was no production of tower cranes of eight-tonne capacity and greater, forage harvesters, grain or flax harvesting combines, or main electric locomotives. Agriculture Preparations for the spring sowing. Due to insufficient sowing of winter crops, adverse wintering conditions, and reduced autumn plowing, the volume of field work to be accomplished this spring is great. Winter crops for this year's yield were sown over an area of 15.5 million hectares (20 percent less than last year), including 14.3 million hectares (20 percent) for grain. According to data from the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, the condition of winter crops on the whole across the Russian Federation can be expected to be unsatisfactory over an area of 2.0-2.5 million hectares, or 13-16 percent of the total area of winter grains and green forage, as opposed to 1.9 million hectares (9 percent) on the average for the past five years. Autumn plowing was accomplished over 41.9 million hectares--6.2 million (13 percent) less than in the fall of 1992. The degree of provision of farms with seeds of spring grain crops is somewhat worse in general than last year (especially with respect to buckwheat, rice, and legumes). In January-February 1994, agricultural clients were supplied 0.9 million tonnes of lime-containing materials (55 percent less than during the same period last year), 0.4 million tonnes of motor vehicle gasoline (49 percent less), 0.8 million tonnes of diesel fuel (52 percent less), and 10.3 million tonnes of peat (56 percent less). In February of this year, dispatch of fuel proceeded more intensively than in January: Shipped in Expressed as Shipped Expressed Expressed January-February percentage of in as as 1994, millions of January-February February percentage percentage tonnes 1993 level alone, of February of January millions 1993 level 1994 level of tonnes Lime-containing 0.9 45 0.4 37 86 materials, total Peat export 10.3 44 4.7 36 86 Motor vehicle 0.4 51 0.2 51 109 gasoline Diesel fuel 0.8 48 0.4 48 117 A 1.9-fold increase, on the average, is being seen over last year's level in volume of oil products purchased by farms through direct ties. However, the share of total sale volume attributable to free sales remains low (8-9 percent). Supplies of oil products as of the beginning of March were significantly lower than last year's levels: On hand as of 1 March, tonnes As of 1 February (for reference) 1992 1993 1994 1994 1994 percentage percentage of 1993 of 1993 Diesel 1.389 916,000 451,000 49 52 fuel million Gasoline 390,000 405,000 239,000 59 61 Equipment repair this year lags behind the results of previous years. As of the beginning of March of this year, approximately one-fourth of the tractors, trucks, and soil-tilling and sowing equipment available were in a state of disrepair.

In January-February of this year, the sales volume of slaughtered livestock and poultry in all categories of farms was estimated to be 12 percent less than the volume for January-February of last year; production of milk was 10 percent less, eggs--6 percent less. Livestock production output at personal farmsteads remained at the levels produced during the same period of last year. The following table shows the dynamics of production volumes at agricultural enterprises in January-February: 1992 1993 1994 Volume sold of 1.216 million 1.054 million 866,000 livestock and poultry for slaughter, live weight, tonnes As percentage of 77 87 82 previous year Gross milk yield, 4.165 million 3.532 million 2.994 million tonnes As percentage of 82 85 85 previous year Output of eggs, 5.425 billion 4.830 billion 4.546 billion number As percentage of 94 89 94 previous year Numbers of cattle as of 1 March 1994 decreased by 7 percent, according to estimates, from the level of 1 March 1993 at the farms of all producers; of pigs--by 9 percent; of sheep and goats--by 13 percent. The decrease observed in numbers of livestock is attributable primarily to agricultural enterprises, where 60-70 percent of all livestock is concentrated. 1 January 94 1 February 94 1 March 94 1 March 93 percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of 1 January 93 1 February 93 1 March 93 1 March 92 (for reference) Cattle 89 89 89 89 Cows 94 93 93 91 Pigs 87 87 88 83 Sheep and 79 78 77 84 goats The extent of provision of livestock with feed was somewhat greater than last year's level on the whole for farms in Russia. Remaining fodder per standard head of livestock amounted 8.2 feed-unit quintals on average at the beginning of March of this year, as opposed to 7.5 feed-unit quintals as of this time last year. In January-February of this year, procurement organizations effected purchases for state resources, from all producers, a volume of livestock and poultry 28 percent less than during the same period last year, milk--21 percent less, and eggs--6 percent less. In this regard, agricultural enterprises increased their sales of livestock production at markets, through their own stores, through the public kitchen system, and through other channels. In all over the two-month period, these enterprises sold 13 percent of the total sales volume of livestock and poultry outside the state procurement network, 4 percent of the milk, and 7 percent of the eggs. Sold to the state Sold to the state Sold to the state Sold in in in in addition by January-February January-February January-February agricultural 1992, tonnes 1993, tonnes 1994, tonnes enterprises outside the state procurement network in 1994, tonnes Livestock 1.096 million 925,000 666,000 104,000 and poultry, live weight Percentage 73 85 72 167 of previous year Milk 3.049 million 2.564 million 2.018 million 79,000 Percentage 72 84 79 173 of previous year Eggs 4.001 billion 3.768 billion 3.529 billion 267,000 Percentage 81 96 94 of previous year Sale of fruits and vegetables. Sales of hotbed- and greenhouse-grown vegetables through all channels in January-February of this year decreased almost three-fold from last year's levels, including a 2.5-fold decrease in sales of cucumbers, and 3.4-fold decrease in sales of green vegetables. The share of total sales attributable to state purchases remained virtually unchanged from last year, amounting to about 85 percent. Income of the Populace The income of the populace in January-February of this year amounted to R32.4 trillion, a 9.2-fold increase over the same period last year. In February of this year, available monetary income of the populace (income after mandatory payments and fees were made) increased 9.1-fold over the February 1993 level. The cost of goods and services increased approximately 8-fold. Real monetary income at the disposal of the populace was 13 percent higher this month than one year ago (in January it was 7 percent higher). The following table provides data on the distribution by population segment of monetary per capita income: January January February February 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, millions of percentage millions of percentage individuals individuals Total 148.4 100 148.4 100 including those with monthly per capita income, in rubles: Up to 20,000 6.0 4.0 0.7 0.4 20,100-40,000 28.2 19.0 8.7 5.9 40,100-60,000 31.5 21.2 19.0 12.8 60,100-80,000 24.8 16.7 22.6 15.2 80,100-100,000 17.7 11.9 21.2 14.3 100,100-120,000 12.3 8.3 17.9 12.1 120,100-140,000 8.5 5.7 14.4 9.7 140,100-160,000 6.0 4.0 11.3 7.6 160,100-180,000 4.1 2.8 8.7 5.9 180,100-200,000 2.9 2.0 6.7 4.5 200,100-220,000 2.1 1.4 5.2 3.5 220,100-240,000 1.5 1.0 4.0 2.7 240,100-260,000 1.1 0.8 3.0 2.1 260,100-280,000 0.9 0.6 2.4 1.6 280,100-300,000 0.6 0.4 1.8 1.2 Over 300,000 0.2 0.2 0.8 0.5 In February 1994, the uppermost 20 percent of the populace had at its disposal 40 percent of all monetary income; the lowest 20 percent--only 7 percent (comparable figures for February 1993--20 and 8 percent, respectively; for July 1993--37 and 7 percent; for December 1993--39 and 6 percent). The coefficient of income concentration (Gini coefficient) in February 1994 was 0.301 (in January--0.343). Values of the subsistence minimum for the Russian Federation populace (determined in accordance with Russian Ministry of Labor methodology) are as follows: Average monthly per capita figure, rubles Entire Working Pensioners Children population population October 1993 32,400 36,600 22,800 32,400 November 37,900 42,800 26,700 37,900 1993 December 42,800 48,400 30,200 42,800 1993 January 1994 51,400 58,000 36,200 51,300 February 56,600 63,700 39,900 56,900 1994 Monetary income for a portion of the population was even lower than the cost of the food product selection taken into account when calculating the subsistence minimum. This segment includes families with many children, single-parent families with children, families with a large proportion of dependents in which those employed are receiving close to minimum wage, single pensioners and invalids.

The amount of pension equalization was increased. As a result, there was a significant decrease from the January level in the numbers and percentages of the population with disposal incomes lower than the subsistence minimum. In January 1993, the proportion of the population with monetary income lower than the subsistence minimum was 35.5 percent; in February 1993 it was 27.2 percent. According to estimates, the average wage accrued by employees in February was R150,000, an increase of 6 percent over December 1993.
