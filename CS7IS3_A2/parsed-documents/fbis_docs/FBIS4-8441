The first topic Havel proposes is the question of cooperation in Central Europe, the definition of the Central European space and the discussion of its character and prospects. The second is the context of Central Europe in Europe itself. Theme three, Havel said, is Russia and the Balkans, because every discussion of Europe has to include these regions. Lastly, the present state of Europe, its problems, tasks, the dangers it faces and the prospects of its integration. The main significance of the event, however, will be the opportunity it presents for informal discussions, during which differences of opinion need not be harmful, he said. The six presidents Havel will be playing host to are from Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and Germany. Although Germany has only got "one foot" in Central Europe, as Havel said, its president, Richard von Weizsacker, was in office during Germany's reunification and several other moments crucial for Central Europe. Germany's participation may also help the country to formulate its relationship with its immediate eastern neighbors, he said. Havel said he hoped the location of the meeting would contribute to the renewal of the spirit of regionalism which characterized the Czech lands in the time before communism, when the Czech republic became "just Prague and its surroundings".
