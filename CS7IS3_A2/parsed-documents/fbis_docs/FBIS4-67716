Lipikhin under the "News" rubric: "Conflict at the Ambulance Service"] [Text] A group of Ambulance Service workers has announced its intent to strike. Moscow residents know that this is not the first attempt of the people in the white coats to resort to extreme measures. Newspapers reported on conflict situations at the ambulance service two years ago. And what is the reason for today's discord? First, a portion of the collective has come out against the imminent reorganization of the ambulance service and emergency medical service. Second, the ambulance service workers believe that their service is not receiving adequate attention from Moscow's government. Is this so? In just nine months of the past year, the Main Medical Administration spent an additional 2.34 million rubles to increase the wages of the ambulance service's personnel, 8,856,000 rubles to insure the lives of the service's workers, and 84,811,000 rubles to feed them. Each worker sent on a call is provided with special clothing. And that costs nearly 100,000 rubles. The money was allocated systematically, beginning in January 1993 when the ruble "hovered" much higher than now. By directive of Moscow's mayoralty, seven substations will be built in 1994-1995 in rayons of new construction, and an additional 13 substations and 4 base garages are slated to become operational by 1998. Still unresolved is the question of supplying the ambulance service with vehicles. In the past 2 years, the motor vehicle combine of the Moscow Administration of Motor Medical Transport [Mosavtosantrans] received a total of 65 vehicles for the ambulance service. And that's what they got even though each year about 400 vehicles become unsuitable for operation. As a result, each day there are 160 to 200 vehicles out of service. Why has so critical a situation come about? The problem is that the RAF [expansion not given] microbuses for the ambulance service are manufactured in the Baltics. They must be paid for in foreign exchange -- and in no small amount. And according to specialists' estimates, they can serve a total of 4 years and 7 months. That is in theory. In practice, the little RAFs break down after 1 1/2 or 2 years of operation. To solve the problem of providing transport vehicles for the ambulance service, Moscow's government has sought the means to buy 220 Mercedes vehicles. Twenty of them are already in operation in the city, and beginning in February, another 10 vehicles will begin operating in Moscow every day. Furthermore, the matter of purchasing the medical version of the RAF microbus is not being decided. But as far as strikes are concerned, no one has yet abolished the Criminal Code article regarding responsibility for failure to provide medical assistance.
