On the contrary, he told journalists, Croatia was looking forward to reducing troop levels "as long as the Serbs do not continue their aggression." The minister said Croatia was ready to grant local autonomy to the region but would never accept Krajina's integration into Greater Serbia nor a formal link between Krajina Serbs and rebel Serbs in Bosnia. Granic partially admitted accusations made by humanitarian organisations that Serbs in Krajina had been persecuted and their homes destroyed. "We're at war," he said, "and it's difficult to control everything that happens near the front line." Granic said his country was in favour of international supervision to ensure human and minority rights were respected in Krajina and said negotiations between Croat and Serb representatives from the region would recommence in the Russian embassy in Zagreb in six days' time. He also indicated that Croatia was ready to normalize relations with Serbia if it ceased to support secessionists in Krajina and said it was "necessary to apply even more pressure on Belgrade which holds one of the keys to the end of the war in ex-Yugoslavia." Granic said he was in favour of a new "active and realistic" mandate for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Krajina. He said the present mandate had not led to a disarming of the Serbs in the region and had not prevented the continued bombardment of Croat towns like Zadar. After meeting a number of officials in Copenhagen Wednesday, Granic left for Helsinki in the last stage of a Nordic tour that also included stops in Oslo and Stockholm.
