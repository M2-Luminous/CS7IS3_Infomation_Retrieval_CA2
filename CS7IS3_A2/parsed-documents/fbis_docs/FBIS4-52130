Japan is a major memory-manufacturing nation turning out 4-megabit DRAM (dynamic random-assess memory); however, as a result of growing export demand from American personal computer manufacturers, Japan has been in short supply of memories, which has resulted in boosting their imports to make up for the shortfall. The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has "unexpectedly" served to meet a "20- percent share of foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese chip market" under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, known as being typical of a numerical target. The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has been noticeable since early this year. According to trade statistics compiled by the Finance Ministry, Japan imported a total of 99,764,510 memories during the January-March quarter, a jump of 1.5 times over the same period of last year. Japan's memory imports during the first three months this year exceeded its total memory imports for 1988. The view is already surfacing that Japan's memory imports this year will certainly exceed last year's all-time high of 313 million memories. South Korea has become a top supplier of memories to Japan in terms of volume and amount, and most of the memories are believed to be 4-megabit DRAM. Against the background of the economic recovery in the United States, such major Japanese semiconductor manufacturers as NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd., and Toshiba Corp. have exported nearly 70 percent of their 4-megabit DRAM that is used in the manufacture of personal computers, thereby triggering the short supply in Japan. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan has said, "Japanese personal computer makers and memory users have coped with the short supply by importing South Korean-made memories." The trend of high memory prices at home has forced the Japanese personal computer makers and memory users to import memories from abroad to keep their businesses profitable. Japanese personal computer makers have aggressively imported foreign-made EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) and other memories that are technologically superior to domestically made memories, and this has become a factor in Japan's growing imports of memories. A researcher at the electronics group of the Nomura Research Institute, who is well versed in the domestic and foreign semiconductor situations, has said, "As Japanese semiconductor makers have increasingly shunned the production of DRAM, South Korean semiconductor manufacturers, who increased their supply capabilities, needed to boost their semiconductor exports to Japan so Japan's imports of DRAM's are expected to grow in the future."
