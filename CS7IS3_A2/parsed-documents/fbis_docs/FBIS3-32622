Miriam Ortiz confirmed that military exercises are being conducted and they are running two weeks behind schedule. [Ortiz] Today, as the State Council is posing serious questions about the president's having permitted the entry of foreign troops without permission, the doors of Juanchaco opened up and a new perspective appeared on the presence of U.S. soldiers here. The minister of defense said these troops did not come to the country to build a school and a health center. He said they came to conduct military engineering exercises. [Defense minister] Pardo also said that there has been disinformation regarding this case. [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Was the president of the Republic also misinformed? [Pardo] Why? [Ortiz] Because he did not know that the presence of the U.S. soldiers here... [Pardo, interrupting] No, no. What happens is that they have tried to build up a case here. Things have been blown out of proportion. The president appoints some officials. He appoints a minister of defense or any other portfolio so that the minister exercises the duties. [end recording] [Ortiz] The minister also said he does not agree with the opinion of the State Council, adding that if this judgement is allowed to advance, it will pose a danger to international cooperation. He explained that as part of this practice, 163 U.S. military engineers are building this health center with four rooms and a school with four classrooms, all for $100,000. [Begin recording] [Ortiz] What we are all wondering is why has the work been delayed? [Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo] First, because of the winter. Even though January is a summer month, it rained a great deal. [end recording] All climatic and topographic difficulties in which the Americans wanted to carry out this type of engineering exercise have been found in this part of the country. It rains every day in Juanchaco. But paradoxically thanks to the rains the work is running two weeks behind schedule. [end recording] [U.S. Army Captain Clark] We've had some problems with the weather. [Ortiz] When will you leave? [Capt. Clark] When the work has been completed. [end recording] [Ortiz] For their personal security, these soldiers are carrying 132 MA-16 rifles and 10 9mm pistols. In addition, they are being guarded by 60 Colombian soldiers. During this visit, it was also learned that there is a second part of these exercises scheduled for 1995, which has been postponed for the time being.
