In his address to the assembly deputies, representatives of the state authorities, and guests, Karadzic first pointed at the historical dimension of the centuries-long struggle by the Serb people to resist suffering and slavery, as well as the efforts to overcome all cracks and divisions in Serb national unity. Emphasizing that the Serbs have spent this century under constant supervision, whose objective was to prevent any integration among the Serbs, Karadzic added that "the claims made by Catholic and Islamic international circles that the war in the former Yugoslavia is not a religious war are untrue. The wars in 1914 and 1941 were religious, and the war in 1991 was and is a religious war aimed at exterminating the Orthodox world." "A large number of Muslims were nationally unaware, and there were even unaware Muslims who in ethnic terms declared themselves as Serbs, although they also took part in the genocide of Serbs because they were driven solely by religious motives," Karadzic said. As far as political violence against the Serbian people is concerned, the president of the Srpska republic noted that the most pressing aim of Croatia's "democracy" was to exclude the Serbs from its constitution in the process of secession, while the first task of the Muslim leadership of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina was to cancel the constitutional rights of the Serbian people. This political violence turned into the jihad warriors' battle cries, Karadzic said. He added that all the masks of fake Yugoslav values, fake communism, fake Europeanism, and of everything the Muslims had faked and worn as a mask since the departure of Turks from these lands had been dropped at the moment. It is precisely Turkey's attempt to return to the Serbian lands as an empire that encouraged the local Muslims to attempt to oppress the Serbians again. This time, however, there were new Serbians, unknown to the Islamic east and Catholic west. This time their attempt at dividing and stifling the Serbians by Serbians was foiled. Apart from a few shameful exceptions, traitors and degenerates who could not be cured of their servile obedience and subservience, the Serbians as a whole united and reconciled as never before. They stood up and defended themselves, Karadzic said, stressing that their return to tradition and religion swept away the decades of rusty lies and delusions. "Our political reply to their violence was, first, the separation of our deputies to the Assembly of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by our proclamation of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and later of the Serb Republic. This took place exactly two years ago on Scepan Day 1992. We replied by to their political violence with political moves and measures. We reacted to their dismantling of a state by building our state," Karadzic said. President Karadzic then recalled, in his reminiscence of past events, that in the first 45 days of the war the people led by the Serb Democratic Party--as the main political power of the Serb people outside Serbia--stood up against the enemy. The armed Serb people became the Serb army in the best sense of the word, in the spirit of the best heroic Serb military tradition. A number of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers recognized in themselves the oath of their forefathers and volunteered to lead the units of the newly formed Srpska republic army. "Despite all the lies and slander of international propaganda, the Srpska army has preserved its spirit of chivalry and its military honor, as befits it. All lies about the crimes committed by this army, having been used for the purpose of exerting pressure on Serbia and the Serbs, have already been forgotten, even by those who had launched them. Brilliant victories of the people's army, its military conduct, bravery, and heroism, have secured the existence of the Srpska republic and the Serb people and have made even the enemy and hostile international circles acknowledge and even admire Serb soldiers." Deputies of this assembly, regardless of their party allegiance, with all their political struggle and other work, promptly joined the action of forming the army and even directly took part in the armed struggle, in which two of them--Goran Zekic and Milovan Bjelosevic--lost their lives. Milutin Najdanovic, our prominent federal deputy, was killed in a beastly manner in Sarajevo, Karadzic said. Exceptional heroism has been demonstrated by the doctors and medical staff who in time organized the war hospitals that have saved the lives of a large number of our fighters, the president of the Srpska republic said. Many of our heroes will not be mentioned in this limited speech, but they will be held in the Serbian people's memory, Karadzic pointed out. Our generation's self-confidence and its trust in historic endeavor would not have been possible without the sense of unity in our people east and west of the Srpska republic, Karadzic stressed. The republic of Serb Krajina, which conceived the idea and national ideology of the Serb Democratic Party, is always in our mind as an example of courage as well as an obligation. We must never forget, although we rather unjustifiably seldom mention it, the help of the people and leadership of Montenegro and the support of most political parties there. Without Serbia's transformation, its rise from the ashes and the completion of its integrity and the resolve of the people and leadership of Serbia, we would not have an indispensable support and have no hope in success, Karadzic stressed. Serbia is our beginning and our goal, our inspiration and hope, our cradle. All the calculations of our enemies have collapsed because Serbia--its people, leadership and political parties--have not been acting as they were expected to act. They did not let us down. Our aim is to unite with Serbia. We are not going to conceal this. This is our right, which is identical to the right of a bird to fly or of a flower to boast of its smell and colors. We have this right. For centuries we deserved a Serbia, and now we have finally secured it. Serbia deserves us too. Long live the Serbian people and all its friends. Long live all the Serbian lands that are called--in a word--Serbia, President Karadzic said in the conclusion to his address to the deputies of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic and the numerous guests at the ceremonial session marking its second anniversary.
