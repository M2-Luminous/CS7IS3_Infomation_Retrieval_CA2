According to local officials, the prefecture now has 41,867 rural and township enterprises which created one billion yuan of output value last year, accounting for more than half of the total rural output value. The rural and township enterprises contributed 33.82 million yuan to the local revenue in the past year. For a long time, Dingxi had been so poor that about half of its rural population did not have enough to eat or wear. Since 1983, local government, together with relevant local departments, has proceeded in accordance with local conditions and begun to adjust the production structure in rural areas. They have adopted measures to encourage local farmers to set up rural and township enterprises or be engaged in diversified economy without neglecting grain production. As a result, rural and township enterprises engaged in engineering, transport, carpet-making and food-processing sectors have mushroomed in Dingxi prefecture. At the same time, the prefecture has also worked out preferential policies to attract outside investment for development of local resources. The quick development of rural industry has also created more job opportunities for surplus rural labor, effectively improving the living standards of local residents. At present, 170,000 rural laborers, or about 12 percent of their total, have found jobs in local rural and township enterprises.
