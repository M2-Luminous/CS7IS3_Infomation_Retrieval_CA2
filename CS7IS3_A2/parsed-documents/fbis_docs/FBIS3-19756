This was announced by Mr. Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), the Federal Government's resettlers' commissioner, on Monday [21 March] after a talk with Bishop Christoph Klein, head of the Evangelical Church in Transylvania. In 1994, too, Bonn keeps financial aid available to support the Romanian Germans. For this year and for the past year 28 million German marks has been allocated for this purpose from the FRG Interior Ministry budget. This year a center for the elderly will be completed in Hermannstadt, Transylvania, and a cultural center in Temeschburg (Temesvar) in the Banat region. Waffenschmidt, parliamentary state secretary to the Interior Ministry, wants to visit the ethnic Germans in Romania in May. He added that a considerable minority of the Romanian Germans want to stay in their homeland. The approximately 20,000 applications for resettlement that the Federal Administrative Office still has are to be speedily processed within the framework of the regulations of the Law on Compensation for War-Induced Losses, Waffenschmidt concluded.
