Our correspondent Ramiz Meshelihesenli reports: [Begin recording] [Meshelihesenli] After sincerely greeting the delegation headed by Medetkan Sherimkulov, chairman of the Kyrgyzstan Supreme Council, Geydar Aliyev provided detailed information on Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan and on the tragic consequences resulting from it. The Azerbaijani president said that to date Armenia has failed to implement concrete proposals and agreements worked out during the Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in Moscow last September, and that these agreements remained on paper. It was reported that the agreements worked out by the initiative of the international organizations and Russia for the peaceful resolution of the conflict have been derailed because of the Armenian side's disregard for them. What is more, Armenia is not abiding by any of the four resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council; rather, it is organizing new large-scale offensives against Azerbaijan and is not putting an end to its policy of occupation. Armenia will pursue its aggressive aims unless punished by international organizations. Geydar Aliyev also reminded the delegation that it was again Armenia that undermined the agreements reached during the meeting between the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments. As additional proof of Armenian aggression, Aliyev noted that it was Armenians who shot down the Iranian plane over Karabakh. The Republic's president indicated that he is hopeful of the new peace initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's delegation. Medetkan Sherimkulov, who heads the CIS delegation, thanked Aliyev for his detailed information on the situation. He added that their efforts aim at settling the conflict by peaceful means. The delegation proposed that the chairmen of the Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments meet in Bishkek in the first ten days of May. The delegation will leave for Yukhari-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] today. When Medetkan Sherimkulov noted the need for the representatives of the Armenian community of Yukhari-Karabakh to be present at the Bishkek meeting, the Azerbaijani president replied: [Aliyev's statement in Russian omitted] [Meshelihesenli] Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Republic's Supreme Soviet; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; State Adviser Vafa Gulizade; Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov; Namik Akhundov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission on International Ties; Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian special ambassador on the Karabakh problem; and other officials took part in the meeting.
