The Necessity for Introducing Low-Pollution Vehicles and the Reasons for Selecting the Vehicle Types Covered in the Study In Japan the abatement of atmospheric pollution has been advocated for quite some time, and to date, various types of measures have been devised to counter the so-called fixed sources like factories, e.g., emission concentration controls, aggregate emission volume controls and restrictions on fuels used by factories and the like. As a result of the use of petroleum-fueled internal combustion engines as the motors for automobiles, they too, like the other fixed pollution-generating sources, have become the source of a considerable portion of the total volume of urban exhaust gases. For this reason, and in light of what is known about the behavior in the environment of various substances in exhaust gases and their effects on the human body, a systematic, phased response has been devised within the technical framework of the petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine designed to abate exhaust gas from automobiles, e.g., through the establishment of long-term technology development goals by the Central Environmental Pollution Countermeasures Council, etc. As a result, current petroleum-fueled internal combustion engines may be safely called combinatorial aggregates of incremental improvement technology which responds to widespread demands for environmental considerations in addition to such primary requirements for automobile engines as fuel consumption and horsepower, etc. In addition, a great many businesses, beginning with the road transport carriers, and other parties associated with road transport, the ones using automobiles, have been giving their due cooperation as well in reducing environmental impact by implementing rational operations along with timely and appropriate introduction of vehicles which have been improved in this manner. Although regular progress is being demonstrated in this way by the restrictions on individual substances in exhaust gases from automobile units, the volume of automobile travel brought about by growth in the national economy is increasing, and the overall volume of exhaust gases continues to rise. Where this trend is particularly evident is in the environmental problems of the greater metropolitan areas like Tokyo and Osaka. Specifically, there are many areas where the environmental standard for nitrogen dioxide (NO[.sup]2[/]) has not been achieved and there is no trend of improvement in evidence. In order to cope with this situation, the ``Special Measures Law Concerning the Reduction of the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Emitted by Automobiles in Designated Areas'' was passed in June of this year, and the basic policy, etc. for reducing the total volume of NOx is scheduled to be clarified by autumn of this year. According to the Environment Agency, once this law is put into effect, environmental quality standards will be attained by the year 2000; however, the popularization of substantial numbers of low-pollution vehicles is being counted upon to achieve this goal. Furthermore, social concern over current environmental issues is in transition to a global environmental approach on issues like global warming from carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/]), and acid rain which is attributed to sulfur oxides (SOx) and NOx, etc. In addition, a more global sweep is being evidenced, e.g., the UN Conference on the Environment and Development was held in Rio de Janeiro in June of this year, and a Climatic Changes Framework Agreement (Treaty to Prevent Global Warming) obtained the signatures of more than 150 countries. The amount of CO[.sup]2[/] emissions per person in Japan is among the lowest group among the developed nations, but the amount of these very CO[.sup]2[/] emissions is equal to approximately 5% (276 million tons) of the world total, fourth highest in the world. Japan has established an Action Plan To Prevent Global Warming designed to promote systematic, comprehensive measures to deal with global warming and says that it will achieve per-capita CO[.sup]2[/] emission volumes which are at the 1990 level in the year 2000. A considerable amount of effort is going to be required to achieve this target. That being the case, hereafter, in response to consciousness of environmental issues in which the focus will likely be placed on the global environment in this manner, the question of whether or not some sort of specific results will be achieved by petroleum-fueled internal-combustion engine automobile technology while pursuing the conventional policy of incremental technical improvements is likely to become an issue. Regarding this point, there are those who indicate concern about trade-off issues between existing technologies already developed in response to conventional technical requirements, and there is concern that, increasingly, the technical options are becoming far too narrow and the solutions more difficult. Naturally, while we continue to feel that it is important to keep up with technical challenges in this fashion, there are limits to coping with present and future environmental issues, and to overcoming and improving on them with this approach alone. Especially now, when the trend of society as a whole is to demand material contributions toward protecting the environment from those connected with road traffic, e.g., a great many businesses, beginning with all road transport carriers, it is necessary to accelerate actions and measures designed to protect the environment by everyone concerned in order to take some sort of obvious steps. In particular, the deterioration of the urban environment, e.g., the failure to achieve NO[.sup]2[/] emission standards, etc., is being pointed out, while on the other hand, at present, when it is being recognized that prompt implementation of comprehensive measures like the elimination of extreme concentrations or the improvement of traffic flow by the promotion of road maintenance and upgrades is, very regrettably, difficult, the adoption of a comprehensive, tandem approach of seeking and promoting possibilities for using low-pollution vehicles (low-emission vehicles) or vehicles with no exhaust gas (zero-emission vehicles) is being recognized as necessary and significant. It is recognized that some of the so-called low-pollution vehicles have matured in terms of their stage of technical development to the extent that it is possible to evaluate them as subjects of study. This study committee adopted such a viewpoint, and on the assumption that there are vehicles which have possibilities for mitigating in all aspects the environmental impact from automobile exhaust gas which would be used by road transport carriers who now have great occasion to use diesel vehicles, which have contradictory characteristics concerning both CO[.sup]2[/] and NOx in particular, and also that the degree of their technical maturity has reached a prescribed level, the committee decided to subject four types of vehicles to study, i.e., energy-regenerating-type hybrid vehicles, methanol vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and electric vehicles. In addition, the decision was made to give consideration to comprehensive introductory support measures so that these vehicles could be introduced in as smooth a replacement cycle for conventional vehicles as possible. In line with this, we studied whether or not it is possible to use each of these vehicles as productive assets. As one of the steps in the study, the committee decided to gain an understanding of the operating structures of the road transport carriers which would correspond to the actual operation of the four types of low-pollution vehicles and then to do a compilation of vehicle use realities in the road transport industry, to include vehicle procurement methods. The committee decided that if, after having illuminated the realities of vehicle usage learned in this manner and having confirmed that a market exists which could match the performance of low-pollution vehicles, it should be determined that their autonomous popularization could not be anticipated in terms of the operating structure of the industry, they would take under consideration policy support measures. II. Operating Structure of Road Transport Carriers 1. Size of Freight Carrier Firms We will gain an understanding of this from various types of data concerning the present status of freight carriers. However, since the currently available data predates the effective date for the Second Law on Material Handling, the data still contains distinctions such as route and area, etc. According to the classification of a small or medium enterprise established by the Minor Enterprises Act, as of the end of March 1991, 99% of area carrier firms and 83% of route carrier firms fell under the small or medium enterprise classification. When divided into route and area classifications, small firms accounted for a great majority of area trucking firms in terms of capitalization, number of employees and number of vehicles. On the other hand, among route trucking firms, it appears that those capitalized at ¥100 million or more accounted for 17%, while those with 301 or more employees accounted for 19%, and that these large firms account for a considerable share of transport. Thus, there are a great many medium and small-sized firms among the road transport carriers, and so in order to bring up the diffusion rate of low-pollution vehicles, it is important that we begin working on firms at this operating level and not just the large firms.

Operating Conditions In order to gain an understanding of the business and operating realities of road transport carriers, we will analyze various kinds of business indicators by size of the carrier firms. First of all, in looking at the settlement of accounts status, in route trucking, 13 firms were operating at a loss in contrast with 98 firms operating at a profit, while in area trucking, there were 194 in the black and 28 in the red. No particular difference in the ratio of firms operating in the red was detected in correlation with route and area trucking. However, when analyzed by size, in contrast to the absence of any correlation to size for firms operating at a loss among the area trucking group, none of the firms operating at a loss among the route trucking group were found among firms with 101 vehicles or more, and one could say there is a clear difference correlating to size among the route trucking firms for the ratio of firms operating at a loss.

Route trucking has risen to the 4-5% level and area trucking has leveled off at the 5% level. On the other hand, this figure is at the fairly high level of 7-8% for manufacturing and 7% for the retail industry. Nevertheless, in the wholesale industry this level is low at 5%. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 2-4.

The average rate of recurring profit on total capital for route trucking is 5.4% and falls below that for firms other than those with 1-20 vehicles or with 301 and above. In addition, there appears to be a difference in the ratio of recurring profits to operating revenue which correlates to the size of the firm. In the case of area trucking, the correlation between this difference and size is all the more apparent. In particular, the average for firms with 1-20 vehicles is -1.6% and a great many of these firms are operating in the red. Chart 2-5.

This represents the ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities, and normally, when this ratio exceeds 100%, one can conclude there is no need to worry about short-term solvency. In connection with route trucking, other than firms with 1-20 or with 301 or more vehicles, this ratio falls below 100% and there is lingering concern about short-term solvency. On the other hand, in the case of area trucking, excluding firms with 20 or less vehicles, this ratio exceeds 100% and from the standpoint of liquidity, one can say that area trucking firms are in better shape. Also, when the ratio of long-term capitalization to fixed assets (where one evaluates the operating status of long-term capitalization) exceeds 100%, it indicates that there are current liabilities requiring short-term repayment in connection with the portion which is in excess and that it is being covered by fixed assets capital. In route trucking, firms other than those with 1-20 or 301 or more vehicles, and in area trucking, firms with 20 or less vehicles exceed 100%. Also, among these firms, the individual net worth ratio is declining as well. Chart 2-6.

Note: In the majority of firms among small and medium-sized enterprises, profitability is low, and their operating efficiency and financial structure too are not altogether good. In particular, the liquidity ratio is quite a bit below 100%, and one could say that there is lingering concern about their short-term solvency. 3. Total Expenditure and Composition for Freight Carrier Firms In order to analyze the operating realities of the firms, we study the composition of the various expenses incurred in the course of their business activity. According to small and medium cost indicators compiled by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, the average sales volume of a sound enterprise is ¥309 million, and 96.1% of that goes to cover total costs with fixed costs accounting for 37.5% and variable costs for 58.6%. Also, the personnel cost ratio, including welfare costs, employee training and the like, is 38.8%. Fuel costs, repair costs, and depreciation costs are cited as expense items relating to vehicles during the course of business. Depreciation costs average ¥13 million and as a ratio of operating costs have grown to 13.6%, a sales volume ratio of 4.4%, second only to executive salaries and allowances. As for other industries, e.g., manufacturing, the figure is ¥39 million, 3.2% of the total cost structure; for the wholesale industry it is ¥9 million, 0.4% and for retail, it is ¥2.5 million, 1.1%. Vehicle fuel and repair costs average ¥8 million, 2.5% of the total cost structure. Chart 2-7.

Among area trucking firms, vehicles account for 5.0% of the fixed asset depreciation costs. Also, in totaling up fuel costs, maintenance costs and depreciation costs, they account for 7.6% of operating costs among route trucking firms and 14.1% among area trucking firms, and the cost burden relating to vehicles is growing for area trucking firms. Further, if you examine these costs by the numbers of vehicles, the weight of vehicle depreciation costs for route trucking firms with 50 or less vehicles, it exceeds the average for route trucking firms. Among area trucking firms, the ratio of vehicle-related expenditures is higher overall when compared with that for route trucking firms, and here again, the depreciation cost component ratio is higher among smaller firms with 50 vehicles or less. The introduction of low-pollution vehicles is a very important business issue for road transport carriers. As evidenced in the indicators of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, compared with other industries, their depreciation cost burden is higher, and according to MOT indicators, it is obvious that the smaller the enterprise, the larger the burden for fuel costs, maintenance costs and vehicle depreciation costs accounted for in operating costs. In the future, when weighing measures to popularize and promote low-pollution vehicles, it will be necessary to consider handling measures with business realities such as these fully in mind.

Bus Company Business Realities In examining bus company business realities, both private and public, it is obvious that they have become deficit-prone business operations. According to the motor transport business indicators of the Road Transport Bureau of the MOT, as far as can be determined by the indicators when averaged, bus service operators, both private and public, are operating at a deficit, and even charter bus firms have a very low earnings structure. In particular, public bus service companies are running substantial operating deficits. Of the general bus service companies which qualify to receive MOT regional bus subsidies (333 firms), no more than 55, 16.5%, are operating in the black, and the overwhelming majority have lapsed into deficit operations. In addition, bus companies have high capital investment in vehicles and buildings and the like, and a high fixed assets ratio (fixed assets/net worth), even in comparison to trucking firms. That is also manifested in a low rate of turnover of total capital (operating revenue/total capital), and the fact that revenue is extremely low compared to the scale of investment and that investment efficiency has deteriorated is obvious. Because this operating structure has become intrinsic, with the exception of public companies, the liquidity ratio (liquid assets/current liabilities... indicates the ability to make external payments) of bus companies has dropped below 100%, and they are confronting credit-related problems. When we look at costs per operating kilometer, income per kilometer of actual travel is ¥451, while costs are ¥490. According to the component itemization of these costs, the component ratio of personnel costs is very high, vehicle maintenance costs account for 2.91%, and vehicle depreciation costs for 4.43%. The ratio of vehicle depreciation costs is equivalent to that for the costs of fuel, oil and lubricants, and in terms of the overhead burden has become an important factor. Thus, bus operations are working under extremely stringent conditions, and in a great many cases bus service operators are pursuing other lines of business as well. Generally, bus service companies are assessed as enterprises having a highly public nature, and their credit rating as enterprises ends up being boosted. Accordingly, when you examine the ratio of operating profit to net sales by size of operation for bus service only, among the bus services in question the operating costs exceed operating revenue in all cases, regardless of size, but when evaluated on an overall enterprise basis, including the other lines of business, those bus companies with 1-30 and 301 or more vehicles are generating operating profits, and even in terms of recurring profit are showing up in the black. Thus, for bus companies which are operating in a business environment more severe than that for trucking firms when judged as a separate and independent business, the introduction of low-pollution vehicles will be a greater burden. However, the public bus companies have opportunities to bring in funding from general revenue sources, and the pilot introduction of low-pollution vehicles in terms of the aspect of environmental management is to be anticipated. Also, among the private firms, even in those where the bus service operation is running at a deficit, when one makes allowance for subsidies from within the company, it is perhaps possible that the burden of introducing low-pollution vehicles can be covered to a certain extent. However, even in that case, reduction of the costs to introduce these vehicles will determine the numbers introduced just as it will for the trucking firms, and so various types of support measures will be needed to facilitate their popularization.

Current Vehicle Usage of Road Transport Carriers 1. Vehicle Procurement Methods Later on we will present these in detail, but as a measure for popularizing low-pollution vehicles which are relatively high-priced in comparison to existing diesel vehicles, especially among small-scale firms with low liquidity ratios, the mitigation of the initial capital burden will be highly significant, and it is conceivable that a great many cases will require support measures in combination with a lease system designed for this purpose. Nevertheless, it appears that at present, there are few cases in which these businesses use leases to procure vehicles. Accordingly, along with clarifying current forms of procurement and the reasons for not using leases, etc., by implementing a questionnaire survey of these businesses, we gained insight from existing data into the circumstances for and problems with using leases when procuring vehicles. First of all, let's look at the types and methods of vehicle procurement by businesses. According to a questionnaire survey sent out to the various branches of the Tokyo Metropolitan Trucking Association in which a majority of the members are small and medium firms, almost all (23 out of 25) responded that ``when required, trucks are purchased in small lots,'' and cases of combined, large-lot purchases are limited. Also, it is obvious that when purchasing vehicles, approximately 60% of the firms are cognizant that ``it is important because of the need for a fixed amount of depreciation costs every year'' from an accounting standpoint. Furthermore, as reasons for the poor utilization of leases for vehicle purchases, ``because even when money is borrowed, funding can be procured at low-interest,'' and ``because of the structuring to produce profits for the actual years of a vehicle's serviceable life after it is fully depreciated'' were cited most often. Also, more than one third of the respondents indicated that it is ``because they do not fully understand the merits of leasing.'' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 3-1.

As of 1990, the number of lease-held passenger cars was 420,000, buses, 10,000, and trucks, 680,000, and in terms of component ratio, trucks and passenger cars were the more prevalent. Also, in terms of the ratio of lease-held vehicles accounted for in the numbers of vehicles in use, leases accounted for 7.2% of buses, for 7.1% of trucks, for 1.3% of passenger cars, and for an overall average of 2.7%. Whatever class of vehicle one considers, lease utilization is rising steadily, and it appears this trend is going to continue in the future as well. Incidentally, according to a FY1990 lease demand trends survey on leasing overall conducted by the Japan Leasing Association, corporations then utilizing leases accounted for 86.9% of the total, a 2.3% rise in comparison with a survey conducted in 1986. As for the items being leased, communications equipment and exchanges were the leading category, and for vehicles, leases were used by 31.5% of enterprises, demonstrating a rise of more than 10% in comparison with the 20.2% recorded for 1987. All of which is to say that for low-pollution vehicles, the speed of future technical innovation will be greater in comparison with existing vehicles, or in other words, as a result, the risk of their becoming superannuated is expected to be high, and so too there will be a greater need to avoid the risk of superannuation associated with the speedy introduction of low-pollution vehicles with higher performance, and in this aspect, the merit of leasing seems to be growing. As far as we can judge from the data and the survey findings mentioned above, for medium and small enterprises vehicle procurement is an important business issue and independent procurement is the norm. Also, as far as dissatisfaction with the lease system is concerned, there are problems relating to ``the impression that it is relatively expensive,'' and ``the terms establishing the residual value, or the period of the lease.'' Consequently, in the event assistance policies which employ leasing are devised, a system which is responsive and easy for businesses to use, and the employment of low-interest funding such as fiscal investments and loans designed to negate ``the impression that leases are relatively expensive'' will likely be indispensable. And, it will probably be necessary to give consideration to the methods of establishing residual value and lease periods as well. Graph 3-2. Lease Ratio Changes In any event, if a lease system is incorporated as part of the assistance policies, concrete, readily understandable public relations (PR) aimed at these businesses is going be a major prerequisite. 2. Business Operations and the Realities of Vehicle Usage We sorted out the realities of how trucks and buses are being used on a daily basis in various businesses primarily on the basis of the results of a questionnaire in cooperation with the Tokyo Metropolitan Trucking Association supplemented with existing data and investigative hearings. Below, we have compiled the actual conditions and special features concerning the forms of truck and bus usage judged in terms of, (1) size of enterprise, (2) transport destination, and (3) items conveyed. (1) Forms of Usage in Terms of the Size of the Enterprise In the case of the major transport carriers, for usage within an urban area (travel distances of 50-80 km), 2-ton vehicles are the primary choice. However, 4-ton vehicles are used for hauling to industry. For suburban, large-volume hauling (travel distances of 100-140 km), 5-ton vehicles or larger are used. For long-distance hauling (travel distances of 500-600 km), 10-ton vehicles or larger are used, and transport is conducted at night. In the case of medium-sized transport carriers, 2-ton vehicles are used primarily for short-haul (travel distances of 30-50 km), and medium-to-long haul transport (travel distances of 300-1000 km) is handled with 4-ton and 10-ton vehicles. City-route buses travel around 110 km per day. They always perform nearly the same travel pattern (frequent stops, and an average vehicle speed of around 11 km/hr.). Also, the per-trip travel distance of sight-seeing buses is around 200 km, and the travel patterns of buses employed for specific services such as shuttle service within airports, etc. are fixed within a specific area. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 3-3.

Transport to distribution centers is handled with 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles for 40-120 km trips, and 10-ton vehicles are used for trips exceeding 200 km. Trips are made primarily in the early morning and daytime. For deliveries to wholesale and retail stores, trips are made primarily during the day within the cities, and the travel distance is 50-150 km. For deliveries to wholesale stores 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles are used, and for deliveries to retail stores 2-ton vehicles are used. In addition, for deliveries to construction sites, a variety of vehicles, from 2-ton to 10-ton, are used and the travel distances and operating features are diverse as well. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 3-4.

For transport of construction materials, a variety of 2-ton, 4-ton and 10-ton trucks are used, and the operating features are diverse as well. For the transport of finished goods, food, daily necessities, books and printed material, and liquors, mainly 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles are used. Travel distance of around 100 km, primarily daytime trips within the cities, and numerous delivery items is characteristic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 3-5.

Among 4-ton vehicles, there is a tendency to emphasize upgrade capability. For long-distance transport, because there is a lot of cargo to deliver and comfortable accommodations are sought due to long driving time, etc., primarily 10-ton vehicles are used. Also, since refueling in the course of a run is not desirable, vehicles with good fuel consumption are sought. In the case of route buses, stops are highly frequent, and there are a great many acceleration and deceleration cycles. Features such as road performance and ease of handling are sought. In the case of long-distance buses running between cities, long-distance, overnight, high-speed operation is called for, and safety, accommodation and cruising range, etc. are the features sought. 3. Current Status of Urban Traffic The present status of truck and bus usage by various enterprises is as described above, but here we will address the realities of truck usage and possession overall. The number of trucks owned nationwide as of the end of March 1991, was 8.83 million, and of that, the number of trucks for businesses numbered 900,000. In terms of the composition of the types of cargo vehicles on a registered vehicle basis, compact trucks accounted for just under 70% nationwide in contrast with full-sized trucks which, conversely, accounted for approximately 70% of business vehicles. In the case of compact trucks, a high percentage were gasoline vehicles. We will examine in detail the full-sized truck class in which diesel vehicles accounted for the majority. In the makeup of business vehicle types, full-sized trucks in the 9-ton-and-over-to-under-11-ton class were the most prevalent, accounting for 18.8%, followed by trucks in the 3-4-ton class at 15.2% and the 2-3-ton class at 15%. However, when full-sized and compact trucks are lumped together according to carrying capacity, the 2-3-ton carrying capacity class vehicles were most prevalent at 19.8%. When classified by operating area, the 2-3-ton class vehicles were the overwhelming leaders in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba) at 32.5%, and no more than 6.2% nationwide, while trucks under 2 tons accounted for 10.5% in the Tokyo metropolitan area and about the same nationwide. In the Kinki area (Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo) as well, the ratio of 2-3-ton class vehicles was higher in comparison with the nationwide ratio. In the Nakagyo area (Aichi, Mie), unlike these other two areas, the 3-4-ton class vehicles were the more prevalent, and the component ratio for 9-11-ton class trucks was high as well. Chart 3-6.

The average transport distance for regular-sized business trucks is 83.2 km, and for compacts it is 35.3 km. Also, we consider these in terms of average transport distance and number of tons transported per actual working vehicle day. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 3-7.

It appears from these figures that in practical terms, refueling is done once a day, and so the cruising ranges which these travel distances will demand of the low-pollution vehicles to be introduced will be considered. For the number of transport tons, the number of tons transported per working transport trip, rather than the number of tons per day, will be considered for the performance required. According to these figures the per-trip tonnage is 5.3 tons for full-sized vehicles and 0.8 tons for compacts. However, large-sized trucks are included among the full-sized class, and we need to take into consideration the fact that this inflates the figures. Note: Since these figures include times when the vehicles are running with no cargo, they represent the distances traveled, rather than the average transport kilometer for business vehicles cited above.

Kilometers traveled per working vehicle day = kilometers traveled/total vehicle working days. 2. Number of tons transported per working vehicle day = number of tons transported/number of working vehicle days. 3. Number of transport trips per working vehicle day = total number of transport trips/number of working vehicle days. 4. Kilometers traveled per working transport trip = kilometers traveled/total number of transport trips. 5. Number of tons transported per working transport trip = number of tons transported/total number of transport trips. Next, we will sort out in simple terms the travel conditions within cities. First of all, in terms of trucks in general, the travel modes comprise a combination of 4 elements: idling, acceleration, constant speed and deceleration. The 10-15-mode travel used in calculating such things as automobile exhaust gas regulations are representative. And, in diesel vehicle regulations, 6-mode-travel is applied to heavy vehicles. In FY1994, this will be changed to 13-mode to correspond with the 10-15 mode. Currently, the average 10-15-mode-travel vehicle speed is 22.7 km/h. According to this, in terms of average vehicle speeds, although the data is from 1985, the average for Tokyo's 23 wards was 14.9 km/h, roughly less than half the national average of 36.9 km/h. This average has declined in other metropolitan areas as well, it was 19.5 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya area, a reduction in average speed of just under 13% for Osaka and of just under 24% for Nagoya when compared with 1980 data. According to this data, it appears that the average vehicle speed is falling and that the frequency of idling is rising as shown in these graphs based on the results of study by the MOT's Traffic Safety and Nuisance Research Institute. Graph 3-9. Current Travel Modes (10-15 Mode, 11 Mode) Graph 3-10. Average Traveling Speeds on Public Roads (Peak Hours) Graph 3-11. Average Vehicle Speed and Idling Cycles per km Also, since the frequency of idling cycles is high for buses because of idling at bus stops and while passengers get on and off, in addition to traffic signals and traffic backups, their average vehicle speed is low. According to the constant speeds established in the urban bus operating schedules for FY1989, the average bus speed in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 11.4 km/h, and 12.8 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya metropolitan area, even lower than the average vehicle speeds cited above. And, according to data on actual Tokyo route buses (Shibuya-Shinbashi, 17 January 1992), the lowest average speed in one day was 9.15 km/h over 10 vehicle hours, approximately less than half compared to that for the early morning. In addition, backup time at the major intersections within Tokyo reached 2,150 hours in 1990. On a per-day basis this was equivalent to approximately 6 hours. Thus, for urban travel, travel patterns with high idling frequency and low average vehicle speed are on the rise. Graph 3-12. Changes in Backup Time of Major Intersections in Tokyo IV. Features and Possible Uses of Vehicle Types Covered by Study In this chapter we will sort out the features and specific systems as well as possible uses, etc. for (1) hybrid vehicles; (2) electric vehicles; (3) methanol vehicles and CNG vehicles respectively. 1. Hybrid Vehicles A brief synopsis of the concepts, special features and specific systems relating to hybrid vehicles is offered as follows: 1) Concepts Hybrid vehicles have internal combustion engines and non-internal combustion engines for motors, and depending on the travel conditions, etc., have the ability to combine the motive power of its non-internal combustion engine with the internal combustion engine output, or to make exclusive use of the motive power of its non-internal combustion engine. 2) Features We would sort out the principal features of hybrid vehicles as follows: (1) Their intent is to allow the merits and demerits of internal combustion engines and non-internal combustion engines to compliment one another, and to resolve problems such as fuel consumption, exhaust gas properties, cruising range, and the like. (2) They offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the internal combustion engine for which it is possible to consider a wide range of engines such as methanol and natural gas engines and not just gasoline and diesel engines, and afford a variety of combinations to meet performance requirements. Furthermore, based on the latest technical advances, hybrids have been proposed which, instead of being limited to simple combination methods, focus on ways to harness energy regeneration and on energy conservation measures and the like. 3) Specific Examples Various types of systems have been proposed for hybrid vehicles, some examples of the leading specific systems are as follows: (1) Excitation-type Regeneration Systems a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving energy and reducing the volume CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust. b. Regenerates braking energy and the like and stores it in batteries. An electric motor is activated with this battery-stored energy and the output of the internal combustion engine is supplemented by it for starting, acceleration and upgrades. By reducing the load on the internal combustion engine with this stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation and the like are to be achieved. c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of current diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through the regeneration of energy is conceivable. Graph 4-1. Diesel-Electric Hybrid Vehicle d. Among the excitation-type regeneration systems, a working bus with the HIMR (Hybrid Inverter-Controlled Motor and Retarder System) method diesel-electric hybrid system has been perfected, and has been put into partial use. Graph 4-2. Diesel-Accumulator-type Hybrid Vehicle (2) Accumulator-type Hybrid System a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving energy and reducing the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust. b. Braking energy is regenerated and stored with hydraulic pressure. A hydraulic pump is activated with this stored hydraulic pressure for starting, acceleration and upgrades and by reducing the load on the internal combustion engine with this hydraulic stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation and the like are to be achieved. c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of current diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through the regeneration of energy is conceivable. d. Operational tests with test vehicles are being conducted. (3) Engine-Generator-type Hybrid Systems a. Technology developed with the aim of improving the cruising range of electric vehicles. b. Operates an internal combustion engine at a high efficiency rating point to run the vehicle and power an electric motor to produce electric power. Stores the surplus energy generated by the internal combustion engine in batteries. c. Output performance is equivalent to that of an electric vehicle so that the vehicle can be powered by the electric motor alone. d. Concept stage (theoretical studies), or basic research stage. (4) Engine-Electric Motor-Combination-type Hybrid System a. Improved energy conservation the main development objective. b. System which operates on either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor. A variety of methods have been proposed over quite some time, but one of the latest systems, the VW-Audi System (operates on an electric motor as the primary engine for travel within the city and on an internal combustion engine as the primary engine for travel outside the city, and when the electric power output runs down, it uses the internal combustion engine as an auxiliary engine) has been proposed for passenger cars. c. Improvement is needed on power output problems to where the system is equivalent with gasoline engine systems, as well as on the cruising range. d. VW-Audi is perfecting the system on the passenger car level. It is in the theoretical study stage in Japan. Graph 4-3. VW Hybrid System 4) Possible Uses Considering things like the technical features of hybrid vehicles like those described above, they are judged to be particularly suitable for large-city traveling. As pointed out earlier, travel within cities demonstrates a pattern of repeating starts and stops, and hybrid vehicles devised to regenerate braking energy can be described as systems with high introduction value. Also, the introduction of hybrid vehicles requires no provision of special infrastructure, and so one can claim there are few physical impediments to their introduction. Furthermore, test operations are proceeding smoothly, and technical reliability is growing. 2. Electric Vehicles We will sort out the concept and features of electric vehicles as automobiles, and the issues, etc. presently being confronted as follows: 1) Concept Electric vehicles use electric power as their energy source and operate with electric motors. Charging batteries are used primarily as the energy supply source. Graph 4-4. Vehicle Component Diagrams 2) Features Given that it eliminates entirely exhaust gases with SOx and NOx while operating, and that, in terms of the electricity generating source, the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] gas emitted is small compared to that of gasoline vehicles, the electric vehicle is the ultimate expression of a low-pollution vehicle. Also, it has the added advantage of producing very little noise. 3) Problems At present, 1,000 vehicles or more, mainly compacts and light vehicles, are being used on the road in Japan, but the short per-charge cruising range (approximately 100-150 km at a constant speed of 40 km/h, around 50 km within the city), and the short life span of the batteries have been pointed out as problems in terms of their use. Also, continuing new development is needed on systems overall for electric vehicles because the current price levels are very high, from 2 to 10 times that of existing vehicles, and that wide variation is also a major issue in terms of popularizing their introduction. Furthermore, acceleration is poor, and the driveability in cities, where responsive driving is called for, leaves something to be desired. And for vehicle design as well, current designs are premised on lead storage batteries, and design constraints in terms of weight and space are imposed. It appears that in the future factors like the aging of the truck operator population and the employment of some women will be inevitable, and if attempts are made to offset this with chassis design strategies as part of the measures to secure a labor force, these storage batteries might become limiting factors. In order to solve these problems, development of smaller, more powerful storage batteries (high-energy-density batteries) is needed, and a great deal of hope is placed on results from development work on storage batteries as mobile, high-output sources of electricity being promoted by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). In this connection, research and development (R&D) on a new type of compact, high-performance battery, including a fast-charge system, began in April of 1992, and along with it research studies are to be initiated on the provision of social systems and infrastructure which will support the mass popularization of electric vehicles. It is also anticipated that in the future, with mass production, there will be substantial declines in the price levels of electric vehicles. 4) Possible Uses At the current stage of development, in terms of road performance, etc., it would be difficult for electric vehicles to compete with existing diesel vehicles, especially in carrying capacity in the 2-ton class or above. However, once the essence of electric vehicles is understood, one can assume that because they produce no exhaust gas and very little noise, they will be used actively in specific fields. And, with future advances in storage battery technology, gradually, their fields of use are likely to broaden. 3. Methanol Vehicles We will sort out the concepts and features of methanol vehicles as automobiles, and the specific issues they are confronting at present as follows: Graph 4-5. Areas of Responsibility of Related Industries in Electric Vehicles and Gasoline Vehicles 1) Concepts With methanol vehicles there are two types of concepts, the auto type and the diesel type. The auto type is a vehicle mounted with a methanol engine which is a slightly modified gasoline engine, and the diesel type is a vehicle equipped with a spark ignition device or glow plug ignition device based on a diesel engine. Graph 4-6. Auto-Type Methanol Engine Graph 4-7. Diesel-Type Methanol Vehicle 2) Features With the auto-type methanol vehicle it is possible to achieve exhaust gas levels which are equivalent to those of gasoline engines for CO, HC and NOx because of the use of a ternary catalyst. And, with the diesel-type methanol vehicle, NOx exhaust content is lower than that of diesel engines and black smoke is not exhausted. 3) Problems With equivalent capacity fuel tanks the cruising range per fillup is short, half that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, and so it is limited to short-range service like pickup and delivery within cities. Also, their use for long-distance transport would require the installation of a fuel supply network. While long-distance runs would be possible by increasing the carrying capacity of the fuel tanks, it would have to be at the cost of lowering the effective carrying capacity of the vehicle. In addition, there are technical problems like the corrosion resistance of the fuel supply system materials, and with the auto-type, improving the low temperature starting and high temperature restarting performance and reducing the levels of unburned methanol and aldehyde in the exhaust gas, etc. 4) Possible Uses Methanol vehicles have already been under test operation for an extensive period of time and a broad field of use is assumed. However, as cited above, the cruising range per refuel is short and the installation of new fuel supply facilities will be required, so for the time being their use will be focused on travel within cities. In the future, as fuel-supply networks are established, it is assumed they will be used in long distance travel modes as well. 4. CNG Vehicles We will sort out the concepts and features of CNG vehicles, and the issues and specific systems, etc. as follows: 1) Concepts Natural gas vehicles (NGV) are vehicles fueled with natural gas, and NGV presently operating are classified according to the form of the natural gas in the fuel tanks: as compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles. The total number of NGV presently operating in the world is estimated to be from 750,000 to 1 million (according to a ``Clean Fuels Report'' article of April 1990), and most of these are CNG vehicles. LNG vehicles on the other hand, have yet to be generally popularized due to difficulties with the fuel supply and storage aspects, and so, other than some in the U.S., only a very few are in use. There are also adsorbed natural gas (ANG) vehicles which store natural gas at low pressure (1/5 - 1/3 of the pressure of CNG vehicles) using an adsorbing material, but at present, these are in the research stage on natural gas adsorbing materials and have not been put into practical application. 2) Features We will sort out the main features or advantages of CNG as follows: (1) Natural gas fuel has been established as an energy substitute for petroleum, reserves equivalent to those of petroleum have been confirmed, and it is endowed with superior supply stability since the producing nations are not disproportionately located in the Middle East. (2) It has a low CO[.sup]2[/] generation rate per calorie unit (70% that of petroleum). (3) Because impurities are removed when it is liquefied, the purity of the methane is high and it has great potential for lowering pollution. (4) The following can be pointed to for its features as an automotive fuel: a. It has a high octane value of around 130 and superior knocking resistance, enabling a high-compression-ratio engine as a result. b. Lean-burn stability parameters are broader, resulting in improved fuel consumption (energy conserving). c. By burning in a mixture with light oil, it is possible to use natural gas as a fuel in diesel engines without modifying them by adding plugs. Technical development is underway on the assumption that this will result in lower exhaust of black smoke and NOx, and this will have the effect of improving the vehicle usage process. d. Because it is a gas fuel, it has good starting properties in cold climates. e. Since fuel supply will use gas pipelines, vehicle transport with tank trucks and the like are not necessary. f. Since impurities are not found in the fuel, it will be possible to extend engine life and to reduce maintenance and administrative costs. (5) When converting vehicles into NGVs, one needs only to modify a gasoline or diesel vehicle's fuel supply system, spark or ignition system (only for CNG diesel type vehicles) and, as needed, the compression ratio. Vehicle performance already has been demonstrated in the case of gasoline-type vehicles. Also, with mass production, it is possible that the costs can be kept at a level that is equivalent to that of conventional vehicles. 3) Problems The principal CNG problems are as follows: (1) The areas in Japan which are supplied with natural gas by pipeline are limited to the major metropolitan areas and the domestic natural gas production areas of Shinkata, Akita and Chiba, and at present, this network cannot be quickly expanded nationwide. (2) On-board space must be secured and vehicle weight increased in order to accommodate a fuel storage cylinder. (3) The per-refuel cruising range is short, around one fourth that of gasoline and diesel vehicles equipped with identical capacity fuel tanks, so they are limited to short-range service such as pickup and delivery duty within cities. 4) Specific Examples A variety of system types have been proposed for CNG vehicles, and these are roughly classified as light and heavy vehicle types, and generally categorized according to engine system and form of fuel usage. Categories of CNG Light Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems (fuel switching), and CNG-exclusive systems. Heavy Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems; dual-fuel, diesel fuel and CNG, systems (mixed burn); and CNG-exclusive systems. They also can be classified in terms of two combustion methods, the lean-fuel-air-combustion (lean burn) method and the theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion (stoichiometric) method. (1) Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle The gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle is one that is capable of interchangeably using the two fuels, gasoline and CNG. A majority of the NGVs presently operating in the world are gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles which are gasoline vehicles that have been modified by adding CNG fuel systems. Conversion kits for these modifications can be procured cheaply overseas. The reason for the spread of this method appears to be due to the lower convenience of vehicles fueled with CNG alone, as a result of the restricted cruising range (travel distance per tank of fuel) and fuel supply facilities. In gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles, the CNG is stored in a fuel cylinder under 150-200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] of pressure and after it travels through a fuel pipe and it is reduced to near-atmospheric pressure in a pressure regulator (pressure-reducing valve) located in the engine compartment, it is fed to the engine through a gas/air mixer. As for the engine combustion method, in nearly all cases in Japan it is the same as that for gasoline engines, the theoretical air-fuel ratio combustion method, in which the air-fuel ratio (_l_) is operated at close to 1.0, is employed, and in order to purify the exhaust gas, a ternary catalytic device is added. Graph 4-8. Schematic of Foreign Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle (2) Diesel Fuel/CNG Dual-Fuel Vehicle Natural gas has a low octane rating in comparison to light oil and it is hard for auto-ignition to occur, and so it is difficult to use in this manner in compression-ignition type diesel engines. Therefore, if one is going to combust natural gas in a diesel engine, an ignition source is needed. Accordingly, one gets the natural gas to combust by modifying the fuel and intake systems and using light oil as the ignition source. This is referred to as the diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel system. The diesel engine is operated with a high compression ratio, and so it is possible to make more efficient use of natural gas with it than with a gasoline engine. However, because the kits to convert diesel vehicles into diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel vehicles have not come into wide use at present, the price is high, and the installation is more complicated than in the case of a conversion to a gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle. Nonetheless, since the use of this type of vehicle is conceivable as a measure to improve the use of diesel vehicles, there are hopes for technology development. (3) CNG-Only Vehicles Gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle and diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel vehicle engines use a number of different fuels, and so while they are optimized to make the best use of the combustion features of natural gas, they cannot help but do an inadequate job. CNG-only vehicles are mounted with engines designed for CNG in order to make the best use of the combustion characteristics of natural gas. For cases in which the vehicle is being converted from a gasoline vehicle, a theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion method engine is used. For conversions from diesel vehicles, a lean-fuel-air-mixture method is under development. CNG-only vehicles, including those converted from diesel vehicles, are mounted with diesel-type, premixed, single-chamber-ignition system engines; diesel-type, premixed, precombustion-chamber-spark-ignition system engines; a mechanical-carburetor-control system engine developed by Gasunie NV (The Netherlands); and an engine in which the fuel-air-ratio is electronically controlled developed by TNO (The Netherlands). 5) Possible Uses Numerous CNG vehicles already are in actual use in various foreign countries, and from a technology development standpoint there are few problems. However, CNG-only vehicles have a short per-refuel cruising range, and so their use will be focused in cities. As stated earlier, the CNG supply system is limited to areas which are focused on large cities, and these CNG-only vehicles can be described as suitable for use in large cities where the environmental problems are severe. Since CNG dual-fuel vehicles can use diesel fuel as well, it will be possible to use them for long-distance trips as well. If they are used as transit vehicles and the like for major cities, the claim could be made that their use would be highly valuable from an urban environmental standpoint. V. Study Concerning the Social Infrastructure Upon Which Introduction of These Vehicles Is Premised 1) The low-pollution vehicles addressed by this study committee are hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, methanol vehicles and CNG vehicles. Hybrid vehicles are fundamentally based on light oil-fueled vehicles, and do not require road transport carriers and others to make new investments in fuel supply facilities and the like or in related infrastructure. On the other hand, for electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, the use of their energy/fuels as fuel for conventional automobiles had not been foreseen, and so no nationwide supply system for them as automotive fuel has been established. Therefore, when road transport carriers have attempted to use these vehicles, they have had to procure the energy sources, and in addition, to set up facilities to supply their vehicles on their own. Nonetheless, as confirmed by the questionnaire study conducted as part of this study committee's work, it has been difficult for urban businesses to add on large-scale fuel facilities to their company sites, and restrictions on the further establishment of supply facilities and questions about how uninterrupted supplies of fuel are going to be secured, etc., have led to difficulties in expanding the scale of supply of petroleum-substitute fuels. On the other hand, until these issues are overcome, the reality is that there can be no clear awareness that we must use petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles. For the service stations which sell conventional gasoline, etc. and which are in the most convenient locations to supply petroleum-substitute fuels, the situation has been one in which they have had no confidence whatsoever concerning the volume of sales that can be anticipated, and whether it can succeed as a business, and the fact that there has been no choice but to be negative toward new investment has been a major obstacle from the standpoint of establishing petroleum-substitute-energy supply stations. 2) Nonetheless, in light of the very recent rise in concern about global environmental issues, etc., a major shift in energy supplier awareness of petroleum-substitute energy supply is evident. To support this, we cite the report of the ``Petroleum-Substitute Energy, Energy Supply Systems for Automobiles Study Committee'' (22 June 1992) which studied petroleum-substitute energy supply systems with the participation of the ``National Federation of Petroleum Dealers' Associations,'' an association of petroleum dealers. This report: i) Provides a uniform assessment of the role of petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles saying, ``they will have the effect of killing two birds with the same stone by resolving pressing issues like environmental policies for the reduction of CO[.sup]2[/] and energy policies on lessening the degree of dependence on petroleum.'' ii) Adopts an aggressive energy-supply-side attitude, indicating that ``the relationship between 'alternative-energy vehicle R&D and popularization' and 'the establishment of energy supply networks for alternative-energy vehicles' is a 'chicken and egg' relationship, and until we cut through this dilemma, rapid popularization of alternative-energy vehicles cannot be anticipated. Rather, there is a need to establish the role of both as 'two wheels of the same vehicle' and to promote both in a systematic, policy-type manner.'' iii) Further mentions the handling of service stations and states that they should make efforts to be able to handle automotive energies other than gasoline and light oil (CNG, methanol, electricity) in the medium-to-long term. iv) Pointing out that there are dangers with any form of energy, and in terms of urban disaster prevention, the separate establishment of supply stations for these respective energies is not desirable, and that the cost of land is high in urban areas where the need for alternative-energy stations is great, and so the cost of establishing alternative-energy stations could be prohibitive, the report advocates ``that the provision of infrastructure be undertaken by making use of 60,000 service stations nationwide.'' The report further clarified the study committee's position on the provision of infrastructure by indicating in particular that in using existing service stations, ``we should attempt to establish alternative-energy stations as model operations for the first three fiscal years, and for the time being, policy-type incentives such as subsidies, etc. would appear to be needed because of the lack of commercial interest.'' In accord with this, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) has formulated the ``Environmental Vehicles Popularization Infrastructure Program (Eco-Station/2000 Program).'' In concise terms, it aims for the establishment of 2,000 ``eco-stations'' by the year 2000; calls for the provision of about 100 ``eco-stations'' as model operations during the initial phase of the program, from 1993 through 1995; for national treasury grants to cover the expenses; and for nationwide development of the remaining stations from 1996 to 2000 with provision of the required funding through a system of interest-free loans. The budget request relating to ``eco-stations'' for FY1993 is ¥1.8 billion, and a very major step has been taken relating to the provision of a supply infrastructure for petroleum-substitute energies. In other words, in connection with the provision of a supply network for automotive petroleum-substitute energies, it is safe to say that, at the very least, there are prospects for a solution to this issue in the form of facility establishment by suppliers at a prescribed pace. Thus, based on current circumstances in which an increase in the ``number of taps'' is being affirmed, the focus in terms of the prime issue for road transport carriers relating to the supply of alternative energies likely will shift to the questions concerning whether or not supply margins for petroleum-substitute energies will be stable enough for automotive markets in the context of world or Japanese domestic demand, followed by questions concerning how prices will react once automotive fuel demands are created as new sources of demand for these energies. (1) Electric Power Supply In looking at the supply and demand structure of electric power which is the motive energy for electric vehicles, one finds that there are major swings in the course of a single day, with consumption high during the day and low at night. At the same time that daytime electric power supply and demand is growing tighter, the range of fluctuation between day and night demand is getting bigger from year to year as well. Graph 5-1. Daily Electric Power Demand Load Curve Graph 5-2. Changes in the Biggest 3-Day Averages per Month In the event electric vehicles are popularized in large numbers, it is anticipated that electric power supplies will grow all the more tight if things like daytime charging of electric vehicles and fast-charging, etc. are carried out. Electric power has superior features, e.g., it is clean and can be used for a variety of purposes. Conversely, the fact that it cannot be stored is a drawback. As a result, facility capacity must be slightly more than peak demand. Consequently, facility utilization rates (annual amount of electric power output divided by 8760 hours and then multiplied by 100) tend to be low, and the generating costs end up being that much higher. In order to cope with these circumstances, it is necessary to attempt to level the load by introducing a system of rates differentiated by time periods. A time-differentiated-rate system attempts to facilitate consumer load shifting and to smooth demand load by establishing different rates for peak-load and low-load periods. It will be necessary to encourage the charging of electric vehicles at night and to smooth out the supply and demand balance through the introduction of this kind of night rate system. Also, if low-cost, night-rate charging can be used, it will contribute to improved electric vehicle energy costs, and so this too will serve to promote their popularization. First of all, development of an electric vehicle fast-charging system is to be initiated this fiscal year using a new type of battery power storage system (making effective use of nighttime power output by storing it and then using it for charging demand during the day) being developed by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). In addition, in order to promote the popularization of electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, MITI has announced an ``eco-station'' program to establish 2,000 stations by the year 2000 which will supply electricity and natural gas, and is studying the provision of subsidies beginning in 1993 to be used to cover the costs of remodeling existing gas stations. Thus, while the provision of infrastructure for the use of electric vehicles is inadequate, it is possible to make the assessment that steady progress is being made. (2) Methanol Supply and Demand First of all, in looking at the international supply and demand for methanol, current estimated annual worldwide demand is approximately a little less than 20 million tons, around 80% of the sustainable supply (approximately 23 million tons). In terms of regions, supply capacity is great in North America and Eastern Europe, while demand is great in North America and Western Europe. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chart 5-3. International Methanol Demand Estimates (unit: 1,000 tons) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |International Methanol D-|Production Capacity | | |emand Estimates | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |North America |5,697 |7,210 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |South America |1,004 |1,522 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |West Europe |5,443 |2,970 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |East Europe |2,979 |5,445 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Far East/Asia |3,699 |3,248 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mid-East/Africa |500 |2,766 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |19,322 |23,161 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Methanol Annual 1991 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also, in terms of methanol uses, in addition to being used as a chemical feedstock to produce things like formalin and terephthalic acid, etc., in recent years it has been in the spotlight as a feedstock for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) which is used as a basic component for elevating the octane rating of high-octane gasoline. Graph 5-4. Methanol Uses (Worldwide Basis) Next, if one looks at the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) price of refined methanol as an indicator for understanding the methanol supply and demand situation in Japan, considerable fluctuation from year to year is evident as shown in Graph 5-5. This demonstrates instability in the supply and demand structure. Graph 5-5. Changes in Methanol Production, Import and CIF Graph 5-6. Changes in Methanol Demand and Price The raw material for methanol itself is natural gas, and there is general consensus on the point that there is no need for concern about a shortage in the supply of natural gas. Therefore, it seems there is no need to consider a shortage in methanol feedstock as a factor in future supply and demand instability. On the contrary, current price fluctuations are the primary cause of supply and demand imbalances. The methanol production industry is a typical process industry, and when a methanol plant is expanded it is on the scale of 600-700,000 tons per plant; in other words, expansion is conducted on the order 3% of the global supply capacity. When demand rises, given the comparatively high operating rates of current facilities, price jumps occur easily, and this promotes strong motivation to increase production facility capacity, but after capacity increases, it creates noticeable surplus capacity once a decline in demand occurs, leaving a market structure susceptible to ``pig cycle'' types of price fluctuations in which prices slump. In addition, at present, there is no consensus on which types of service vehicles M85 and M100 respectively are going to be used for, and, as indicated in connection with this point by the ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee'' mentioned earlier, ``comprehensive study is needed, to include the social and economic aspects, and not just the technical aspects.'' In any event, if one takes the long view, it will likely require efforts to establish a stable supply and demand relationship which is independent of supply and demand for chemical-feedstock methanol in order to secure stable supplies of methanol as an automotive fuel. On top of that, because of properties like the formation of combustible, explosive gas compounds and invisible inflammation, etc., methanol is regulated by the Fire Protection Law, the Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law, and the Labor Safety and Health Law, and since there must not be any discharges outside the systems of use, if widespread popularization with ordinary users is anticipated, it is conceivable that revisions of the relevant laws and ordinances or the creation of new standards will become necessary. Natural Gas Supply and Demand First of all, in looking at the supply and demand structure of natural gas which is the motive energy of CNG vehicles, we learned that the worldwide demand for natural gas in 1990 was 1 trillion 931 billion cubic meters, a 2% increase over the year before. The former Soviet Union and Central Europe accounted for approximately 40% of the overall consumption. Total global production volume in 1990 was 1 trillion 957.1 billion cubic meters, a 2% increase over the year before. The former Soviet Union produces approximately 40% of the world's total and the U.S. approximately 25%. The former Soviet Union in particular has greatly expanded its production, approximately four-fold over the last 25 years. With natural gas there is little emission of SOx and NOx, and even the emission volume of CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of global warming, and is 70% that of petroleum and 60% that of coal when combusted. Therefore, it is evaluated highly as a fuel in terms of environmental considerations. Also, in terms of supply, it is stable in comparison with other fuels. The resource supply nations are widely distributed in places like the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, etc., and there are 12 years more proven reserves than there are for petroleum. Japan depends on the Middle East for 6% of its natural gas supply, very low compared to 70% for its oil supply. In view of these facts, natural gas appears to be a desirable petroleum-substitute fuel for transport. Graph 5-7. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas Graph 5-8. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas Natural gas demand is forecast to grow 3% annually until the year 2000. Petroleum demand, on the other hand, will grow at an annual rate of 1.5%. Under the circumstances with environmental issues and the like, energy demand in Europe has begun to shift rapidly to natural gas. There are prospects that by the year 2010, the ratio accounted for by natural gas for all energy sources, including petroleum and coal, will expand from the current 15% to 30%. In terms of supply as well, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which has been the leading supplier nation up to now, development is now under way with western capital. Furthermore, the Middle East, which accounts for 30% of total reserves, is being counted upon to satisfy the increase in demand, and the probability of stable supply is growing. (Infrastructure Establishment) The biggest obstacles to natural gas being used for vehicles are the establishment of a supply infrastructure and especially, the securing of supply for the ``eco-stations.'' In Japan the areas which have natural gas pipelines installed and which are being supplied are limited to large cities and their environs and domestic natural gas producing areas such as Shinkata, Akita and Chiba, etc. The concept of a pipeline traversing the whole country (targeted completion in 2010) and the like have been rumored, but in any event, Japan is in no position to develop a pipeline network right away. Within the currently supplied areas there is the possibility of using the existing pipelines for terminal distribution, and it is conceivable that refueling facilities for CNG vehicles could be established with relative ease. Graph 5-9. Town Gas Supply Areas Which Supply Natural Gas At present, six CNG dedicated stations have been established nationwide and are being used to supply fuel to CNG vehicles owned by the gas companies. CNG refueling is rapid and timed, and the refueling technology has been proven overseas. The development and establishment of compact, rapid refueling facilities (compressor and dispenser) is a pressing matter, and in Japan a 3-year project was started in FY1992 with an AIST subsidy for the ``development of practical NGV refueling equipment,'' and needed infrastructural technology is being readied for mass popularization. Furthermore, in order to popularize CNG vehicles, relevant legal system revisions and the like will be sought. The revision of the High-Pressure Gas Control Law and the establishment of vehicle technical standards, etc., and various types of environmental apparatus directed toward mass popularization have become urgent matters. Graph 5-10. LNG Plants in Japan VI. Estimates of Costs To Introduce and Operate Low-Pollution Vehicles 1) At this juncture we are going to make estimates of the introductory and operating costs for the hybrid, electric, methanol and CNG vehicles which are to be targeted for introduction by the road transport carriers, bearing in mind analyses of the studies cited earlier and the like. The object of these cost estimates is to enable forecasting concerning such issues as how big a burden would be imposed on these businesses if they introduce and operate the vehicles in question, and if various types of support policies are devised, how effective would they be? In order to establish more realistic premises and take into account the features, etc. of each of the vehicle types, the estimate premises are not necessarily common to all, but the basic cost framework was made common to all. Thus, before getting into the estimates for each of the low-pollution vehicles, we will sort out the common premises. The following items are offered as common premises or thinking: (1) We used estimated prices formulated on the basis of data on the various vehicle types provided by the auto industry of Japan as a premise of study by this study committee, and on the basis of investigative hearings with associated industry groups and enterprises. (2) It is assumed that fuel is to be procured from ``eco-stations'' and the like. Note: We will explain fuel price later on as well, but because it is difficult to accurately predict, as a premise of this exercise, we formulated and used uniform-estimate values. (3) Expense accumulation items were placed in six areas: vehicle price; maintenance costs; fuel costs; operating costs; infrastructure and facility costs; and education and training costs. (4) To evaluate low-pollution vehicle introduction costs, we used the method of comparing the total costs of the accounting period, which totals the initial costs (vehicle price, automobile acquisition tax, etc.) and operating expenses (fuel costs, expendable items, interest payments, etc.), and the average annual costs with those for current base vehicles. In estimating the introductory and operating costs of low-pollution vehicles using premises such as these, we found that with a simple purchase case, assuming average service life, the average annual operating cost in the case of a hybrid vehicle is ¥1.51-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.3-1.7 times current vehicle costs. For a methanol vehicle, it is ¥1.23-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.4-2.1 times current vehicle costs. For a CNG vehicle, it is ¥1.12-1.73 million/year, equivalent to 1.3-2.0 times current vehicle costs. Given the road transport carrier operating structure outlined in Chapter 2, it is difficult to view these as cost levels supporting autonomous popularization. Therefore, in order to lower these operating cost levels, various types of support policies will be devised, and we have assumed a variety of options, presented below, as the principal thinking on handling policies. (1) Lowering financing costs in order to reduce the cost of procuring the new vehicles. As operating premises of this study committee, the use of fiscal-investment-and-loan-type special interest loans, and a financing ratio of 50% are assumed. Also, regardless of the source of funding, implementation of some sort of grant for paying at a fixed rate of interest is assumed. Specifically, reference is made to the system of interest subsidies relating to purchase funding for vehicles conforming to the latest regulations with transport industry promotional subsidies. (2) Lowering initial introductory costs in view of the low financing capacity of medium and small-sized firms. As an operating premise of this study committee, we assumed the use of leases in combination with fiscal investment and loans. (3) Incorporation of credit supplementing measures since medium and small-sized firms are short on credit resources. As operating premises of this study committee, in the event these are used in combination with a lease system, the introduction of a system in which business cooperative associations stand surety for money loaned and the lowering of lease rates are assumed. (4) Endeavoring to lower the per-year cost burden by devising incentives in connection with corporate taxes, etc. As an operating premise of this study committee, allowing a tax deduction equivalent to 7% of the basic lease fee (total amount of the lease fees x 60%) for companies using a lease system, similar to ``MITI's Medium and Small-Sized Enterprise New Technology Promotion Tax System (known as the Mechatronics Tax System),'' is assumed. (5) Allowance to use incentives in connection with all other vehicle taxes. As an operating premise of this study committee, reduction of the vehicle acquisition tax, and vehicle tax is assumed. 2) Note: Electric vehicles, as mentioned when we presented their technical features, are particularly superior in terms of their lack of exhaust and quietness, and they are generally recognized as the ultimate expression of the non-polluting automotive vehicle of the future. Development efforts to date have focused on vehicles in the ``light automobile'' class because of the relationship to the issue of the capacity of current storage batteries. For this reason, in the 2-ton commercial vehicle class which is considered necessary for the actual introduction of low-pollution vehicles by the road transport carriers, development is still in the stage where demonstration vehicles have begun to be provided for trial operation. For the electric vehicle itself, as stated earlier, extensive technical component development still remains to be done on storage batteries and in other areas. Also, technology development aimed at making the important peripheral electric vehicle equipment, the recharging facilities, more inexpensive is needed. Thus, a lot of hope is riding on the potential for future component technology development for the 2-ton class electric vehicles, and given the cost estimates, including operating costs, based on the price for the trial manufactured 2-ton vehicles, the majority of the committee feel it is still too early, and so we will forego specific estimates on these at this juncture. 3) Also, estimating the ``costs'' of petroleum-substitute energies proved extremely difficult; although it is relatively simple to get a handle on the comparative costs for electricity and CNG (the price for LNG, the feedstock material, is set by long-term contracts), there are many elements of uncertainty, not to mention methanol, which as was pointed out in the report of the ``Study Committee for Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles'' cited earlier, ``is one of the feedstock materials for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) in which there is heightened interest as a gasoline component, and research study on future supply and demand trends is needed.'' Consequently, as an operating premise of this study committee, for fuels in which the related enterprises have some degree of responsibility for supply prices, we made reference to the price estimates of those enterprises, and for those fuels for which no such circumstances exist, we estimated supply prices on the premise that the fuel costs per kilometer of travel would not be cheaper than those for petroleum-derivative fuels. 1. Hybrid Vehicle Cost Estimates Cost category content for the introduction and operation of hybrid vehicles is as shown below. It is assumed that by employing energy regeneration, hybrid vehicles will have better fuel consumption rates than existing vehicles, and that some of the introductory costs will be recovered with lower operating costs. Note: For maintenance costs, we used the estimates of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Also, given the technical features of the hybrid vehicle, there is no need for the provision of new infrastructure, and since instruction and training can be handled in a very few days, the decision was made to disregard those costs in these estimates. These estimates are premised on a 4-ton truck and a large-model route bus as the test hybrid vehicles. With respect to the former, the establishment of a 2-ton class, compact vehicle was studied out of consideration for the realities of truck usage in urban areas, but in taking into account the technical features of the hybrid vehicle and the current stage of technical development, etc., the committee decided to premise the estimates on the highly feasible 4-ton vehicle. For the bus, we targeted the large-model route bus which already has a track record as a test vehicle and for which there are a great many units in use. Note: Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of manufacturing, we established a 2-tier price structure for the vehicle prices. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses respectively based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to the Tokyo Trucking Association and existing statistical data. Using existing experimental data, etc. as a reference, the rate of energy regeneration was calculated at 20%. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Estimated Costs (Hybrid Vehicles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cost Categories |Estimate Premises | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vehicle Price |Establish per unit price based on dat-| | |a, etc. of the Japan Automobile Manuf-| | |acturers Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in contrast to an average annual cost of ¥1.14 million for existing trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of 100 units is ¥1.99 million, just under twice that of current vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 5,000 units, the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to ¥1.51 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that hybrid vehicles are going to be popularized with road transport carriers. Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average annual cost drops to ¥1.44 million with an annual production level of 5,000 units, and if a lease system which incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, that cost falls to ¥1.32 million. Furthermore, if a fixed-rate-interest subsidy is added on, the average annual cost is lowered to ¥1.27 million, 1.11 times the current average annual vehicle cost. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around ¥130,000 per year. The same holds true for hybrid buses as well, required costs swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks, the vehicle price disparity between existing buses and low-pollution buses is relatively small, and so the disparity in cost with existing vehicles ends up being the limiting factor. If it is assumed that all support measures are possible, and if annual production expands to 1,000 units, that cost disparity will shrink completely to a mere ¥70,000 in average annual cost, and so substitution for current vehicles can be anticipated within existing frameworks for new vehicle replacements. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Summary

Methanol Vehicle Cost Estimates Introductory and operating cost categories for methanol vehicles are shown below. For maintenance cost estimates, we used the estimates of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and multiplied those with the annual mileage. Methanol vehicles make the provision of new refueling facility infrastructure necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates of fuel prices are difficult, and so we made our estimates on the premise that ``fuel costs per kilometer of travel will not be less than that for other petroleum-derived fuels.'' Also M100 was assumed as the fuel standard. Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and large-model route bus as the trial methanol vehicles. The large-model route bus was chosen because a test vehicle track record already exists and a large number of units are in service. Note: Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of production, we established a 3-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the trucks and a 2-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the buses. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and Registration Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in contrast to an average annual cost of ¥880,000 for existing trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of 100 units is ¥1.89 million, more than twice that of current vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000 units, the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to ¥1.55 million, around 1.8 times that of existing vehicles. If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the average annual cost for introduction and operation falls to ¥1.23 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that methanol vehicles are going to be popularized with road transport carriers. Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average annual cost falls to ¥1.19 million on the basis of an annual production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the cost falls to ¥1.13 million. Furthermore, if a fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average annual cost is lowered to ¥1.06 million, 1.2 times that of existing vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around ¥180,000 per year. In looking at methanol buses, similar to the trucks, the required costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing buses and the low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so the cost disparity with existing vehicles will shrink. However, even with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest grant of 3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, the lowest the average annual cost will fall is approximately 1.12 times that of existing vehicles, over ¥440,000.

CNG Vehicle Cost Estimates Cost categories for introducing and operating CNG vehicles are as shown below. For maintenance cost estimates we used the estimates of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and multiplied those with the annual mileage. CNG vehicles make the provision of new refueling facility infrastructure necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates of fuel prices are difficult, and so we used a price formulated using the prices estimated by the Japan Gas Association as reference. Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and a large-model route bus as the trial CNG vehicles. The large-model route bus was chosen because a large number of units are in use. Note: Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of production, we established a 3-tier price estimate structure for the trucks and a 2-tier price estimate structure for the buses. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to the Japan Trucking Association and existing statistical data. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cost Estimate Categories (CNG Vehicles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cost Category |Estimate Premises | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vehicle price |Per-unit prices established on the ba-| | |sis of data of the Japan Automobile M-| | |anufacturers Association, etc. and on | | |investigative hearings, etc. with rel-| | |ated industry associations and enterp-| | |rises.

In looking at CNG buses the same holds true, the required costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing buses and the low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so this will shrink the cost disparity with existing vehicles. However, even with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest subsidy of 3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, CNG buses will be cheaper than existing buses, and it is to be anticipated that they will replace existing vehicles within the new vehicle replacement frameworks already in place.

to cost estimates (full policy implementation basis) conducted under a prescribed set of conditions from the standpoint of making a comparison with existing diesel vehicles, annual costs are expected to rise respectively by ¥130,000 for a hybrid vehicle (4-ton carrying capacity), ¥180,000 for a methanol vehicle (2-ton carrying capacity), and ¥80,000 for a CNG vehicles (2-ton carrying capacity). Similarly, for buses, annual costs are expected to rise by ¥70,000 for hybrid vehicles, and by ¥440,000 for methanol vehicles, but conversely, for CNG vehicles a cost reduction on the order of ¥30,000 is anticipated. 2) In order to endeavor to popularize these low-pollution vehicles even further, the key will be whether or not it is possible to find factors which will allow us to shrink these cost disparities. First of all are the prices of the hybrid/methanol/CNG vehicles assumed within these estimates. Particularly, given the far shorter history of technology development on vehicles which use petroleum-substitute fuels than that for diesel vehicles, when compared to these engines which are ``more tempered'' by the demands of the market, it is no exaggeration to say that engines which use petroleum-substitute fuels are still under development. It is possible that in the future, as a result of cooperation between users and manufacturers, far more usable engines than those currently available and, in turn, more easy than at present for road transport carriers to use, and vehicles priced lower than the current estimates will become available. Second, financing cost reduction is possible. Current estimates for hybrid vehicles assume an annual fixed-rate interest subsidy of 1%, but, for example, in a case in which the introductory number of units is relatively low, it is probably possible to assume higher and more liberal fixed-rate-interest subsidies similar to those for methanol and CNG vehicles. Also, Japan Development Bank special-interest-rate financing is assumed in the estimates for all three types of vehicles, but there is a high probability of further cost reductions in the area of funding procurement, e.g., the opportunity for the parties introducing these vehicles to take advantage of preferential interest rates available for medium and small-sized enterprises, and further, in the case of using imported vehicles, the opportunity to take advantage of the Import-Export Bank of Japan product import financing system (interest: 5.3% at financing rate of 70% of item cost). Third, there is the importance of further ingenuity in terms of the use of all three vehicles types by the road transport carriers actually using these low-pollution vehicles. In the case of hybrid vehicles in particular, it is conceivable that transport costs will decline due to improvements to the relatively conservative mileage estimates as these enterprises secure more adequate operational stability and implement more efficient operating plans. Also, methanol and CNG vehicles have feature flexibility in terms of carrying capacity, mileage and chassis design by varying the energy density of their respective fuels and by changing their fuel-carrying methods. As a result, it is also possible that when we attempt to fully demonstrate the respective features, we will end up with more ingenious vehicles in terms of capacity, etc., than those premised in these estimates. In addition, in the case of CNG vehicles, the ``eco-stations'' which are likely to be developed will have the feature of being completely limited to the areas supplied by Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas and Osaka Gas for the immediate future. It is likely that individual road transport carriers will devise ways to absorb cost increases by using the features illustrated earlier and making them conform sufficiently to performance demanded in response to the characteristics of their customers. With the accumulation of such efforts and ingenuity by the parties concerned, effectively combined with tax incentives, fiscal investment and loans, and the like, we probably can expect to be able to promote the introduction of hybrid, methanol and CNG vehicles. 3) As mentioned earlier, no matter how difficult they have been to build, the history of low-pollution vehicles is still a brief one. Compared to vehicles with diesel engines which have a long tradition as commercial vehicle engines, one can justifiably argue that low-pollution vehicles which use petroleum-substitute fuels in particular are under development. As long as current circumstances prevail, users cannot choose to bear the burden of full-scale introduction on their own, nor can manufacturers decide to undertake adequate R&D investment, or facility investment at their own risk. Just as they are for structuring issues on the energy supplier side mentioned in the report of the ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee,'' the problems in introducing low-pollution vehicles are also inherently ``chicken or egg'' issues. In order to come up with breakthroughs on these issues, road users, starting with the road transport carriers, should formulate ``long-term targets for the introduction of low-pollution vehicles'' individually and in step with the response of their associated industry, and then strive for steady introduction on the basis of those objectives. In particular, if national and local-level government organizations make use of these vehicles as part of their operations, it goes without saying that they should set their own ``targets'' to serve as models for others, and then lead the private sector by steadily meeting these targets. Also, the national government should approve the application of measures to support their introduction cited earlier only for those businesses which have clarified these ``targets,'' and should consider eligibility in such a way that they do not discourage road users, beginning with road transport carriers. Steps should be devised so that these ``targets'' do not act simply as triggers for eligibility for these support measures. The following idea is an example of such a step. Customarily, whether it is a low-pollution vehicle or a regular vehicle, when it comes to a choice between a vehicle that has been on the market for several years or one that is just hitting the market, the one that has been tried and tested by the market will be the superior vehicle in terms of performance and price, etc. Therefore, one idea is to lower the burden and risk for those enterprises attempting to introduce these vehicles ahead of other enterprises by, for example, approving the application of support measures for road transport carriers attempting to introduce ``low-pollution vehicles'' which have not been on the market long, even if their ``targets'' call for a relatively low proportion of ``low-pollution vehicles'' among the vehicles they possess, while requiring a fairly high rate of introduction of these vehicles to be eligible for support measures after a prescribed period of time has elapsed and vehicle assessments concluded, etc. As for methods of using introduction targets, even aside from elements which must await government administrative review because of issues relating to utilization of tax incentives and fiscal investment and loans, clarifying these long-term introduction targets can be expected to have the reverberating effect of enabling automobile manufacturers to define demand estimates, making it possible to lower marketing-associated risks even further. VII. In Conclusion (1) In our study through chapter 6, we have pointed out that the possibilities for improving the operating costs and speeding up the pace of popularization of low-pollution vehicles increase by devising a series of support policies like tax and fiscal investment and loan incentives as well as schemes to make use of them, etc. In the event the introduction of low-pollution vehicles is facilitated as a result of regional features, etc., in addition to policies such as these, which ought to be characterized as uniform national minimums, it is preferable that the incentive measures be added on region by region. Similarly, from the standpoint of alternate energy policy, although not policy in direct support of low-pollution vehicles, the formulation of any sort of support measures is welcome. As long as they are conducive to the popularization of ``low-pollution vehicles,'' it is probably preferable to need to make active use of these policy measures from separate perspectives. (2) As explained a number of times, road transport carriers have adopted the position that there need to be guarantees for the systems from which supplies of energy for petroleum-substitute-energy-type low-pollution vehicles are to be received. The position of the energy suppliers on the other hand, is likely to be that clear estimates of the amount of demand and guarantees to cover facility investment risks are needed. In order to put a stop to this kind of endless debate, the ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee'' introduced earlier has stated that an ``Eco-Station 2000'' program should be put together and the support, etc. it requires implemented. The formulation of support policies such as these in itself would be welcomed as being truly opportune. If we were to take it upon ourselves to assume the position of a business actually operating vehicles and point to this program, the first priority naturally would go to the metropolitan areas, especially those which are subject to NOx laws and regulations, as investing parties in low-pollution vehicles which they themselves would use. Therefore, in attempting to invest in vehicles which use petroleum-substitute energies, it would be desirable that the stations supplying the petroleum-substitute energies, i.e., the ``eco-stations,'' be concentrated in the metropolitan areas, and on the major artery roads closely linked with them. Also, there appears to be a great need on the part of the energy suppliers like the petroleum retailers, etc. to get a handle on vehicle upgrading trends of the road transport carriers. Therefore, in order to formulate future targets for the corporate introduction of petroleum-substitute-energy-type low-pollution vehicles, it is necessary for those on the user side, beginning with the road transport carriers, and those on the energy supplier side, the petroleum retailers, et al., to come up with estimates for the supply and demand of petroleum-substitute fuels that range into the future. There is an especially great need to come up with estimates between the enterprises and the energy suppliers, the petroleum retailers, et. al., on the amount of supply required in the event the use of petroleum-substitute-fuel vehicles is attempted, even if only in those areas subject to NOx laws and regulations. The issues straddle the jurisdictions of several ministries and agencies, but a forum to study supply and demand ought to be established through the cooperation of the administrative parties. As stated earlier, it is of course conceivable that in the initial stages of use of low-pollution vehicles, a certain amount of problems with the convenience of use will surface. And, some types of product complaints need to be fed back steadily to the manufacturers. This kind of steady feedback in itself has the ability to bring about progress toward a more ``user-friendly'' vehicle, and conversely, provide automobile manufacturers with know-how and new technical data relating to the use of low-pollution vehicles, and as a result, stimulate even wider demand for low-pollution vehicles. It will probably be necessary to secure points of interface of this kind between users and manufacturers in some form. Normally, this role is played by the sales and service departments of automobile dealerships, but it seems that if several manufacturers build a specific type of ``low-pollution vehicle,'' as much sharing of their technical data as possible would lead to an effective use of precious manpower. Also, low-pollution vehicles have many points of difference with existing automobiles, particularly in terms of upgrading and maintenance, etc., and will require mastery of unique technology, particularly in the initial stages of introduction. For this reason, in using the lease system which this study committee made a premise of its review, we should consider extending it to a maintenance lease, rather than limiting it to a financing lease, so that along with serving the convenience of the road transport carriers who will be the users of the low-pollution vehicles, it will be possible to use these leases as the point of interface between the manufacturers and the road transport carriers for upgrading and maintenance data and other data. (4) Although tentative proposals have already been made regarding the handling of low-pollution vehicles in terms of taxes, it is probably going to be necessary to consider the optimum methods of implementing various automobile-related taxes and fuel taxes as long-term issues needing further study. For example, there is the issue of the automobile weight tax. This problem is directly manifested in electric vehicles, and even if excessive weight increase from storage batteries or the weight increase from the accumulator and storage battery apparatus in hybrid vehicles, the so-called ``tonnage reduction'' issue, is cleared up through the application of design ingenuity, rises in vehicle weight tax are unavoidable, and so without some sort of consideration, it is inevitable that this tax will be a source of cost increase for users of these vehicles. Also, within this report, we have addressed the issue of terminal sales price in connection with petroleum-substitute fuels, and we have kept issues pertaining to intermediate-stage taxation completely outside the purview of our study. Hereafter, having taken into consideration how they would conform with the series of policies aimed at bringing about low-pollution automobile traffic, and with promoting the introduction of petroleum-substitute energies, it likely will be necessary to study the best way to handle the imposition of taxes. (5) Furthermore, in order to confer social approval on the use of low-pollution vehicles, active consideration ought to be given by the appropriate parties to establishing conditions for their use such as devising measures like affording priority to low-pollution vehicles in public parking facilities, or setting preferential toll road usage fees for low-pollution vehicles, or providing standardization and certification systems, etc. In addition to that, active responses will be needed through the mutual cooperation of the industries concerned and cooperation with local governing bodies, etc. in connection with the extensive activities required to enable the smooth future popularization of low-pollution vehicles, e.g., the work of enlightening those concerned who benefit from the uses of road traffic, general consumers, shippers, etc., on the significance of using low-pollution vehicles, and improving the ability of the automobile-related industries to understand technology development trends, etc., which is needed to form a consensus that the ``cost increases'' which cannot be further eliminated should be borne by society as a whole by formulating tax and fiscal investment and loan incentives. (6) As indicated above, there is a considerable amount of work requiring close, mutual cooperation between automobile manufacturers and road users, and between road users and fuel suppliers. These various tasks require in particular the establishment of some type of fora for consultations on the formulation of low-pollution vehicle introduction targets by individual enterprises, for consultations with the petroleum retailers, and for consultation with the automobile manufacturers. Naturally, it is conceivable that a variety of methods could be used to establish these kinds of fora. For now, the establishment of a ``Low-Pollution Vehicle Popularization Forum'' (tentative name) with government cooperation as a forum to allow the relatively ``soft'' undertaking of collective, timely exchanges of manufacturer, user, and petroleum retailer information, and above all, direct contact and discussion of low-pollution vehicle issues by these three parties are likely to be an effective ``first step.'' Item (6) stated above is a proposal designed to supplement support policies for the popularization of low-pollution vehicles. In addition to ancillary measures like this, even more difficult issues remain to be dealt with as far as things that should be done to protect the environment in terms of road traffic are concerned, e.g., on top of upgrading the road network, making the flow of traffic smoother, and the distribution of goods more efficient. We would again point out the need for greater effort by the parties concerned. (Reference Data) Given the fact that it seems the price in the initial stage of low-pollution vehicle introduction have to be high compared to their price in the stage of full-scale popularization, and that there are aspects of insecurity relating to marketability for the manufacturers, we need to lower the risks for users for the initial stage in which specific low-pollution vehicles are thrust into the market. Furthermore, more than 80% of trucking firms are medium-to-small-sized enterprises, and in light of their funds availability and credit circumstances, the introduction of relatively expensive low-pollution vehicles is going to require policy incentives. In terms of specific support measures for enterprises and individuals shifting purchases to low-pollution vehicles: (1) tax incentives such as reducing vehicle tax and vehicle acquisition tax, and corporate and individual income tax deductions, etc.; (2) the use of fiscal investment and loans; and (3) the use of a lease system, etc. are being considered. In addition, (4) a fixed-rate-interest subsidy from the Japan Trucking Association; support measures from local governing bodies; and (6) other indirect support measures are conceivable as well. (1) Tax Incentives Automobile Tax (Local Tax) - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce the rate of the automobile tax for electric vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994 - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce the rate of the automobile tax for methanol vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994 -Establishing a measure to reduce the rate of the automobile tax for hybrid vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) for FY1993 and FY1994 (period applicable) - Reducing the vehicle tax by to half for 12 months following a purchase when a diesel vehicle (truck or bus) manufactured prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas regulations is scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle conforming to the latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991 (period applicable) Vehicle Acquisition Tax (Local Tax) - Presently 5% of acquisition price for private vehicles and 3% for business vehicles - Extending (the period applicable) the 2% reduction in the acquisition tax applied to methanol vehicles to FY1993 and FY1994 - Establishing a new measure to reduce the acquisition tax 2% for hybrid vehicles for FY1993 and FY1994 (the period applicable) - Providing 1% reduction when a diesel vehicle (truck or bus) manufactured prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas regulations is scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle conforming to the latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991. Corporate Tax (National Tax) - Will implement tax incentives against the nominal price of a vehicle in line with those in MITI's system of tax measures to promote new technology investment by medium and small enterprises (known as the Mechatronic Tax System) and its system of tax measures to promote investment to deal with changes in energy and the environment (known as the Energy and Environment Tax System) (For reference) MITI System of Tax Measures To Promote New Technology System Investment by Medium and Small Enterprises (popularly referred to as the Mechatronic Tax System) - Authorizes a special depreciation for medium and small enterprise purchases of the latest mechatronic equipment, 30% over the ordinary depreciation for that business year (36% for imported equipment), or a corporate tax credit (on purchases above ¥1.6 million per unit, up to 20% of the amount of corporate tax) of 7% of the revenue tax (8.4% for imported equipment) - For leases as well, in addition to allowing lease fees to be treated as deductible, as a method of reducing taxes, it is possible under the Mechatronic Tax System to take a tax deduction of 7% of the basic lease charge (total lease fees x 60%). (For reference) Tax System To Promote Investment To Handle Changes in Energy and the Environment (popularly referred to as the Energy and Environment Tax System) - Authorizes a special depreciation of 30% for that business year on purchases of equipment to counter energy and environmental changes (of more than ¥1.6 million for things like vehicle internal combustion engines which conform to the FY1990 automobile exhaust gas regulations, etc.), or a corporate tax credit of 7% of the acquisition amount (up to 20% of the corporate tax amount for that fiscal year) - Authorizes under depreciated amounts to be carried forward for 1 year (2) Use of Fiscal Investment and Loans - Enable the use of low interest loans from the Japan Development Bank and the Small Business Finance Corporation to obtain vehicles (interest rate long-term prime rate minus 0.5-0.8%) (3) Use of Lease System If a lease system is used, the leasing company assumes the burden for the funding to purchase the low-pollution vehicle and the user gets by with just paying a monthly lease fee. A further advantage to leasing is that the full amount of the cost of the item can be treated as deductible within the period of the lease. Consequently, if the lease period is shorter than the legal service life (within the limits of Ministry of Finance notification), it has the effect of saving taxes. Also, since cost is centralized in the monthly lease fee, it is simple to get a handle on the current value. Figure (For Reference) Institutional Leasing An equipment procurement measure referred to as leasing is a system devised by MITI in its attempts to rationalize and modernize medium and small enterprises based on the determination that it is very effective in terms of promoting popularization and expanding use of specific equipment and functions. The ``National Standard of Living Equipment Lease'' which covered ``voluntary-chain'' equipment and ``cold-chain'' equipment, etc., with financial debenture underwriting measures in 1970 was the start of institutional leasing. Institutional leasing subsequently developed into ``Leasing To Promote Popularization of New Machinery and Equipment, etc.'' Relatively low-interest financing for facilities and equipment for which the promotion of popularization is desirable in terms of the national economy is made available to lease companies using capital derived from financial debenture underwriting measures as the source of funding. As a result, lease users end up being able to make use of designated equipment for a relatively inexpensive lease fee. These institutional leases have continued from 1972 up to the present as leases covered by financing from the Japan Development Bank, a government-affiliated finance institution. Institutional Lease Arrangement Financed by Japan Japan Development Bank Lease Financing System Coverage (Equipment) Items covered by institutional leasing: ``social welfare equipment''; ``point of sales (POS) systems''; ``automatic gas cut-off devices for liquid propane (LP) gas''; ``social welfare equipment for the home''; and ``satellite broadcasting and receiving systems.'' Financing for 35-40% of the cost of an item is received from the Japan Development Bank. Japan Development Bank Financing is received in various other categories: - 1. Aircraft - 2. Aircraft Facilities and Equipment - 3. Data Processing, Communications Enhancement - 4. Import System Upgrade (equipment required to facilitate imports) - 5. Equipment To Improve Energy Usage (e.g., co-generation systems, etc.) - 6. Distribution Systemizing (machinery and equipment to improve distribution) - 7. Regional Development Equipment - 8. New Technology Development Equipment - 9. Pollution-Prevention Equipment - 10. Equipment To Facilitate Measures To Counter NOx System To Promote Popularization of Co-generation Systems (Enterprises Covered) Enterprises installing co-generation systems (including leasing firms as well), for which promotion of popularization is recognized as particularly necessary in striving for efficient use of energy. (Equipment Covered) Gas-turbine-type, gas-engine-type and diesel-engine-type co-generation systems with primary energy utilization efficiency of 60% or higher. (Financing Ratio) Forty percent of the item price (although there are fluctuating factors, rate is 1% below the long-term prime rate) Finance Arrangement Diagram (For Reference) Lease Subsidy System Begun by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 1979 in order to increase consumption of domestic agricultural and marine products, in this system part of the lease fee is subsidized by the Food Industry Center, Inc. in cases where food manufacturers introduce new machinery on a lease basis. In other words, a ``lease subsidy system'' was begun. Once a subsidy is determined the Food Industry Center pays the leasing company a subsidy twice a year. Based on these subsidy payments, the user deducts an equivalent amount from his payments and then pays the leasing company. When the interest equivalent on the cost of the item in the lease fee is calculated in terms of annual interest, it is lowered approximately 2% with the subsidy. In FY1987, the Forestry Agency initiated a subsidy system. This was done in an attempt to facilitate the introduction, through leasing, of equipment to increase artificial drying of lumber, mainly domestic lumber and wood products, to improve the distribution of lumber. In this system the Japan Lumber Stockpile Organization subsidizes a portion of the lease fee when lumber drying equipment is introduced by leasing. Similar to the Food Industry Center mentioned earlier, a subsidy is paid to the leasing company and the user bears responsibility for the remainder of the fee. In FY1990, coverage was expanded to apply as well to computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) equipment among the equipment to improve lumber distribution. In 1990 MITI's ANRE initiated a subsidy system. Under this system a subsidy for part of the lease fee is received from the Federation of Gasoline Retailers and Petroleum Associations in cases where equipment relating to restructuring is introduced through leasing. Unlike the two systems cited earlier, the subsidy is paid to the user. Diagrams of the various subsidy arrangements are given below: Food Industry Subsidy Lease Credit Insurance System This is a national insurance system established in 1973 as a system to supplement the credit access of medium and small enterprises in order for them to use leasing on advantageous terms. In substance, the item insured is stipulated and the leasing company concludes an insurance contract with the government covering the lease contract, and in the event of default such as non-payment of the lease fees, etc., the government provides compensation of approximately 50% of the amount of default. The contracting party in the current lease credit insurance system is the Small Enterprise Credit Insurance Corporation which took over on behalf of the government in October of 1984 from the Machinery Insurance Division of MITI's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau. This system not only supplements the credit access for medium and small enterprises, the insurance money is paid promptly upon contract of the insurance, is virtually as efficient as a no-interest loan, and it also has the advantage of low insurance rates, etc. Leasing of Aircraft for Overseas Markets As part of the measures to deal with Japan's favorable balance of international payments in 1978 (the so-called surplus reduction) under the leadership of MITI, the leasing companies implemented emergency imports of aircraft and then leased them to foreign airline companies. Under this arrangement the leasing companies purchase aircraft and plants, etc. from abroad using the emergency import foreign currency loan system of the Import-Export Bank of Japan, and then provide them under lease to various countries. It had the effect of succeeding in reducing the surplus amidst growing criticism from a number of countries, and of contributing to economic cooperation as well. (4) Fixed-Rate-Interest Subsidies The Japan Trucking Association, a trucking industry group, also has implemented a fixed-rate-interest subsidy for replacement purchases of vehicles which conform to the latest regulations, and low-pollution vehicles will be covered by these subsidies as well. (5) Local Government Body Support Measures Local government bodies will provide support to private enterprises purchasing low-pollution vehicles. (For Reference) Measure of the Environment Agency to promote the introduction of electric vehicles: ``Pollution-Related Health Damage Compensation and Prevention Foundation Subsidy'' (since FY1988) (1) Foundation Details The Pollution-Related Health Damage Compensation and Prevention Foundation acts as a source of funds derived from contributions made from the standpoint of social responsibility by parties who are sources of atmospheric pollution, as well as those who are connected with the sources of atmospheric pollution, and provides prescribed-amount subsidies to local public organizations engage in the following undertakings: (i) local public organizations purchasing their own electric vehicles (ii) local public organizations providing subsidies to private enterprises, etc. purchasing the electric vehicles (2) Areas Covered (47 areas): Chiba; 23 Wards of Tokyo; Yokohama; Kawasaki; Fuji; Nagoya; Tokai; Yokkaichi; Mie Prefecture, Mie District, Kusunoki; Osaka; Sakai; Toyonaka; Suita; Morinaga; Yao; Higashi Osaka, Kobe; Kobe; Amagasaki; Nishinomiya; Ashiya; Kurashiki; Tamano; Bizen; Kita Kyushu and Omuta.
