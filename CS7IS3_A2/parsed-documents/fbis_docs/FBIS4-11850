"All Palestinian prisoners are our responsibility, whether they belong to (the Islamic Resistance Movement) Hamas or not," Sha'th told AFP. "The question of the release of prisoners will be examined today (Sunday) or tomorrow, and the Hamas prisoners remain the main problem," Sha'th said, adding that the releases would take place in stages after an accord to launch Palestinian autonomy was signed. Israel and the PLO started intensive negotiations here Sunday to launch Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho within 10 days, after a break of five weeks because of the Hebron massacre. Israel has freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners since the autonomy negotiations began last October. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced Sunday that more Palestinian prisoners would be freed and others who had been deported or fled would be allowed to return to the territories. "These measures will concern only those wanted or expelled, who do not have blood on their hands, grassroots militants and not frontline political leaders," he said. A Foreign Ministry official said the majority of the 10,000 Palestinians still in Israeli jails would be released in several stages.
