The biggest beneficiary was Britain, which is to get ECU3.377 billion (3.7 billion dollars), followed by France (ECU3.203 billion -- 3.5 billion dollars) and Germany (ECU1.942 billion -- 2.14 billion dollars). The money comes in addition to the ECU141 billion (155 billion dollars) which the EC will spend on economic development in the poorest parts of the EC -- known as Objective 1 areas -- between 1994 and 1999. Objective 1 areas include pockets of depression throughout the EC plus most of Spain and all of Ireland, Greece and Portugal. The money divided up on Wednesday will go to other areas in the EC. It is earmarked to fight long-term unemployment by helping young people adapt to the labour market along with others long excluded from the workplace, and to help workers adapt to industrial change. According to the latest official figures, unemployment in the EC is running at over 10.7 percent and is expected to peak at 11.5 percent in mid-1995.
