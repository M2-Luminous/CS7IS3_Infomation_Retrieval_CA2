Participants of international meetings including the international hearing on sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army and the 49th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights denounced the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in driving millions of Korean young and middle-aged people like beasts of burden and murdering over a million Korean people and making fortunes by carrying away a large amount of resources and valuable cultural relics. At a meeting of the sub-commission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities, a representative of the Liberation Organization said that the Japanese imperialists had drafted over six million Korean young and middle-aged people to work them hard and its government and military deprived the Koreans of their language and names and forced them to worship the Japanese emperor. Lourder Indai Sajor, coordinator of the Asian women human rights council task force for Filipino victims of military sexual slavery by Japan, said that the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in depriving women of their rights and reducing them to sexual slaves were most hideous anti-human, special-class crimes without parallel in history, that they were heinous crimes against human rights and humanity in view of international law. Campton Makamure, chairman of the Zimbabwe Association of Democratic Jurists, said that the Japanese imperialists established a medieval colonial rule after occupying Korea and murdered over a million Korean people in cold blood and drafted nearly 200,000 innocent Korean women as sexual slaves of the Japanese Army. "If Japan really has the intention to improve its relations with the DPRK and contribute to world peace and security, it must repent of and apologize for its past crimes and show its sincerity in practice," he urged.
