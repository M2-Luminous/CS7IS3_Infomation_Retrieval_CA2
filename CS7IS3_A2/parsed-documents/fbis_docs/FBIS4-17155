Echoes of the struggle for ownership were also manifest 19 April at the final phase of the parliamentary hearings at the State Duma. There were political attacks from Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputies and Communists, extremist assessments, and so forth. Nonetheless, the overwhelming sentiment was more favorable than before, and there was a more businesslike attitude to the results of voucher privatization and the problems of "monetary" privatization. Rather, opponents are persuaded of the futility of trying to change any aspect of the pace and terms of voucher privatization before 1 July -- when voucher privatization comes to an end. Probably the only real threat to the privatizers' plans comes from the proposals to exclude fuel and energy complex property from the auction program at the final stage of the voucher auctions and, after 1 July, to declare a temporary moratorium on privatization so as to "take stock, think everything through," and "not repeat past mistakes." Anatoliy Chubays dealt with the familiar arsenal of accusations about the "wholesale" nature of privatization (there was even a new version -- "blitzkrieg") using arguments and normative document paragraphs that are also familiar. After the hearings A. Chubays told journalists about the task set by Viktor Chernomyrdin of submitting a draft law on the monetary phase of privatization to the government by 1 May. "Work however you like -- even day and night," was Chernomyrdin's parting shot to the special commission, "but make sure that there are no shocks when the vouchers are exchanged for rubles." To be frank, the timetable is very tight. All the more so as, in the opinion of commission head Chubays, two documents will have to be drawn up -- a law which parliament should ratify, and a second version, in the shape of a presidential edict, in the event of any possible holdups. I asked Anatoliy Chubays whether it is possible to hope for even one-tenth of the amount of privatization at the new stage after 1 July. "Of course," he replied, "there are some natural reasons for the slowing of the pace -- there is far less demand for privatization for money than there was for privatization by voucher. But this will not mean a halt; it will merely be a different kind of privatization. I am confident, though, that the reduction will not be tenfold, but far less."
