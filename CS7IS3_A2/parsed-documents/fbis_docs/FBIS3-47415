"In the advent of the new world order, which will be dominated by new regionalism and economic hegemonism, the only way for the Korean people to survive is to attain early unification of their country," Yi told a New Year's press conference. Declaring that South-North economic cooperation is the only way for both Koreas to survive in the world economic war, Yi urged the Seoul Government to pursue a parallel policy of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and inter-Korean economic cooperation. He suggested that South and North Korea open special areas for investment by both sides. "The Democratic Party placed its overall goal for this year on preparing national systems for the era of internationalization," Yi said. The party will work for political reform for clean politicking, reorganization of government agencies to cope with internationalization, reform for economic structural organization, stability in ordinary citizen's lives and measures for farmers and fishermen, he said. It will also try to realize an "era of localization," prepare for unification, and establish educational, cultural and environmental policies for the 21st century, Yi said. With regard to the reorganization of government agencies, Yi said that the country could no longer expect to boost its competitive strength under current economic policy, which is only preoccupied with statistics for economic growth. In order to open the way for revitalizing the economy, the country has to reorganize and strengthen govenment agencies in trade, science and technology, education and information fields, he said. Yi proposed the formation of an emergency "pan-national" economic conference to be participated in by the government, political parties and economic organizations to solidify national strength. He placed the party's top priority on stabilizing consumer prices and recommended a freeze on utility costs and other public fees, a reduction of value added tax, improvement for commodity distribution systems and cuts in production costs. Pledging the opposition party to try its utmost to block the opening of the rice market to imports, Yi demanded that the government cancel the uruguay round of trade talks and renegotiate agreements on agricultural and livestock trade. The Democratic Party will never ratify the Uruguay Round agreement at the National Assembly, Yi said. Commenting on a move to merge opposition parties, Yi said the Democratic Party will do its best to gather all opposition forces. He also called for an extraordinary session of the National Assembly to discuss issues the legislature could not handle during the just-ended regular session. The issues include the so-called Dec. 12, 1979, coup d'etat-like incident, irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup program, and amendment of political laws.
