FR941020-2-00101 FR941020-2-00060 On August 4, 1994, a notice of the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances in Schedules I and II was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 39790). All interested persons were invited to comment on or before September 6, 1994. The following comments were received. Two companies commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota for amphetamine is insufficient to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for export requirements and the maintenance of reserve stocks. Based on current 1994 manufacturing quotas, the 1995 FDA estimate of medical need, and export requirements, the DEA increased the 1995 initial aggregate production quota for amphetamine. A company commented that the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quota for levo-desoxyephedrine is insufficient to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for export requirements and the maintenance of reserve stocks. After a review of the 1994 manufacturing quota, the 1995 FDA estimate of medical need and other data, the DEA has determined that no adjustment is necessary at this time. Two companies commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota for methylphenidate is insufficient to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States and for the maintenance of reserve stocks. Based on 1994 manufacturing quotas, 1993 year-end inventories, the 1995 FDA estimate of medical need and research and development requirements, the DEA adjusted the initial 1995 aggregate production quota for methylphenidate accordingly. Pertaining to Sufentanil, one company commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota is insufficient to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States. The DEA reviewed all available information and adjusted the initial 1995 aggregate production quota for Sufentanil. Another company commented that the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quotas for hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone (for conversion) are insufficient to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States. After a review of 1994 manufacturing quotas and research and product development requirements, the DEA has determined that increases are necessary to meet medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interest must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined that this actions does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by ยง0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby orders that the 1995 initial aggregate production quotas, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base, be established as follows.
