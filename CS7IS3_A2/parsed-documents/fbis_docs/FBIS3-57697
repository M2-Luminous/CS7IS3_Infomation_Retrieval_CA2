The sub-machine guns, pistols, and anti-aircraft guns and missiles in question cost Estonia $60 million. Israel has pledged to supply weapons until the end of 1995 and Estonia will pay for them before the year 2000. This deal once caused a scandal in parliament because the contract for the supply of such a costly consignment of weapons was kept secret. Government officials quickly came up with a justification: The accelerated withdrawal of the Russian troops was, it is claimed, linked specifically to the appearance of "Uzi" sub-machine guns in the Estonian army. Our lads took fright and left.
