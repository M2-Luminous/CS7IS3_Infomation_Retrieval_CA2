The Foreign Ministry has explained what this measure means: [Begin Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro recording] El Salvador was not excluded due to a lack of preference or as a political measure against the country. This was a measure to provide an opportunity to countries that have a lower number of immigrants in the United States. [end recording] This decision does not in any way affect the treatment Salvadorans receive in the United States. [Begin Alfaro recording] This does not mean any delay, because there is the [word indistinct] program, which grants Salvadorans the possibility of working while it is in effect. It was previously known as the [word indistinct]. In this case, I think this is directed more toward citizens of countries of Eastern Europe, Africa, or other continents. [end recording] The deputy foreign minister also announced the creation of a tourist card for U.S. citizens who want to visit the country. [Begin Alfaro recording] This will benefit the country not only concerning immigration, but it will also help tourism. This will enable anyone to buy a tourist card with dollars. [end recording] The card might cost $10 and will be sold at travel agencies and U.S. airports. It is hoped it will become effective before the end of President Cristiani's term.
