Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called it "a small step in the history of military aviation" as the four European partners paraded their dream before senior figures from potential future customers. Officials from Saudi Arabia, Japan and Malaysia watched Eurofighter's impressive international public debut alongside existing customers at the opening ceremony at British Aerospace's Warton site in Lancashire. About 1,500 leading figures in the aerospace industry saw the unveiling of the aircraft which is developed jointly by Britain (33 percent), Germany (33 percent), Italy (21 percent) and Spain (13 percent). The Eurofighter will eventually replace the RAF's [Royal Air Force] Jaguars, Tornado F3s and defunct Phantoms and will be the most advanced fighter in the world apart from the American F-22, which will be several years later entering service and twice as expensive. The project is also crucially important for the aviation industries of the four countries as it is sustaining a total of 150,000 jobs. "It is a major part of our industry priority and offers hope of employment for many tens of thousands of people along the length and breadth of the UK," said Mr Rifkind. ``We are all privileged today to be taking part in a small step in the history of military aviation and to see a little bit of history being born before our eyes. It is always a romantic and remarkable event when a new aircraft takes to the sky and pushes forward yet further the boundaries of aviation technology.'' As defence budgets tumble in Europe, the four industrial partners are looking for multi-billion pound sales elsewhere, particularly the Middle East and Far East, in the early part of the next century. But Eurofighter's primary role will be to defend the skies of Europe for the first 30 years of the next century. However, the partner nations today warned industry to check the soaring costs of the project, with German state secretary of defence Joerg Schoenbohm saying no extra funds were available. "It is a particular desire of the German defence minister to lower the costs of this project," he said. Mr Schoenbohm said Germany would not decide until next year whether to go ahead and buy the aircraft. The German defence minister Volker Ruehe, who two years ago almost pulled Germany out of the project, was noticeable by his absence at the unveiling. Spanish armaments director Juan Arenas said the project represented a "very high cost" and they had to be very careful about every peseta invested. "We cannot allow ourselves to spend more than our national economies are able to afford. You must always keep this in mind." Mr Rifkind added: "We all have interest in bringing down costs in a sensible way."
