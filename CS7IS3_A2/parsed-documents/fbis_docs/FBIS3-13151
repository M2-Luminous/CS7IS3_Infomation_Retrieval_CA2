In an exclusive interview with Palestinian reporters at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Peres said that if talks are held on the final stage, the two sides will reach more documents and papers but the situation on the ground will not change. Instead, he called for concluding the negotiations within several days and implementing the transfer of power, including the arrival of the Palestinian leadership and police force, so that they would take charge of the situation in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Peres said that subsequently it will be possible to negotiate over expanding the area of Palestinian control, whereby it will include all the occupied territories. Afterward, talks will begin on the final status. In response to the journalists' questions about disarming the settlers and negotiating on settlement activity and international protection, Peres said that those steps pose complications because Rabin's government relies on a one-vote majority in the Knesset. Despite this, Peres believes that acceptance of the Gaza-Jericho plan, which he described as a first step, will lead to a tangible change among the Palestinian people. Regarding the continuation of settlement activity and the confiscation of land, Peres vehemently denied that land confiscation was continuing except for street expansion and nature protection. When one of the journalists presented him details of land confiscation, Peres said that he would study the issue. With regard to evacuating the settlers from Hebron, Peres said that he would state his position on this issue in the cabinet meetings, but he added that there were legal problems in terms of evacuating the settlers en masse. In answer to a question about whether it was possible to vacate the Hebron bus station, taken over by the Israeli Army since 1980, Peres said that he would study the matter. During the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, Peres tried to persuade the journalists to defend the peace process, saying that it was the best practical means for achieving Palestinian demands and aspirations. Peres expressed understanding of the Palestinian position's dilemma. He said that anyone who participates in a peace process will lose popularity because peace requires concessions from both parties. It is common knowledge that concessions do not increase the leadership's popularity. Peres urged the Palestinian people to support 'Arafat despite all the difficulties. He said that the Palestinian people should be more supportive of 'Arafat, because he has given them something tangible by negotiating cleverly. Every Palestinian leader in the past failed to do this, and the Palestinian problem had remained in limbo. [passage omitted] In answer to a question about the UN Security Council deliberations, Peres said that Israel's objection to applying the Geneva Conventions to the occupied territories stems from the fact that Jerusalem has been included in the resolution. This is opposed by Israel, because it considers Jerusalem to be part of Israel, not part of the occupied territories. On whether a meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was possible, Peres said that they will meet to sign the agreement and not earlier, but contacts are under way on different levels and through different channels.
