FR940527-0-00063 FR940527-0-00023 JAMES MADISON MEMORIAL FELLOWSHIP FOUNDATION 45 CFR Chapter XXIV Fellowship Program Requirements AGENCY: James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The following are the regulations governing the annual competition for James Madison Fellowships and the obligations of James Madison Fellows. They replace the Foundation's former rule published in the Federal Register on March 2, 1992 (57 FR 7321&hyph;7326), which implemented the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act of 1986. These revised regulations govern the qualifications and applications of candidates for fellowships; the selection of Fellows by the Foundation; the graduate programs Fellows must pursue; the conditions attached to awards; the Foundation's annual Summer Institute on the Constitution; and related requirements and expectations regarding fellowships. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation, 2000 K Street NW., suite 303, Washington, DC 20006&hyph;1809. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James M. Banner, Jr. (202) 653&hyph;8700. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule exactly reproduces the text of the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16585). Since only one comment to that proposed rule was received and that one without substantive suggestions, no alteration in the proposed rule is required. The James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act authorizes fellowship support for graduate study by teachers of American history and social studies and by college seniors or college graduates who wish to become teachers of the same subjects. However, in order not to exclude from consideration for James Madison Fellowships those teachers or would-be teachers whose current or future secondary school instruction, while concerning the usual subjects covered by courses in American history and social studies, may be carried on in courses entitled ``government'' or similar names, this rule, like the former rule, goes beyond the Act to apply to those teachers and would-be teachers who do or will offer secondary school instruction in American government. List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 2400 Education, Fellowships.
