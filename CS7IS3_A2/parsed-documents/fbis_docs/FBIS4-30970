It is known who killed Reihl-Kir, Saban, Krivokuca and the Zec family'" (FERAL TRIBUNE, No. 449, 25 April 1994). The RH Supreme Court reports that in "connection with the killing of the Zec family, criminal proceedings have been completed, that criminal proceedings are underway in connection with the murder of Reihl-Kir, and that so far criminal proceedings have not been instituted in connection with the murders of Saban and Krivokuca." The news release of the RH Supreme Court states: ``The verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now zupanija court in Zagreb), as the court in the first instance, dated 9 July 1992 (VI-K-104/92-86), in its acquittal section, based on Article 350, Point 3, of the Law on Criminal Procedure (now Article 340, Point 3), acquitted the accused Sinisa Rimac of the charges of having murdered Mihajlo Zec on 7 December 1991 and of having committed the murder of Marija Zec and Aleksandra Zec on 8 December together with the accused Munib Suljic, Igor Mikola, Nebojsa Hodak, and Snezana Zivanovic; that is, it was not proven that they committed the crimes of murder under Article 35, Paragraph 1, of the KZRH [RH Criminal Code] (now Article 34, Paragraph 1), which they were charged with. ``The state's attorney did not appeal the acquittal section of the verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija court in Zagreb), so that this verdict became final with respect to that portion. Thus, the RH Supreme Court, as the court of appeals, deliberated in this criminal case, in a session held on 8 June 1993, only the appeals of the defendants Munib Suljic and Sinisa Rimac, filed against the conviction section of that verdict, in which the Zec family was not the victim (IKz. 1270/92-3). ``With respect to that criminal case, the RH Supreme Court also ruled on the request of the RH state's attorney for protection of legality, filed on 8 March 1993, against the decision of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija court in Zagreb) on 26 March 1992 (Kio-I-35/91), and in a session held on 14 July 1993 it rejected in its verdict the request for protection of legality as unfounded, since it established that there was no violation of the law to which the state's attorney referred in his request (KzZ-7/93-3). ``In connection with the murder of Josip Reihl-Kir, we report that the district public prosecutor's office in Osijek (now the district state's attorney's office in Osijek) issued an indictment on 25 March 1993 (Kt-148/91), amended in writing on 12 April 1994, and initiated criminal proceedings against the defendant Antun Gudelj, who is at large and inaccessible to state authorities, for three cases of perfidious murder (when Josip Reihl-Kir was murdered) under Article 35, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH (now Article 34, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5) and one crime of attempted perfidious murder under Article 35, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH, related to Article 19, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH [Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia] (now Article 34, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH in connection with Article 17, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH). Criminal proceedings are still underway, since the accused, according to information in the file, is in Australia or Canada, and so up to now, in spite of an international warrant, has not been accessible to the state authorities and has not been extradited. ``An inquiry has established that during criminal proceedings no attempt was made to influence or pressure the courts and judges who tried the cases and rendered decisions in these cases. ``As for the murders of Saban and Krivokuca, according to a report of the presiding judges of the zupanija courts of jurisdiction, criminal proceedings have not so far been instituted,'' states the news release of the RH Supreme Court. In conclusion the Supreme Court says that "the courts are organized as bodies of judiciary authority, which they perform independently and self-sufficiently within the competence defined by law. All unfounded objections contrary to this operation of the courts we judge to be harmful both to the system of the independent and self-sufficient judiciary and also to the creation of basic conditions for building Croatia as a law-governed state," states the press release signed by Milan Vukovic, presiding judge of the RH Supreme Court.
