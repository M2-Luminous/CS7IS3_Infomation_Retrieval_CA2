This meant that the persons who opened fire at the vehicle did not intend to harm any of the passengers, especially as the passengers were walking toward the bus and were about 20 meters from it, and no one attempted to intercept them. The source explained that some workers had been dismissed from the plant, and it is possible that they may have carried out some actions in order to inflict damage on the plant. The security source said that the Western media have hastened in an unprecedented manner to exaggerate the incident and guess at the identity of the perpetrators. These media did not find in the minibus anything to satisfy their desire to distort the state of security and stability in Egypt, so they reported that it was a tourist bus. The source called on the Western media to be accurate in reports that could harm the country's interests. The source affirmed that the Interior Ministry issues accurate statements about any incident.
