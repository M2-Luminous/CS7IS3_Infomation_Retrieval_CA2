In the past, the government of General Suchinda Khraprayun also cited the need for joint efforts to develop the country's democratic system as a pretext to justify its actions. Worse still, the Democrats often arrogantly attack any peaceful activities calling for democracy. We stated on several occasions that we do not agree with Chalat Worachat in using a hunger strike to push for the observance of the major "principle" of democracy. However, we do agree with the "essence" of his demands. Although we disagree with his method, we, with unbiased and fair perception, believe that Chalat has chosen the hunger strike as a means to create strong agitation in society so that he can attract the people's attention to the struggle for genuine democracy, the "principle" which requires the participation of the people in every aspect of the democratization process such as in drafting a constitution, the decentralization of power and election of provincial governors. Chalat's maneuver would have failed and received no support from any party had the present government faithfully followed the fundamental "principle" of the democratic system in compliance with the aspirations of the people who voted in the general election on the 13 September 1992. The people clearly stated that they want the present government to do away with all conditions and obstacles that hampered the development of the democratic system and that had been the cause of the bloodshed in May 1992. The five parties in the coalition government had all pledged and promised the people that they would amend the Constitution to make it more democratic. But, none have honored their words. Recently, the Democrat Party, the core of the coalition government, has shown no signs of respecting public opinion. Indulging in power, the Democrats believe that they and their colleagues represent correctness. We are extremely disappointed with the unconstructive, inhumane, and unBuddhistlike behavior of Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, who compared Chalat's hunger strike to a robbery and said that Chalat will die for nothing. The prime minister, who is also the leader of the Democrat Party, can best use the "principle" he has been adhering to for 23 years to judge whether or not such statements should be uttered by an MP from his honorable party. We can recall the political confusion and several conflicts of opinion triggered by the impolite and inappropriate statements of this minister in the past. In attempting to end the crisis, the prime minister simply clings tightly to the "principle" he claims to be correct and overrides the problem. He has no courage to initiate any political move and just allows the conflict to be further aggravated, while his subordinates keep adding fuel to the fire and provoking , with statements against those who chose peaceful means to pursue their causes. The prime minister is reputed for his firm adherence to principle. This is one of the good characteristics of a leader of the country. However, if his adherence to the principle is aimed at preserving his premiership for as long as possible, he is then a selfish person. It is the obsolete principle which often causes abnormal problems in the country. We are extremely disappointed with the prime minister and the Democrat Party for they have paid no attention to the valuable suggestion from Dr. Prawet Wasi. The well respected Dr. Prawet has recommended that the whole political system be reformed so as to avoid violent confrontation and so that "Chuan, Chalat, and the country can all survive." Instead of listening to the advice, the Democrat Party has resorted to all kinds of political tricks including lying and setting up pro-government mobs. In short, the Democrat Party is behaving as the government of General Suchinda Khraprayun did before the latter was ousted by the people. The behavior of leaders of the Democrat Party has so far clearly proven their cunning and insincerity. They will not hesitate to do anything to keep the parties in the coalition and the opposition bloc and private organizations under their thumb. They will use their own yardstick, which they call "principle." Those who rebel are labelled as trouble makers. Such an attitude is identical to that of past "rulers" who also labelled themselves as the yardstick of society and forced everyone to accept their criteria. Obstinate politicians must be stopped now. We are now at the brink of the dead spot of democracy, which was earned from the blood of the fallen heroes in the May incident. Otherwise, the scenario of "Chuan survives, Chalat dies, and the country is divided," will eventually become reality.
