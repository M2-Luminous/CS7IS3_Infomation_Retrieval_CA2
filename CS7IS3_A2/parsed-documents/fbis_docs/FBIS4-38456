"This agreement will be signed by the Presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow," said the press-secretary of the Azeri Embassy in Moscow, Farhad Agamalyev. He mentioned that an agreement was scheduled to be signed by the end of May. However, the Armenian party demanded a simultaneous discussion of both the ceasefire and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. "Such a proposal contradicts Russian settlement plan. The Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, organised a meeting between the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Russia and tried to achieve a ceasefire [as] an important condition for the beginning of political dialogue at the highest level. Given the situation, Azeri Defense Minister Mamedov refused to sign the document and Russia must review the draft of the agreement", said Agamalyev. Talking about the negative reaction by the Azeri opposition to the Russian plan, Agamalyev said that "the opposition's concern is clear, but one has to assess the situation realistically. The CSCE does not have its own military force and mechanism which is able to put an end to the fighting in the region. If we wait for the CSCE, we will further worsen the situation in the conflict zone and we can loose additional territories", said the press-secretary. According to Agamalyev, the meeting between the presidents, where a major political agreement [as received] is due to take place in early June.
