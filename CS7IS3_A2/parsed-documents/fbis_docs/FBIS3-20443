Not long ago, Henry Kissinger visited Beijing with a message that he had been asked by Mrs Thatcher, at that time British prime minister, to transmit verbally to the Chinese leadership: "Mrs Thatcher indicated that it was not an idea of the British Government that the H&S Banking Corporation merge with the British Lloyds Bank, but that it was a business decision of the said bank itself, which thereby planned to extend its operations to Europe. It is for that reason that they will move headquarters to England, namely to London." The fact is that the said bank took the mentioned merger as a pretext for its actually moving away, and this only confirms the earlier opinion held by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Commission. At a conference discussing suitable countermeasures -- a conference presided over by Ji Pengfei -- it was the unanimous opinion that assent should be refused to the decision of the H&S Banking Corporation. The State Council informed Kissinger of this and requested him to transmit the information to Britain. The H&S Banking Corporation thereupon withdrew its decision to merge with the Lloyds Bank, but merely bought a parcel of Lloyds Bank shares. However, after the 4 June incident, the H&S Banking Corporation bought further shares of the Lloyds Bank, transferred its headquarters to London, and thus, in the end, did realized its intention of moving away. Since the H&S Banking Corporation occupied a decisive position in financial circles, its moving headquarters away from Hong Kong indicated a lack of confidence in China's policies, and this has had an adverse effect on the mood of Hong Kong residents. On the other hand, it is impossible for the said bank to completely withdraw from business dealings with Hong Kong and China. Its main profits come from Hong Kong and from business with the interior of China, a trade which has greatly developed following China's reform and opening up to the outside world. Before the H&S Banking Corporation moved away, the British Government of Hong Kong had gradually transferred some of the official central bank functions of the H&S Banking Corporation, such as its monetary administrative functions, to be exercised by another, separately established organization. This fact shows that Britain had all along never ceased dispositions with regard to the bank's withdrawal, and that it was only after the 4 June incident that the H&S Banking Corporation came out openly with its actual withdrawal. Although views differed as to whether the H&S Banking Corporation could effect a withdrawal, the attitude of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Committee toward the said bank remained one of close cooperation and active coordination, as a means of strengthening the said bank's confidence in the situation. Normal contacts were maintained with the two former presidents Shelby and Purves, cooperating in the recovery at the Hong Kong stock market and helping Hong Kong's medium-sized and small Chinese banks in their difficulties. In the formulation of the Basic Law it was also decided, so as to keep the H&S Banking Corporation from moving away, that the future government of the special administrative region of Hong Kong would not set up a central bank. The policies of allowing the H&S Banking Corporation, after 1997, to have certain central bank functions, allowing it to issue banknotes, operating with participation of the Bank of China, and other such policies, were to be maintained. After the H&S Banking Corporation had entered the Inner China market, Purves once told me that they had certain bad debts in the interior, which they could not recover, and he gave me some details. As soon as I heard of it, I immediately agreed to help them, asking to be informed of the particular items and circumstances, and we did help them in their negotiations in the interior. Later, certain problems were indeed resolved through these negotiations, but some could not be resolved, and I reported to him the circumstances of the negotiations, having him understand and telling him not to be concerned. This work had certainly shown some positive results for the H&S Banking Corporation. Beijing did not completely agree with us in the perception of the situation, and some of their measures were hard to explain. For instance, Li Peng (at that time vice chairman) did not solicit our opinion, also did not keep us informed, when he gave Rong Zhijian funds (Rong was in charge of the Hong Kong office of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation; he is the son of Rong Yiren [2837 3015 0088]), having him buy up in Hong Kong the shares of the China Light and Power Company of Hong Kong. When Rong was unable to do so, he bought the shares of the Guotai Company instead. This process of buying up shares had positive as well as negative effects. It may have a certain positive effect from the standpoint of holding back British capital. However, on the other hand, it will also create a certain anxiety among Hong Kong's general public: Is it the intention of Chinese capital with this "grandiose show of capabilities" to effect nationalization of enterprises through the buying-up of their shares? Will this buying up of shares not indeed effect a "lian" [uniting], then by controlling the shareholdings a "he" [merging], and finally the "guo" [nation] as in nationalization, thus truly achieving a "lian he guo" ["United Nations"]? Arousing this anxiety was detrimental to efforts to keep British capital from moving away and detrimental to creating a sense of stability that Chinese capital, Overseas Chinese capital, and foreign capital desired. Being supported by the their colonial government, the British-owned financial groups in Hong Kong were not only of a colonial character, but their character was also, to a certain extent, monopolistic. This was most evident in the public utilities and postal service, but also in telecommunications, resources, electric power, and other such undertakings. In the face of these facts it was our intention, in order to keep British finance from moving away, to maintain an attitude that did not altogether negate their monopolistic character, but to rather adopt a policy of restricting further amplifications. The problem of such restrictions was also not be solved by setting up laws or policies, or by administrative measures of the government, but rather by allowing the laws of the market to gradually take effect. When I once visited the Hongkong Telephone and Electric Light Company, they expressed to me their desire to invest in the interior and expand their business operations. I thereupon consulted the Chinese minister of posts and telecommunications on whether that company should be permitted to go into the interior to help improve the backward state of post and telecommunications services. We truly needed help from abroad, financially and technically. However, the minister would not agree to my proposal, as a matter of principle. He indicated that we already had four firms inside China, investing in telecommunications. Hong Kong has invested in Shenzhen, and was actively maneuvering to enter Jiangsu Province. He said his ministry opposed this kind of activity because it would result in a diversity of systems and great confusion, and he also inclined to refuse all further developments in matters of telecommunications investments. My efforts, thus, did not find his support. Generally speaking, efforts to keep British capital from moving away have had a certain effect, but results were not ideal.

On the announcement by China that it will recover its sovereignty over Hong Kong, some Chinese capitalists hurriedly moved their funds away, and the outflow of capital, as also the emigration of people, became increasingly serious. In the interest of Hong Kong's prosperity and of its economy, it became therefore critically necessary to assure the Chinese capitalists of the stability of the situation. We worked on this problem from a political as well as from an economic angle. In political respects, we worked for a broadening of the united patriotic front, and stressing the key points, tried to persuade the major capitalists, assuring them first of the stability of the situation, which in turn, we hoped, would have an effect on the other Chinese capitalists, and would achieve the objective of stabilizing a large sector or even the entire situation. At the same time, we employed economic means to support and help the Chinese capitalists, to dispel their anxieties and build up their confidence. Of course, it would not have been sufficient to rely merely on our work in Hong Kong; it was very important to be able to rely on China. China did persist in its policy of reforming and opening up to the outside world, of rapid development of the economy, and of making increasing use of Hong Kong. Of course, the attraction of China proper for Hong Kong was also increasing substantially. As a consequence, Chinese capitalists changed their views on China, and confidence rapidly increased. That was the general trend of the stabilization in Hong Kong. There were quite a few Chinese capitalists who relied on British support, since they had grown up with the support of British banks, but some of them also relied on support from China. China's support was political as well as --and that more importantly -- commercial support, but the two kinds were actually hard to separate from each other. Some capitalists were no doubt guided by purely commercial considerations. However, there were also those who were guided by political considerations or by both political and commercial considerations. We asked the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and organizations with Chinese capital funds to more effectively contribute to the work of stabilizing Chinese capital, and that they should broaden their cooperation with the Chinese capitalists and engage in business. We asked that they assist the Chinese capitalists with regard to sources of supplies, short-term loans, and that they also get the Chinese capitalists to invest in China proper. This policy would have been of benefit for both sides, as it would have meant profits for the merchants and would also have been helpful for China's reform and opening up by increasing exports, attracting capital funds, and introducing new technologies and managerial experiences. The arrival in Hong Kong of delegates from various Chinese provincial and municipal departments and commissions has been an important "resource" for stabilizing Chinese capital. Following the change in foreign trade policy, the various ministries and commissions of the central government, as well as the various provinces and municipalities, have shown a desire to trade by themselves in the products produced in their territories. They were eager to contact by themselves markets abroad, and this provided much opportunity for Chinese capital in Hong Kong, as it brought them the opportunity to act as agents for the sale of Chinese commodities, and to engage in either wholesale or retail business, and also to undertake other types of cooperation. We supported the move of various provinces and municipalities to have their departments or commissions set up organizations in Hong Kong and helped them by introducing connections. To induce Hong Kong's Chinese capitalists to invest in China proper, we organized several informatory trips by representative personalities from Hong Kong industry and commerce to important provinces and municipalities in China, so as to facilitate more mutual contacts and mutual understanding, and also to increase opportunities for mutual business relations. I personally led several of these groups on visits to Jiangsu, Fujian, Shanghai, and other places, where I requested leading cadres in these places to personally receive the visitors. For instance, one year in Jiangsu, it was provincial governor Gu Xiulian [7357 4423 5571] and in Shanghai Mayor Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046] who personally received the visitors, informed them of the situation and conditions, and replied to their questions. In the middle and later years of the 1980's, few major Hong Kong capitalists invested in China proper. Those who really went in were medium-sized and small firms. In order to get large and medium capitalists and shareholders to invest in China proper, also to dispel their anxieties and increase their confidence, we reorganized the stock ownership and functions of the "Hong Kong and Macao International," allotting to it as main task: to bring large and medium-sized capitalists from Hong Kong, Macao, and also Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia to China to invest in China. It might be done by adopting cooperative methods "to build bridges for them and pave the way for them," or they might also be helped in the resolution of their difficulties in their own independent business operations. Because soon after the reorganization the 4 June incident occurred, the reorganization was of little effect. We suggested that the Bank of China increase its business dealings with large and medium-sized firms. The work style of the Bank of China group in Hong Kong was staid and conservative. Targets of their lending activities were mainly medium-sized and small firms and industrial enterprises. Their work was quite successful, but the drawback was that they had few dealings with major firms. Considering the Bank of China group's development by itself, and starting out from the needs of united front work, everybody should expend greater effort and increase business contacts with the large firms. Of course, risks involved would be somewhat greater, but that should not stop the further pursuit of the reform. Acting in this way will lead to new developments in the business operations of the Bank of China, will increase contacts with large and medium-sized firms, and would, in the same manner as in the case of medium and small firms, through these contacts gradually, in the economic sphere, bring about a sense of stability also among these large- and medium-sized firms. The Sino-British Agreement stipulates that the use of land in Hong Kong must be approved by a land committee, and that approval must not be given for the sale in excess of 50 hectares per year. China established this principle on a directive from Deng Xiaoping: Britain should not be allowed to sell off all Hong Kong government land before 1997; there had to be a restriction. To facilitate Sino-British negotiations and the resolution of mutual problems, a special land committee was set up, and it was furthermore stipulated that half of the income from the sale of government land by the British Government of Hong Kong must be left for the use of the future government of the special administrative region. Hong Kong's real estate firms, especially the major ones, were very much in favor of this arrangement. They owned large tracts of land, and restrictions on the sale of government land would bring them, the real estate dealers, even higher profits in their business transactions. In business contacts that we have had with large real estate firms, some repeatedly requested us: "Don't let the Land Committee approve more land deals." Because there was this stipulation in the Sino-British Agreement about not approving too many land sales, and also since we really did not have any experience as to what effects our action could have in other respects, we did act in those few years essentially in accordance with the agreement. Although some more than permissible land sales might have been approved, the amount was small and has had some positive effect in enhancing the sense of stability among the large real estate firms. However, we soon also discovered that a few large real estate firms gradually came to constitute a kind of monopoly in Hong Kong's real estate market. I asked the Chinese members of the Land Committee, and also asked its investigation and research office, to study this problem and to determine what after all would be the desirable amount of land for which sales could be approved, particularly also in the coming years, because if too many land sales would be approved, it would depress land prices, while the approval of too few land sales would have the effect of demand exceeding supplies, and thereby causing steep rises in real estate prices. This task of assessing the proper limits was proposed by me after 1987, but I did not get to know the conclusions from this investigation.

When people started to loose confidence in the situation, some of the major shareholders of the Bank of East Asia wanted to withdraw their capital. This caused a dispute among the shareholders, and a French bank tried to take advantage of the situation and buy up the shares of the Bank of East Asia, which was thereby in great danger. It was then that the chairman of the board of directors, Li Guobao, sought help from the Bank of China. He approached the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and also approached me in the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY. After a study by the economic leading group of the Hong Kong Affairs Committee, it was decided to support the Bank of East Asia, and that the Bank of China should come forward to render assistance. Shares of the Bank of East Asia, held by the Bank of China, were not to be sold, and more of these shares should be acquired, to get Li Guobao out from his dangerous position. In the course of supporting Chinese capitalists by means of economic measures, it also happened that such action caused losses. The most serious case of this nature was the case of the Kangli Company. Shortly after I had come to Hong Kong, Cao Weilian [2580 1218 1670], deputy director of XINHUA SHE, in charge of economic affairs (a former vice minister in the Ministry of Machine Building and Electronics, a person with close links to Jiang Zemin) informed me that the Kangli Company was a large electronics enterprise in Hong Kong, and that its manager, Ke Junwen [2688 0193 2429], was a highly esteemed person with high ideals and great competence in business affairs. Ke himself also boasted that he will become Hong Kong's Konosuke Matsushita (the founder of the Matsushita enterprise in Japan, revered as the "God of Business"). Cao Weilian had hoped that Ke Junwen would visit China proper and place investments there, and Cao personally accompanied Ke on a visit to Fujian, Jiangsu, Beijing, and other places, and also introduced him to leading cadres in the central government; Gu Mu [6253 3668], a state counselor, also met him. Ke, then, proposed cooperation with Chinese capital, and after we studied his proposals, we also agreed with him, and would have three parties in Hong Kong, the Bank of China, Huarun, and China Merchants, jointly raise capital and cooperate with him. After all the capital was invested, Ke Junwen ran away. We investigated and found that he had also used the name of yet another company for large-scale transfers of Kangli capital and movable property. This was a serious lesson indeed. Later, experts from China assessed the value of Kangli's real estate and equipment and stated that its equipment was still very good, some of it even not yet available in China, so that the economic loss, fortunately, was not too serious. However, the continuous losses in business operations will be a burden for many years to come. Supporting Chinese capitalists in the development of their undertakings is also an important aspect. In 1986, Hu Yingxiang and Li Jiacheng [2621 0857 6134] came together to see me with a plan for the development of a stretch of ocean west of Hong Kong island and of Lantau Island, there to build a second airport. As one location being considered for the project was Chek Lap Kok Island, another was the area between Lantau Island and Hong Kong island. They were also planning to reclaim land from the sea between Lantau Island and Hong Kong and build a new harbor, a residential area, and a commercial area there, also submarine tunnels between Lantau Island and Hong Kong, and also between Lantau Island and Kowloon, and an express highway from Lantau Island to the new border port of Luomazhou. After listening to their plan, I fully concurred with them, convinced that this plan would not only satisfy Hong Kong's needs for sea, land, and air transportation in the 1990's, but also those of the first part of the 20th century, and that it would further enhance Hong Kong's function of import-export base in South China. I said: "This is a very good plan, it has to be reported to Beijing; I can be responsible to do that." I asked them: "Have you talked to the Hong Kong government? Better first talk to them and get their support." My concern was that since Hong Kong was still administered by the British Hong Kong Government, it stands to reason that so huge an engineering project would only be possible if it had that government's consent and support. I also suggested that they should not divulge the plan to outsiders before having clarified the position of the British Hong Kong government. Li Jiacheng asked Hu Yingxiang: "Do the reporters know about it?" Hu said he had already made arrangements to meet the press. I suggested not to do that, and Li Jiacheng agreed with me, but Hu persisted in doing it. As a consequence, after publicizing the plan to the press, there was no response at all from the British Hong Kong government, who apparently shelved the matter. After the 4 June incident, the British Hong Kong government came out with its own plan for building a new airport. I think things would have been quite different if Li and Hu had first solicited an opinion from the British Hong Kong government.

Foreign capital uses Hong Kong mainly to expand activities into Southeast Asia, especially into China. Since China's reform and opening up to the outside world, especially after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Statement, the position of Hong Kong as an intermediary, and as a springboard and bridge, has foreign capital increasingly recognize its usefulness and has foreign capital find Hong Kong increasingly attractive. Under these circumstances, the opportunity must not be lost for extensive and close contacts with the diplomatic agencies and commercial institutions in Hong Kong, stationed there by the various countries and territories, and we must assist them in gaining an understanding of China's policies and to resolve whatever difficulties they may have. That is one of the major tasks of the branch office of NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY. With this in mind, the said branch office instituted an internal division of labor: Main responsibility of the external affairs department was to maintain broadest contacts with the diplomatic organizations in Hong Kong, stationed there by the various countries and territories. The economics department had mainly to contact the commercial organizations of the various countries and some mass organizations, as for instance, the American General Chamber of Commerce. I myself had frequently accepted their invitations to meet with them, and, at their requests, had answered some of their questions. Foreign capital was at that time generally concerned about two problems: One was whether there could be a political change in China's Hong Kong policy, and, secondly, they resented the monopolistic position of British capital in Hong Kong, a situation which they hoped would be changed. For instance, bankers from other countries than Britain, stationed in Hong Kong, resented very much that the H&S Banking Corporation would enjoy many privileges of a central bank, but would not have the obligations of a central bank. Especially American and French banks expressed their criticism to the Hong Kong branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY and to the Chinese Government, and also expressed the hope that when China will formulate the Basic Law, it will include restrictions on Britain in the future monetary policy of what will be the government of the special administrative region. I was pondering how to take care as much as possible of the interests of foreign capital and how to satisfy their demands as far as possible without unduly offending the British Government and harming the interests of British capital. Some foreign-financed banks in Hong Kong are pressing for the right to issue banknotes. I positively suggested to Ji Pengfei and Zhao Ziyang [6392 4793 7122] to consider allowing American, Japanese, and French banks to participate to a limited amount in the issuing of banknotes, so as to give the Hong Kong currency a more international character. Later, the Basic Law included a provision of a decisive character, as it stipulated: "The right of issuing Hong Kong currency shall be a right of the Government of the Special Administrative Region. ... The Government of the Special Administrative Region...may confer the right to specially designated banks within legally prescribed limitations, which banks then may issue, or continue to issue, Hong Kong currency." Bankers of other nationalities stationed in Hong Kong have been quite satisfied with this arrangement. The basic law consultative committee had admitted as members and advisors several foreign capitalists and bankers, giving them a chance to state their opinions. As the economy of Hong Kong has developed, foreign capital has become increasingly active in Hong Kong, and it has become an absolutely indispensable matter, in the interests of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, to effectively deal with foreign capital. We had attached the greatest importance to our dealings with the capital funds held in Hong Kong by Overseas Chinese. Apart from devoting myself personally much effort to contacts with them on a broad scale, work was also done through relevant departments in China and organizations of Chinese capital in Hong Kong. The aim was to dispel their doubts and anxieties, affirm their resolve to make use of Hong Kong and to enter Hong Kong, to provide them with facilities, to cooperate with them, and to render service to them. Capital of Overseas Chinese refers mainly to the capital held in Hong Kong by the overseas Chinese of Southeast Asia. Some of the major overseas Chinese capitalists of Southeast Asia, such as Lin Shaoliang [2651 4801 5328] of Indonesia, Guo Henian [6753 7729 1628] of Malaysia, and Xie Guomin [6200 0948 3046] of Thailand, all have considerable investments in Hong Kong. That is so because, on the one hand, Hong Kong itself has its particular attractiveness, and, on the other hand, because of political considerations. For instance, Lin Shaoliang has close relations with Indonesia's president Soeharto, and at one time, when Soeharto's position had become shaky, Lin Shaoliang regarded Hong Kong as a safe haven for his capital. When the Malaysian Government for a time behaved anti-Chinese, the Chinese in Malaysia also often used Hong Kong as safe haven for their capital. Since China's reform and opening up, Overseas Chinese capital flowed through Hong Kong on its way to China proper; the Overseas Chinese had always attached great importance to the useful function of Hong Kong.
