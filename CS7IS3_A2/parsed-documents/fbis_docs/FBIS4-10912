The action followed the dismissal of 888 workers as ordered by Government Agreement 152-94, which reorganizes the portfolio, reducing it to three directorates. Acting Minister Gustavo Cheng Becker advised the ministry's union leaders of the cutbacks yesterday morning. Union representatives rejected the order and initiated a protest by occupying the ministry buildings, taking hostage the acting minister and two Finance Ministry representatives. The two ministry officials left the building later that evening. Mefi Rodriguez and Maritza Palencia, on behalf of the Finance Ministry, agreed the government would pay compensation and other such benefits provided by the law. Acting Minister Cheng Becker explained President Ramiro de Leon Carpio reached the decision based on the Government Agenda he made public on 15 August. It was then when he decided on the urgent need for administrative reorganization. Cheng said this government agency will now function as a Superior Directorate, a General Services and Internal Administration Directorate, and a Rural and Urban Development Directorate. The payroll will now have 22 people. The restructuring led to the deletion of certain positions which, according to technical assessments, were not needed to carry out the work described by its law and regulations. The affected positions were listed in Government Agreement 152-94, he said.
