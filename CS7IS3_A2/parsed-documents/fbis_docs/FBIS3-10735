He said, however, that the crisis is not affecting the APRA alone, but, in general, all parties in Peru and the rest of the world. "As far as we are concerned, enormous efforts are being made to make renewed and updated proposals that can convey a message of hope to people," he said. As for the mistakes made during the APRA government, he said that despite this, it should be admitted that there were major achievements like decentralization, which produced the democratization and transformation of the state, giving towns the opportunity to independently build their own future. He said: "Unfortunately, all this has been left behind because we are a country in which centralism prevails." In this regard, Alva Castro said the future and history will make a much more accurate balance, without either annoyance or passion. "Let us allow the party and its leaders to build the future for the consolidation of this institution so that it will continue to contribute with its experience to the country's sociopolitical development," he said. He explained that APRA still has political weight in the country, and that the clearest proof of this was seen on 18 February on the occasion of the meeting for the Day of APRA Solidarity. "The party has social power, and it is fully convinced that its leaders and members will join efforts to find a renewed image. That is why we will participate in the 1995 elections. We will choose a presidential candidate later," Alva Castro said. Concerning former President Alan Garcia's new work as novelist, he said he has the right to use his knowledge, talent, and capacity in literature. "This occurs because Alan has decided to stay far from the current national situation," he said.
