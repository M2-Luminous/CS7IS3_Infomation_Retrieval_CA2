Would you explain the procedures that will be followed in the Constitutional Court in terms of juridical control following the state of internal disturbance the government decreed yesterday to prevent an important group of dangerous narcotraffickers and others charged with subversion and terrorism from leaving prison? [Naranjo] The procedure is established in the Constitution. Decrees that acquire the status of legislative decrees the government issues in exercising Article 213 are passed to the Constitutional Court for review of constitutionality; it is an automatic review. [Announcer] Can the Constitutional Court analyze reasons of advisability or nonadvisability? [Naranjo] The Constitution is clear on attributing the authority to evaluate the circumstances that warrant the declaration of an internal disturbance to the government; in other words, it is the government that supposedly has the basic authority needed to conclude a state of internal disturbance must be declared whenever there is a serious disruption of public order, which in the government's opinion imminently attempts a compromise of institutional stability, state security, or the coexistence of citizens. The government must determine such elements. [Announcer] How much time does the Constitutional Court have to make a pronouncement regarding the state of internal disturbance? We understand that before it does so, the Attorney General's Office must also state its position. Is that correct? [Naranjo] Correct. The court has a regular period of 60 days to decide. In cases of states of internal disturbance, as in this case, those terms are reduced by one-third, or 20 days. As you noted, the Attorney General's Office must give prior consent. For that, there are 30 days, but by reducing this by one-third we are left with 10 days. [Announcer] The declaration of a state of internal disturbance is becoming a recurrent problem to prevent dangerous inmates from leaving prisons. Is this due to the Prosecutor General's negligence or delayed action? [Naranjo] I would not like to comment on that yet. As you can understand, we must make a pronouncement on this subject, but we cannot state our opinions at this time.
