As a result his country does not intend to deal with the IMF, as the Netherlands demanded. However, Suriname will have to implement whatever hard-hitting restructuring measures the IMF may require, he conceded. "Last year, many Surinamers still thought that they were doing the Netherlands a favor implementing a restructuring program. They did not understand that they were doing so out of pure necessity." Surinamese Development Aid Minister R. Assen rapped his knuckles sharply on the table to underline his words. Assen, who back in September took over from his predecessor, ex-minister E. Sedoc, who retired for health reasons, believes that Suriname must get down to work straight away. "We must not wait until money starts to arrive from the Netherlands, but simply make a start." The relationship between the Netherlands and Suriname cooled considerably when the Netherlands stopped making payments (worth 200 million -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) out of a slush fund aimed at stimulating production. Such money would only be made available if Suriname, which had fallen a considerable way behind in implementing its structural adjustment program [SAP], turned to the IMF. This demand aroused a great deal of emotion. According to the government, doing business with the IMF was tantamount to committing political suicide. However, things would now appear to have settled down again somewhat, following a compromise proposal drawn up by Assen which was delivered to the Netherlands Government in The Hague last week by members of the Surinamese Parliament. Suriname stated its readiness to turn to the Warwick Research Institute to monitor its SAP. The Netherlands could then turn to the IMF for advice concerning its findings. Although members of the Netherlands Parliament found the plan "rather laborious," Development Aid Minister Pronk did not react dismissively. Assen admits that the compromise does not in any way affect the way in which Suriname will have to implement its adjustment program. Both the Warwick Research Institute and the IMF are making strong demands regarding Surinamese restructuring. According to Assen: "It is a highly sensitive issue. In Suriname there is strong resistance to the International Monetary Fund, partly because of the poor image that it had one year ago. For example, wild tales were circulating about actions in the streets of Jamaica, where an adjustment program was also being implemented. "The first party to turn feeling against the IMF was the NDP [National Democratic Party] (the opposition party led by ex-Army chief Bouterse -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note), back in 1988. When the IMF was in the news again last year, the members of the government were extremely cautious. Primarily because the trade unions were also strongly opposed to the IMF. It would have taken me years to convince them that the IMF had significantly changed their tack in the meantime, and become more lenient. We cannot tolerate a situation such as this. After all, we have just emerged from a period of military rule, during which the government exercised insufficient control over the army. Furthermore, the army gained hold within a political party (the NDP -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) which seemed pretty likely to come to power." "However, we have already overcome one important obstacle. In October, the trade unions announced actions due to the fuel shortage and the tremendous increase in electricity prices. When Bouterse decided to go along with them, betting that the government would fall before Christmas, it suddenly became dead quiet. If Bouterse had kept his mouth shut, then the government might indeed not have lasted until Christmas." Assen already has the dates of the restructuring measures in his head. On 1 June, Suriname, which currently practices four different exchange rates, will make the transition to having just one uniform rate. In addition, import duties will have to be raised at around the same time, and the plan for restructuring the civil service will also have to be ready. "We will have to implement specific, coherent measures," said Assen, "which means that the working population will have to accept a wage adjustment." [Otter] It is not the first time that the government has announced hard measures. [Assen] I think that today the government is certainly convinced that there is no way around implementing a structural adjustment program. If we do nothing now, we will lose all our credibility. By 1 June we must have a uniform exchange rate. The bottom line for me is that the Surinamese economy must be restructured, with or without foreign help. Naturally, receiving help would considerably facilitate the task of keeping the rate under control, but I am not counting on receiving that money before June. I think that The Hague is saying: "Let us wait and see how serious you are about implementing your plan." [Otter] In Suriname, there was a strong emotional reaction when the production slush fund worth 200 million was frozen. How important is that money? [Assen] The balance of payment support makes it easier for us to keep the rate under control. And with the industrial fund we could stimulate exports. We must increase the state's foreign exchange revenue. Surinamese companies are primarily trading and packaging companies. The entrepreneurs will have to become more export-oriented. That is difficult because trading yields a great deal. The mentality of our entrepreneurs must change. If the purchasing power of the people declines further, then that will probably happen of its own accord. At the same time, we must all attend to replacing imports. Suriname must give priority to production that makes the country self-sufficient. [Otter] Until now, the government had refused to implement the restructuring measures, being mindful of a possible popular uprising. [Assen] If we offset the measures by others that raise people's incomes, then I think there will be less resistance than anticipated. Perhaps we will leave salaries as they are and work with a system of bonuses. That will not trickle down to secondary provisions (social security, etc. -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note). If the government's plans are to be restructured, then the officials must be accommodated within the private sector. Then we will have to extend our social safety net, e.g. by raising officials' pensions. [Otter] Why did the government not act any earlier if it is all that simple? [Assen] It is not simple. Last year we needed to devote our energy to dealing with the question of power. In the meantime, attitudes have changed somewhat. There are now many more Surinamese who understand why the SAP is necessary. For a long time, Suriname was isolated, due to its period under military dictatorship and the freezing of development aid. There were only a few people who had heard of an adjustment program, and we needed time to find our feet. I can still remember speeches by ministers which contained a great deal of rubbish about the SAP. Now we understand that the SAP is not being forced on us from abroad. So in that respect we have become a little wiser.
