The academy, a centre of the development of the chuche-based agro-science, was founded on December 29, 1948. The great leader President Kim Il-song who is always deeply interested in the agricultural development of the country, visited the academy on some 110 occasions and indicated the direction of comprehensively developing all fields of agricultural sciences and has wisely led the work for its realization. Today the academy has more than 30 central institutes specialized in rice, maize, soil, cultivation, agrobiology, agro-chemistry and agricultural irrigation. There are over 180 scientific research bases including branches of agricultural science and experimental farms in each province. Thousands of scientists work there. Among them are Kim Sang-yon and Kim Chong-hui, authoritative academicians, professors and doctors in the field of rice breeding and veterinary science, Yi Pong-hwi, a famous doctor in the field of maize breeding and hundreds of other people with academic degrees or titles. According to data available, scientific research bases and ranks of scientists have increased tens of times and ranks of people with academic degrees or titles hundreds of times compared with the early period of its founding. The academy has registered a large number of successes in the development of agricultural science of the nation since its foundation. Upwards of 600 varieties bred introduced by researchers are now introduced. They have rounded off farming methods suitable to region and soil on the principle of right crop in right time and proper crop in proper area. It is noticeable in the field of cultivation that a signal success is recorded with the completion of a farming method in highland 1,000-1,400 metre high above sea level and double cropping method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and other mild climate areas. And different kinds of chemical fertilizers suitable to growing condition of crops have been studied and developed and their qualitative composition improved. Now fertilizers are applied to all crops in the Korean countryside on the principle of complete manuring system. Besides, a large number of farm machines have been invented and introduced by researchers of the Academy of Sciences. As a result, all farming work has been mechanized and a great success garnered in developing overall fields of agricultural production including soil and irrigation. Researchers are now directing great efforts to getting new strains of rice and maize for a higher and stable yield and researching and completing a variety of fertilizers with domestic resources.
