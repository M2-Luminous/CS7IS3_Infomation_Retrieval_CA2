The U.S. authorities have included Iran among the seven countries, and have levelled their strongest attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report claims Iran trains what the American authorities call fundamentalist terrorists, and dispatches them to the other Islamic countries. A cursory glance will reveal that all of the 7 countries included in the list are those Third World countries that are not prepared to give in to the American global superpower role, and oppose Washington's expansionist policies. CIA has been the greatest center for training terrorists, and it has frequently resorted to devilish plots such as coup d'etats including the 1953 coup in Iran and the coup engineered against the legitimate government of Dr. Allende in Chile in the 70s -- and assassination of numerous political figures around the world. In fact coup d'etats and assassinations have been among the basic components of the American foreign policy in the decades after World War II. The relation between the American government and the terrorist groups is an undeniable fact. How else could one explain the meeting of the American Vice-President with a terrorist group whose acts of terrorism have been proved on the basis of evidences provided by the U.S. Government itself. Thus it is quite obvious that Washington's attempt in accusing Iran and six other countries of giving support to terrorist groups is only meant to divert world public opinion from its own activities. Syria is also accused of support for terrorists mainly in connection with its activities in Lebanon. But political observers have no doubt that this is a clear case of blackmail. In other words Syria will automatically be crossed off the list of governments supporting terrorism as soon as Syria has accepted the Zionist aggression in the Golan Heights. So on the eve of Christopher's new round of trip to the Middle East with the mission of putting pressure on Syria and making it accept the imposed peace arrangements, it is understandable why Washington brings out such accusatory reports.
