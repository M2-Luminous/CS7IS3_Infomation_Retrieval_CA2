In an interview with correspondents in Tunis, 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the agreement between the PLO and Israel was dying and the diplomatic process was reaching a dead end. In reaction, political sources in Jerusalem said that it was the Israeli Government's policy to honor agreements. Therefore, there was no point in discussing the next stage of the negotiations between the PLO and Israel before the talks on Gaza-Jericho First were completed.
