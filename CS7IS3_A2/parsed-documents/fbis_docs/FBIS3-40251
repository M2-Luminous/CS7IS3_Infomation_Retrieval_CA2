Iliycho Iliev of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion: "How Did You Sin, Officer? In the Past and Now the Armed Defender of Bulgaria Continues To Be Economically Enslaved, Politically Deprived of Rights, Socially Degraded, and Morally Crippled"] [Text] Who was the officer in 1989? For a very large part of the population, he was the uniformed novice, a prop of the totalitarian regime, a submissive executor of absurd commands and decisions of the semi-illiterate superior leaders, who were sometimes shepherds, tailors, and cobblers, quickly graduated from the ShZO [Reserve Officers School], or from three- or six-month courses for officers. Exploiting the halo created above the head of the officer throughout history, the totalitarian machine employed hirelings who were to embody and support the mechanism of its power. For this bargain, it paid them a little more than the average salary, maintaining the myth in the society at large that the officer is a privileged person, that he is part of the nation's economic and political elite. For the recalcitrant, there were political sections and party commissions, military counterintelligence, and State Security. There was also the "freedom" to leave the military with a wolf's ticket [an undesirable discharge] given to those disciplinarily dismissed for political reasons, or for "unreliability" and to be doomed to misery and moral harassment along with his family. For two or three decades of loyal service to the nation and the fatherland, the officers received the indulgence of buying one panelboard apartment (after age 45), of living in humiliating anticipation of a paltry pension, to be looked at with disparagement, and to endure spiritual judgment under socialism, before smiling at death. Called in the name of the most shining ideals, the officer was economically enslaved, politically deprived of rights, socially degraded, and morally crippled. Today We Draw the "Dividends" From This Inheritance Of the 500 officers released this year [1993], almost 80 percent of them have no right to a pension. These are the young officers who preferred to drive taxis, to lay tiles, or to become painters instead of waiting for inadequate salaries, which are sometimes delayed. Unemployment Among Officers' Wives Is Disproportionately High; 65-70 Percent Do Not Work These women are among the first to fall victim to layoffs since "the husband is an officer." The meager military budget does not allow for periodic issuing of uniforms. There are not sufficient means for repairing garrison buildings, for feeding personnel, and for basic human needs, let alone for full military preparedness. The army owes hundreds of millions of levs to state and private companies, which are already refusing to supply us with even the most essential goods. In the press, cases have been described in which officers have used their own funds to feed their troops. In a number of outfits, it has become a tradition to give passes for Saturday and Sunday to almost all the soldiers because it is impossible to feed them in the mess halls. The paltry social funds which the army has today do not permit housing to be built and condemn young officers to remain homeless for many years. For that reason, during the coming years in some military schools, it will reach such a point that 0.66 percent of young people will apply for admission. Thus, anyone who is willing and can read and write will be admitted. Legally, the officer continues to be in a much more disadvantageous position than civilians. Deprived of the right to participate in political life, we are denied representation in parliament and are without even the most modest lobby with the deputies. Two parliaments and three governments have delayed the Law on Defense and the Armed Forces (ZOVS), the package of laws on the MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the law on pensions, state employees, and so forth. And that is no accident. The interests of not a single one of the parliamentary political forces coincide with the nation's need for a strong military and police. The solidarity of an officer corps possessing good morale would raise a cry against the corruption, lawlessness, and passivity of the institutions and those in power. It would be asked why the criminals who are ruining the army and driving the country to yet another national catastrophe are not being brought to justice. In the Puppet Show, the Fate of Bulgaria Is Being Trifled... ...but the episode, "Creation of a Stable Army, Police, and Specialized Service," is missing. Officers who are highly qualified and concerned about their futures, led by charming generals, did not permit people with dubious (agent [state security informer]) antecedents or with current legal entanglements to lecture to us from parliamentary microphones about what is national security, military doctrine, the armed forces, and military reform. As if no one knew that 11 billion dollars and eight levs (in 1992 prices) would be required for the reform. At the same time, the gentlemen-populists are ready to vote to limit the period of active military service by three or more months. They are ready to obstruct the army just to let graft operate for themselves. What else could a person think, after a group of deputies presented a motion to adjourn a parliamentary meeting at which the disasterous financial condition of the army would be examined and the defense minister and the chief of the general staff would be heard? But this motion was dismissed because there were no more urgent problems than those of the military. The current plight of the military servicemen is the result of a staged ineptitude and of a deliberate attempt to reduce the defensive capabilities of the nation, in order to have that posttotalitarian model adopted, a model determined by the puppeteers. That is why our defense industry has also been wrecked; we have lost longstanding arms markets into which companies from "brotherly" states have quickly stepped. For this reason, we continue to be mired, without rights, still doomed by the Law on General Military Service of 1958 and by the statutes and regulations copied from the former USSR's statutes on the armed forces by neo-Stalinists. The Regulations on the Acceptance of Officers for Active Military Duty, which is still in effect (and still secret), contains numerous flagrant violations of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Constitution, and of recently passed laws. The obsolete normative order ties the hands of the just, hardworking commanders who are willing to take the initiative and creates excellent conditions for schemers, string-pullers, and opportunists to exercise selective leadership methods. Society Has the Kind of Military That It Deserves, That It Creates for Itself At times, ill-fed and reduced to rags, our army has been invincible because among the people there has seethed a volcano of vital patriotic enthusiasm. Today, their faith shaken and deeply rent by division, we can hardly expect that we will soon again have the reviving luster from that generation of officers who have written the most glorious pages of our recent history. They did not lose a single battle or a single operation in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, the first Balkan War, the second Balkan War, World War I, or World War II, but, as a result of the shortsighted policies of their "leaders," they have been relegated to the camp of the vanquished. After 10 November 1989, the defense bureaucracy opened its doors to hundreds of civilian specialists. But with the exception of indisputable professionals, along with the three civilian defense ministers, there have come not just a few prima donnas, men who left their country to work abroad, and intriguers, who have robbed the military materially and morally, deepening its contradictions, and going all over the world, leaving the problems to the next batch of experimenters. We believe that it is impermissible for officers and sargeants to wait 10-15 years for military housing while civilians receive a key to the military housing stock with their appointment papers just because they are on someone's team. After months, the team left the MO [Ministry of Defense], but they kept the housing they acquired, those forever happy former servicemen. Lacking a national security concept, official ratification of the Bulgarian military doctrine, and laws, our army has been on autopilot for four years, and the officer corps has wandered about in a professional, legal, and moral wilderness. Taking turns, the almost seasonal management team in the MO comes in. With the understanding that they are short-timers, they work in piecemeal fashion, without even trying to set forth the principles of a modern, stable military. Under these circumstances, those who thrive are generals, senior commanders, and the leading pawns from the Dzhurov [Minister of Defense Dobri Dzhurov 1962-90] era, the embryos of the neophytes, suckers from a more energetic plant, pretenders to the former military glory. Today, already as depoliticized leaders, they graduate discretely from language courses, receive specialized training at U.S., French, and German academies, lead newly established administrations and departments, profit from rigged competitions, and deliver testimonials about their common colleagues. After the defeat in Vietnam, the prestige of the U.S. armed forces fell abruptly. This was followed by an unsparing analysis of the reasons for the ignominious defeat. Legal, structural, and financial measures were taken. In a few years, the government and the society at large restored the ranking of the Army, Air Force, and Navy to first place in the sociological ratings, next to the Supreme Court, and ahead of the president, television stars, and sports heroes. But to achieve this, intellectual courage and determination were necessary; these qualities were displayed by the leadership of the armed forces. This same intellectual courage is needed in Bulgaria.
