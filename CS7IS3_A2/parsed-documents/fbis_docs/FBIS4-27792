Despite languishing economic trends, the three international carriers experienced steady growth in demand for their services accompanied by increased revenues and profits. International Digital Communications (IDC; Daito ward, Tokyo; Katsuto Orihata, president) recorded recurring profits for the first time since establishment of the firm. All of the firms attribute their favorable results to increased use of communications linked with Asia as a whole, including China. Of total revenues, the portion attributable to telephone toll charges was 192.7 billion yen, a 5.1-percent increase over the prior year, for Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD); 41.529 billion yen, a 29.3-perecent increase, for IDC; and 38.902 billion yen, a 23.7-percent increase, for International Telecommunication of Japan (ITJ; Chuo ward, Tokyo; Hiroshi Ohara, president). At the beginning of the year, initial estimates forecast growth of 9 percent for international communications demand for Japan as a whole, but it appears that growth of telecommunications linked with Asia grew at a rate in excess of 10 percent. Sources at KDD say, "China-related demand grew in the mid-30-percent range and Philippines-related demand grew 12 percent," with similar sharp increases experienced by all of the firms in relation to China, the Philippines, and South Korea, second only to the traffic recorded with the United States. It appears that the trend is backed up by increasing travel to Japan and rising commercial operations in Asia by Japanese firms. Capital investments totaled 45 billion yen for KDD, 9.6 billion yen for IDC, and 14.2 billion yen for ITJ, reflecting a decline from recent years because of the absence of major capital investments involving construction of international marine cable links.
