FBIS4-3816 "drchi079_w_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Trade Director Renews Call for Unconditional MFN Trade Director Renews Call for Unconditional MFN HK2304064794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 23 Apr 94 p 2 HK2304064794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) English BFN [Text] Suggestions that conditions be placed on MFN (most favoured nation) trading status for China have been dismissed as impractical by Director-General of Trade Tony Miller. Mr Miller, responding to questions at the launch of the Trade Department's Customer Liaison Group yesterday, renewed his call to the United States Government for unconditional renewal. He said: "I do not think customs officers in America would be able to distinguish goods that were made at a state-owned factory or other factories. Partial renewal of MFN is not practical. I do not think it will help Hong Kong, it will create uncertainty and would be just as damaging as withdrawing MFN." His comments came on the eve of Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang's visit to the U.S. to lobby for MFN. Earlier, Mr Miller launched the 30-member liaison group, which aims to improve communications between traders and officials. He said: "A new feature of this year's performance pledge is the enhancement of customer input. The setting up of the Customer Liaison Group aims to provide for a direct and ongoing dialogue between the department and our officials. Our customers' concerns are our concerns. The department will take the group's suggestions and feedback seriously ."
