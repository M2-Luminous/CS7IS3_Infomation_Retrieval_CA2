In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed a non-project use of project lands application for the Yadkin Hydropower Project, No. 2197&hyph;016. The Yadkin Project is located on the Yadkin/Pee Dee River in Stanly and Montgomery Counties, North Carolina. The application is for approval to build a marina on the Narrows Reservoir. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving the application would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please submit any comments within 20 days from the date of this notice.
