During the visit, his highness held talks with British Prime Minister John Major on the political situation in the region, bilateral relations, and the situation in the Balkan states. His Highness Crown Prince Hasan also addressed a conference on the economics of peace in the Middle East. His highness also took part in a meeting held by the Board of Trustees of the Refugees Institute at Oxford University. At hand to receive his highness were His Highness Prince 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, His Highness Prince Ghazi Bin-Muhammad, a number of their highnesses the princes and princesses, the prime minister, the speakers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and top civil and military officials. His highness spoke about his meeting with the British prime minister. He said: [Begin recording] [Hasan] We met after British Prime Minister Major's return from Brussels. He was preoccupied with a basic issue; that is, the issue of Yugoslavia. As you know, the U.S. initiative was seeking to achieve peace within the European framework. It seems there were strong feelings about what initiative should be taken in order to contain the ongoing tension, especially in Tusla and (Serbrenica), when it came to talk about replacing the Canadian and Dutch forces. Nevertheless, British Prime Minister Major was concerned about the need to clarify this issue to the world. I had the chance to stress the need to condemn those who carry out acts of violence, whoever they may be and wherever they are, in order to enable the UN forces to carry out their tasks and missions. [Reporter] During the conference on the economics of peace in the Middle East, you stressed that it is necessary for peace to reflect on the man in the street. How did intellectuals and politicians in Europe react to this call? [Hasan] Just as an investment framework for a regional meeting is being pursued, we are also pursuing a human framework for meetings that practically define the world community's stand toward the human being, the refugee, the evacuee, and the expellee. Unless this crystallizes into a world vision, it will be hard to talk about a systematic continuation of the peace course. Regarding UN institutions, as well as those institutions concerned with refugee affairs, I noticed there is an inclination to move toward a comprehensive vision. This vision applies equally to the World Bank. It is summed in the need to establish regional institutions, including a regional development bank, that deals, according to internationally accepted standards, with all those who seek help and assistance at this stage, in order to invest in the human being and make him part of the peace course. [Reporter] Sir, you are now the head of the newly re-formed Royal Commission for Jerusalem Affairs as delegated by his majesty the king. In your opinion, what are the next steps toward Jerusalem in response to his majesty's call, in his letter to the prime minister, to activate this committee to protect Holy Jerusalem? [Hasan] His majesty the king granted me and my colleagues this great honor. I hope that we will be able to fulfill the duties required of us at this stage within two phases of action. The first is a phase that will continue in the future; that is, maintaining Jordan's concern with Jerusalem through the Awqaf institutions that work on the ground in Jerusalem. When we talk about the Royal Commission, we are talking about a unique Hashemite Jordanian support for the Arab and Islamic identity. We must define this unique role and work toward reaching deep understanding of all our responsibilities at this stage. The second role is to acquaint scholars from the Islamic world with ethical supremacy, including its dimensions and various literature. As for the Arab and Islamic right and duty, naturally, there is much room for action within the framework of Jerusalem and the holy places in Palestine. I should recall that there is dearth of discussion in this field within the Islamic and Arab framework. In fact, we need to sharpen the conscience and mind. I believe that seeking assistance from an elite of scholars in the Islamic world, for which the opportunity is open, is a very important and critical issue at this particular stage. [end recording] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan this evening took the constitutional oath as regent, during his majesty the king's presence abroad, before the cabinet and in the presence of speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives.
