After having the Dalits on his side, Kanshi Ram is trying to expand his base among other backward castes and the Muslims. The Kushwaha and Muslim conference on Tuesday in Kanpur was part of this effort. Kanshi Ram's cunning strategy is to steal away Mulayam Singh's support base. However, Kanshi Ram has taken this initiative in order to be able to form a government in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] on his own. Kanshi Ram argues that the Dalits, backwards, and Muslims make up 90 percent of the country's total population. If they united, then the 10 percent high caste people would not have any clout. Kanshi Ram is playing his "backward" card to attract the other backward castes. He made this an issue in yesterday's meeting. Kanshi Ram said that the backwards make up 52 percent of the population, however, their share in the nation's government and administration is only three percent. Every leader who had played the backward politics, has deceived them. Kanshi Ram sang this same song until late that night in the Chaman Ganj area. In this meeting, organized by the Indian Islamic Organization, Kanshi Ram said, "The Brahman group is responsible for the injustice against the Muslims. If you join the Dalits, no power can rule you." Kanshi Ram said that the lower castes and Muslims have united in Kanpur for elections. Until now, the Brahman forces have been using them [Dalits] for causing riots so that some of them die and the Brahmans could benefit. Not many Muslims came to hear Kanshi Ram in this Muslim-majority area. The speeches were very hot, excited, and dramatic in this meeting attended by about 2,000-2,500 people. Amidst the "Allah-ho Akbar" slogans, it was said, "Neither a court nor a government can make decisions on the Babri Masjid. We are strong. If we have the authority, we will build the mosque there." Maulana Habib-ul Rehman Ludhianvi said in Kanshi Ram's presence, "The friendship between the Dalits and the Muslims is very old." Later, Maulana also advised Kanshi Ram to convert to Islam. Calling Kanshi Ram the greatest supporter of the Muslims, Kanpur's leading Muslim Maulana Abdul Baqi appealed to the Muslims to follow Kanshi Ram. This meeting was held through the efforts of Masaud Ahmed, the state minister for education. In order to make sure that only the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] benefits from this meeting, Mulayam Singh was not invited despite great efforts by the SP [Samajwadi Party] people. Even Mulayam Singh's name was not mentioned in this meeting. Kanshi Ram and the BSP were called the real saviors of the Muslims in this meeting. It was said that Kanshi Ram provided 96 vidhan sabha and 21 Lok Sabha seats to the Muslims in the 1989 election. The numbers for the 1991 election were 105 and 22 respectively. No other party has ever given so many tickets to the Muslims. In the 1993 vidhan sabha elections, the Congress gave Muslims 26 out of 425 tickets, the Janata Dal 29 out of 375, and the Samajwadi Party gave 36 out of 265 tickets to the Muslims. However, Kanshi Ram gave 49 out of 167 tickets to the Muslims. Therefore, only Kanshi Ram can be the answer to the problems of Muslims. Kanshi Ram said that the Muslims were in a dilemma during the recent election. They were not with Mulayam Singh, however. They were joining him [Kanshi Ram] now because he had called more than 40 meetings "to encourage brotherhood." The BSP people have travelled on bicycles to improve relations. That is why the Muslims are not taking part in riots happening in the western and northern parts of the state. The government has abused the Muslims. Mansoor Khan, the state's education minister, appealed to the Muslims, "You have seen them all. Now give two months to Kanshi Ram. All your problems will be resolved." In the Kushwaha Mahasabha meeting, Kanshi Ram told the same things to other backward groups. He said, "This is your condition today. You are the majority among the backward castes, but you have no part in administration or the government. You are misled during the elections. You support the Janata Dal, the Congress Party, and the BJP one after another. The partnership of the backward castes in Uttar Pradesh government is less than that even of the Dalits. It has been 64 years since the Round Table conference was held, and 45 years since we got independence. However, the backward castes have not received their share yet." Kanshi Ram refered to the IAS [Indian Administrative Service] to impress this fact on the backwards saying, "There are 550 IAS officers in U.P. and only seven of them are from backward classes. The Dalits trusted Dr. Ambedekar and listened to him. That is why there are 112 officers from the Dalit group. The backward castes are 50 years behind the Dalits now. They must think now and the whole Bahujan Samaj will have to fight as a group." Kanshi Ram refuses to admit that he is trying to cut his associate Mulayam Singh's support base. He said, "I am just uniting the BSP." However, many SP leaders did join the BSP in the Kushwaha conference. High state officials along with several hundred cars with blue and red lights were there to protect Kanshi Ram.
