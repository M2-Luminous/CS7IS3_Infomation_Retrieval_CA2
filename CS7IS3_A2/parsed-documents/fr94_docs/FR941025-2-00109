FR941025-2-00109 FR941025-2-00065 Trust Structure 4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer. On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust assets. ABS, alone or together with other broker-dealers, acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. The majority of the public offerings of certificates made to date have been underwritten on a firm commitment basis. However, some may be undertaken on a best efforts basis. In addition, ABS has privately placed certificates on both a firm commitment and an agency basis. ABS may also act as the lead underwriter for a syndicate of securities underwriters. ABS may also act as the servicer or seller to the trust of the receivables or the trust sponsor. Certificate holders are entitled to receive monthly, quarterly or semi-annually installments of principal and/or interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the pass-through rate_which may be fixed or variable. When installments or payments are made on a semi-annual basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer's assets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in the name of the trustee (on behalf of certificate holders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. Usually, the period of time between receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account does not exceed one month. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer will furnish a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this report is delivered to the trustee, it will be made available to certificate holders and delivered to or made available to each rating agency that has rated the certificates.
