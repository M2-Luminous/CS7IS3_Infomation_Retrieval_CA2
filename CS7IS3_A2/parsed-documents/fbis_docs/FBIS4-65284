The blending in the melting pot of goodwill is not all that simple, as both Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin have had to find out. The chancellor was not invited to Normandy by the three Western powers to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the invasion. And the Russian president is not allowed to celebrate the withdrawal of his troops in a joint ceremony with the three protecting powers in Berlin. Kohl has made a wise decision regarding the Berlin question -- same day, same place: yes; together: no. And that is right, since the Russians must not be lumped together with the Americans, the British, and the French. Admittedly, they all liberated Germany from the Nazis -- and for the Russians this involved enormous sacrifices -- but afterwards the Western powers and the Soviets played such different roles that honoring them in a joint ceremony would be "revaluing all values." The Red Army brought freedom to the Germans, the Europeans -- and shortly afterwards it took it away again from those in the East: There, brown [Nazi] totalitarianism was replaced by the red variety. The Western powers protected freedom -- in West Germany and West Berlin at least. What would have become of West Berlin if the West had not counteracted the blockade (which ended almost exactly 45 years ago) so courageously? If the western part of the city had been incorporated into the Soviet zone, European history would have taken a different course, although not a better one. Noting this difference instead of covering it up has nothing to do with discrimination or downgrading, but with the self-confidence of a state that is committed to freedom. And with gratitude: Yeltsin's predecessors were the occupiers, the Western powers were the defenders, and they will remain our allies. To honor these two in a joint ceremony would be just as doubtful historically and morally as would attempts at fraternizing in Normandy, where one side remembers its victory and the other its defeat -- unless a German chancellor can make himself celebrate the event as the beginning of liberation, without any ifs or buts. Not all memories blend well, and anyone covering up the past will be unable to cope with the future. And the future of Germans and Russians must be dealt with today -- before the last occupier has left the country. The German-Russian past was not a good one: When they were not getting at each other's throats -- see World Wars I and II -- they very often made deals with one another at the expense of their neighbors -- see the various divisions of Poland, Bismarck's help against the Polish uprising of 1863/64, [the Treaty of] Rapallo, and the 1939 Hitler-Stalin Pact, which made it easy for Hitler to start World War II. Relations were hardly ever stable, but what is needed now are relations characterized by responsibility. Strategically speaking, things are easier for the Germans now than they have been in 50 years: They are "surrounded" by friends only, separated from the Russian military force that no longer camps in the heart of Europe, but 1,500 kilometers to the east. And the GDR pressure spot, which warned Bonn not to misbehave for decades and strained its Western connection, has also disappeared. Today, Germany is freer vis-a-vis Moscow than ever, but it is not free from responsibility. Russia is as much a burden on Europe as ever, but the problem is no longer expansion, but explosion. Yeltsin's demand to be addressed formally by the rest of the world shows an almost paranoid insecurity. Of course, politics cannot be reduced to psychiatry, but this is where Germany's entirely new difficulties start. To treat a partner as a patient will hardly promote his self respect; also, you cannot psychoanalyze a nation. What is getting Russia down -- such as the catastrophic 25 percent fall in production -- has reasons that are entirely homemade and which cannot be cured by injecting further billions. On the other hand, it is not in the West's interest, not to speak of Germany's, to see the Russian empire go the way of the Hapsburg and the Ottoman Empires, whose disintegration paved the way for World War I. What can be done? Symbolic gestures always help when self-confidence is down. These include the grand style in which Bonn has treated "Boris," also the chancellor's friendly, informal way of addressing Yeltsin, the wise compromise on the troops' farewell, the installing of a "hot line" between the two countries, which resumes the famous metaphor coined by Bismarck who said that the "line to St. Petersburg" must never break off. If this helps Yeltsin stand up to the Rutskoys and Zhirinovskiys at home, all the better. But a responsible German policy must go beyond niceties. "On the other hand," the chancellor said quite rightly, "we and our Western partners are expecting Russia to cooperate constructively in overcoming European and international crises." This is a warning and a compliment at the same time. The warning is that Russia should not use its weakness as a stick, as it used to do with its strength. And the compliment is that the West wants to have, and honors, Moscow as a partner.
