Saunders] [Text] Queenstown March 23 SAPA -- State President F. W. de Klerk on Wednesday [23 March] said the potential for violence in the Ciskei could not be ruled out. "We have a large crowd at one of the stadiums demanding Brig (Oupa) Gqozo's presence. Brig Gqozo said he is not going. There is a volatile situation there but we have taken steps to defuse the situation if this volatility erupts. We are on the scene and are absolutely willing and able to protect South Africa's interests and, of course, the interests of the Ciskei," he said at a press conference in the border town of Queenstown. At least 20 South African Defence Force armoured vehicles were parked on the outskirts of the town as Mr de Klerk spoke.
