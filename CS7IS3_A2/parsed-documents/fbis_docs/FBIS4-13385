Wijetunga told his legislators that they "should devote their full time and energy to prepare" for the upcoming elections. The travel ban will take effect May 1, Wijetunga said in his letter released to the press Friday. "I am sure you will appreciate that I have to be very strict in this matter, in the interest of the government parliamentary group, as well as in the national interest," he told the 125 legislators of the UNP [United National Party]. The ban followed the UNP's humiliating defeat at a key local election last month. Analysts have said that the setback at the southern provincial council could trigger a national trend. The UNP came to power in 1977 and has since won every election except the May 24 local council vote. The defeat has sent shock waves through the UNP, which will field Wijetunga as its presidential candidate in the December polls.
