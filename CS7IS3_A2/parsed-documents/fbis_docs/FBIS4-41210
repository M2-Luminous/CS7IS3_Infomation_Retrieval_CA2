With the signing of this agreement an important process has begun: The amalgamation of political parties in Georgia, something that was unavoidable but has been long delayed in Georgia. In accordance with the agreement, until the constituent congress is convened, the party's provisional leading body is to be the Political Council (composed of 13 members) that will be run by mutual agreement prior to the adoption of the party's rules. The Political Council is empowered to adopt a decision on any issue relating to the party's activities provided it has the support of more than half of the members. The work of the Political Council is to be presided over by three cochairmen, all of whom have equal rights: Nodar Natadze (Popular Front), Tedo Paatashvili ("Charter- 91"), and Vakhtang Dzabiradze (Republican Party). The party will operate as one faction in the Republic of Georgia Parliament. At the meeting, the cochairmen of the United Republican Party of Georgia signed the party's political declaration that stipulates the speediest resolution of the following problems during this fateful time for Georgia: 1. To restore the united national consciousness of the Georgian nation and reattach the nation's dismembered limbs. 2. To determine correctly Georgia's historical and state function in the Caucasian region at the border between Asia and Europe and elaborate a nation-state doctrine as the basis for the state's official strategic political course. 3. To restore Georgia's territorial integrity and extend the Georgian state's jurisdiction throughout its entire territory. 4. To restore and elaborate in reality the sovereignty of the Georgian state and steadfastly defend the trend toward its growth and consolidation. 5. To transform real and not imaginary parliamentary government into the primary guarantee of the country's democratic development. 6. To conduct without delay structural and legislative reform pertaining to the political and economic management of the state. 7. The state is to ensure that the minimum social needs of citizens are satisfied in a just manner and their lives, dignity, and rights are legally protected. In the near future, the United Republican Party of Georgia plans to present a concrete program covering all the aforementioned problems to Parliament and society. The party believes that Georgia has the spiritual, cultural and historical, intellectual, political, and natural or human potential to enable the country to avoid a complete nation-state catastrophe. At the same time, the party views the use of force to resolve problems as the most serious crime against the country's integrity. Those present at the meeting observed a minute's silence in memory of those Georgian guardsmen who were slaughtered in Gori on 13 June 1992. The crowded meeting ended with a dinner.
