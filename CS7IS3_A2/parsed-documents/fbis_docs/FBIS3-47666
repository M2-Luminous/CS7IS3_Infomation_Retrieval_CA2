The sources said the general account budget for the year beginning April 1 will be about 74 trillion yen, up about 3.0 percent in nominal terms over the original program for the current fiscal year. The actual scale of the budget after complicated accounting adjustments, will fall substantially short of the original fiscal 1993 budget totaling 72.35 trillion yen, they said. The government will be forced to issue deficit-covering national bonds for the first time in five years if proposed income tax cuts are implemented, they said. The Finance Ministry plans to finalize its draft budget for fiscal 1994 by around February 5, with the government adopting its budget plan around February 10, the sources said. The ministry at the same time is working out another pump-priming supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, the third in a series, they said. The ministry estimates tax revenues in the coming fiscal year at around 58 trillion yen, compared with 55.68 trillion yen estimated for the current year. It plans to issue 8 trillion to 9 trillion yen worth of construction bonds to make up for the revenue shortfall, the sources said. The Finance Ministry plans to slash budgetary requests by government ministries and agencies by more than 700 billion yen to keep total expenditures to just under 50 trillion yen. It will approve budgetary requests of some 8.9 trillion yen for public works projects in the new fiscal year, the sources said. The budget for servicing outstanding national bonds will be held to around 15 trillion yen, down from 15.44 trillion yen for fiscal 1993, because of lower interest rates, they said. Local governments will be requested to repay interest-free loans from the central government worth about 2.2 trillion yen ahead of schedule in fiscal 1994. To ease the impact on finances of local entities, the central government will offer an equivalent amount of loans with funds raised through construction bond issues, the sources said. Construction bonds worth a total 11 trillion yen will be issued during the new fiscal year, they said. The total amount of national bonds to be issued will hit a record 15 trillion yen if bonds to cover income tax cuts are floated.
