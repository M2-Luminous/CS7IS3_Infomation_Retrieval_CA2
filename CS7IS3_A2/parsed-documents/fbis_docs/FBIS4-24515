The counterfeit tapes and discs, worth over NT [New Taiwan] $20 million (US$740,000), were destroyed in an annual IPR crackdown campaign sponsored by the Government Information Office, National Bureau of Standards, and the Copyrights Protection Committee of the Interior Ministry. In a speech before the ceremonial destruction, Vice Interior Minister Yang Pao-fa said Taiwan is entering a "users pay" era after the country vowed to join the international community in a campaign to eliminate IPR and copyright infringement. Yang said it is particularly important for Taiwan to observe IPR protection practices as the country is supposed to develop intellectual property rights protection relations with 118 member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) upon joining the world trade regulatory body. Yang urged the public to cooperate with the government in achieving the ambitious goal of making Taiwan a "counterfeit-free" country.
