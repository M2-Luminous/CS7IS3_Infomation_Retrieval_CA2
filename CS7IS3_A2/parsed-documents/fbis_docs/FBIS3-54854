Kiesus said the Russian company guarantees stabile oil supplies and steady work of the refinery, which is very important to Western partners and banks, who might consider giving preferential loans to Mazeikiai. According to a contract between Lucoil and the Lithuanian refinery, Mazeikiai is supposed to refine 6 million tons of Russian oil this year. Lucoil supplied only half of the amount it promised for 1993. Kiesus said Mazeikiai will refine 6 million tons of Russian oil this year if all transportation problems are successfully solved. The refinery received 5.1 million tons of oil last year. Three million were supplied by Lucoil, 2 million came in from different commercial companies and 50,000 were purchased by the refinery itself. In 1992, Mazeikiai refined a record low of 4.9 million tons. The refinery hopes to get 8 million tons in 1994, which is still 4 million tons below its maximum annual refining capacity. Kiesus said Mazeikiai intends to buy more oil itself -- some 50,000-100,000 tons each month. The oil will hopefully be purchased for preferential loans from foreign banks and financial organizations, he said. Loans for the refinery are currently under negotiation between Lithuanian energy officials and some Western banks.
