FBIS4-2637 "drchi070_w_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Appointments Criticized Appointments Criticized HK1204053894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 12 Apr 94 p 6 HK1204053894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Irene So and Linda Choy] [Text] The appointment of a former United Democrat (UDHK), Lau Kong-wah, to China's advisory body was criticized as a further step to isolate the party whose previous attempts to communicate with Beijing officials have been turned down. Describing the appointment as a "united front tactic", chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming said: "It shows the Chinese Government is continuing to isolate the UDHK in building up a united front by recruiting more democrats as advisers." Mr Lau, a member of the Sha Tin District Board and Regional Council, resigned from the party one year ago because he was dissatisfied with the lack of communication between the central and district levels of the party. Mr Lau would not say whether his former membership of the UDHK was related to the appointment. Mr Lee dismissed the suggestions that some UDHK members might follow suit and leave the party in order to join the united front. "Even if China wants to appoint UDHK members in future, our central standing committee may not approve it," Mr Lee said. The newly-appointed advisers yesterday rejected suggestions that their acceptance of China's offer meant they were shifting to the pro-China camp. Many appointees said the need to improve communications with the mainland because of the deadlock over the territory's political development had prompted them to take up the posts. Hang Seng Bank chairman Sir Quo-wei Lee, formerly an Executive Councillor said there was a need to reflect the views of Hong Kong people. Sir Quo-wei, who dismissed the suggestion that he was shifting to the pro-China camp politically, added: "It is not necessarily anti-British to become a Hong Kong affairs adviser." Another appointee, the vice-chancellor of the Hong Kong City Polytechnic, Patrick Cheng Yiu-chung, said he believed there was no difference serving advisory groups under British rule and those under China's. "I have served on numerous advisory committees set up by the Hong Kong Government in the past 10 years or so. My students protested that they were only decorative bodies to mislead the public, but I still took the posts as long as I could achieve something. I really do not see any difference between helping the British Government and the Chinese Government," he said. Mr Cheng said it was difficult for the two countries to cooperate over political issues and more preparation should be laid in other areas of the transition. Another appointee, former chairman of the Law Society Donald Yap, said there was a pressing need to communicate with China. But he said he had yet to formulate his own views on subjects such as the composition of the Court of Final Appeal. The legal profession has expressed strong opposition towards the Sino-British agreement on the court. As for the jailing in China of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang, Mr Yap said Beijing should either give more details about the case or explain why it could not.
