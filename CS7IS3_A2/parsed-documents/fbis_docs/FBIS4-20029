The two governments agree to a two-phased procedure that takes into account the destruction and occupation of Croatian areas by the Serbs. Basically, it will be possible to send Croatian refugees back to their country from 1 May onwards. However, the agreement contains an exception clause. "The repatriation of former war refugees, whose origin from a locality situated in damaged, fought for, or occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia can be proved, as well as Croatian war refugees from the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be provisionally discontinued until January," says the agreement. A Croatian diplomatic representation in Germany must certify that these criteria apply. Refugees from occupied or damaged areas should be repatriated from Germany even before January 1995 if a cease-fire comes into effect in Bosnia-Herzegovina or if Croatia, for its part, "commences the repatriation of war refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina." Kanther said that the acceptance of refugees as an act of charity should not be construed as a "permanent right of abode." Croatia needs people to reconstruct the country, he said. Germany will help Croatia obtain help from the European Union [EU]. Kanther promised that Germany would support negotiations on a cooperation agreement between the EU and Croatia. On the subject of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kanther said that Germany would also consider the situation in that country when repatriating refugees. However, the principle remains whereby once the war is ended, there is no reason to accept refugees in Germany. Acting Croatian Prime Minister Kostovic said his government was holding talks with the Bosnian Government on the subject of repatriating refugees, but nothing has been decided because of the situation in Bosnia. There will be a conference on this subject in Ljubljana in the beginning of May, under the aegis of the United Nations. Kostovic pointed out that his country has accepted 280,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another 250,000 Croatian refugees have fled from Serb-occupied areas. There are only 800 vacancies in refugee camps operated by the Croatian Government. According to Croatian Government data, the first phase of implementing the agreement will not pose an excessive burden on Croatia. The returning refugees could be accommodated in their former homes. The accommodation of Croats from Serb-occupied areas will be more difficult. Kostovic expressed his thanks for the German Government's help. The Croatian Government claims there are 70,000 Croatian refugees in Germany. Some 20,000 of them come from Serb-occupied areas. The interior ministers of the German laender resolved last year that the reprieve on deporting Croatian refugees would expire at the end of January, but this deadline was subsequently extended to the end of April. In February, the conference of interior ministers adopted a two-phase procedure that takes into account the marital status and regional origin of refugees. During the negotiations, the Croatian side assured the German Government that it has declared an amnesty for Croatian citizens who avoided military service or deserted between August 1990 and September 1992. "Croatia guarantees the protection of human rights; discrimination over race, religion, ethnic origin, sex, social connections, and political opinion is out of the question," says a note from the Croatian Government.
