This particularly applies to the "Communist Platform" (KPF), which was founded within the PDS with its explicit approval and whose activists openly declare themselves in favor of the "revolutionary idea of the socialist alternative." According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the Marxist-Leninist KPF regards itself as a bridge to other communist groups and it maintains close and regular contacts, particularly with the German Communist Party [DKP] and the Communist Party of Germany [KPD]. Thus, this association has to be assessed as a "test case" for the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. In an interview with the DKP newspaper UNSERE ZEIT, PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky explains the PDS view on cooperation with communists in the election campaigns as follows: "A decision that communists are not to be put on PDS lists has not been made. I would also regard it as a loss." According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the PDS is also not "afraid of coming into contact" with violent extremists. As proof, the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution quotes from the 17th edition of the PDS member magazine DISPUT, which says, among other things, the following: "The PDS has a good position in the scientific analysis of the fascist development. Consistently, however, it will have to bank far more on extraparliamentary actions and self-help. It would be stupid to leave autonomous groups alone in actions that would be worth supporting, for example, if the `concrete prevention of Nazi meetings' is at issue." PDS members also participated in a congress of leftist groups in Hamburg to which members of the terrorist scene had also come. According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, PDS members also participated in the "Socialist-Communist Action Unit," which is operated by the KPD and whose objective is the founding of a "uniform Communist Party of Germany."
