Mamedov, who is attending the 24th OAS General Assembly as an observer, stated that the agreement does not entail any form of ideological agreement, but rather stems from mutually advantageous relations. Mamedov said Russia and Brazil are following the same path toward promoting democratization in the world. He described Brazil as a priority partner for Russia. He noted that the agreement will pave the way for implementing several cooperation projects between the Russian and Brazilian Armed Forces, in addition to promoting the transfer of technology. The agreement may also be instrumental in improving the bilateral trade balance, which last year stood at $300 million. Foreign Ministry experts consider this figure to be well below the potential for trade between the two countries. Foreign Minister Amorim will visit the Russian Federation in December to sign new agreements.
