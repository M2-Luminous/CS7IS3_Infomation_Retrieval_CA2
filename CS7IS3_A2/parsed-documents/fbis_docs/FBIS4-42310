At a meeting with the economics ministers of the above three countries on the sidelines of the Berlin International Air and Space Show -- the meeting also attended by representatives of the Airbus consortium, including German Aerospace Director Juergen E. Schrempp -- Rexrodt said that state support for the sale of top German technologies abroad is a key component of foreign and economic policy, and is not limited just to the Airbus project. However, talks at government level should not be used to apply political pressure or impose financial restrictions, it was said. The four ministers agreed to combat unfair financial dealings and political malpractice on the aviation market. Rexrodt said the European enterprises involved in the construction of the Airbus had complained of being at a disadvantage compared to their main U.S. competitors. He said there are indications that the American competition is advertising its aircraft in a very determined and unconventional manner, availing itself of help from the U.S. Government. Specifically, Rexrodt criticized distortions in competition, something that violates agreements reached with credit instance companies. Observers view this as a clear indication of the Americans' business dealings with Saudi Arabia. Rexrodt said the initial German contribution to the Airbus program amounts to a "refundable 6.5 billion German marks [DM]." A general increase in the financial contribution for the purpose of research into future technologies can be expected in the medium term, he said. Wolfgang Piller, president of the Association of German Air Industry, told HANDELSBLATT that the state is providing the German aviation industry with DM6 million for the purposes of aviation research. In the United States, on the other hand, $2.7 billion has been provided for air research indirectly through NASA and the Pentagon. While government aircraft orders in the United States constitute 64 percent of all such orders, in Germany government aircraft orders only amount to 38 percent, said Rexrodt. In the United States, 30 experimental projects have been commissioned, compared to only one in Europe -- in the Netherlands. This provides a springboard for U.S. moves to distort competition. The supportive words of European politicians should finally be followed by deeds, according to Rexrodt. In the meantime, the absence of the four-engine long-range Airbus A-340 on the air show's opening day is viewed as a bone of contention on the sidelines of the economics ministers conference. The Airbus had to remain on the ground at Toulouse because an agreement between Lufthansa and German Aerospace about who should pay for the flight collpased at the last moment. Apparently, German Aerospace withdrew its financial involvement in Airbus.
