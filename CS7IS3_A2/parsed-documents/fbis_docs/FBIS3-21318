Katyal: "Six Proposals Submitted to Pakistan"; quotation marks as published] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--Keeping up its initiative, India today conveyed to Pakistan the promised proposals on six sensitive subjects, including Siachen, stabilisation of the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, and confidence-building measures in the nuclear field, as part of a normal, practical approach intended to be adopted in the bilateral field. The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, handed over six non-papers containing the proposals to the Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, this evening. India, Mr. Dixit told the High Commissioner, had structured these proposals after serious deliberations and the initiative was neither empty propaganda nor an attempt to lay pre-conditions for continuing the dialogue. The other subjects covered by the non-papers are: Sir Creek and delimitation of the maritime boundary, Tulbul navigation project and activation of the committees, set up within the framework of the Joint Commission, in July 1989 at Islamabad. India was represented at the Joint Commission meeting, which followed the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi's visit to Pakistan, by Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then External Affairs Minister. The nuclear continental ballistic missile, contained in today's proposals, envisage extension of the existing agreement on non-attack at each other's nuclear facilities to cover non-attack on population centres and economic targets and to provide for non-first use of nuclear capabilities. This was a small step in the bilateral context but there was nothing to preclude its extension to cover other countries which might choose to adhere to these provisions. To ensure effective communication especially at times of crises, India suggested conversion of the present hotline between the Directors-General of Military Operations into a secure and dedicated link, coupled with fax facilities. Siachen: As regards Siachen, India re-conveyed its willingness to accept the agreement reached in 1992 (which could not be implemented because of technical wrangles). Under it, both sides were to disengage from authenticated positions held presently, and leave the delimitation of the Line of Control beyond NJ 9842 to a joint commission. The immediate objective was to ensure peace and tranquillity in the area without prejudice to each other's positions. `A positive signal': Today's formulation on Siachen was, perhaps, not different from the one agreed upon by the Defence Secretaries of the two countries towards the end of 1992. India's acceptance of that agreement now was seen as a positive signal which was not possible then because of the domestic political situation. Pakistan did not want the "Actual Ground Positions Line" (AGPL) to be mentioned in any document lest India should use it in support of its claim to hold the territory acquired "through aggression." It should be possible to get over this objection, so goes the Indian argument, by inserting the words "without prejudice to each other's positions." India occupied all the commanding heights along what, according to it, should be the Line of Control--along the Saltaro ridge, following the internationally-accepted watershed principle for delineating boundaries. The area was relatively quiet, with the cases of firing on the decline. India would like Pakistan to appreciate the significance of New Delhi's gesture--made at a time when it had a decisive advantage. LoC in J & K: Perhaps, the most comprehensive was the non-paper on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. It was virtually a full-fledged draft agreement, with its ten clauses dealing with all aspects--violation of the line, trans-border infiltration and the like. It followed the format of the Sino-Indian arrangement for a tension-free border but was firmer and clearer. That was because, contrary to the Sino-Indian border, the two sides do not differ on how the Line of Control runs in Jammu and Kashmir. This proposal also envisaged an institutional mechanism to monitor and suitably deal with cases of violation of the agreed steps. That mechanism could also be used to ensure compliance with the provisions of the existing agreements, like the one on the prior notice of the movement of troops in the border areas (which, in actual practices, had not been fully adhered to). The Sir Creek imbroglio was sought to be resolved by separating its two components--the border on the ground, which could be resolved later, and maritime boundary, for which a detailed delineation formula had been spelt out. No reference to forces: There was no reference to re-deployment or reduction of forces along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir, as demanded by Pakistan. According to the oft-explained Indian stand, the force level would be in proportion to the degree of infiltration or interference from the other side. By implications, India could discuss re-deployment in case of decline in the activities against its territorial integrity. While the proposals on Siachen and Sir Creek, were, more or less, on the lines already agreed upon, the formulation on other issues, according to officials, marked a forward movement by India. That was particularly the case in regard to the nuclear CBMs. India could not compromise on its opposition to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty nor accept the proposal for a five-nation conference for a nuclear-free South Asia, as suggested by the United States. Subject to these reservations, it had offered non-proliferation steps in the bilateral context--in keeping with the concerns mentioned during its dialogues with industrialised countries. But there was nothing to suggest that India would accept the "capping, freezing and rolling back" sequence suggested by the United States and others in regard to its nuclear capabilities.
