The six went through a trial within a trial after four of them had applied for change of their initial plea of guilty to not guilty. The convicted were Shelter Rebecca Ritchie (36), Lovemore Ndlovu (34), Cecil Matongo (33), Harry Kaliofas (22), Joshua Kelemera Zidala (25) and David Muchineripi (40). Mr Joseph Mate for the State told the court that on an unknown date but before August 23 this year, Ritchie was asked to sell Mandrax tablets by a friend. She approached Ndlovu, who later gave a sample of the tablets to Matongo. A few days later Kaliofas requested for the whole packet after consulting Zidala who allegedly said that the tablets were the correct stuff. On August 23, Muchineripi took the tablets and was approached by Kaliofas to discuss the price. On September 23 this year, Muchineripi was arrested at a local hotel. They were all remanded in custody to January 19 for sentencing after evidence is led in mitigation.
