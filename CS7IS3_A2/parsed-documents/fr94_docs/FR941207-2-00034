FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert Forrest, Product Manager (PM) 14, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33505), which announced that Mole Med Inc., P.O. Box 333, Aurora, IN 47001, had submitted an application to register the pesticide product Mole-Med (EPA File Symbol 64439&hyph;R), ~containing the active ingredient castor oil (CAS No. 8001&hyph;79&hyph;4) at 66 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product. ~~~~~ The application was approved on August 3, ~1994, as Mole-Med, to repel moles from lawns (EPA Registration Number 64439&hyph;1). This registration is unconditional for 1&hyph;year. During that period the registrant will submit more information on product effectiveness. If this requirement is not satisfied by August 15, 1995, EPA will automatically cancel the registration. ~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of castor oil, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use of castor oil when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805).
