A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel caused that impasse and that only international and U.S. action can resolve it by putting pressure on Israel to return to the basis on which the peace initiative was founded, and by doing that on all fronts without putting pressure on the Palestinians to implement the Oslo agreement, because that agreement has been proven to be a failure and is unacceptable to the Palestinian people. The source said that there was no alternative to an Israeli declaration of willingness to withdraw completely from all the occupied territories in order to ensure the success of the negotiations. He added that the settlements issue has become an urgent matter which must be discussed to determine the fate of the settlers and to work for their evacuation from the occupied Arab territories because they have become a daily threat and danger to the Palestinian people, as Hebron's al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre demonstrated. The official said that the aim of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the United States was to make Washington pressure the Palestinians into completing the separate peace agreement to enable the occupation authorities to impose the settlements for five more years at least, and also to paralayze the Security Council and prevent it passing an anti-Israel resolution and providing protection for the Palestinian people. He said that Syria was still interested in peace and had from the beginning responded to the prerequisites of the peace process, but Israel was placing many obstacles in the way of any progress. There will be no progress, he said, as long as Israel continues to pursue a policy which does not serve peace in any way. [passage omitted]
