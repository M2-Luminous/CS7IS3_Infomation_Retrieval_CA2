The Moslems are firing at us over the positions held by U.N. peace-keepers from their strongholds in hospitals, post buildings and other exclusively civilian facilities, the sources add. The aim is obviously to try to provoke us into neutralizing these Moslem nests so that we could then be blamed for attacking civilian targets, they explained. The same sources said that the Moslems had used the same tactics before to fire at Serb and U.N. positions in Sarajevo, the capital of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb side has protested with the U.N. Protection Force over this practice, but to no avail. Moslem provocations in Sarajevo continue on Sunday, with the brunt of the Moslem mortar fire directed at Serb-controlled sections of Ilidza, Nedzarici, Grbavica, Dobrinja 4, Vogosca and Rajlovac, the Bosnian Serb Army said. Over the past 24 hours, the Moslems were attacking Serb military and civilian targets throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, it added. Bosnian Serb troops are firmly holding their positions and responding only when absolutely forced to do so, the Bosnian Serb army said. It added that the Moslem troops in the Gorazde enclave in the east continued their attacks on Serb-controlled Foca and Cajnice. Sources in the Bosnian Serb Army also said that, despite a U.N. ban on military flights over Bosnia, Moslem helicopters were flying from Orasje to Gradacac and Tuzla in northern Bosnia, and over the areas of Vares, Breza, Visoko, Kiseljak and Vozuce in central Bosnia, where Moslems and Croats have been fighting pitched battles since the spring of 1992. The Serb side has duly informed the U.N. command about the unauthorized Moslem helicopter flights, the Bosnian Serb military sources said and added that the U.N. command had failed to react to an earlier warning from the Bosnian Serb command that unless such flights stopped, the Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft defence would be forced to itself prevent similar incidents from recurring.
