FBIS4-16933 "drsov076_f_94013" FBIS-SOV-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 National Affairs Economic Performance in 1st Quarter 1994 Economic Performance in 1st Quarter 1994 WS2004090094 Kiev UKRINFORM in English 2126 GMT 18 Apr 94 WS2004090094 Kiev UKRINFORM English BFN [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April 94] [Text] Experts with the Economics Agency under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine compiled a composite report about Ukraine's economic performance in the first quarter of 1994. According to it, national income dropped by 36 per cent versus the January-March period of 1993. While January's production drop versus January 1993 was by 32.7 per cent, it amounted to 35.7 per cent during the January-February period and rose to 38.4 per cent for the entire first quarter. The consolidated budget's revenues amounted to 35 trillion krb. in the January-February period (i.e. only 8.4. per cent of the approved budget's figure). The consolidated budget's expenditures exceeded 40 trillion krb. [karbovanets] with welfare having consumed 6.6 trillion krb. (16.4 per cent of total expenditures), financing the societal-cultural sector having accounted for 9.8 trillion krb. (24.4 per cent), and the national economy, having attracted 18.38 per cent of total financing. Besides, 6.5 trillion krb. credits by NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] and other banks were drawn to offset the budget's deficit and cover some other outlays. Reduced production resulted in budgetary revenues' losses through underpaid VAT to the tune of 2.8 trillion krb. and excise to the tune of 1.8 trillion krb. Ukraine's payment crisis led to underpaid taxes, which reduced by 4.4 times, and the aggregate loss reached 1.5 trillion krb. as of 1 March. The first quarter's subsidies to the tune of 6 trillion krb. were involved in the state's price regulation and channeled to the population's social of protection (foods, medicines, solid fuels, livestock, milk, housing, public amenities), to the tune of 2.7 trillion krb. and to offset the coal price difference to the tune of 3.3 trillion krb. The aggregate amount of credit investments (credit indebtedness) of Ukraine's banks in economy amounted to 70.7 trillion krb., as of 1 March, including NBU's 22.5 trillion krb. credits, commercial banks' 48.2 trillion krb. credits and the former Union nations' bank affiliates' 98 billion krb. credits. The average weighted rate for commercial bank credits amounted to 385 per cent versus January's 310 per cent. It varied from the maximal value of 900 per cent to the minimal 1 per cent rate. The debit-credit indebtedness of Ukraine's enterprises and organisations continued to accumulate. Credit indebtedness grew by 35.3 per cent during January and February to amount to 172.3 trillion krb. in early March. Debit indebtedness grew by 32 per cent and equalled 131.5 trillion krb. The share of unprofitable enterprises in Ukraine's national economy grew from 16 per cent in 1993's first quarter to 24.1 per cent in the January-February period of 1994. Ukraine's coal-mining industry extracted 27.7 million tons of coal, or by 16.1 per cent less than in the January-March period of 1993. A third of engineering enterprises had to shift to a reduced work-week. The Luganskteplovoz production association was idling for almost two month, though it is Ukraine's sole enterprise, which manufactures diesel locomotives. While it manufactured as many as 63 diesel locomotives in the January-March of 1993 period, this year it produced only five of these. The underlying reason is loss of former markets, as Russia used to be the Ukrainian manufacturers' major customer. Ukraine's collective and state farms have embarked on spring crop sowing. 936,000 ha of perished winter crop areas have been resown with spring crops out of 2 million ha. Ukraine's foreign trade turn-over with the "near abroad" (that is former Union) nations amounted to 50.2 trillion krb. in the 1st quarter of 1994 including 27 trillion krb. exports and 23.2 trillion krb. imports. Foreign trade turn-over with "far abroad" nations totalled 1,214 million USD including 726 million USD exports and 488 million USD imports. Ukraine's favorable balance thus amounted to 238 million USD. Ukraine's metallurgical engineering somewhat improved its performance in March. Averaged daily manufacture of ready rolled metal and steel piping increased by respectively 2.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent versus February and by 7.3 pr cent and 23.4 per cent versus January. However, their production fell short of the target plan figures by 2.9 million tons of rolled metal and 750,000 tons of steel piping. Fuel and raw material shortages remained chronic. Gas supplies to metallurgical works amounted to 72 per cent of what was supplied to them in the January-March period of 1993. Similarly, supplies of scrap, metallurgical coal and electric power were respectively at 56 per cent, 78 per cent and 72 per cent marks versus 1993's first quarter. Ukraine's coal miners supplied metallurgical coal in amounts, which were by 350,000 tons less than what the plan provided for. Ukraine's coal imports amounted to about 200,000 tons, or about a tenth of Ukraine's demand. Undersupplies of scrap amounted to 620,000 tons, which resulted in eleven blast-furnaces (20 per cent of the total amount) and 23 Siemens-Martin open-hearth furnaces (30 per cent of the total) idling in March. The averaged monthly wages of workers engaged in the state-owned sector of Ukraine's national economy amounted to 760,100 krb. in February. Workers engaged in housing, household services, public amenities, public catering, agriculture, social welfare, education and culture, were among the lowest-paid bracket with wages and salaries ranging from 380,900 to 451,000 karbovanets per month. As of late February, the number of jobless persons registered by the employment service amounted to 138,000. 93,100 persons were granted the unemployed status, which was 0.4 per cent of the economically active and able-bodied population. The state's relief per unemployed individual amounted to 147,800 krb. in February.
