Stefano Picchi asked Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin about this: [Begin Adamishin recording] Our policy has been changing, not only in the last few days but over the past year. In what direction is it changing? It is becoming more pragmatic -- let us say, more interested in the defense of our national interests. We may have passed through a somewhat romantic period when we thought that because we had a correct foreign policy we would no longer have any problems. This was not the case. Even when going in a correct direction you must still find a way of solving problems, because interests do not always coincide. I will give you an example: Russia's role in the former Soviet republics is not always recognized. Sometimes it is said that in these republics we are going back to imperialist ways, that we want to rebuild the Soviet Union. It is not true. We have seen, we have established that unless Russia plays an active role it is very difficult to have stability, security, and tranquillity on our border. The former republics want Russia's active role; they want it. [end recording]
