ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a final rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and a regulatory amendment affecting the Pacific halibut fishery in and off of the State of Alaska (Alaska or State). This action implements the Modified Block Proposal, which is necessary to prevent excessive consolidation of the halibut and sablefish fisheries. This action also clarifies the transfer process for the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994; except the amendments to §§676.16, 676.20(f), and 676.22(g), which will become effective on January 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Copies of Amendments 31, 35, and the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal to the IFQ Program, may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Lepore, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Modified Block Proposal, as well as the other alternatives for the IFQ program for fixed-gear halibut and sablefish fisheries, are described in the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (Analysis) dated December 17, 1993. Language amending the BSAI and the GOA FMPs was developed for the Modified Block Proposal, the Council's chosen alternative. The amendments to the FMPs affect the sablefish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska, which are managed in accordance with the BSAI and the GOA groundfish FMPs. The Council prepared both FMPs under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).
