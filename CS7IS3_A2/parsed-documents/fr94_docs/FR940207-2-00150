The Commission published notice of these proposed rule changes in the Federal Register on October 14, 1993. 4 No comments have been received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule changes. 1 File Nos.

The Commission republished notice of the amended proposed rule changes in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33011 (October 4, 1993), 58 FR 53231. I. Description The proposed rule changes will permit the correspondent clearing corporations to put into effect amended and restated agreements providing for the settlement of exercises and assignments of equity options. In addition, OCC's proposed rule change makes related changes to OCC's By-Laws, Rules, and certain form agreements used by OCC's clearing members. In the original filings, OCC, NSCC, SCCP, and MCC proposed to make effective Amended and Restated Options Exercise Settlement Agreements (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``First Restated Agreements''). OCC, NSCC, SCCP, and MCC have amended the First Restated Agreements (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``Second Restated Agreements'') and will make the three Second Restated Agreements, which are the subjects of this approval order, effective in place of the three First Restated Agreements. 5 The Second Restated Agreements replace the options exercise settlement agreements that were previously in effect between OCC and each CCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``Original Agreements''). The MCC and SCCP Second Restated Agreements are substantially identical in form. The NSCC Second Restated Agreement is substantially in the same form with variations reflecting that NSCC will provide OCC with a daily report identifying all securities which are eligible for settlement through NSCC's continuous net settlement (``CNS'') system. 5 Each Second Restated Agreement provides that it will become effective on the later of the effective date set forth in the Second Restated Agreement or the date of approval by the Commission of both parties' proposed rule changes that include the Second Restated Agreement as an Exhibit. The date of the Commission approval will be the effective date for all three Second Restated Agreements. Each Second Restated Agreement provides that it shall become effective in lieu of the respective First Restated Agreement. A. The Original Agreements and the Changes Made by the Second Restated Agreements (1) Operation and Continuing Use of Broker-to-Broker Settlement Procedures Prior to implementing the Original Agreements, exercises of equity options were settled broker-to-broker. In broker-to-broker settlement, upon receipt of an equity option exercise notice, OCC would issue a delivery advice to the delivering clearing member ( i.e., the assigned clearing member in the case of a call or the exercising clearing member in the case of a put) and to the receiving clearing member ( i.e., the exercising clearing member in the case of a call or the assigned clearing member in the case of a put). The delivery advice would instruct the delivering clearing member to make delivery of the security underlying the exercised option directly to the receiving clearing member and would specify the address at which delivery was to be made and the exercise settlement amount to be paid. OCC continues to have rules governing broker-to-broker settlement. 6 However, broker-to-broker settlement has been largely replaced by settlement through the facilities of the CCCs. The Second Restated Agreements provide that OCC will use broker-to-broker settlement only for exercises and assignments of equity options overlying securities which are not eligible for settlement in NSCC's continuous net settlement system (``CNS Securities''). 7 6 OCC Rules 901&hyph;912. 7 CNS Securities are defined only in the terms of NSCC's CNS System and not in terms of the securities that are eligible for each individual CCC's continuous net settlement system. The definition is new in the Second Restated Agreements as is the exclusion of non-CNS Securities. Both of these changes are made necessary by changes to OCC's margin system, which changes were designed to improve the margin system's ability to evaluate and neutralize OCC's risk during the five business day period between the exercise and settlement of an equity option. Because all securities underlying equity options issued by OCC are ordinarily CNS Securities, all exercise settlements will continue to be settled through the CCCs. However, in unusual circumstances in which an underlying security ceases to be a CNS Security or in which the owners of an underlying security become entitled to an additional security as a result of a rights offering or other extraordinary transaction and that additional security is not a CNS Security, exercise settlement may be effected entirely or partly through OCC's broker-to-broker settlement system.
