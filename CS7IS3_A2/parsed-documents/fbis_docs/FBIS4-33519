Four were once guerrilla fighters. They are the 13 individuals forming Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign team, and they represent the range of factions constituting the PT [Workers Party]. There are only two congressmen in the group, most of whose members are intellectuals or party leaders. Deputies in the party comment that the leadership is in the hands of "voteless" people. The group includes a businessman who is not a member of the PT: Oded Grajew. He is active in civil engineering and advertising. He collected suggestions from businessmen for the program. Now he is going to collect contributions from businessmen. The party presidency is held by State Deputy Ruy Falcao (Sao Paulo), a leader of the party's left wing. He participated in the armed struggle against the military regime as a member of the VAR [Revolutionary Armed Vanguard]-Palmares. Falcao does not like to talk about that experience. "What is the point of that now? The amnesty erased all that," he says. Tried under five articles of the National Security Law, he spent three years in prison. Coordination of the campaign will be divided among Falcao, Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (Sao Paulo). Greenhalgh represents the party's extreme left wing, while Mercadante is closer to the center. He is tipped to be Lula's minister of finance. Drafting of the government program will be coordinated by Marco Aurelio Garcia, an intellectual who has great influence on Lula and who is associated with the center group. Also participating in the coordination are Joao Machado and Cesar Benjamin, who represent the left wing. Benjamin stirred up controversy by advocating a fourfold increase in the Armed Forces budget. The alliances in the states are important in getting Lula elected, and they will be monitored by Gilberto Carvalho, the party's secretary general. A professor of philosophy linked to the progressive wing of the Catholic Church, he has never held elective office. He has been a party leader for four years. The PT's advertising in the media is in the hands of the party's most radical leader, Markus Sokol of the faction known as In the PT Struggle. At the party convention, he advocated suspending payment of the foreign debt. The official campaign treasurer will be Tatau Godinho, an English professor without much experience as a treasurer. She hopes to collect a large amount of money from the party's approximately 100,000 members, but is also depending on contributions from businessmen. The group also has two intellectuals acting as advisers to Lula: Paulo Vanucchi and Amilton Pereira. Both participated in the armed struggle.

Adviser With Lula Since 1981 Wander Bueno do Prado, 41, has been an adviser to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva longer than anyone. "I know Lula better than I know my brother," Prado told FOLHA DE SAO PAULO. A sociologist and former metalworker, Prado went to work for Lula in 1981. He has been his private secretary since that time. He takes care of Lula's agenda and organizes the candidate's life. He left that position only from 1990 to 1992, when he coordinated the PT's parallel government (established following the defeat in the 1989 presidential election). He returned in 1993 to organize the caravans of citizenship and participate in the campaign. [Trevisan] How did you come to work for Lula? [Prado] I knew Lula from the union movement, but I was more closely associated with his brother, Frei Chico. In 1981, I was teaching a few classes and looking for a job. I had left my job at the ZF of Brazil metallurgical firm the year before. (He completed his sociology course at the Santo Andre Foundation in Sao Paulo's ABC [Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo do Campo, and Sao Caetano do Sul industrial area] in 1981.) Lula was looking for someone to handle his agenda during the 1982 gubernatorial campaign in Sao Paulo. Frei Chico recommended me, and I accepted. [Trevisan] What was the most difficult political moment you witnessed in Lula's career? [Prado] His defeat in the 1982 elections. [Trevisan] Was it worse than his defeat by Fernando Collor in the 1989 presidential election? [Prado] Much worse. The reason was the number of people we managed to attract and then the small number of votes we received in the end. (Franco Montoro won the election, and Lula ended up in fourth place.) It was about six months before he recovered. The PT had been established in 1980, and the defeat caused doubts about the party's viability. Lula received a very large number of votes in 1989, and it became clear to us that it would be difficult to win the presidency. [Trevisan] How often do you talk to Lula? [Prado] Almost every day, either by telephone or in person. [Trevisan] I see that you have a scrambler (a device used to prevent telephone wiretapping). Do you use it when talking to Lula? [Prado] I bought it last year, but I have never used it. When we talk about important things, we do so in person. [Trevisan] To what faction in the PT do you belong? [Prado] You will have to believe me. I have never belonged to any faction, and I have never held a position of leadership in the party. I have always felt that holding office in the PT would be incompatible with a position in which I am so close to the party president.
