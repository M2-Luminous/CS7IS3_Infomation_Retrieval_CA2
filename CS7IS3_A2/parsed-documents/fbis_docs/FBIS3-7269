Mr. Chan Sek Keong noted that the director ot the Monetary Authority of Singapore's [MAS] economics department had handled a secret MAS report "in a most hazardous way" and failed to protect its secrecy. He urged the court not to believe parts of the evidence the accused had given in court, saying that it contradicted the position he took in a statement to the Internal Security Department [ISD]. Opening the prosecution's submissions yesterday, Mr. Chan noted that Shanmugaratnam had brought a copy of a secret MAS report, which contained the flash estimates, to a meeting with Crosby Securities analysts Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. This was a breach of MAS security rules, he argued. The report, he noted, had not been marked "secret". This made it more likely that it would not be handled with the required care, he argued. It was designed to highlight the flash estimate, had no cover and was not placed in a file, he said. The only precaution Shanmugaratnam took was to cover the report with a piece of paper. He made no other effort to ensure that the paper remained in place. He also removed the sheet of paper when he referred to the report during the meeting. Mr. Chan noted that Shanmugaratnam had argued in court that it did not make any difference whether the document was put in a file or covered with paper. He had said he saw no reason why secret documents should not be brought to meetings with private sector economists. This reflected his attitude towards security rules, said Mr. Chan. Shanmugaratnam had testified that more important than whether a document was placed in a file or not, was the way it was handled. He was confident he would not give away the data as he did not expect to be careless, he said. Taking issue with this, Mr. Chan said it was not clear how anyone could "expect not to be careless". He added that Shanmugaratnam's explanation that he had brought the report to the meeting to refer to the unclassified data in it, showed that he was more concerned about having a useful reference than the need to protect the secret information in it. He urged the court to reject Shanmugaratnam's statement that he had handled the secret document with more care than other government officials. During his day-long submission, he also took up the defence's argument that all the memos and reports from the Ministry of Trade and Industry [MTI] containing the flash estimates that had been admitted as evidence had been graded incorrectly or were not graded at all. Responding, he said that there was a lower degree of risk in these cases than Shanmugaratnam's. Two of these were internal memos, while the third, an MTI report, had been stamped secret and had a cover, he said. Later, he urged the court not to believe Shanmugaratnam's testimony when he said that he now thought it unlikely that Bhaskaran had sighted the figures when they met at the MAS. This contradicted a statement he made to the ISD in which he said he could not rule out the possibility that Bhaskaran had seen the data. This statement, he noted, was made before Shanmugaratnam had been charged. The Attorney-General continues with his submissions on Shanmugaratnam and the other accused today.
