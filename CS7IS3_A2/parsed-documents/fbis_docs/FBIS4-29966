Ambassador Stuart Hume, reached by telephone from Bangkok, said that, contrary to the Radio Rangoon report, he had conveyed no such offer in talks Friday with Burma's minister for border areas development, Lieutenant General Maunt Thint. Hume said he had raised the general question of access of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to people in the border areas, including zones inhabited by former insurgents. "We sought an assurance from the minister that NGOs were free to work in the border areas, which are frequently the most disadvantaged and where humanitarian needs are often the greatest," Hume said. The minister responded that NGOs were "welcome," the ambassador said. Some 10 NGOs are currently working on projects in Burma. NGOs set up their own projects in areas in need, rather than participating in programs put together by the ruling junta, Rangoon-based diplomats said. Australia and other Western nations have restricted assistance to Rangoon as a means of pressuring the junta to introduce democratic reforms. Canberra ended all official assistance to Rangoon after the military seized power in September 1988, killing thousands of people as it crushed a nationwide pro-democracy movement.
