This means that he disagrees with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, who in a DIE PRESSE interview rejected Austria's participation in such partnership. Commenting on the statements of the head of government and chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], Busek said: "This is not the government's opinion!" The OeVP chairman said: "We welcome this initiative. Undoubtedly, there is no alternative to it." Busek said that all the other [heads of] neutral European states "except for Vranitzky" have welcomed the initiative. Austrian Trade Union Federation Recommendation on the European Union Austrian Trade Union Federation [OeGB] President Verzetnitsch announced a separate OeGB recommendation for a referendum on European Union (EU) membership. This recommendation will be discussed at a conference at the end of the membership negotiations. Representatives of the two government parties on 17 January demonstrated cautious optimism that the membership negotiations would be completed by March. SPOe floor leader Fuhrmann considers a date in March "not totally unrealistic." OeVP Secretary General Molterer believes the odds in favor are "more than 50 percent."
