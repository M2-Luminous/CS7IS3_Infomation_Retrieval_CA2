Whereas it was expected that the Friday [18 March] session would deal with documentary testimony and the examination of all the written evidence in the investigators' file, two different testimonies shocked the courtroom. These concerned serious threats against direct or indirect participants in this trial, connected with the further course of the judgement of Fatos Nano. In a strongly worded protest, Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi publicly confirmed the existence of a violent threat against the husband of expert witness Virgjeresha Shkreli, threatening him with physical liquidation if his wife were to testify against Nano at the trial. Immediately after this, Nano's lawyer Perparim Sanxhaku made public another fact. According to him, a now-identified individual had threatened him because he is the Socialist leader's defense lawyer. "On the afternoon of 17 March, certain people whom the police and justice authorities have still not identified used physical and psychological pressure in the most unscrupulous and inhuman fashion against the husband of the expert witness Virgjeresha Shkreli," Prosecutor Qeleshi declared in his protest, "to the point of pointing a loaded pistol into his mouth and saying that, if his wife appeared in court, we will physically eliminate you and hang you." Before the file on the aid scandal was sent to the court, the expert witness Shkreli and her two colleagues had worked on calculating the amount of Italian aid lost, which the prosecutor has claimed were appropriated and misused. However, according to court rules, the work of the experts attached to the investigation must also be examined in court in the final stages of the judicial procedure. Only a few moments after Prosecutor Qeleshi's protest, the lawyer Sanxhaku reported another serious threat, this time against himself. "At 1730 on 15 March, an identified person driving a car with the license plate TR 2651 A threatened me personally," Sanxhaku declared, "saying that they would hang me from a rope." Thus, two very special pieces of evidence have come to light, joining Prosecutor Qeleshi's statement a few days before the start of the trial that he too had been personally threatened.
