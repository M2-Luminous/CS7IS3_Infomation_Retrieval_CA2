The first option -- option A -- concerns the organization of a referendum of self-determination next December without taking into account the reservations voiced by the Polisario Front. The third option -- option C -- is the pure and simple withdrawal of the UN. This, according to sources close to the Polisario, marks the failure of the United Nations and can only lead to the escalation of the conflict and war. As for option B, it envisages the continuation of negotiations as from 30 June in an attempt to secure the agreement of the two parties -- that is, Morocco and the Polisario -- on the criteria of identification of electors illegible to vote. The Polisario Front voiced reservations on these options [A and C] as explained by the ambassador of Western Sahara to Algiers: [Begin recording] [Ambassador] The Saharans think that these options need to be amended, that is the commission of identification of voters should be linked to the so-called compromise proposed by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. We think that this compromise is the formulation of the concessions made by our side. The UN Security Council should thus take into account the reservations voiced by the Polisario Front, included in the memorandum addressed to the UN special representative on 25 February.
