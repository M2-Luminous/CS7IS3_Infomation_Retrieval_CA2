FR940216-0-00031 FR940216-0-00009 50 CFR Parts 611, 675 and 676 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 110193D] Foreign Fishing; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish and associated management measures; closures. SUMMARY: NMFS announces final specifications of total allowable catches (TACs), initial apportionments of TACs for each category of groundfish, and associated management measures in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) during the 1994 fishing year. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits and associated management measures for groundfish during the 1994 fishing year. NMFS also is closing specified fisheries consistent with the final 1994 groundfish specifications and fishery bycatch allowances of prohibited species. These measures are intended to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the BSAI. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 10, 1994 through 24:00 Alaska local time (A.l.t.) on December 31, 1994, or until changed by subsequent notice in the Federal Register . All closures to directed fishing are effective through 24:00 A.l.t. December 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on directed fishing closures should be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, Alaska 99802&hyph;1668 (Attn: Lori Gravel). The final Environmental Assessment prepared for the 1994 TAC specifications may be obtained from the same address, or by calling 907&hyph;586&hyph;7229. The final Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report may be requested from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510 (907&hyph;271&hyph;2809). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen R. Varosi, Fishery Management Biologist, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Groundfish fisheries in the BSAI are governed by Federal regulations at 50 CFR part 675 that implement the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP). Other applicable regulations are found at 50 CFR 611.93 (foreign fishing) and 50 CFR part 676 (limited entry fisheries off of Alaska). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP and implementing regulations require the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, to specify annually the apportionments of prohibited species catch (PSC) limits among fisheries and seasons (ยง675.21(b)), the TAC, initial domestic annual harvest (DAH), and initial total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF) for each target species and the ``other species'' category (ยง675.20(a)(2)). The sum of the TACs must be within the optimum yield (OY) range of 1.4 million to 2.0 million metric tons (mt) (ยง675.20(a)(2)). Specifications set forth in Tables 1&hyph;7 of this action satisfy these requirements. For 1994, the sum of TACs is 2,000,000 mt. Proposed BSAI groundfish specifications and specifications for prohibited species bycatch allowances for the groundfish fishery of the BSAI were published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60584). Comments were invited through December 10, 1993. No written comments were received within the comment period. Verbal comments were received, and public consultation with the Council occurred during the Council meeting in Seattle, Washington, held December 6&hyph;10, 1993. Council recommendations and biological and economic data that were available at the Council's December meeting were considered in implementing the final 1994 specifications. The specified TAC for each species is based on the best available biological and socioeconomic information. The Council, its Advisory Panel (AP), and its Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) reviewed current biological information about the condition of groundfish stocks in the BSAI at their September and December 1993 meetings. This information was compiled by the Council's BSAI Groundfish Plan Team and is presented in the final 1994 SAFE report for the BSAI groundfish fisheries, dated November 1993. The Plan Team annually produces such a document as the first step in the process of specifying TACs. The SAFE report contains a review of the latest scientific analyses and estimates of each species' biomass and other biological parameters. From these data and analyses, the Plan Team estimates an acceptable biological catch (ABC) for each species category. A summary of the preliminary ABCs for each species for 1994 and other biological data from the September 1993 draft SAFE report were provided in the discussion supporting the proposed 1994 specifications. The Plan Team's recommended ABCs were reviewed by the SSC, AP, and Council at their September 1993 meetings. Based on the SSC's comments concerning technical methods and new biological data not available in September, the Plan Team revised its ABC recommendations in the final SAFE report dated November 1993. The revised ABC recommendations were again reviewed by the SSC, AP, and Council at their December 1993 meetings. While the SSC endorsed most of the Plan Team's recommendations for 1994 ABCs set forth in the final SAFE report, the SSC recommended revisions to ABC amounts calculated for Bogoslof pollock, Greenland turbot, and Atka mackerel. The Council adopted the SSC's recommendations for the 1994 ABSs. The final ABCs, listed in Table 1, reflect harvest amounts that will not cause overfishing as defined in the FMP.
