Only NATO can give the Baltic states guarantees of security. That is clear to all NATO member states. According to Georgs Andrejevs, the joining of NATO by Latvia will be determined to a great extent by foreign policy of larger NATO member states in the nearest future. Latvia, similarly to Lithuania and Estonia, has expressed the wish to join NATO in the future, on the occasions of meetings of both prime ministers and presidents of the Baltic states on 15 December 1993. However, Latvia has not yet considered the possibility of passing a separate document on joining NATO, stated Georgs Andrejevs. In a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, signed by the Lithuanian president, there is a request to send to Lithuania a commission of NATO experts who will determine whether Lithuania can be admitted to NATO. But according to Andrejevs, Lithuania is not ready for admission to NATO. Latvia, for its part, has to tackle the issue of the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvian territory before it invites a commission of NATO experts. As Andrejevs admitted, cooperation within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program, as the United States has envisaged it, already means the conclusion of bilateral agreements with NATO, and depending on the readiness of each state this agreement also envisages the opportunity to become a fully-fledged NATO member state. Thus, NATO can itself offer to join this organization, if cooperation within the framework of the peace program is successful and a country meets NATO's conditions in the military sphere.
