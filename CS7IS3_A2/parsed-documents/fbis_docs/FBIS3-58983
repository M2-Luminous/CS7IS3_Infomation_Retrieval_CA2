According to Foreign Minister Kooijmans, it is unfair that the EU negotiator is now being used as the scapegoat for the international failure to achieve a peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia. Kooijmans affirmed on Friday [21 January] that the action plan has failed. The member states must, therefore, ask themselves whether or not to further pursue the present path. The EU should not be considering whether or not to send Lord Owen home, but rather a change in his mandate. As to the nature of the change he envisages, he is not prepared to say at present. The motion by the European Parliament, which demanded Lord Owen's departure, was received poorly in The Hague on Friday. At a press conference in The Hague, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali praised the wonderful work by Owen and Stoltenberg. He said he would continue to support them as their work required patience, political will, and stamina. The four largest groups in the Second Chamber see the replacement of Owen as being of little value, as it does not bring an end to the conflict any nearer. They agree with Kooijmans that the real problem is not Owen, but the impotence of the international community.
