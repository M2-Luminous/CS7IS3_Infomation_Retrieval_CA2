The parliament resolution, adopted on March 29, says that the blame for this crime rests entirely with the Soviet authorities, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, and on the Azerbaijani leadership of that time, above all Abdurakhman Vizirov and Viktor Polyanichko, then first and second secretaries of the Azerbaijani Communist Party; Ayaz Mutalibov, the chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, Elmira Gafarova, the chairperson of the parliament's presidium, and Vagif Gusseynov, the chairman of Azerbaijan's KGB. Legal action has been initiated against these figures and also against former head of the Azerbaijani KGB's 4th department Nikolay Starchenkov, and Mark Shmotkin, the commander of the Baku Higher Military School, who organized an explosion in the Azerbaijani TV center. The document also says that legal action against Polyanichko and Gafarova were stopped because of the said figures' death. Meanwhile, some of the deputies insisted that the list of those guilty of the tragedy shall be supplemented with the names of Yevgeny Primakov, Dmitriy Yazov, Nikolay Kryuchkov and Vadim Bakatin. Most of the deputies agreed with President Gaydar Aliyev, who said that the blame for the tragedy rests with the former Soviet state. A leader of the parliamentary opposition Etibar Mamedov believes that the final assessment of the events in Baku in January 1990, may only be given by a new parliament, not the current one, elected during the rule of communists.
