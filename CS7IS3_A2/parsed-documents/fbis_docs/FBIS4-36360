Reactions differed on the meeting. While some House members regarded it as successful and satisfactory, others said it was an ordinary meeting in which nothing new was presented. House Member 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah asked reporters to rest because there was nothing new for them. AKHIR KHABAR acquired the text of the dialogue at the portrait gallery. Speaker Tahir al-Masri welcomed the prime minister, saying he hoped the meeting would succeed and that the prime minister would give the members satisfactory answers to their questions, whose highlights had been discussed outside the gallery. Al-Masri confined the questions to five points: inter-Arab relations, particularly Jordan's relations with Egypt, Syria, and Yemen; Jordanian-Palestinian relations; public liberties; the mechanism of employment in the government; and the Washington tripartite talks. Al-Masri concluded by emphasizing his request that the members of the House be thoroughly briefed. Al-Majali began by speaking about Jordanian-Egyptian relations, voicing great satisfaction with the recent Egyptian-Jordanian talks and the agreements reached, saying that Egypt treated Jordan with high esteem and that issues are proceeding very well and that Jordan is continually following up the implementation of these agreements by telephone. On Jordanian-Syrian relations, al-Majali said that during his majesty's recent visit to Syria, Jordan was surprised when the Syrians demanded more than coordination, alluding to a form of unity. Jordan voiced its firm stand on such issue, pointing out that it is prepared to promote relations with the Syrian brothers provided a calm and objective study is made first in order to make any form of a union a success. On the Syrian-Israeli track, al-Majali said "it seems" that the Syrians have covered a good measure of coordination with the United States and it was obvious from their talks that things are proceeding well on the Syrian track. On the Jordanian stand on the Yemeni crisis and the official media position, which some of the House members regarded as biased in favor of the north, al-Majali said: We take sides only with unity and legitimacy. Unity has been democratically chosen by the Yemeni people and we respect it. Al-Majali criticized 'Ali Salim al-Bid, explaining to the House members that when he came to Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord Agreement, al-Bid was accompanied by his wife and children. However, he kept them on the plane and alighted alone. He said that al-Bid's talks with his majesty continued until 0200 in the morning. Al-Majali said that al-Bid was so late in coming that Prince Hasan took him from the airport by helicopter to gain time and that his delay was intended to rob the negotiations of the needed time and prevent a discussion of all issues. This shows that al-Bid did not want unity. This was basis of the Jordanian position. Al-Majali rejected al-Bid's charges and accusations that Jordan assisted the north and affirmed Jordan's clear stand on this issue. Al-Majali then spoke about the Jordanian-Palestinian relations, declaring his dissatisfaction with what is happening. He said the talks now are not on the desired level. Meetings are held then working committees are formed. Jordan names its committee members but the PLO stalls and does not name its committee members. In the latest meeting, talks lasted until midnight and issues were proceeding satisfactorily but the head of the Palestinian delegation, Ahmad Quray', asked the head of the Jordanian delegation to give him some time to consult with the leadership in Tunis. They went and never returned to sign what had been agreed upon. On the issue of public liberties, al-Majali stressed the importance of internal security and said that his government gives it its utmost concern. He said: I do not deny that there are certain excesses here or there but the government is determined to respect liberties. He said the number of those detained by the intelligence department is 20 and that the department assured him that the moment they are interrogated, those who prove to be innocent will be released and the others will be referred to court. He said the department has allowed their relatives to visit them. On the issue of civil service appointments, al-Majali said the government explained this in the press and said that the civil service appointments system will be revised. He noted that this is an administrative issue and it should not be interfered with. He said that government will accept any observations by House members on this issue. On the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli talks in Washington, al-Majali said that this is an economic issue and has no political aspects but an attempt to explore the region's economic and political conditions. The prime minister's explanations on this point were not sufficient. The House members then directed their questions at the prime minister. Twenty members spoke, focusing on both internal and external policies. The Islamic Action Front members noted that the prime minister was appointing his relatives and in-laws to special posts. The prime minister categorically denied this charge and challenged them to show him a single instance of this kind. Member Bassam Haddadin questioned the government's lack of neutrality on Yemen and noted that there were signs of a separate solution between Jordan and Israel. Al-Majali answered by saying that the position toward Yemen is neutral and the government is neutral. He also said that it is impossible for Jordan to accept a separate solution with Israel.
