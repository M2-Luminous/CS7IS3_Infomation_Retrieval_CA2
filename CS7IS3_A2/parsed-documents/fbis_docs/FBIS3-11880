The main objective is to agree on a position for the Summit of the Americas, due to be held in December in Miami (United States). According to Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, the Rio Group foreign ministers should agree on common topics about commerce in the hemisphere, good management practices, the preservation of democracy, and social and environmental matters. The decision was announced on 22 March after the Rio Group countries' foreign ministers met for two days in Brasilia. Amorim and Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano took advantage of the meeting to sign an agreement for reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. Under the terms of the document, the two countries will permit the mutual free transfer of remittances. The agreement, however, includes reservations on six topics -- which were raised by Brazil -- to encourage Brazilian investment and restrict Chilean investment. The foreign ministers also began the preparatory work for the Rio Group summit, scheduled for September in Rio de Janeiro. Celso Amorim said the Latin American diplomats also will seek a common position for a meeting with the European Union scheduled for 22 and 23 April in Sao Paulo. According to Amorim, Latin American countries will make joint exchange proposals to Russia, China, Japan, and other Asian countries.
