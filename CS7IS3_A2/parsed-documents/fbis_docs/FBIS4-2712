When Comrade Jiang Zemin was Shanghai mayor, he called on the municipal government to do practical things for the people. That was seven years ago. Now, the municipal government has completed 97 practical things for the people, all of them were closely related to the masses daily lives. The municipal government's move won praises from the masses. For the past seven years, the Shanghai municipal government organized personnel and sent them to solicit the masses' opinions. Based on the masses' opinions, the municipal government prepared a practical-things list for that year in line with the principle of financial and manpower availability and with the principle of doing things in a down-to-earth manner. To ensure the completion of that year's list, relevant departments would cooperate with each other and give priority to completing those practical things. The 97 practical things that the municipal government has completed are concentrated mostly in the food supply, housing, and transport areas, things that the masses show most concern for. For the past seven years, housing construction has always been on the municipal government's practical-thing list. The municipal government has helped relieve Shanghai's overcrowded housing situation to some extent. Shanghai built over 600,000 housing units in the last seven years, thus adding 0.7 square meter to the per capita living space for its citizens. The municipal government has always paid attention to the "vegetable basket project" because it directly affects the interests of all citizens. The government has helped improve the nonstaple food supply. Citizens living in outlying areas or in new residential areas once complained about the unavailability of public telephone service at night. They said they were at a complete loss when emergencies occurred. To meet their demands, the municipal government entered the "emergency telephone" item on its practical-thing list. Following coordination with many relevant departments, it was decided that telephones at plants, stores, schools, and organs operating at nighttime would be open for public use. The new arrangement thus added 2,400 nighttime emergency telephones in the municipality. Last year, the municipal government also set up a "110 police information telephone" network to enhance the people's sense of security. Shanghai municipal government's persistence in doing practical things for the citizens in the last seven years has helped improve the living environment and quality of the masses. The elated masses called the government's practical-thing projects "projects of conscience."
