In the referendum people would decide whether those deputies who have left the party on whose slate they were elected should leave parliament. "The preliminary work is near to completion. Let people decide themselves who they want in parliament and who not," Meciar said, adding that "if a referendum does not provide a way out, early elections will be needed." Opposition leaders Peter Weiss, Jan Carnogursky and Bela Bugar, however, see early elections as the first way out of the current parliamentary crisis which came to a head at the end of last week when some HZDS deputies walked out, thus preventing a crucial decision on the privatization of state property worth 220 billion Slovakia korunas. Before that, the HZDS' post-election majority had been eroded by the gradual departure of nine deputies from the party. A coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS) proved of little help after six of the 14 SNS deputies broke away and have now effectively joined the opposition. Meciar said today that the results of the last elections had to be respected. "Attempts to make Deputy Premier Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik out to be second Knazko (Milan Knazko, one of the departed HZDS deputies) are the affair of the media. There are no basic differences of opinion between me and Kovac," Meciar said, assuring there would be no further splits in the HZDS. It has been speculated in the media that Kovac and Moravcik are considering creating a faction with the support of several HZDS deputies. Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in a television debate that the parliamentary session would continue on February 16. Meciar says however that the session will not take place unless the opposition allows Gasparovic to regain his constitutional authority in the direction of the session. Weiss has promised that the Democratic Left Party (SDL) will put forward a proposal for a solution to the crisis by February 16. Most of today's television discussion was taken up by the amendment to the law on large privatization which parliament had been debating. The opposition calls for greater control over what the government and premier do in this area. As there is at present no privatization minister in Slovakia, the post is filled by Meciar, who is also Chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM). Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Jan Carnogursky said today that this joining of posts and the loss of parliamentary control over privatization would lead to "the corruption of public life," to the lowering of the value of state property, the slowing down of the privatization process and the stagnation of the Slovak economy. Meciar rejected this accusation, and accused opposition politicians of having financial connections with 21 key joint-stock companies in which the FNM had called extraordinary plenary sessions with the aim of a change in statutes and a changes in their supervisory councils. He also argued that the privatization process in south Slovakia was ruled by Hungarian capital. "There is at least 55 percent Hungarian capital in nationally mixed areas, as much as 68 percent," he said. To this the chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic movement MKDH, Bela Bugar, said when the government is in a tight spot it pulls out the nationalist card.
