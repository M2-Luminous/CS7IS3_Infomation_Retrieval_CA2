Alain Juppe also paid tribute to the role of the United Nations in Bosnia: [Begin Juppe recording] It is true that there have been mistakes, and the way in which the negotiations over Gorazde were carried out throughout last Saturday and Sunday illustrates this fact. Nevertheless, I would like to qualify this judgement made against the United Nations. Everything is demanded of the United Nations, and it is given no means to fulfill the mission it is assigned. It is not given money; the organization is practically bankrupt: the main contributors don't pay -- though I must say straight away that this is not the case with France, which is up to date with its contributions -- and then the secretary general is not given the necessary troops. In Bosnia Mr. Butrus-Ghali said several months ago: I cannot fulfill my mission if I am not given 7,000-8,000 more men. France is the only country to have responded to this request. No other country followed. So it's easy to snipe at the United Nations, because it is a somewhat anonymous sort of beast. Yes, but we don't have any other weapon at our disposal, neither diplomatic weapons, nor weapons on the ground. So we have to support it rather than continue to denigrate it, I believe.
