FR940712-2-00074 FR940712-2-00053 The administrative law judge found that the Respondent used Demerol, without a legitimate medical purpose, and became addicted during the summer of 1992. To obscure his use of the drug from hospital and clinic personnel, the Respondent used Demerol from the hospital inventory, wrote false prescriptions, and, at least once, injected saline solution into a Demerol vial. Additionally, the Respondent failed to keep complete and accurate records of his acquisition, disposition, and inventory of controlled substances. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent's demanding work schedule, his spouse's health problems, and a shoulder injury predisposed the Respondent to Demerol addiction. The Respondent was charged, under Utah State law, with possessing and distributing a counterfeit substance, possession of a controlled substance without a valid prescription, possession of a false prescription and failure to make a record for prescribing and administering controlled substances. On May 3, 1993, before the Seventh Judicial District Court for San Juan County, Utah, the Respondent pled guilty to five felony counts. The Respondent's sentence included a fine, imprisonment not to exceed five years, and a one-year suspension of his medical license. The Court's Judgment and Order stayed the sentence for a period of five years and the Respondent was placed on probation with conditions, which included a two year prohibition from reapplying for a state controlled substance license. On May 5, 1993, the State of Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issued a Stipulation and Order with terms similar to that of the Judgment and Order, including a provision that the Respondent complete a rehabilitation program. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent participated in an aftercare recovery program, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; agreed to random drug screening all of which were negative; and was complying with or working on the conditions imposed in his probation agreement and in his licensing board stipulations. The administrative law judge concluded that the Respondent had made substantial efforts at rehabilitation, is presently in recovery, and that his prognosis for a full recovery is good. Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration may revoke the registration of a practitioner ``*␣*␣*upon a finding that the registrant_ (1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; (2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance; (3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his registration recommended by competent State authority; (4) has committed such acts as would render his registration under Section 823 of this title inconsistent with the public interest as determined under such section; or (5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to section 1320a&hyph;7(a) of Title 42.'' The administrative law judge determined that subsections (2), (3), and (4) provide a basis for revocation based on Respondent's conviction of five felony counts relating to controlled substances, his surrender of his state controlled substance license, and the public interest factors. Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors shall be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
