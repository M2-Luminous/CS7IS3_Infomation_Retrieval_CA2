"The traitor Kim Yong-sam blared that he `will work to strengthen the triangular cooperative system of South Korea, the United States and Japan' to `get rid of' the North and lay aside the past history of aggression of Japan, crying for `future-oriented relations'," the statement said, and went on: "Kim Yong-sam is trying to slay fellow countrymen in league with outside forces while turning back on the independent, patriotic stand and sincere efforts of the North for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country, and wipe off the slate the brutalities of Japanese imperialism which we can never pardon. He is, indeed, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and a dyed-in-the-wool pro-Japanese element who far outdistances the successive rulers. "The Japan mission of Hanminjon bitterly denounces with towering national resentment a sequence of acts committed by the traitor Kim Yong-sam during his tour of Japan, branding them as heinous treacheries and shameless flunkeyist acts. "By stating that the `Self-Defence Forces' of Japan could be dispatched to the Korean peninsula in `case of emergency,' the traitor Kim Yong-sam embarked upon a very dangerous road which might lead to a nuclear holocaust annihilating the nation, encouraging the Japanese reactionaries who are dreaming of overseas expansion." The statement called upon the entire South Korean people to reject the dependence on foreign forces and treacheries by taking the road of independence and patriotism and turn out as one in the struggle for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime.
