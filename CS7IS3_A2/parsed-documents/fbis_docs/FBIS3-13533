After the meeting, Ross said that the talks were useful and good and that he will meet with 'Arafat again this evening. Asked if the Palestinians will go to Washington to negotiate with the Israelis, Ross said that this issue has not yet been decided but consultations will be continued. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Political Department, took part in the meeting and said that the talks with Ross were very useful and were characterized by frankness. He noted that the talks dealt with the details of the situation in the occupied territories and the need to provide security requirements for the Palestinian people so that political negotiations can be resumed. He said that the talks with Ross will resume this evening to continue discussion on the points that were not resolved during the meeting. Members of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations declined to make any statements on the resolved issues or the points of disagreement. There are indications that during the meeting Ross failed to obtain 'Arafat's agreement to declare the PLO's return to the negotiating table with the Israelis and the resumption of the talks, which is the condition that the United States set on voting for the resolution submitted to the Security Council on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.
