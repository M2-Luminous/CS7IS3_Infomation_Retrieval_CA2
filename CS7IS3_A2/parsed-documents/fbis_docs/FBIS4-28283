FBIS4-28283 "dreas111_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 North Korea DFRF Releases Statement on National Meeting DFRF Releases Statement on National Meeting SK0306055394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0502 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306055394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF], released a statement to the press on June 2 expressing the hope for an early meeting with South Korean political parties, organisations and public figures to discuss the convocation of a national conference. Recalling that a consultative meeting of representatives of the government, political parties and public organisations of the DPRK on the 25th of May selected the North side's delegates to the preparatory committee of the national conference and, at the same time, urged the South Korean authorities to show an affirmative response to the North's proposal for the convocation of a national conference and select the South side's delegates to the preparatory committee as soon as possible, thereby keeping step with the North, Yu Ho-chun said the South Korean authorities, however, are still taking a wrong position. The true road of patriotism which should be chosen by the nation at present is to oppose war and confrontation and for all the compatriots in the North, South and overseas to be reconciled and united, transcending all the differences, and the most reasonable way for it is to convene a national conference. If the conference is to be convened as scheduled, we think, it is necessary for the political parties, organisations and public figures in the North and South who want reunification to meet in whatever form, to begin with, and have open-hearted discussions for a successful conference under the condition where the preparatory committee for the national conference has not yet been formed and the South Korean authorities are laying hurdles in its way. From this point of view the DFRF Central Committee urges the South Korean political parties, organisations of reunification movement and politicians and public figures who want contacts with us to meet in whatever form as soon as possible at any place. The South Korean authorities should not bar the representatives of the South Korean political parties and organisations and patriotic-minded figures from contacting us, but, though belatedly, positively respond to the proposal for the convocation of a national conference desired by all the fellow countrymen, clearly mindful that the convocation of the historic national conference is a national-historical demand.
