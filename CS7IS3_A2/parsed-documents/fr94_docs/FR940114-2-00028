FR940114-2-00028 FR940114-2-00019 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket Nos. ER94&hyph;347&hyph;000 through ER94&hyph;887&hyph;000] Electric Rate Filings Made Between December 22, 1993 and January 3, 1994, Including Amnesty Filings; Notice of Certain Rate Filings January 11, 1994. The Commission has received 438 rate filings, made under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, during the period December 22, 1993 through January 3, 1994. Many of the filings reflect the submission of multiple agreements for Commission review. Most of the filings have been made to take advantage of a general amnesty period, announced on July 30, 1993, for the filing of agreements under which jurisdictional service was being provided as of that date under previously-unfiled rates, terms and conditions. See Prior Notice and Filing Requirements Under Part II of the Federal Power Act, 64 FERC ¶␣61,139, reh'g denied, 65 FERC ¶␣61,081 (1993). Attachment A to this notice lists all of these rate filings in chronological and numerical order, starting with filings made on December 22, 1993. Attachment B to this notice lists all of these filings in alphabetical order, by applicant. Because of the extremely large number of rate filings made during the period December 22, 1993 through January 3, 1994, the Commission is unable to issue individual notices of filing for each of the filings made during this period. In order to ensure issuance of notice of filings at the earliest possible date, and to allow sufficient time for review and response, the Commission hereby issues this single notice for all of the filings listed in the Attachments. 1 Any person desiring to inspect a copy of any of the filings may do so during normal business hours in the Commission's public reference room, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. (Of course, customers to the filed agreements and, in many cases, affected state commissions already have actual notice of the contents of the filings by virtue of the Commission's regulations, see 18 CFR 35.2(d)). 1 If an individual notice of filing has issued or does issue in any one of the enumerated dockets, then that notice will control the deadline for interventions and protests. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest any of the enumerated filings should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211, 385.214. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to any of the proceedings. Any person desiring to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Motions or protests in response to filings made from December 22, 1993 through December 27, 1993, as indicated in the Attachments, should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Motions or protests in response to filings made from December 28, 1993 through December 29, 1993 should be filed on or before January 20, 1994. Motions or protests in response to filings made from December 30, 1993 through January 3, 1994 should be made on or before January 21, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
