The growing ambivalence was evident during a Saturday [5 March] panel discussion on the past and future of US-Taiwan trade ties sponsored by the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY. "The US has played a key role in the Republic of China [ROC]'s fast economic development over the past four decades," Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said at the discussion. "Without the American technology and capital badly needed by Taiwan, I don't think the development in the 1960's would have been so successful," Schive said. As a result of that help, Taiwan was the United States' sixth largest trade partner in 1993. However, mounting trade resulted in increased tensions, fueled by US calls to open certain protected sectors of Taiwan's market. "No country in the world has the right to impose a reform timetable on other countries," legislator Hsu Tien-tsai of the Democratic Progressive Party said, explaining why Taiwan residents have reacted strongly against the US push for open markets and IPR protection. Deborah Schwartz, director of the economic section of the American Institute in Taiwan, defended the US reform push, saying there is nothing negative about the high-profile position taken by the US during the recent trade and intellectual property rights talks. The talks and threats of sanctions are not intended to serve as a weapon, but to help Taiwan open its market and develop a mature economy. "Taiwan's economy developed largely as a result of open markets in the US," she explained. "The goal of (sanctions) is to give US products the same access to Taiwan's market as Taiwan products have in the US," she added. Schwartz added that market opening and intellectual property rights protection were "win-win" situations. She pointed out that at least six new computer software firms opened in Taiwan after the Copyright Protection Law was enacted. All participants agreed that increasing Taiwan investment in Mainland China would not affect US-Taiwan trade, and Schwartz, Chi, and Hsu all predicted continued good bilateral trade relations. The forum, chaired by Joseph Li, vice president of the Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research, was also attended by Sam S.M. Li, deputy secretary-general of the China External Trade Development Council.
