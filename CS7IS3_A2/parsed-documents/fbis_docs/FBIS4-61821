According to the outcome of the latest poll by the EMOR agency, Pro Patria's support among voters has fallen under the critical 5 percent. "Pro Patria has been attacked and accused from all directions and our biggest mistake is that we haven't had time beside other things to make publicity for our actions," Sinissaar told BNS. He also said it was natural that the political party that is in power would lose popularity among voters. When the standard of living increased last fall, also the people's expectations began to be higher than what was actually possible, he said. "Pro Patria has conducted a thorough analysis of these factors," Sinissaar said. "Our forecast is that the economic situation, and, arising from this, also the social situation will start to improve in Estonia in the near future," he said. He added that the party has learned its lesson from the recent developments and is now set to better explain the background and aims of its activity. As a first example of this, Sinissaar and Prime Minister Mart Laar wrote an article that was published in today's edition of the HOMMIKULEHT daily newspaper. Sinissaar said he believes that the party's approval ratings will be on the increase soon, because "everything that the coalition has done in the past year and a half starts to give tangible results namely now."
