Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told DPA in Ankara that the Turkish Armed Forces do not use the German weapons in contradiction to bilateral agreements or their own commitments. Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan had also reaffirmed this last Friday, he said. On Tuesday, in a letter to his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel again called for the observation of the NATO restrictions on the weapons supplied by Germany. According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel referred to the "recurrent assertions by politicians and media" that the German weapons that were supplied according to NATO provisions are used, contrary to the agreement, against the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). As early as on Monday, Kinkel had appealed to the Turkish Government to use means of the rule-of-law state for the prosecution of the Kurdish extremists and to refrain from using weapons from Germany in the fight against the PKK. Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ataman said that the representatives of the German media are apparently confusing the BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers that had been bought in Russia with the vehicles from the arsenals of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] People's Army supplied by Germany.
