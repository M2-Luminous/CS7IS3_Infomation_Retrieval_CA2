Greece remains ready to develop good neighborly relations and close cooperation with Skopje, thus contributing substantially to its development and prosperity. Greece remains a country that is really well disposed toward Skopje. Greece remains ready to participate in a dialogue with Skopje under the UN auspices. From the time Skopje was accepted in the United Nations, through the formation of the current government -- and despite the previous Greek Government, according to its policy, participating in a dialogue with Skopje -- we have noted the continuous aggravation of Skopje's provocation, its intransigence, and its deceitful offensive propaganda. Since the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia and the creation of the issue of Skopje, Skopje has taken no conciliatory or prudent step. Indeed, since that time, Skopje has set in motion a constitutional document in a strongly offensive context and very provocatively adopted historic Greek symbols, including the Star of Veryina, which was hitherto unknown, foreign, and uninteresting for them. Greece's firm and principle goal is peace, stability, and security in the greater region. To serve this goal and to make the relevant UN decisions credible and real, Greece asked for something that should have been self-explanatory. Greece asked Skopje for specific and practical steps to indicate its willingness to abandon the increasingly offensive propaganda against Greece through points in its constitution and its symbolism. These specific signs are not Greek conditions but, in the final analysis, are Skopje's commitments born out of international law. Greece has stated that if Skopje had taken these necessary, practical steps, it could have examined the possibility of lifting its objections to Skopje's accession to the CSCE. As Skopje's intransigence continued, even intensified, many members of the international community, including member countries of the European Union and recently the United States, established diplomatic relations or recognized Skopje, most of course with the name FYROM [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. Greece does not want to comment on the evaluations and motives behind these moves. The result, though, was that Skopje misinterpreted all these moves, which gave the illusion that it can be indifferent to the Greek positions and the problems it causes for the stability of the greater area. [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's recent impudent letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton proves to Greece that Skopje does not appear to realize the special or unique importance of normalizing its relations with Greece or the problems it causes with its behavior in a particularly sensitive area. Greece, a member of the European Union and presiding over the Union during this half of the year, a member of NATO and the CSCE, and a country with an institutional, social, and economic structure that places it firmly in Western civilization, is obliged to act as the primary guarantor of peace, stability, and security in the region. Greece is obliged to undertake -- it does -- and assume initiatives in this direction, centering on the Yugoslav crisis and the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Greece is obliged to foster respect for international law and play a major role in implementing UN decisions. Consequently, Greece is obliged, especially in the current international arena, to restate with absolute clarity the framework of its own positions and actions. Unfortunately, because the reasons, no matter how hard and firm they are, are undermined or misinterpreted, Greece is obliged to state its position with specific actions. The Greek Government has decided: 1. To suspend operations at its general consulate in Skopje, and 2. To suspend the movement of goods to and from Skopje through the port of Thessaloniki. The exception is that which is absolutely necessary for humanitarian purposes, such as food and medicine. The Greek Government's decision today constitutes a message to Skopje and to others, including all those who participate in formulating the positions of the international community. Greece is always ready to participate in a dialogue with Skopje under UN auspices, as long as this dialogue is honest and substantive and always given our country's position regarding the name of Skopje. Something like this, though, is subject to -- and everyone had better understand this -- the specific and practical signs that Skopje must show. Unfortunately, there has been no sign that it understands the reality and the prospects. Thank you. [applause]
