FR941025-1-00044 FR941025-1-00012 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB66 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reopening of Comment Period on Proposed Threatened Status for the Goliath Frog AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a reopening of the comment period on the proposed rule to list the goliath frog ( Conraua goliath ) as threatened through to November 1, 1994, in order to allow additional time for receipt of comments from affected countries. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, information, and questions should be submitted to the Chief, Office of Scientific Authority; Mail Stop: 725, Arlington Square, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Washington, D.C. 20240. Fax number (703) 358&hyph;2276. Express and messenger delivered mail should be addressed to the Office of Scientific Authority; Room 750, 4401 North Fairfax Drive; Arlington, Virginia 22203. Comments and other information received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday at the Arlington, Virginia, address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Charles W. Dane, Office of Scientific Authority, at the above address, or by phone at (703) 358&hyph;1708. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Following the receipt and review of a petition dated April 9, 1991, to add the goliath frog to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, the Service proposed in a September 12, 1991, Federal Register notice (56 FR 46397) to list the goliath frog as threatened. The information received in response to the request for comments contained in the proposed rule, as well as the comments received at the March 2&hyph;13, 1992, meeting of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), left questions as to whether listing under the Act is warranted. Consequently, a final decision has yet to be announced, and the comment period was reopened on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36737) to close on October 17, 1994. Additional information was requested from the CITES Management Authorities of the range countries, i.e., Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, before September 10, 1994. However, the official contact with those countries through the U.S. Embassies in those countries was completed at a later date. Therefore, in order to provide adequate opportunity to receive additional information those countries were informed that their comments would be accepted until November 1, 1994.
