FR940630-0-00067 FR940630-0-00025 34 CFR Part 682 RIN 1840&hyph;AB83 Federal Family Education Loan Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of revised effective date; final regulations. SUMMARY: In the Federal Register of April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22462), the Secretary published final regulations for the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, 34 CFR part 682. The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations until July 1, 1994. By delaying the effective date, the Secretary seeks to reduce confusion about the effective date of these regulations by making the effective date consistent with the effective date of other changes to the regulations published by the Secretary at that same time. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994, with the exception of the amendments to §§682.202, 682.208, 682.402, 682.410, and 682.411. These amendments will become effective after the information collection requirements contained in these sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Subject to approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the following applicability dates also apply to certain provisions of these regulations: Section 682.202(c), which reduces the amount of the origination fee charged on an FFEL Program loan, applies to loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 1994, if the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended either includes that date or begins on or after that date. Section 682.202(d), which reduces the amount of the insurance premium charged on an FFEL Program loan, applies to loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 1994, if the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended either includes that date or begins on or after that date. Section 682.410(b)(5)&hyph;(7), which requires guaranty agencies to warn defaulters that they may be subject to administrative wage garnishment and offset against Federal or State income tax refunds, applies to claims paid by the agency on or after August 27, 1994. Section 682.411, which requires lenders to warn delinquent borrowers that they may be subject to administrative wage garnishment and offset against Federal or State income tax refunds if they default on their loans, applies to loans on which the first day of delinquency is on or after August 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Harris, Senior Program Specialist, Loans Branch, Division of Policy Development, Policy, Training, and Analysis Service, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Room 4310, ROB&hyph;3), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5449. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;8242. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations which are affected by this change in effective date amend the FFEL loan discharge regulations. The effective date of these regulations has been delayed until July 1, 1994 so that all of the regulations implementing changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and certain technical changes made by the Cash Management Improvement Act Amendments of 1993 in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program which were published in the Federal Register before May 1, 1994 will take effect on July 1, 1994. The Secretary was informed that there was confusion among participants in the FFEL Program about the effective date of the regulations because other regulations published at the same time and implementing other changes to the HEA were not effective until July 1, 1994. The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations to resolve the confusion and to afford participants in the FFEL program additional time to comply with the requirements of these regulations. Waiver of Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232 (b)(2)(A)), and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, because the Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations for only a brief period to reduce confusion and afford participants in the FFEL program additional time for compliance, the Secretary finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the solicitation of public comment on this change in the effective date would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
