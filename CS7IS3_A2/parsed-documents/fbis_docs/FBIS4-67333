FBIS4-67333 "jptdd022__l94098" JPRS-TDD-94-022-L JPRS Narcotics 9 April 1994 WEST EUROPE GREECE Statistics on Narcotics Users Detailed Statistics on Narcotics Users Detailed 94WD0333A Athens TA NEA in Greek 9 Apr 94 p 13 94WD0333A Athens TA NEA Greek CSO [Unattributed article: "There Are 10-Year-Old Users!"] [Text] The myth of the broken family as the chief cause of young people resorting to drug use should perhaps be knocked down. There are other causes for drug use according to the conclusions of a four-year study by the Forensic Medicine Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki [AUT], which had the sad duty of continually contacting and observing the drug-dependent individuals of the area. The conclusions of the study, which were drawn from hundreds of interviews and case histories of narcotics users, during the period from 1989 to 1993, will be presented today in a report by Mr. Matthaios Tsoungas of the Forensic Medicine Department of AUT, at the 9th Medical Conference of Northern Greece. The most dramatic fact arising from the analysis of interviews with a total of 2,194 individuals who "passed" through the laboratory of the Forensic Medicine Department during the period from 1989 to 1993 is that the age of first contact with narcotics seems to be more often lower, even "touching" the preteen years. It is characteristic that--as they themselves confessed--two users first came into contact with drugs at the age of 10. One of them--as he himself declared--began with Indian cannabis, and the other with medicinal drugs. The results of the analysis of drug users' responses yielded the following statistics: Among the drug users, 36.2 percent were illiterate or elementary school graduates; 39.6 percent had finished the third year of middle school or technical school; 21.8 percent indicated that they were high school graduates; and 2.4 percent had a college education. The myth of the family environment as a catalytic influence would seem to collapse in view of the results of this long-term study, because 57 percent of the users of so-called "hard drugs" declared that they were not dealing with any problem at home, and only 11.2 percent were children from broken homes. Those who had lost one or both parents comprised 13.2 percent, while 18 percent faced problems with family members (siblings, aunts and uncles, etc.). According to Mr. Tsoungas, the only area in which drug users displayed a special reluctance to answer was in relation to their professional standing, which figures are issued with reservations as to their reliability. According to replies of the users themselves, 36.2 percent declared themselves unskilled, 33.4 percent were blue-collar workers, 12.6 percent were white collar workers, 14.4 percent were professionals, 3 percent were farmers, and only one user declared himself a scientist. The study's "subject matter" was a sample of 2,194 individuals, the large majority of whom (over 80 percent) were men of all ages. The increase in the number of drug users being brought to the Forensic Medicine Laboratory in the last few years is worrisome. Specifically, in 1989, 385 individuals were brought for examination (after being arrested for use or for dealing); in 1990 there was an increase to 477; in 1991 a decrease to 416; in 1992 there were 434; while in 1993 there were 482. The age of those examined varied from 16 up to 76 years old. According to the information in the Forensic Medicine Laboratory's study, 46.6 percent of users stated that they began using from the age of 18; 43.8 percent stated that they began using drugs between the ages of 19 and 25; 9.6 percent of respondents began using drugs beyond the age of 25. The users' responses on the causes to blame for their resort to narcotics are characteristic: 65.1 percent of the users stated that they began using drugs out of curiosity, or through peer contact; 14.7 percent thought that they had been lead to drugs due to economic or family problems; 6.7 percent stated that they began using after joining the the Merchant Marine, while 13.5 percent began using during their time of military service. With regard to substances with which drug use began, the conclusions reached in the study are characteristic--though scientifically disputable: 64.7 percent of users stated that they began with Indian cannabis, without this meaning that cannabis is necessarily serving as the "lead-in" for the so-called "hard drugs," especially if one keeps in mind that an especially large proportion of chronic cannabis users never go on to other substances. Thirty percent of users stated that they began with pills and other medicinal preparations, while 4.4 percent said that they went straight to heroin, and only 0.9 percent stated that they began with cocaine.
