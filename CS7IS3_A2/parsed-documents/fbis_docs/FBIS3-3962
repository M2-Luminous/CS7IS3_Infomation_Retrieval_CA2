"The authorities are going to have to face very serious social tests," the 300-page report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, acquired by AFP, says. The document starkly illustrates the worries exercising the communist leadership as it grapples with ambitious reforms to transform the economy. President Jiang Zemin rammed home the dual message on Tuesday, instructing officials to "protect reforms while preserving stability" in everything they do. The report, entitled "The Social Situation in China, 1993-4: Analyses and Forecasts," looks back on a year of growing fragility in Chinese society, as it struggled to cope with double-digit economic growth. It confirmed independent reports of unrest in Moslem-minority regions in western China, the scenes of "the bloodiest unrest" in the country in 1993. In May, riots broke out in Kashgar, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where "separatists carried out terrorist acts, causing explosions, and put up reactionary posters," it said. In late August and early September, "hundreds of thousands of Muslims demonstrated" in western China, the academics said. On the industrial front, "strikes and demonstrations increased," it said, disclosing that there had been 30 "serious incidents" at plants in the eastern city of Ningbo in May alone. As for the cause of the discontent, the report pinned the blame on the strains experienced by state firms as they struggled with the adjustment to capitalist economics. "More and more workers cannot have a normal live because of the financial difficulties of state firms," it said, estimating that seven million working-class families were living in hardship, equal to around 20 million people in all. Turning to 1994, the Academy said that inflation -- currently running at around 20 percent in the cities -- was "already more than alarming. Elements of social instability will increase further as economic reforms deepen," it predicted. "The possibility of serious unrest in regions experiencing economic difficulties cannot be ruled out," the report said, predicting an ever-widening rift between the rich eastern coastal provinces and the backward regions of the west. Factories would experience greater tension, as there is bound to be "more unemployed workers, strikes and violence against plant officials." The document added that "friction is inevitable" between the central government and the regional authorities, which would fuel regionalism. A Chinese think-tank last year also cited this as a potential cause of a breakup after the death of 89-year-old leader Deng Xiaoping. "Numerous acts of sabotage by hostile forces, inside and outside the country" could be feared, the report said, making an implicit reference to Islamic fundamentalists and Tibetans. Crime, which surged last year, would continue to rise. It called on the government to apply "social measures as well as economic reforms" not only by attacking basic problems but also by stepping up police efficiency and the campaign against corruption. But it notably also made a public call on the country's top leaders to show greater transparency in their lifestyle and also to "listen to public opinion."
