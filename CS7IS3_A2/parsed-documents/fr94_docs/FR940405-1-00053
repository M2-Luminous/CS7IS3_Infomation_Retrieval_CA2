FR940405-1-00053 FR940405-1-00013 The formation of DNA adducts is widely accepted as an initial step in the carcinogenesis process. The measurement of DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling assay has been used as a way to assess DNA damage following exposure to cigarette smoke. Lee et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;194] exposed Sprague-Dawley rats to 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg total particulate matter/m3 of aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS) for 6 hours per day for 14 consecutive days. They examined the DNA from lung, heart, larynx and liver after 7 and 14 days of exposure and after 14 days of recovery. They also examined alveolar macrophages for chromosomal aberrations. Exposure related DNA adducts were found in the highest dose test. However, no elevation in chromosomal aberrations was observed in alveolar macrophages in this study. Similar results were also obtained when animals were exposed to the same three concentrations for up to 90 days. DNA adducts were seen in lung, heart and larynx DNA of the animals exposed to the highest concentration of ADSS [Ex. 4&hyph;195]. The adduct levels were highest after 90 days of exposure and were significantly reduced in all target tissues 90 days after cessation of exposure. Again, chromosomal aberrations in alveolar macrophages were not elevated in any group after 90 days of exposure. The authors concluded that the concentration of DNA adducts formed in the lung tissue did not increase linearly as the ADSS concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mg. Several short-term tests have been performed in eukaryotic systems. A solution of the gas phase of mainstream cigarette smoke has been shown to induce reciprocal mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D3 and petite mutants in an isolate of strain D3 [Ex. 4&hyph;163]. Whole mainstream cigarette smoke induced mitotic gene conversion, reverse mutation, and reciprocal mitotic recombination in strain D7 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Ex. 4&hyph;113]. Transformation of mammalian cells was induced in several cell systems using the cigarette smoke condensate from mainstream cigarette smoke [Exs. 4&hyph;22, 4&hyph;161, 4&hyph;188, 4&hyph;267, 4&hyph;268, 4&hyph;298]. Another in vitro assay that measures the number of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced has been employed widely to determine the mutagenic activity of cigarette smoke. Valadand-Berrieu and Izard [Ex. 4&hyph;313] used a solution of the gas phase from cigarette mainstream smoke and showed that this solution induced a significant dose-related increase in sister-chromatid exchanges. Putman et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;257] have also demonstrated dose-dependent increases in sister chromatid exchange frequencies in bone-marrow cells of mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 weeks. Review of the literature clearly demonstrates that MS smoke and ETS exposure causes cancer in humans. These results are supported not only by animal studies but also by studies that show SS smoke to be both genotoxic and clastogenic. 8. Conclusions
