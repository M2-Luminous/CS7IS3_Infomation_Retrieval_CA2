"The president does not intend to follow the practice which is usual for such situations in the West and will not put the blame on the partner by reshuffling or changing the cabinet", the spokesman told reporters on Thursday. "Nothing radical is in store", he stressed and said that rumours about a possible dismissal of Privatisation Minister Anatoliy Chubays are "inventions and bluff". But Kostikov admitted that the president had expressed "serious remarks" to Viktor Chernomyrdin during their 6-hour long meeting on Tuesday because of poor implementation of presidential decrees and economic decisions. However, "the president and the prime minister act in a coordinated way and there is no talk about a crisis of trust between them", according to Kostikov. "There are serious remarks, tough criticism on the part of the president. The actions of the government are assessed by the president as unsatisfactory in a number of aspects, but there is no misunderstanding", he stressed. After the signing of the Civic Accord Treaty the president and the government "acquired a sufficient degree of political confidence which allows them not to hide disagreements which exist between them. In conditions of a greater stability there is a possibility to raise questions in a sharper way without fearing they would affect the political situation", Kostikov said.
