Speaking at the University Auditorium (in this capital's Zone One), where he cast his vote, the president said he trusts the referendum will strengthen the democratic system, which was negatively affected by the foiled self-coup d'etat by Jorge Serrano Elias. De Leon said this morning voting is taking place within the framework of "political calm." Meanwhile, the Defense and Government Ministries have mobilized at least 24,000 troops throughout the country. The president said he is happy with the way Guatemalans are participating, because "the referendum is taking place as planned" despite terrorist activities. He said: "The referendum represents an example to the world, because while in other countries, political crisis are resolved in antidemocratic and violent ways; here in Guatemala electoral mechanisms are wielded to resolve problems." Referring to the threat of a transportation stoppage on 1 February, de Leon Carpio said: If necessary, "I will check it." He cautioned: "I will assume my responsibilities with whatever measure I may have to adopt in the economic, social, and political fields." De Leon discarded, however, utilization of the Army to guarantee power and staples for the Guatemalans. Regarding this Sunday's referendum, he said there are many covert groups (which he did not identify) that are interested in the democratic system not gaining strength. He cautioned that if the "no" vote wins and should public order be disrupted, "I will adopt measures the situation may require and the law allows, because I will not tolerate any disruption of public order." De Leon Carpio--who hinted that violence could increase if the no vote wins--said: "The enemies of democracy are not very happy." The president reiterated his intention to fight violence and poverty, which affects 80 percent of Guatemalans, and to channel resources to strategic fields, such as health and housing.
