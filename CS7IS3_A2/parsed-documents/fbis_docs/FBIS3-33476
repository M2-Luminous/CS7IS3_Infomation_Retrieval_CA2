The search for a slate on which to be a candidate in the October elections is transforming the parties into electoral Frankensteins. When it was founded, back during the days of the Constituent Assembly in 1988, the PSDB immediately acquired a symbol and a nickname. Its symbol is the toucan, and its nickname was the "Sorbonne Party," a reference to its necktie-sporting leaders with their doctorates. So far the party has remained faithful to its mascot, but not to its nickname. Over the last few days, the party has picked up members as disparate as an economist with ties to unions, a business leader, and a rancher. In other words, it has attracted a sympathizer of the PT [Workers Party], a former member of Collor's PRN [National Reconstruction Party], and a former bionic governor from Arena [National Renewal Alliance]. To put things even more clearly, the party has been joined by Minister of Labor Walter Barelli; Albano Franco, president of the National Confederation of Industry (CNI); and former Minas Gerais Governor Aureliano Chaves. What do the three of them have in common? Until a few days ago, they had nothing. Now they have the party. The "Frankensteinization" of Brazilian parties had a deadline. According to the election timetable approved by Congress, politicians wanting to be candidates in the elections of 3 October had to join a party by Sunday the 9th. Just before that date arrived, the parties received an avalanche of new members who, on the pretext of offering electoral benefits, ended up further eroding the distinctiveness of the various parties. Besides the PSDB, the phenomenon also had a strong effect on at least two other parties: the PP [Progressive Party] and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. But it was in the PSDB that the repercussions were greatest. The toucan symbolizing the PSDB is now sporting a promising forelock [a reference to President Franco]. It was with the support of President Itamar Franco and his team that the PSDB gained Barelli and Albano Franco. The party also took in Minister of Justice Mauricio Correa, who had been without a party since his break with Leonel Brizola and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. The invasion by politicians with different plumages has caused an uproar in the tucano nest. "The only thing lacking is for General Figueiredo to join the PSDB," Deputy Edmundo Galdino (PSDB, Tocantins) raves. The strongest objections have concerned Albano Franco. The senator was invited to join three months ago by Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, who is Albano's partner in a bid to win the contract for cellular telephones in Ceara. The PSDB bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, headed by Deputy Jose Serra, opened its beak at the time and is still complaining. Reactions opposing Albano have also come from Sao Paulo, where the PSDB is strongest. Senator Mario Covas, the PSDB's candidate for governor of Sao Paulo, has told friends that he would not like to see Albano on the party slate. But the most indignant reaction has come from Senator Jutahy Magalhaes, Sr., who is threatening to change parties if Albano's membership is not rejected. The problems between the two men involve a murky family quarrel. As minister of social welfare, Jutahy Magalhaes, Jr., did everything he could to get rid of the Brazilian Welfare Legion (LBA) headed by Leonor Franco, Albano's wife. Leonor not only managed to keep the LBA intact: she was even appointed to be the new minister of social welfare. Although controversial, Aureliano's decision to join has not caused a commotion equal to the one created by the arrival of Albano. "I have no aspirations to be a candidate," says the former governor and former vice president. "I joined the PSDB only in order to have a platform for the more consistent exercise of citizenship," he philosophizes. With a new look and a little mustache as well, Aureliano withdrew from politics after bringing up the rear in the presidential election of 1989. Despite his denials, he is behaving like someone who wants to run for state governor, but along the way he is going to encounter PSDB member and former Minister Paulino Cicero, who also has his eye on the governorship of Minas Gerais. While the addition of Albano and Aureliano to the party has been viewed with distrust, the same cannot be said of Barelli's decision to join. The minister has not only been well received: he is already the subject of jokes. Barelli is being called the PSDB's most likable economist, making him a counterpoint to Deputy Jose Serra's difficult temperament. The 1994 elections may also include the charms of the most refined Rio de Janeiro elite. Socialite Regina Marcondes Ferraz is the most illustrious acquisition by the PPR in Rio de Janeiro. Now that she has joined the party at the request of former Minister of Finance Francisco Dornelles, Regina will have someone in the party with whom to discuss Chanel's latest collection. The reason is that the PPR has also received reinforcement in the form of the first lady of Alagoas, Denilma Bulhoes, who is in the habit of wearing the most famous European labels while campaigning in the environs of Maceio. Regina may not have Denilma's political experience, but she does not consider herself a novice. "During the 1989 presidential campaign, I even held meetings in my home for Maluf," she says. "Considering all the chaos in which the country finds itself, I decided that it was time to participate more fully, so I joined the PPR." Regina has not yet decided whether to be a candidate, although her friend Dornelles is pressing her to do so. Taken by a sudden interest in politics since he began courting former Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello, humorist Chico Anysio also beat the deadline for party affiliation by choosing a party, although like Regina, he is not confirming his candidacy. Chico chose the PP. One of those at his side will be union leader Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, president of Union Power. Medeiros first considered joining the PSDB, but he was intimidated by the posturing of the party leaders in Sao Paulo with all their plumage. Since the perch was so narrow, he chose to land in the PP, which has "progressive" in its name and a bunch of conservatives in its ranks. To give an example, he will be in the company of Brasilia businessman Luiz Estevao, Fernando Collor's inseparable friend--one of the latter's few inseparable friends, let it be said. The PRN, which had more than 30 deputies at the start of the Collor administration, is now down to seven musketeers. Three Party Models PSDB: Known as the party of intellectuals, it now presents an eclectic profile: the standard PSDB member wears the hat of Aureliano Chaves (formerly of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]), has the face of Minister Barelli (formerly almost a member of the PT) and the body of businessman and Senator Albano Franco (formerly of the PRN), and wears the tennis shoes of Deputy Maurilio Ferreira Lima (formerly of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]). PPR: The party that has always had the face of Maluf is acquiring new ingredients in addition to the unmistakable bald head of Esperidiao Amin. The party is celebrating the solid acquisition of First Lady Denilma Bulhoes. Socialite Regina Marcondes Ferraz has also joined, although she denies wanting to be a candidate. PP: This is one of the newest and most heterogeneous parties. It has the distinctive hair of former Governor Alvaro Dias (Parana), the huge mustache of Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the body of Professor Raimundo/Chico Anysio, and the legs of Governor Joaquim Roriz (Federal District), who is having a rough time on the CPI [congressional investigating committee].
