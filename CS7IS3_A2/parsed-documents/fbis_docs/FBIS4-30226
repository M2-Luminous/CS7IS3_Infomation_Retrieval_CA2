Speaking at the National Press Club of Japan, the central bank chief pointed to emerging bright signs on the economic horizon in a remark following his past comments on the state of the economy. Mieno went on to say that corporate activities seem on a recovery path, citing an improvement in personal spending in some categories and increasing exports. As for the yen's recent surge that saw it shoot past the 100 to the dollar level, Mieno said he has serious concern about foreign exchange rates and noted that he will take appropriate action whenever needed while keeping close contact with other group of seven industrialized nations. He said the yen's sharp appreciation should help promote an industrial shakeup in Japan. On corporate investment, one of the main driving forces of the economy, Mieno said that it would take time to see corporate investment in plant and equipment pick up because adjustments to past excessive investment remain. Mieno apparently made the comment in view of the nation's gross domestic output for the January-March quarter announced Tuesday, which showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, or the best performance in three years, on the strength of personal spending and not corporate investment.
