Foreign investors or those from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao once were forbidden to invest in the Chinese commercial retail business. Trial utilization of foreign funds in this field in some large cities including Beijing and Shanghai was approved by the State Council only in recent years to meet the growing demand of consumers. Since then, Shanghai commercial departments have approved 300- plus foreign invested retail projects with a total capital exceeding one billion U.S. dollars. Investors are from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and some transnational corporations. Following the Eastern Shopping Mansion, another large-scale complex named the Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center and partly funded by Hong Kong investors opened to service recently in Shanghai. Equipped with high-standard facilities and stocked with world- renowned brands, these shopping centers manage to provide elegant and comfortable shopping environments and greater selection for those consumers with high income. In order to attract more local wage-earners, the newly-opened Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center offers affordable daily necessities in conjunction with expensive luxuries in its beautifully-decorated shopping halls. Its commodities amount to more than 30,000 varieties in total. "If you want to make your brands known in China, Shanghai can help you do it," general manager of the Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center said, which is also what most overseas investors in Shanghai's retail business firmly believe.
