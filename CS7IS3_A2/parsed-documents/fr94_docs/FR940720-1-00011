FR940720-1-00011 FR940720-1-00004 Regulatory Procedures Executive Order No. 12866 We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since these rules affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act These proposed rules impose no additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget clearance.
