Ministers firmly believe that other members of the United Nations should first be asked to contribute if extra forces are required to enforce a peace accord in Sarajevo. Britain, the second largest contributor of forces in the former Yugoslavia after France, is already concerned at the open-ended nature of the humanitarian operation. Although a wide range of Army units has been "earmarked" to reinforce the 2,300-strong British contingent, none has been placed on short notice to move. Despite the soaring tension following NATO's 10-day ultimatum to the Serbs to pull back artillery units from Sarajevo, Britain does not believe reinforcements are necessary at this stage. Units which could be deployed in an emergency if the Serbs launched large-scale retaliatory attacks for air strikes include an infantry battalion with Saxon armoured personnel carriers and an artillery regiment. The battery of six 105mm light guns, which was returned to Britain last June after five months sitting off the Croatian coast, remains on notice and could be flown out to the region. "There are a wide range of capabilities which have been earmarked to reinforce British troops if required depending on the situation but we are not prepared to discuss numbers, units or specific capabilities," said the Ministry of Defence.
