Under the plan, the Central American nations would receive Haitian refugees "temporarily" while a solution is sought to the current crisis in that Caribbean nation. Figueres told ACAN-EFE that Washington is working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in an attempt to "assist those Haitian citizens who feel politically threatened." Figueres added: "The idea is for these people to stay here on a temporary basis, until they can be returned to Haiti." Although Figueres stressed that "all of us are concerned" about the situation in Haiti, "so far, we have yet to make a decision." He added, "We will be evaluating the request within the next few days." Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo confirmed Washington had indeed presented the request to Costa Rica, but he explained that it would affect only political refugees, not economic refugees. He added that the issue would be studied jointly by the United States and Costa Rica.
