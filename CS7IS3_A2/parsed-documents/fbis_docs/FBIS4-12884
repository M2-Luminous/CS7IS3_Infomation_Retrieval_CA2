He pointed out that the battle over freedoms has started and will not end until positive results are achieved, which can only take place through the restoration of newscasts and political programs to the audio and visual media. During the expanded Phalangist Party meeting that was held yesterday at party headquarters, Sa'adah said: During the al-Ta'if meetings, the issue of these varied and numerous media was presented.
