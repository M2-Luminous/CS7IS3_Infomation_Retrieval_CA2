This was stated by President Islam Karimov after his visit to Ankara. He said that lately certain political forces have been dissatisfied with such a state of affairs. He added that everything promoting the country's growth and its international influence provokes their negative reaction. Karimov said these forces shadow relations with Turkey. He said one of the main purposes of his visit to Turkey last week was to prove that Uzbekistan and Turkey are interested in each other. "I see Turkey as the closest, most reliable partner," the president stressed. During the visit Karimov held talks with his counterpart Suleyman Demirel. The two sides signed a treaty on legal assistance in criminal, trade and civil cases and a protocol between the two foreign ministries on cooperation and mutual consultations. Karimov urged Turkish businessmen to expand cooperation with partners in Uzbekistan and continue setting up joint ventures. (There are over 100 such mixed companies in Uzbekistan at the moment -- INTERFAX.)
