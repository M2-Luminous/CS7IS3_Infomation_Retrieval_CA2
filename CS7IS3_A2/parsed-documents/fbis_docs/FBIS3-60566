It was so hopeless, it didn't lead anywhere. At an earlier stage, even before the summer, the UN should have learned from what had happened and tried to change the course of events, either by reaching a political settlement with the clan leader, Aidid, or by increasing military presence in order to clean up Mogadishu.'' This was the opinion expressed by the physician, Johan Dalen, 44, who recently returned to Sweden after having worked for a few weeks at the Swedish field hospital in Somalia. ``My strongest impression from Somalia, and the one it is the hardest to forget, is of the injured children; children who had been shot in the head, or who had had both legs amputated. As a surgeon, one wants to perform surgery, and that one really gets to do in Somalia,'' said Dalen quietly. Curfew Johan Dalen has previously worked in Cyprus, Lebanon, and Cambodia, through the UN and the Red Cross. ``In Somalia I have seen how much can be done with limited resources,'' he said. There is still unrest in the capital, Mogadishu, but in rural areas, the famine is, in essence, eliminated. Food supply and the purely military aspects of the operation do work. But in Mogadishu, where gangs of thugs roam the streets at night, the curfew is still in effect after 1800. The hospital, which employs 150 Swedes, is located in the same area as the old university and the U.S. Embassy. The Swedes are taking care of 20,000 UN soldiers. In the immediate vicinity of the hospital, 5,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed, and consequently the area is often subject to grenade attacks. ``No, I was not afraid. When one lives in the middle of a conflict, it becomes part of everyday life, and as we were not the primary target for the grenades, it was not that dangerous,'' said Dalen. Strict Orders The people working at the field hospital have received strict orders not to leave the area without taking precautions. The hospital staff members wear helmets, submachine guns, and bulletproof vests, and travel to and from the airport in armed convoys. The vehicles are equipped with Swedish and Red Cross flags to indicate that they are not Americans. And to protect themselves against shrapnel, most people stay inside as much as possible. Even women receive training at UN courses in the use of weapons.
