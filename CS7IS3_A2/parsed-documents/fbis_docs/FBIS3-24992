Mr. Helder Proenca, member of the political bureau of the African Party For the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the ruling party, reported this on 4 February in Lisbon. Helder Proenca, who tackled issues relating to the ongoing electoral process in his country with Portuguese authorities, said that the possible delay in their preparation cannot justify the postponement of the election for the end of the year. The Portuguese newspaper PUBLICO wrote on 4 February that the president of the Republic, Joao Bernardo Vieira, candidate in the presidential election, wishes to maintain the date of 27 March despite the "technical imposssibility" of the organization of the election already recognized by the National Electoral Commission and in which all legalized political parties are represented. Six candidates have already been registered but they have not officially presented their candidacy because the date of the census of voters has not yet been set, the daily said, recalling that only registered voters on electoral lists are eligible.
