Concrete proposals for a trial arrangement are expected to be ready by October, the justice minister announced Tuesday [22 February] in the Folketing during the first hearing of a number of proposals from the Progress Party [FRP], which wants to make radical changes in the war on drugs. The FRP wants treatment sentences to begin as early as 1 April, but the system cannot be changed that quickly, according to the justice minister, who was however quite receptive to many of the FRP proposals which, in general, were well received by the Folketing parties. Italy: No Methadone, Just Spaghetti ``You do not have to go and hoard your food. It is neither heroin nor methadone, just spaghetti,'' the Italian treatment worker told a new group of drug addicts who attacked their lunch after a sweaty morning of working the minisettlement of San Carlo in the Alben Mountains near Rome. This minisettlement is part of the Italian Solidarity Center's drug treatment program called the ``Human Project'' which, since the 1970's, has tried to steer drug addicts onto the right course. The leader of the center, Catholic priest Don Picchi, maintains that 85 out of 100 drug addicts complete the three-year treatment program. Recently, the Progress Party proposed that Denmark copy the Italian model, and Social Welfare Minister Yvonne Herlov Andersen (Democratic Center) told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE today that she wanted to find 20 million kroner for two pilot projects. They would be set up according to the Italian recipe, in which the most important ingredients are: no methadone, no intoxicants--but hard physical labor and supervision around the clock, particularly in the beginning. The ``Human Project'' is divided into three main phases: An orientation phase lasting seven to nine months, during which the addicts are to be given motivation and discipline. The drug users live at home during this period, but it is the responsibility of their families to make sure he/she goes to meetings at the center. The relatives also go to therapy. The second phase is in the minisettlement of San Carlo: 120 addicts and 12 care providers--psychologists and former addicts--live together for eight months. Each day consists of hard physical labor in the morning and therapy, courses, sports, etc. in the afternoon. The third phase is the release phase. The former addicts live in a house outside Rome. Contact with their families is reestablished. They look for jobs and the ``patients'' are prepared for a normal life without drugs. After a few months they move into the ``city of temptation,'' Rome, where they live in the same house. Finally, they return home, but continue group therapy and personal talks for seven months. One Dane who has been close to the treatment system is freelance journalist Ulla Kampmann. She lives in a small town outside Rome. For many months, Ulla and her husband served as a ``family'' for a drug addict while he went through the ``Human Project.'' She has arranged a conference on drug abuse and an exhibition Friday [25 February] in ``The House'' in Copenhagen. Italian and Danish care providers will exchange experiences at the conference.
