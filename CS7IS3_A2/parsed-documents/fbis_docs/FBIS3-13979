Singh Gill, director general of Punjab police, by R. Balaji; place and date not given--quotation marks as published--first three paragraphs DECCAN CHRONICLE introduction] [Text] Hyderabad, Jan 13--He does not betray the image of being the `super cop' of the country. Obviously delighted with the resounding success he and his men had against the terrorists in Punjab, Mr. K.P. Singh Gill, the Director-General of the Punjab police, feels that, if Punjab can be freed from the stranglehold of terrorists, there is no reason why the volatile Jammu and Kashmir cannot [be] freed from the trigger-happy ultras. And given Mr. Gill's determination and the way in which he paid the Punjab terrorists in their own coin, Kashmir can certainly become once again a peaceful and prosperous State that it was a decade back. Will he go to Kashmir to counter the terrorists? "Yes, if the government wants me," says Mr. Gill like a true soldier. Mr. Gill, who is now on a visit to the city, spoke to DECCAN CHRONICLE at length on the way he dealt with the militants in his State. Excerpts from the interview. What priorities did you have in mind when you worked out a strategy for Punjab? The top priority was to beat the terrorists at their own game. Develop the expertise to meet them face to face, match their firepower, strategy and ultimately it was a man to man fight. When we changed our strategy and also improved our weaponry and intelligence network, we were always ahead of them and able to put them down. Did your strategy go as per the plan? We kept two things in mind. First we knew we had to react to their moves and counter it. Then we wanted to try and find out about their recruits and prevent the same. We also countered their propaganda and tried to cut their roots, destroy their bases and indulge in day and night combing operations. Was there any change in the strategy adopted by your predecessor, Mr. J.F.Riberio, and you? My strategy was part of an extension of the strategy adopted by Mr. Riberio. We extended upon the 25 percent success achieved by him. What is the estimated member of terrorists remaining in the State? There are no active terrorists now. Once in a while they come from other places and indulge in some acts and escape. But now we are very alert and preventing them from coming in. Do you think the police alone was responsible for the success or is it because of better coordination with other agencies? Oh yes! We had very good cooperation from the Army, BSF [Border Security Force], CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] and others which contributed to the success. What is the role of Pakistan in promoting subversive activities in Punjab? Pakistan is very much involved in encouraging terrorist activities in the State. The recent arrest of Dr Sohan Singh revealed that at least eight important leaders of different groups are operating from Pakistan. Is there a difference of opinion between you and the Chief Minister, Mr. Beant Singh? No there is no differences between me and the Chief Minister. Since the focus on terrorist violence has shifted from Punjab to Kashmir and in view of your own success in Punjab, would you prefer to take an assignment in Kashmir? Yes ... for some time there was such a talk. If the government wants my services for Kashmir, I am ready for it. And I will go there if they want me. Are you confident of achieving success in Kashmir too? Well, one does not go to a place to fail in the mission. One goes to the place wanting to achieve success. What strategy do you envisage for tackling the militants in Kashmir? Sitting at a distant place (Punjab) one cannot work out any strategy. You have to be there to take a decision. After your term, would you be interested in joining politics? I have no intention of joining politics. *
