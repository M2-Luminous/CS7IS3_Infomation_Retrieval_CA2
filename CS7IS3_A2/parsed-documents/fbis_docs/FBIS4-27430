The issue has obvious security implications for Japan, and so debates have been held in the Diet. But the debates have tended to boil down to an exchange of words on the relationship between universal and collective security. They have failed to focus on how Japan should ensure its security under the current international situation. There has been Diet dispute over interpretation of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It has been labelled as theological dispute, and the point of issue was the relationship between Japan's constitution and the defensive action this permitted the country to take. The dispute had the effect of putting the brakes on Japan's buildup of military strength. But the political parties used the security issue ideologically because, in the Cold War era, their relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union was the main factor in determining their status at home. Even now, the Cold War's influence still lingers in Japan and parliamentary debates on Japanese security are still immature. Debate has been held in the Diet on whether the collective security laid down in the UN Charter and the universal security that is the "global framework for the maintenance of peace and safety through the United Nations" are different. How meaningful is this to Japan's security? If the government and the Diet take a common-sense view of Japan's security, they must first discuss the North Korean situation. They can discuss North Korea's domestic situation, how bilateral U.S.-North Korea talks are expected to go, and what Japan can do to help find a diplomatic solution to the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. There are a lot of topics to be discussed. The main point of concern here is that while government ministries and agencies are informally examining ways to deal with the situation should economic sanctions unfortunately be imposed against North Korea and Japan be obliged to follow, the Diet has not yet debate the matter. Perhaps the government thinks it would lessen potential political friction to submit to the Diet a package of amendment bills and get them passed at a stroke shortly after the economic sanctions introduced. If the government does think that way, it is ignoring the Diet. The Diet is the supreme body of state power that is mandated to make a final decision on how the government deals with emergencies when they occur. Bureaucrats should not be allowed to deal with the emergency on the basis of their own judgment. The Diet has delayed holding the debates out of fear they may incite North Korea or because it was judged incompatible with Japan's national interests to publicize the country's measures for dealing with the emergency by debating them in parliament. The Diet has also not held the debates because the government has not supplied it with the information needed by the Diet to provide informed debate. It is true that government ministries and agencies are informally "studying" ways to amend relevant laws so that Japan can put economic sanctions into effect. The Diet, nonetheless, should hold the debates despite the aforementioned restraints. Lack of debate is causing a chaos. And one cause of the chaos is the confusion over the legislation for an emergency that was studied by the Fukuda cabinet in 1977. This legislation was in anticipation of a situation in which Japan goes to war, and is different from the legal measures that may be needed to deal with the North Korean situation. The confusion has arisen because debate on Japan's security in the Diet has boiled down to a play of words. In particular, the government must explain the present situation in a way the people can easily understand. It is impossible for the government to promote any policy unless it is understood by the people.
