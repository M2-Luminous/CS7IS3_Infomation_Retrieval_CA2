It was allegedly submitted to the State Duma marked "Confidential". The 12-page document contains recommendations to the Russian leadership regarding the tactics and strategy in the resolution of the Chechen problem. The Chechen presidential office told Interfax that Shakhray recommended that in the settlement of the Russian-Chechen relations, the main stakes should be made on political forces opposing Dudayev. "This is another sign that Russian diplomacy is not in control of the situation," a high-ranking official of the Chechen presidential staff pointed out. In his opinion, the Russian leadership is currently trying to reanimate supporters of the former first secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Regional Committee Doka Zavgayev who was dismissed from this post in 1991 and is now living in Moscow. At a conference in Groznyy the Security Department submitted a document to the Chechen president, saying that Shakhray maintains close relations with the Chechen opposition.
