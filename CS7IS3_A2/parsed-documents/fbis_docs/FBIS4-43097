Golhan said Russia, which is experiencing the travails of transition to democracy and a free market economy, is unable to tolerate those states that gained their independence after remaining under Russian control for 70 years. In a statement to YENI GUNAYDIN, National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan indicated that it would be very difficult to say that the Russian Federation has endorsed the newly independent states. Recalling that this was the impression he got during his visit to Russia and during the NATO conference on 24 and 25 May in Brussels, Golhan said: "It Has Assumed an Air of Big Brother" "Russia has assumed the air of `I am your big brother, I am the leader of the CIS, you line up behind me, let me provide military and other assistance to you and establish bases vis-a-vis the small states. As such, Dogan Gures' statement is correct if we assess the situation from Turkey's angle. "Russian Defense Minister Grachev said something like this during the NATO meeting: `We need to send more troops to Transcaucasia.' I replied: `You might like to send troops, but will the independent states there not get worried by that?' He replied: `There are bilateral agreements. I am sending the troops at their request. Besides, the West has turned its attention on Bosnia-Herzegovina and is sending troops there. It is sending no troops elsewhere.' Yes, this is correct. He also added: `I am sending troops to Georgia and Azerbaijan. If the West wants, it could also send troops. It could even send commanders and I will place my troops under their command.' Although there is some truth in this, what could be said with certainty is that even if the Russian Federation desists from exerting pressure on these countries by taking advantage of internal conflicts and friction, it is trying to subjugate them under the guise of troop deployment. Therefore, the existence of [Russian] troops there is not suitable to Turkey. These are independent states and they themselves must solve their own military and democratic problems. "The West Is Spoiling Them Too Much" National Defense Minister Golhan also indicated that there is the worry that faced with economic difficulties, such as 1,000 percent inflation, Russia might redirect its attention abroad and that the former Communist Party will gain further strength if things do not develop as the people wish. Stressing that such a development will create major difficulties for Russia in its present democratic appearance and in its attainment of desired objectives, Golhan said: "The West is quite indulgent toward them. We often tell the West: `You spoiled them too much.' This is a fact." Remembering that we share a 500-year history with Russia and that the ties have always been friendly, Golhan said that at present there is no problem but that it is not possible to predict future intentions. UN Umbrella for the Troops Asked "what will happen if Russia becomes more active in Azerbaijan," Golhan replied: "We discussed these matters with the Russian defense minister. We told him that if there is a need to send troops then this should be done under the UN umbrella. At least they requested CSCE and UN observers. If troops are to be dispatched, then this should be done not on the basis of bilateral agreements but under the UN umbrella."
