Alleged Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) members scattered fliers in the city's outskirts calling on the people to reject the reforms. Several streets were littered during the predawn hours with other fliers in favor of the reforms. Campaigning in favor or against the 43 constitutional reforms was prohibited by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) since noon 28 January. TSE Magistrate Mario Guerra Roldan has said to carry out any campaigning either for the "yes" or "no" vote, which includes moving ahead the date of the legislative elections, is against the electoral process. Meanwhile, abstention marks the first hour of voting, and according to radio reports, the number of people who have gone to polling stations installed in various schools in Guatemala City averaged between three to seven.
