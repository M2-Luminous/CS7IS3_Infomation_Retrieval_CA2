Take notice that on November 7, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, Fourth Revised Sheet Nos. 318 and 319, to be effective December 1, 1994. Natural states that the tariff sheets were submitted in compliance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) order issued October 7, 1994 at Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;179&hyph;000, et al. (Order). Section 21 of the General Terms and Conditions of Natural's tariff has been modified to reflect the Commission's determination in the Order regarding the billing determinants to be used in developing surcharges for the recovery of Account No. 858 costs and the sequence in which various components of Natural's rates are to be deemed discounted. Natural requested waiver of its Tariff or of the Commission's Regulations to the extent necessary to permit the tariff sheets to become effective December 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of the filing are being mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers, interested state regulatory agencies and all parties set out on the official service list at Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;179&hyph;000, et al. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests must be filed on or before November 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
