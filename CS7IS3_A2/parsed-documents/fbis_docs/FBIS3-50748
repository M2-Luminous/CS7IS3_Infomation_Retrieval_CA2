In that decision, the Federal Supreme Court established several restrictions on collections for entities considered immune by the Constitution and for states and municipalities. The court decree has not been published yet. The banks allege that the Constitution restricts immunity on operations related to the essential activities of those entities, and that without the publication of the court decision, the banks will not be able to define what operation by the same entity is immune. Helio Ramos Dominguez, legal adviser for Febraban, said: "It is not up to the banks to define whether an operation is related or not to an entity's essential activity." On 27 December 1993, the banks sent requests for clarification to the Federal Revenue Office and the Central Bank. Febraban believes it will be very difficult for the Federal Supreme Court to publish its decision before January -- the court is in recess and will return to work in February -- therefore, it hopes to begin collecting based on the clarifications from the two organizations.
