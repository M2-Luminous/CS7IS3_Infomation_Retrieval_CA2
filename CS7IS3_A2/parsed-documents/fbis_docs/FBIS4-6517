FBIS4-6517 "dreas077_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 South Korea No Timetable for DPRK Loggers' Repatriation No Timetable for DPRK Loggers' Repatriation SK2004094594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0800 GMT 20 Apr 94 SK2004094594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Full-fledged negotiations are under way with Moscow on bringing to South Korea those North Koreans who are roaming about Russia after having escaped from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, but the talks may have hit rough going. Repatriation is likely to occur much later than Seoul first expected, as the task is more difficult than generally anticipated here. Chongwadae [presidential office] officials say it will be difficult to bring the North Korean escapees into the country before June because the government has yet to obtain correct information on their whereabouts and personal histories. This is a far cry from Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks that some of the loggers could arrive this month as the government would complete repatriation formalities as soon as possible. Han made the comments upon his arrival from Russia on Monday. But presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Wednesday, "the government does not yet know where these North Koreans are now and what they are like. So it is unlikely that they will get to Seoul before June, though the government is seeking to bring them back as soon as possible." Noting that while negotiations are under way with Russia about when repatriation should occur, he said no timetable has been agreed. This indicates that repatriation could take place later than generally expected, depending on how the talks with Moscow progress. He made it clear, however, that the United Nations would not intercede in resettling the North Korea defector-loggers, saying the issue would be settled only through negotiations with Moscow. The Foreign Ministry attributed Chu's remarks about a delay in repatriating the loggers to the difficulties facing the Korean Embassy in Moscow as it tackles the issue. A ministry official said the embassy is having trouble determining the loggers' exact whereabouts and personal histories. There have been few reliable reports on them from the Embassy in Moscow, he added. Some 90 North Korean loggers have visited the Embassy in Moscow and other South Korean diplomatic missions in former Soviet Republics to ask for refuge in South Korea, but it is difficult to maintain contact with them as they move from one hideout to another for fear of capture by North Korean agents. For those granted permanent residence in Russia, it takes time to confirm whether they want to be repatriated to South Korea. In particular, those with Russian wives generally do not wish to come to South Korea. This being the case, working-level officials from the Foreign Ministry were somewhat surprised when Minister Han, upon arriving from Russia on Monday, told reporters the North Korean loggers would come as early as this month. The government first sought to repatriate the North Korean loggers with the help of Russia and the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, but this policy has changed after Minister Han's Moscow visit. The change was prompted by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's positive stance on the repatriation issue during his meeting with Han, ministry officials observed. The Foreign Ministry has instructed the Embassy in Moscow to repatriate the loggers as soon as possible, raising speculation that the government is dealing with the issue in light of political considerations on domestic issues. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the Russian Government had requested, through Seoul's Embassy in Moscow, that the South Korean media practice self-restraint in reporting on the repatriation issue. The government is not negotiating with Beijing on repatriating North Korean defectors in China but is focusing on the issue of North Koreans in Russia, he added.
