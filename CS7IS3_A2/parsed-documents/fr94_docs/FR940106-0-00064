FR940106-0-00064 FR940106-0-00018 English sole. The coastwide ABC of 1,900 mt in 1993 is changed to two area ABCs in 1994: 2,000 mt for the Vancouver-Columbia area and 1,100 mt for the Eureka-Monterey-Conception area. A new stock assessment was conducted only for the Vancouver-Columbia area. It indicated high recruitment during 1977&hyph;1992. The large biomass, combined with the early age at maturity which allows a high exploitation rate, suggest that a ten-fold increase in short-term yield may be possible in the Vancouver-Columbia area. However, catches have averaged only about 2,100 mt between 1983&hyph;1991. The 1994 ABC is set conservatively, at 2,000 mt in this area, approximately double the coastwide average catch during 1983&hyph;1991. The southern area ABC is set near the recent average catch because trawl surveys indicate little trend in abundance. There is no harvest guideline for English sole. Petrale sole. A new stock assessment for the Vancouver and Columbia subareas was conducted which resulted in the ABC for the two subareas being combined and lowered from 1,700 mt in 1993 to 1,200 mt in 1994. The assessment indicates that the stock in this area is essentially at the expected long-term average level of abundance, and recent yields are slightly below the potential. In addition, the ABC is lowered to exclude the portion that applied to Canadian waters that mistakenly was included in the previous ABC. There is no harvest guideline for petrale sole. Setting Harvest Guidelines Greater Than ABC In most cases, harvest guidelines equal the ABCs, or prorated ABCs, for specific areas. However, for 1994 as in 1993, the Council recommended harvest guidelines that exceed the ABCs for three species, POP, Dover sole in the Columbia subarea, and shortspine thornyheads. The FMP requires that the Council consider certain factors when setting a harvest guideline above an ABC. These factors were analyzed by the Council's Groundfish Management Team (GMT) and considered at the Council's November 1993 meeting before recommending the 1994 harvest guidelines. These factors also were considered in establishing the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP in the 1981 FMP, and in the most recent stock assessments for POP and Dover sole in the Council's August 1992 SAFE document, which provided the basis for the 1993 and 1994 ABCs. A synopsis of these issues appears in the above discussion of these species. Overfishing. The FMP defines ``overfishing'' as a fishing mortality rate that would, in the long-term, reduce the spawning biomass per recruit below 20 percent of what it would have been if the stock had never been exploited (unless the species is above the level that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY)). The rate is defined in terms of the percentage of the stock removed per year. Therefore, a large amount of catch can cause overfishing at any stock abundance level. Conversely, overfishing does not necessarily occur for stocks at low abundance levels if the catch can be kept to a sufficiently small fraction of that stock level. The target rate of exploitation for west coast groundfish typically is the rate that would reduce spawning biomass per recruit to 35 percent of its unfished level. This desired rate of fishing will always be less than the overfishing rate, so there is a buffer between the management target and the level that could harm the stock's long-term potential productivity. If the overfishing level is reached, the Guidelines for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602 require the Council to identify actions to be undertaken to alleviate overfishing. POP is the only species believed to be near its overfishing level in 1993, and no others are expected to be overfished in 1994. POP was depleted off Washington and Oregon mainly by foreign fishing during the 1960's and early 1970's. In 1981, a rebuilding program was established for POP in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas. (POP are neither common nor important in the more southern areas). A review in 1992 of fishery and survey data does not indicate any significant rebuilding. The stock is estimated to be about 50 percent of its MSY level and recent harvests are near the level of overfishing (1,100 mt). The review also indicates that strong year classes, which are necessary to rebuild the stock, occur infrequently so the lack of rebuilding is not expected. The Council's GMT recognized that, as long as trawling occurs in these areas, incidental catches of POP will result. The GMT recommended that trip limits continue to be set to discourage targeting on POP while allowing landings of incidental catches.
