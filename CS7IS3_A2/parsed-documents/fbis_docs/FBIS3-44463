With the dawning of the new year, the unitary and managed floating exchange rate system of the renminbi on the basis of market supply and demand was formally introduced, thus marking a great stride forward in the foreign exchange management system. Simultaneously, or immediately afterward, the work to establish a modern enterprise system, as well as reform in the market system, taxation, finance, foreign trade, housing, and other important spheres was or will be carried out. With the rapid advance and a deeper degree of reform, the Chinese economy is bound to face a new and rigorous test. How can we achieve high-speed growth without causing inflation? It has been learned that President Jiang Zemin consulted several noted economists on this problem. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic affairs, also is seeking the best way to solve this problem. As a matter of fact, an outlook of China's economic situation in 1994 shows that it is very necessary to study and discuss this problem in a profound manner. According to economists' predictions, the national economy will maintain high-speed growth in 1994 because of the strong support of the following four factors: 1) The large domestic demand of this country of 1.2 billion can continue to give the necessary impetus to economic growth. 2) Owing to unbalanced industrial development and relatively backward basic industries and infrastructure, it is necessary to strengthen construction, which can give a strong impetus to current economic development, as well as create conditions for future economic development. 3) The driving force of reform remains strong in the process of transforming the old system into a new one, and the production potentials that were restrained under the old system still have to be released continuously. 4) In order to carry out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world, the Chinese economy will draw closer to the international economy. China can constantly introduce and assimilate advanced technology and management experience from other countries, absorb international resources to make up domestic deficiency, and strengthen the domestic economy's capability to develop. Four Negative Effects of Macroscopic Regulation Viewed from the situation in 1993, high-speed economic growth will bring about a painful lesson if it is not grasped scientifically and effectively. Last year, at a time when high- speed economic growth was being achieved, prices also soared and there was a very severe phenomenon of economic disorder. With the second half of last year, the central authorities could not help but introduce emergency macroscopic regulation measures. This series of measures already has achieved some results, the situation of economic disorder has changed, and the overall situation is developing in a positive way, but the Chinese economy still faces three kinds of problems following the introduction of macroscopic regulation: 1) The level of commodity price rises in the market is still too high. Commodity price is a "backward" index that fully reflects the situation of high economic growth, the policy of large currency supply, and vigorous price reform in the previous stage. 2) Four negative effects are exposed by macroscopic regulation: Insufficient funds, a discrepancy between production and marketing and more payments in arrears, the frequent occurrence of the phenomena of production stoppage and semistoppage, and lower industrial benefits. 3) The phenomenon of unbalanced economic development still exists and there is no marked progress in structural readjustment. According to figures released by the State Statistics Bureau, the economic growth rate in China last year was 13 percent and the inflation rate also was 13 percent. These two figures were precisely the real situation of China's economic development in 1993. Viewed from the prospects of the economy and commodity prices in China in 1994, experts predict that the economy will continue to maintain a growth rate of 10 percent or so, and that only after a series of effective measures are taken by the government can the inflation rate be controlled at 10 percent or so. Hence, we can see also that the situation in 1994 will hardly be less grim than that in 1993. Reform Measures Are Related to Commodity Prices Some economists pointed out: The negative effects were exposed by macroscopic regulation after last August, and the central authorities put a large amount of currency into circulation. From the angle of economics, commodity prices will rise about a year after currency circulation, so after the coming August, inflation may arise again in society and the government will bear great commodity price pressures. On the other hand, viewed from China's current social situation, only at a level of slight price rises can rapid growth of the national economy be achieved. This is because: 1) As returns on investment in industrial enterprises are low in times of high inflation rates, a large amount of funds will be shifted to stock speculation, real estate, and other non-productive areas, which makes it very easy for a bubble-economy craze to arise, thus aggravating the investment and industrial structures, and damaging the national economy's foundation for rapid growth. 2) High inflation will strain every aspect of the national economy so that it is difficult to implement various measures conducive to reform, thus generating greater difficulties and risks. 3) High inflation also will offer a chance for illegal elements to disrupt the market, thus making it more difficult to complete the marketization process. 4. High inflation also will affect residents' psychological endurance, thus giving rise to social instability factors. As a matter of fact, a series of new reform measures introduced for the sake of accelerating the implementation of the market economy are related, more or less, to the commodity price factor. President Jiang Zemin said at the new year tea party organized by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee: "We must meticulously organize the introduction and implementation of a series of important reform measures for the establishment of socialist market economic system.... We must pay the utmost attention to our progress, promptly sum up our experience, and strive to succeed in implementing these measures." Hence, we can notice the determination and vigilance of the central government in implementing reform measures in 1994. The year 1994 is key to China's reform, and the relationship between high-speed development and a check on inflation undoubtedly will be a top consideration.
