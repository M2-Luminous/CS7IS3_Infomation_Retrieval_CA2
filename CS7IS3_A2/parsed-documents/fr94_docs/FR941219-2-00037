FR941219-2-00037 FR941219-2-00028 Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy, Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Name of Firm: Murphy Oil Corp. / Murphy Oil USA, Inc. Date of Filing: October 25, 1994 Case Number: VEF&hyph;0003 December 12, 1994. On October 25, 1994 the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute $10,700,000 remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration & Production Co. (collectively referred to as ``Murphy''), pursuant to the Consent Order entered into between Murphy and the DOE on July 15, 1994. In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations which were resolved by the present Consent Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. I. Background Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federal price controls. As such, it was subject to the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During that time, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Murphy and issued an issue letter to Murphy on September 29, 1976. ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Murphy on January 28, 1981. ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986, which Murphy contested before the OHA. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and the DOE entered into a Consent Order which resolved disputes regarding Murphy's refined petroleum product operations during the period the petroleum price and allocation regulations were in effect. See Murphy Oil Corp., 17 DOE ¶85,782 (1987) (the first Consent Order). The first Consent Order left the issue of Murphy's alleged violations as a producer of crude oil unresolved. Those issues were decided by the OHA on June 17, 1992 when the OHA issued a modified version of ERA's PRO as a Remedial Order (RO). See Murphy Oil Corp., 22 DOE ¶83,005 (1992). Murphy subsequently appealed the OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). On January 24, 1994 a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Proposed Order (D&PO) which modified the RO. See Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co., et al., 66 FERC ¶63,002 (1994). On July 15, 1994, Murphy and the DOE entered into the present Consent Order, the second between Murphy and the DOE. This second Consent Order, which does not modify or affect the terms of the first Consent Order, resolves all existing or potential civil and administrative claims against Murphy for alleged violations of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations left unresolved by the first Consent Order. Under the terms of this second Consent Order, Murphy has remitted $10,700,000 to the DOE, and all outstanding or potential claims by the DOE against Murphy have been extinguished. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. II. Jurisdiction and Authority The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see The Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07; Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the second Murphy Consent Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. III. Proposed Refund Procedures A. Crude Oil Refund Policy We propose to distribute the Murphy funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement. In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement). The MSRP establishes that 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be remitted to the federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may be initially reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts. The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. See Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it received pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This Notice was published at 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981 crude oil price control period, and (2) prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and need not submit any additional proof of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes. See City of Columbus, Georgia, 16 DOE ¶85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that crude oil refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per gallon (or ``volumetric'') refund amount, which is obtained by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases. See, e.g., Texaco, Inc, 19 DOE ¶85,200 (1989); Shell Oil Co., 17 DOE ¶85,204 (1988) ( Shell ); Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 14 DOE ¶85,475 (1986) ( Mountain Fuel ). B. Refund Claims We propose to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies remitted by Murphy. We have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. This reserve figure may later be reduced if circumstances warrant. The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims in a manner similar to that used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges. See Mountain Fuel, 14 DOE at 88,869. Under these procedures, claimants will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.
