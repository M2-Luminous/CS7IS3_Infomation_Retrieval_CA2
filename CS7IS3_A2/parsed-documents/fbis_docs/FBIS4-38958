"Under the Constitution the Ukrainian Supreme Council can only suspend decisions of the Crimean Supreme Council, not rescind them," he stated in the Ukrainian parliament Wednesday. As the president noted, "Crimea must be placed within the framework of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine." In his opinion, "a party has come to power in Crimea which has proclaimed the strategic course of seceding from Ukraine and restoring Crimea to Russia." Kiev took a sharply negative view of a recent decision by the Crimean Supreme Council on restoring the 6 May 1992 version of the Constitution of the autonomous republic. This makes provision, in particular, for the legal-treaty status of relations between Kiev and Simferopol and the possibility for Crimeans to obtain dual citizenship. L. Kravchuk proposed that the Supreme Council make amendments to the law on delimitation of powers between Kiev and Simferopol, "making provision for an expansion of the powers of the Crimean organs of power." At the same time the president deems it necessary to amend the laws on the security service and the militia. The power structures throughout Ukraine should be under central jurisdiction alone, he noted. In L. Kravchuk's opinion a subcommission should be set up in the Ukrainian parliament "to deal only with Crimean problems." At the same time he expressed agreement with the proposal to introduce in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers the post of vice premier for territorial questions. L. Kravchuk also pointed to the need speedily to resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, including "the question of dispersing the Ukrainian and Russian fleets to their bases and clearly defining the status of the Black Sea Fleet on Ukraine's territory." "This will have a considerable positive effect on the situation in Crimea," he said.
