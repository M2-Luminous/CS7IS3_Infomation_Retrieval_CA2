FR941222-0-00097 FR941222-0-00014 Section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), makes it the responsibility of the Postal Service ``to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users.'' One of the most important manifestations of this responsibility in the international area are services that enhance the ability of U.S. companies to do business in other countries. That can be accomplished both by simplifying the process those companies use to prepare their packages for mailing and by reducing the costs those companies incur to mail merchandise to other countries. However, the Postal Service's existing international services for merchandise packages require those companies to pay the same postage rates as all other customers pay even though very different Postal Service operations may be involved. II. International Package Consignment Service A. Rationale In order more closely to meet the needs of mail order companies and other customers that send merchandise packages from the United States to multiple international addressees, the Postal Service is implementing a new international service, International Package Consignment Service (IPCS). Initially, the service will be available only to Japan. The Postal Service anticipates offering IPCS to Canada in the near future. To the extent feasible, the Postal Service will expand the service to include other destination countries in response to requests from customers. In this regard, the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for IPCS to destination countries other than Japan and Canada. In addition to making it easier and less costly for U.S. mail order companies and other customers to export goods, the implementation of IPCS will benefit all users of the Postal Service's other services by decreasing the total revenues that the Postal Service needs to recover from them. Offering IPCS makes all Postal Service customers better off because the additional business generated not only covers the extra variable costs it causes, but also enables the Postal Service to recover its fixed costs from a larger base of customers. B. Qualifying Criteria A customer that wants to use IPCS will be required to enter into a service agreement with the Postal Service providing for the following. First, the customer must commit to mail at least 25,000 packages through the service during the next 12 months to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Second, the customer must designate the Postal Service as its carrier of choice to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Third, the customer must agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that (1) the Postal Service and the customer can exchange data transmissions concerning the customer's packages, and (2) by scanning the customer-provided barcode on each package, the Postal Service can extract, on an as-needed basis, certain information about the package. In general, the information that must be made available to the Postal Service includes: the order number; the package identification number; the buyer's name and address; the recipient's name and address; the total weight of the package; the total value of the package; the number of items in the package; and, for each item in the package, its SKU number, its value, and its country of origin. The exact information required will vary, depending on the destination country to which the packages are sent. In practice, this requirement means that the customer will have to begin the necessary systems work by the time it begins using IPCS, and then will have to assist the Postal Service in completing and maintaining the information systems linkages. The Postal Service will use the extracted information to prepare any necessary customs forms and package labels, to accept the customer's mail and verify postage payment automatically, and to provide user-friendly tracking and tracing. In addition to these required commitments, which must appear in all IPCS service agreements, arrangements between the Postal Service and the customer that are technical in nature also may appear in the IPCS service agreement. For instance, the service agreement may describe the EDI or proprietary file format that will be used to transmit data between the customer and the Postal Service, as well as the frequency and schedule of transmissions. Similarly, the service agreement may describe the formats and frequencies for any exception and performance reports that the Postal Service will provide to the customer. The IPCS service agreement will not define the basic terms and conditions of the service, or the rates that the customer will pay. As discussed below, IPCS is not a customized service. All customers that use IPCS will be offered the same rates and will receive the same delivery services. New regulations in International Mail Manual (IMM) 620 establish IPCS and make it generally available at published rates.
