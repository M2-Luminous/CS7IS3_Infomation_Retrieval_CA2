He added that it would be logical to expect--following the agreement on the federal and confederal links between the Muslims and Croats that enables the Croats in Bosnia to have state and institutional links with their mother country--something similar to be offered to the Serbs also so that they can link up with their natural homeland, Serbia. By taking such an approach, the international community, while in a way restoring Yugoslavia--that is, linking parts of that formerly complex country--wants to prevent the creation of an Islamic fundamentalist Bosnia and to secure natural links between identical peoples. Asked whether Montenegro's Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be disbanded, Lekic categorically said that the ministry was working as usual and that the termination of its work and existence was totally out of the question.
