A more detailed reaction can be expected from Washington after the official announcement of the makeup of a new Russian government, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering declared in an interview with Interfax on Monday. He explained that his administration's position towards Russia's reforms did not depend on concrete personalities but was based on the principles they advocated. Commenting on the First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar's decision to resign, Pickering said that it did not take Washington aback, since rumors on Gaydar's possible resignation from the government had circulated long before his public announcement about it. He voiced satisfaction with Gaydar's intention to carry on his duties in the Duma, where he led one of the major parliamentary factions, "Russia's Choice." Pickering said that in the current situation the American administration regarded President Yeltsin's attitude to further reform as crucial. He recalled that at the recent summit, U.S. President Clinton had been firmly assured by Yeltsin that reform in Russia would be continued and stability there would be preserved.
