These funds are not even enough to pay for the operation of television and radio transmitters. Here is what was said in this connection by Aleksandr Nekhoroshev, the director of Russian Television's "Vesti" program. [Begin Nekhoroshev recording] This means that the Ministry of Communications, which must receive 85 percent of this amount for the upkeep of transmitters, will be forced to switch off the transmitters because of non-payment. That is to say, from the minute that the government approves this harmful budget for television and radio, we could all expect at any minute the switching off of state television and radio and, in this way, perhaps the last instrument for unifying the inhabitants of our country, Russians scattered accross our great power, could be broken. The idea has already been voiced that this government will close state television and radio but that another structure of the government will open it. These are questions for the government and the people who are working in it. We are also worried because, taking into account the aggressiveness of all commercial structures, we are absolutely convinced that both in Moscow and in the regions, from the moment state television and radio are closed, great efforts will be made to seize them. In this way we are now all on the threshold of a danger which on the whole was deflected both in August 1991 and October. Attempts to stifle in particular the All-Russian TV and Radio Company failed then, and this was splendid. Now, however, by the hands of bureaucrats, quietly, by one stroke of the pen, something could be perpetrated which even in my worst dreams I am unable to imagine. On behalf of the journalists of the All-Russian TV and Radio Company I can now request Premier Minister Chernomyrdin for an immediate meeting in order to discuss the catastrophic situation in which state television and radio finds itself. It seems to me that for the time being there still is some sense in holding this meeting. It could very well be the case that after Friday there will no longer be any sense in holding such a meeting.
