FR941212-1-00056 FR941212-1-00014 8. The Commission proposed to amend its prohibition so that LECs would be permitted to purchase cable facilities in markets that meet these criteria. Alternatively, these criteria could serve as the basis for a presumption that a request for waiver of the prohibition would be granted. The Commission tentatively concluded that LECs proposing to purchase cable facilities in their service area must identify the facilities to be purchased in their Section 214 application and demonstrate that the area served by those facilities meets the Commission's established criteria. The Commission sought comment on these proposals and on any other proposals parties might offer that would accomplish the same ends. 9. The Commission also proposed to amend its rules to permit LECs and cable operators jointly to construct a video dialtone system in those areas in which the Commission permits LECs to acquire cable facilities for use in providing video dialtone. Permitting joint construction of video dialtone systems in such areas and shared costs of video dialtone might, in fact, encourage the deployment of advanced facilities in areas that otherwise might lack them. The Commission sought comment on its proposal to permit joint construction of video dialtone systems in areas in which the acquisition ban is lifted. C. Preferential Access Proposals 10. The Commission sought comment, first, on whether it legally can, and should, mandate preferential video dialtone treatment for commercial broadcasters or for certain classes of PEG or not-for-profit video programmers. The Commission has authorized preferential treatment of certain classes of consumers when such treatment is justified by a compelling showing of need and public policy concerns. The Commission invited parties to comment on whether there are public policy reasons to mandate preferential treatment for commercial broadcasters, or for certain types of PEG or not-for-profit programmers, such as, for example, noncommercial educational programmers. Parties addressing this issue were instructed to describe any such reasons with specificity, as well as the adequacy or inadequacy of alternative means of providing public support for such programmers, such as grants and direct subsidies. Parties were also instructed to address whether mandated preferences for certain types of programmers would be consistent with the First Amendment and the Supreme Court's decision in Turner v. FCC , as well as with Title II of the Act, including Sections 201(b) and 202(a). 11. The Commission also invited parties to suggest a definition of the programmers they believe any such mandate should cover. Specifically, to the extent that any policy of preferential treatment would be based upon a finding of need, the Commission sought comment on how such a policy could be fashioned to target not-for-profit video programmers most in need of preferential treatment. The Commission also sought comment on appropriate affiliation rules that might be part of any such need-based test to ensure that video programmers that have certain affiliations with nonqualifying entities do not receive preferential treatment. In addition, the Commission sought comment on whether preferential treatment should be available to any not-for-profit programmer meeting a means test or to only those programmers offering certain types of programming, such as educational programming. Parties should also address the First Amendment implications of any such classifications, as well as how such classifications would be administered. For example, parties should discuss whether a LEC role in determining eligibility of specific video programmers for preferential treatment would be consistent with the common carrier framework governing video dialtone, the cross-ownership provisions of the 1984 Cable Act, and relevant case law. 12. Finally, the Commission sought comment on the type and amount of preference that should be mandated, in the event that it decided to prescribe preferential treatment for certain programmers. Parties should address, in particular, whether preferential access is necessary, or whether discounted rates alone would meet public policy goals. Parties should also address how much of a preference should be granted. For example, parties advocating preferential rates should address how those rates should be calculated. The Commission noted that one possibility would be to base preferential rates on an incremental cost standard, whereby video programmers eligible for preferences would pay only for the incremental costs to the LEC of providing channel capacity to such programmers. The Commission sought comment on this proposal and on any other proposal for implementing a preferential treatment policy. 13. The Commission sought comment, second, on whether to permit LECs voluntarily to provide certain programmers with preferential treatment on LEC video dialtone platforms. The Commission sought comment on these ``will carry'' proposals. In addition, the Commission sought comment on whether it should permit LECs voluntarily to provide other forms of preferential treatment. For instance, should the Commission permit LECs to offer preferential access or rates only to not-for-profit video programmers? Should the Commission permit LECs to reserve capacity for local broadcast stations and PEG programmers at reduced rates? With respect to all proposals for voluntary LEC provision of preferential treatment, the Commission sought comment on whether a permissive policy toward preferential access to video dialtone would be consistent with the First Amendment and the Supreme Court's decision in Turner v. FCC . The Commission also sought comment on whether these proposals would or could be consistent with Sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Act, and, if so, under what circumstances. The Commission invited comment as well on whether such proposals are consistent with the common carrier framework governing video dialtone, the 1984 Cable Act, and relevant case law, including NCTA v. FCC . In addition, the Commission sought comment, as it did for mandatory preferential treatment, on all the issues entailed in identifying the categories of customers eligible for preferential treatment. Finally, the Commission sought comment on whether these proposals, assuming they are lawful, would further the public interest. D. Pole Attachments and Conduit Rights 14. The Commission also requested comment on whether it should adopt additional rules with respect to pole attachments and conduit rights. Section 63.57 of the Commission rules requires LECs seeking to provide channel service to show in their Section 214 applications that the cable system for which the LECs would be providing channel service had available, within the limitations of technical feasibility, pole attachment rights or conduit space ``at reasonable charges and without undue restrictions on the uses that may be made of the channel by the operator.'' The rule seeks to prevent LECs from denying cable systems reasonable access to their pole or conduit space for the purpose of preventing competition from these cable systems. The Commission sought comment on whether a similar rule should apply to LECs providing video dialtone service. Commenting parties were instructed to address whether LECs have the incentive and ability to leverage their control over pole attachments or conduit rights to prevent facilities-based competition by video programmers to the LECs' video dialtone platforms. Advocates of a rule in this area were instructed to propose specific language, and to explain how the rule would prevent anticompetitive behavior. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Statement
