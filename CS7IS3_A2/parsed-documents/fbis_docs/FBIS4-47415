A group of scientists from the Voronezh Oblast State Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate, the Kurchatov Institute, and the Scientific Research Institute for Preventive Toxicology and Disinfection propose funding the eight-million ruble program from Voronezh Oblast funds earmarked for ecology purposes. Tn 1992, 335 Voronezh residents were poisoned and 24 died (Moscow ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII Dec 93). The outbreak strained local toxicological centers and prompted oblast authorities to prohibit the sale and processing of mushrooms (Moscow MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA 12 Aug 92). Extensive studies by prominent institutes failed to identify the substance responsible for the poisonings, the journal said. Possible sources of contamination considered were radioactivity, heavy metals, agricultural chemicals, microorganism toxins, and toxins created during cooking. Researchers also thought that warm weather may have altered the appearance of poisonous mushrooms so that they resembled edible species. Studies were conducted at the Volgograd Scientific Research Institute of Toxicology, Occupational Pathology and Medical Prevention of Chemical Poisoning, the Komarov Institute of Botany in St. Petersburg, the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, the Voronezh Oblast Epidemiology Center, and the Institute of Toxicology in Yekaterinburg. Previous press accounts reported that animal tests detected ``strong toxins'' in the Voronezh mushrooms (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7 Aug 92, Moscow Russian Television Network 12 Sep 92). The medical newspaper MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA (Moscow 12 Aug 92), however, noted that tests had failed to find either toxic substances or heavy metal salts in the fungi. MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA also noted speculation that edible mushrooms had mutated to produce a new toxin. Tn 1993, the Russian State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision claimed that death cap mushrooms had been definitively identified as the cause of all fatal cases of mushroom poisoning in Voronezh and other oblasts (IZVESTIYA 14 Aug 93). Similar mass mushroom poisonings have occurred elsewhere. In 1991, Lugansk, Donets, and other regions of Ukraine experienced over 400 cases and 40 fatalities (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7 Aug 92). Krasnodar Kray registered over 330 cases of mushroom poisoning and 40 deaths during the same year (Moscow TRUD 4 Mar 93). The author of the ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII article, Voronezh epidemiologist T. Chubirko, thinks comprehensive studies should be done in these areas as well.
