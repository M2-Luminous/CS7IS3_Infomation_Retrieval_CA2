"A civilian minister is just not enough to be able to say that civilians are in charge of the Army," adds Jerzy Szmajdzinski, chairman of the Sejm Defense Commission. "The system of control over the Armed Forces is far from perfect and it continues to be at the stage of being established. This, among others, is what work on the new constitution is about. We want the system to be established in accordance with well known examples of armies of Western countries that have stood the test of time," Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said at the opening in Warsaw of an international conference devoted to "Civilian and Democratic Control Over Armed Forces." According to the MON chief, the basic roles in the system, are performed -- in the following order of importance -- by: The president, the prime minister, the government (and a civilian defense minister within the government), and the Sejm which adopts the budget and other laws. Michael Quinlan, former undersecretary of state in the British Defense Ministry, told the conference participants about how civilians control the British Army: "The law is the most important issue," the British guest said. "A soldier is not allowed to execute an illegal order because he would be brought to justice. This prevents abuses." Quinlan added that it is inconceivable in a democratic state that the Army should want to influence for instance the shape of the constitution. General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army General Staff, attended the conference: "We have already done some things, although it can be concluded from the foreign guests' papers presented here, that we are still at the beginning of the road. The important point is, we are heading in the right direction," Wilecki said. Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance, chairman of the Sejm Defense Commission, was more skeptical: "A civilian minister is just not enough to be able to speak about civilian control over the Army. First, we must change the awareness of the officer cadre. The military must be aware that the law is their supreme boss. And it is not the military, but civilians that should make basic decisions regarding the Armed Forces," Szmajdzinski said. Conference participants will deliberate through Wednesday, among others, whether it is better to employ civilian employees or professional military in MON, and also the issue of "when can we be sure that the Armed Forces are directed appropriately."
