Lapondic: "Danger of Dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina"] [Text] At a news conference last Friday, Ivan Kegljevic, president of the Croatian Christian Democratic Party, said that "the Granic-Silajdzic agreement that was signed in Washington should be supported only as explained by Dr. Mate Granic, Croatian foreign minister and vice president. He speaks of a federation whose creation would include the Serbs. By contrast, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in his address to the nation, excluded Serbian participation in the federation. That represents the danger of creation of a Serbian republic within Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is not at all acceptable." "Such an approach by the Croatian president," Kegljevic continued, "opens the possibility of the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina and thus threatens peace. As long as the agreement proposes borders with Serbia, which is obvious in Tudjman's statement, it does not propose a federation, because the borders themselves exclude the possibility a federation. The result of cramming the 60 percent of the population that is Croatian or Muslim into only 30 percent of the territory would be continued war." The Croatian Christian Democratic Party rejects the part of the agreement that deals with the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina because the party leader believes that it violates the Constitution of Croatia.
