In the case of the three named persons, the presidential initiative was overruled by the Alba Iulia City Court. The reason given was the unfavorable report of the Aiud penitentiary direction. The report cites an attempted breakout (Illyes), the slapping of the face of a cellmate (Balint), and the gravity of the crime for which he was convicted (Boldizsar). All three have appealed the Alba Iulia Court decision. "The UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] lawyers and parliamentarians will take all possible legal steps to have them released and to have the presidential decree applied in their case as well," says a UDMR communique.
