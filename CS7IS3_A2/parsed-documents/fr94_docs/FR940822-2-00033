FR940822-2-00033 FR940822-2-00022 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;702&hyph;000, et al.] Texas Gas Transmission Corp, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings August 11, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Texas Gas Transmission [Docket No. CP94&hyph;702&hyph;000] Take notice that on August 8, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), 3800 Frederica Street, Owensboro, Kentucky 42301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;702&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to add a new delivery point in Grant Parish, Louisiana, under Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;407&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Texas Gas currently transports gas for delivery to Farmland Industries, Inc. (Farmland) at a meter located on Texas Gas's Bastrop_Eunice pipeline system in Grant Parish, Louisiana (Wintershall_Farmland Meter). Such meter was installed and is being operated under the authority of Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (Section 311) and Section 284.3(c) of the Commission's Regulations. Texas Gas states that Farmland has recently indicated a need for greater flexibility in the services that can be provided at this delivery point on Texas Gas's system. In particular, Farmland would like to be able to receive at the Wintershall_Farmland Meter gas transported not only pursuant to Section 311, but also pursuant to Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88&hyph;686&hyph;000. By this filing, Texas Gas is requesting authorization to change the status of this delivery point in order to be able to transport and deliver gas on a jurisdictional basis. Texas Gas states that the quantity of gas to be delivered through this meter will vary; however, the design capacity of the Wintershall_Farmland Meter is approximately 78,200 Mcf per day under normal operating conditions.
