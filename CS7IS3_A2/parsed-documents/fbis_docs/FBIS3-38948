A statement issued by the French foreign ministry called on the three warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "to pull back to avoid an escalation" of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "France welcomes the firm and clear decision taken by the Atlantic alliance which was made necessary it following the drama in Sarajevo. "As it (France) proposed, the decision makes demands, fixes a deadline and sets out sanctions," the statement said. [passage omitted] "France, which is the main contributor of (UN) troops in former Yugoslavia and notably in Sarajevo, notes the gravity of decisions taken. It also wants the Bosnian government to trust that a peace settlement will be put into action." The ministry also welcomed the willingness shown by the United States to work with Europe in trying to resolve the conflict. The statement added: "This start by the international community has to be followed through. It must now prove that it has the same determination to put into effect the decisions it adopted today (Wednesday). "France and its European and American partners have to redouble their efforts in liaison with Russia in order to rapidly bring about a peace agreement based on the European Union's plan of action. "France calls on all parties to pull back within the time limit fixed by NATO to avoid any escalation and to act responsibly in the search for a negotiated peace settlement."
