To keep the process simple, an understanding of the complex, rigorous statistics that were used to develop the periodic freight brake test or single car test versus sample size charts given in Appendix B of the rule text is not necessary to use the charts. The rigorous statistical treatment behind the development of these charts is given in a paper titled ``Statistical Analyses of Inspection Interval and Quality Control Strategy'' published by the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The methodology is designed to ensure that over time the measured periodic freight brake or single car test failure rate approaches the target acceptable failure rate tied to the type of service being provided by the equipment with a 95 percent degree of confidence. In theory, the better the brake test, inspection, and maintenance program, the longer the time between required periodic brake tests can be extended. Three examples of how to apply this statistical analysis follow. Example 1 A private car owner operates a fleet of 2,400 double stack cars. Due to the high mileage these cars accumulate each year, they meet the definition of ``high utilization equipment.'' The private car owner has completed the phase-in period for his fleet required by §232.609. For a one-year period the private car owner keeps the records of his periodic freight brake test program required by §232.615 to use the statistical process to justify a change. During this one-year period a total of 2,400 periodic freight brake tests are conducted, and a total of 133 failures of the freight control valve to pass the periodic freight brake test are recorded. The failure rate is calculated as 133/2,400=.055. The failure rate of .055 versus the sample size of 2,400 is plotted on Table B&hyph;2 from Appendix B to Part 232. This table and the plotted data are given in Table 2.

This is approximately a 17% increase in the time between required tests. Example 2 A commuter railroad operates a fleet of 600 passenger cars in conventional service. This fleet of cars has completed the phase-in period required by §232.609. The commuter railroad keeps the single car test records required by §232.615 for a period of one year. Since initially conventional passenger equipment is required to receive a single car test once every six months, the commuter railroad conducts a total of 1,200 scheduled, single car tests during this period. During this period, the commuter railroad records a total of 48 failures of the brake control valve or the relay valve to pass the passenger single car test. The test failure rate is calculated as 48/1,200=.040. The failure rate versus sample size is plotted on Table B&hyph;3 of Appendix B to Part 232. This data is shown in Table 3.
