Thus, the alternatives are politically clear, CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze told journalists in Bonn after the meeting. The choice is between the continuation of the coalition of the center or a red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition. Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping can now save himself the trouble of continuing his "coalition hide-and-seek game." He can govern only together with the Greens. The CDU will clearly state the alternative positions in the election campaign. It will point to the focal issues of tax and financial policy, to reliability in foreign policy, as well as to the plans of Greens and parts of the SPD that are hostile toward technology. Asked whether the FDP decision also means a preliminary decision for the election of the German president, Hintze said that he is convinced that there are good prospects that CDU candidate Roman Herzog will be elected. Answering further questions, Hintze said that potential differences with FDP Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger about the question of the deportation of Kurds are considered to have been eliminated by the minister's latest statements.
