With several journalists present, Llort said that, due to Villeda's orders, he could not make any remarks but that he "trusted God and the judge" that everything would come out right for the sake of the Forensic Institute's prestige. The judge made this request "so as not to hamper the investigations" into the death of the officer, who was killed by the explosion of a hand grenade, the safety pin of which he pulled, saying it was a toy grenade. The incident took place at the police station in Zacamil. Forensic Institute adviser Martin Santos has said: "We abide by and obey our laws. We at the Forensic Institute will never be belittled by anyone. Our analyses are scientific and not biased in favor of anyone. For this reason, it will be the criminal judge who will decide who is telling the truth." Santos stressed the fact the order to keep silent originated with the judge, who surely knows why "the investigations should not be hampered." U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan has told the Salvadoran news media the institute's tests were false and that Jose Maria Monterrey, National Civilian Police director, would report on the case today or tomorrow. When the ambassador's position was announced, the press sought out Dr. Llort, but he replied he must refrain from reporting on the situation on the judge's instructions. It has been reported the judge will study the institute's tests and those carried out by the U.S. Government before making a statement. Llort finally said: The prestige and reliability of the institute's work has been released to the local news media. I trust God and the judge all will come out right. The reporters appeared to have been taken by surprise this morning by the turn of events regarding Rivera's death, because Ambassador Flanigan himself has announced Police Director Monterrey would make a statement with additional details.
