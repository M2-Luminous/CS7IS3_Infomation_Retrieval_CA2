FR940207-2-00116 FR940207-2-00064 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33555; International Series Release No. 634; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;28] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing of Options on American Depositary Receipts January 31, 1994. I. Introduction On October 12, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33103 (October 25, 1993), 58 FR 58357 (November 1, 1993). No comments were received on the proposed rule change. 3 3 The proposal was amended on December 23, 1993 to clarify the procedure the CBOE would use to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. Letter from Claire P. McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated December 23, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). In addition, although the proposal originally contained a request to list options on ADRs representing shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and YPF Sociedad Anonima, it is not necessary for the Commission to specifically approve the listing of these options. Under the current approval order, these options are eligible for listing, without further action by the Commission, if they meet Amex listing standards, as amended by this order. II. Description On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved an Amex proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the Exchange's established uniform options listing standards. 4 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the Amex must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing without an agreement. Second, the Amex's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing under the Amex rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float'' of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR Approval Order requires the Amex to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements. 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31529 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57248 (December 3, 1992) (``ADR Approval Order''). A comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement provides, among other things, for the exchange of market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchaser or seller of the securities traded. Furthermore, the Amex options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other applicable requirements of the Act.
