Community Planning and Development Programs; Consolidation; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 150␣/␣Friday, August 5, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Parts 91, 92, 570, 574, 576, and 968 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1731; FR&hyph;3611&hyph;P&hyph;01] RIN 2501&hyph;AB72 Consolidated Submission for Community Planning and Development Programs AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to amend the Department's existing regulations to completely replace the current regulations for Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategies (CHAS) with a rule that consolidates into a single consolidated submission the planning and application aspects of the Department's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) formula programs with the requirements for the CHAS. This new consolidated submission will replace the current CHAS, the HOME program description, the Community Development plan and the CDBG final statement, and the ESG and HOPWA applications. The rule also consolidates the reporting requirements for these programs, replacing the general performance reports with one performance report. Although this rule does not incorporate the public housing Comprehensive Grant (Comp Grant) process into the consolidated planning and application process, it proposes changes to regulations concerning Comp Grants to encourage this cooperation in the development of the Comp Grant plan and the consolidated plan. The changes are intended to ensure that the needs and resources of public housing authorities are included in a comprehensive planning effort to revitalize distressed neighborhoods and help low-income residents locally. In addition, the rule proposes amendments to the separate regulations for the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and HOPWA programs to remove some duplicative provisions, cross-reference the new provisions, and to conform terminology to that used in the revised part 91. DATES: Comment due date: October 4, 1994.
