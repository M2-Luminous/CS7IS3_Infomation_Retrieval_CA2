FBIS4-33692 "drlat112_b_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Dominican Republic Arrival of U.S. Officers Criticized Arrival of U.S. Officers Criticized PA0906174794 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1625 GMT 9 Jun 94 PA0906174794 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [By Alonso de Contreras] [Text] Santo Domingo, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The arrival of U.S. military officers to the Dominican Republic to provide assistance on the Haitian blockade and the alleged risk that the crisis could be extended to the entire island has diluted the interest over the result of the controversial elections held on 16 May, which is still pending. Twelve U.S. military officers and civilians, all assigned to the U.S. Army Atlantic Command [as received], arrived in the Dominican Republic last night in response to a request made by Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer for support in carrying out the embargo on Haiti. The arrival of the military officers, however, has been criticized in numerous Dominican political and media circles. It was described as an intervention and an attempt against Dominican sovereignty. In addition, the principal Dominican business and social leaders have written a letter to the UN Security Council, the UN secretary general, the OAS secretary general, the U.S. Congress, and the EU, in which they warn of the danger that "poor handling" of the Haitian crisis could destabilize both countries, which share the island of Hispaniola. The signatories of the document, ranging from members of the Catholic hierarchy to presidents of media and business organizations, who did not send a copy of their letter to the Dominican Government, ask themselves if the Haitian crisis "as it is being handled now could destabilize the entire island of Hispaniola, turning it into a volcano of 14 million people." The letter, after noting the huge cultural differences between Dominicans and Haitians, states that the 1991 military coup in Port-au-Prince "and the subsequent embargo have aggravated a chronic crisis, which because of poor handling (...) threatens to break up the coexistence between the two peoples." The authors of the communique, after insisting that "a deformed image of the links and relations between Dominicans and Haitians has been presented," note that the Dominican Republic in the last 25 years has been able to develop "a democratic system that has allowed the holding (...) of free elections." The document, which was distributed today to get the signatures of Dominican citizens, says "the Haitian population pressure, with its outgrowth of illiteracy, disease, ecological devastation, and large scarcities, demands that the Haitian problem be resolved with the assistance of the economically powerful countries." The document, however, does not specify the type of assistance required. The Haitians "displace Dominicans from their jobs, reduce wages, compete for land, and cause serious health problems," it adds in obvious reference to the thousands of black laborers who participate every year in the harvesting of sugarcane and who receive wages lower than those given to Dominicans and even live in "bateyes" (communities) established by government firms. After repeating that the Haitian "tragedy" is worsening with the UN and OAS embargo, the letter asserts that "no country, with conditions similar to those in the Dominican Republic, is willing to shelter the Haitians who flee from the intolerable conditions in which they live. The massive Haitian immigration has implications, not only of a social and economic character, but also prompts a political situation of unforeseeable consequences in the future of the Dominican Republic." All observers consider the letter to be the most important document presented by the Dominican Republic on the Haitian issue. Diplomatically, the government has not defended this position at the United Nations and has only done so timidly at the OAS. The document ends with a defense of Haiti's and Dominican Republic's sovereignty. The letter, dated 8 June, was made public today, 24 days after the Dominican Republic general elections concluded. The final election results are still unknown -- although President Balaguer leads his opponents in the provisional vote recount. The post-electoral crisis is still visible due to the opposition's charges of fraud. The letter also appears after President Balaguer ordered a "blockade" of the border following a meeting with U.S., UN, and OAS representatives on 25 May to discuss compliance with the embargo on Haiti. According to Washington and the international organizations, Santo Domingo was not complying with the embargo.
