"The fact that this attack took place during the festive season is evidence of the depths of depravity to which the perpetrators are prepared to sink in order to destabilise the democratic process. They must and they will be stopped. "All South Africans must now unite and make the greatest possible effort to fight violence in all its forms. I appeal to the public to take every possible precautionary security measure to lessen the likelihood of such attacks. The South African Government and the SA Police remain as committed as ever to combating terrorism and every possible effort is being made to bring those responsible for this latest outrage to justice. "I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims." Condemnation of the attack also came from the African National Congress's Gill Marcus who told reporters she hoped the killers would soon be brought to book. "We condemn it as totally unacceptable... It's very difficult to understand the motives of people who commit random acts of terror."
