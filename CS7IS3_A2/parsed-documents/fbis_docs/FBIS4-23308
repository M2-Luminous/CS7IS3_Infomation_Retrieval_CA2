[Begin recording] [Ogi] Presenting the report to the head of state, General Sani Abacha, the chairman of the CCC, retired Justice (Sayibu Sayi), said the agenda was drawn on major issues and includes over 1,000 memoranda received from individuals and (?groups) from across the country. The memoranda, Justice (Sayi) explained, were collated and analyzed to formulate the 30 items contained in the conference agenda. The chairman added that the agenda was designed to fit into the four-month duration of the conference under the first phase of the political program. Receiving the agenda, Gen. Abacha commended the commitment of the commission in keeping faith with government's resolve and anxiety to ensure that the conference was a success. Gen. Abacha described the conduct of the last election of delegates for the conference as most encouraging and congratulated both the winners and losers for their maturity and spirit of sportsmanship. The head of state commented on the reactions of the international community on the outcome of the election, as well as his administration's determination to pursue its transition program to a successful conclusion. [Abacha] (?On) the outcome of the delegates' election, the attention of government has been drawn to favorable comments by some foreign governments and media which now believe that this administration is sincere and fully committed to putting this country on a sound democratic footing. We appreciate this show of understanding. We however continue to solicit their cooperation in their reporting and commenting fairly and positively about our nation. They should also highly appreciate the enormity of our problems and give support to our courage and determination to grapple with them. Let me reiterate, unequivocally, that this administration will not renege on her stated objective. The administration [words indistinct] confidence placed on her to (?lead) our country [words indistinct]. The pursuit of a vibrant democracy for our people (?ignores) incoherent, emotional, and idle (?views) of self-seeking individuals. [passage indistinct] Make no mistake about it. [Ogi] Gen. Abacha said that the resolve of the administration to return the country to democratic rule was total and will never succumb to what he described as the whims and caprices of a small minority. The CCC, inaugurated on 18 January, had earlier submitted an interim report on 9 March. With the submission of the agenda, the commission is now expected to commence preparations for the commencement of the conference on the 27th of this month.
