The unit prices for Construction Units in this Proposal include provisions for the payment of all monies which will be payable by the Contractor or the Owner in connection with construction of the Project on account of taxes imposed by any taxing authority upon the sale, purchase or use of materials, supplies or equipment to be incorporated in the Project as part of such Construction Units. The Contractor agrees to pay all such taxes except on Owner-Furnished Materials and it is understood that, as to Owner-Furnished Materials, the values as agreed to by the Owner and Contractor for such materials include such taxes, if applicable. The Contractor will furnish to the appropriate taxing authorities all required information and reports pertaining to materials used on construction of the Project except as to Owner-Furnished Materials. ARTICLE II_CONSTRUCTION Section 1_Time and Manner of Work. The Contractor agrees to be prepared to commence the construction of the Project within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice by the Owner of the acceptance of the Proposal. The Contractor agrees to commence construction of a Section within XXX ( XXX ) days after receipt in writing from the Owner of the following: a. Location and number of the various Construction Units required for construction of the Section (hereinafter called the ``Staking Sheets''). b. Itemized list including appropriate Unit prices, of the Owner-Furnished Materials to be used in the construction of the Section and an authorization by the Owner for the Contractor to obtain such materials from the Owner's warehouse located at XXX . c. A schedule showing the rate at which construction of the Section shall proceed and the total number of calendar days (excluding Sundays) to be allowed for completion; provided, however, that the required completion time for any Section shall not be less than XXX ( XXX ) days or XXX ( XXX ) days per mile of line, whichever is the greater, which days shall be calendar days (excluding Sundays). The time of the completion of the Section is of the essence of the contract to be effected by acceptance of this Proposal. d. A statement that all required easements and rights-of-way have been obtained from the owners of the properties across which the Section is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably be expected to object to such construction). e. A statement that all necessary staking has been completed. f. A statement that all necessary funds for prompt payment for the construction of the Section will be available. g. Specific instruction as to location and extent of work to be performed on energized lines, if any. The Contractor will not be required to dig holes, set poles, install anchors, install underground conduit, perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable, or dig trenches if there are more than six (6) inches of frost in the ground nor to perform any construction on such days when in the judgement of the Owner snow, rain, or wind, or the results of snow, rain, or frost make it impracticable to perform any operation of construction; provided further that the Contractor will not perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable on public roads or highways if there are more than two (2) inches of frost in the ground. To the extent of the time lost due to the conditions described herein and approved in writing by the Owner, the time of completion set out above will be extended. The time for completion shall be extended for a period of any reasonable delay (other than a delay resulting from the failure of the Contractor to secure sufficient labor) which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials, direction of the Owner to cease construction as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible: Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. Section 2_Changes in Plans, Specifications and Drawings. The Owner may, from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project, make such changes in, additions to, or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications, and Construction Drawings as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if the cost to the Contractor shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a construction contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Contractor shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. Section 3_Supervision and Inspection. a. The Contractor shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Contractor shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced, and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent by the Owner shall be binding upon the Contractor.
