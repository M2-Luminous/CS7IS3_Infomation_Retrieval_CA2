Since the introduction of reform and opening up, China has achieved a lot of development in its economy but there are still gaps between regions, Li Lanqing said. Enjoying favorable conditions, coastal areas are leading in economic development whereas the hinterland areas are lagging behind in comparison, he added. Li Lanqing pointed out: The era is developing, so there is a need to deepen economic cooperation methods and contents. After several years of development, some of the "three-capital enterprises" in the coastal areas should also be upgraded and renewed. Northern and hinterland regions are superior to coastal areas in land, mineral, and labor resources and their transportation and telecommunications facilities are being improved. Therefore, there are great prospects for foreign businessmen to invest in and cooperate with the hinterland regions. Leung Yam-wing, head of the delegation and chairman of the association, said that this year marks the 60th founding anniversary of the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association. The association will hold celebrations in Hong Kong and Beijing, including a cocktail party in celebration of the establishment of its Beijing office and a "seminar on economic cooperation opportunities between Hong Kong and China's northern regions" to be held jointly with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on 14 June. Li Lanqing congratulated the association on its 60th founding anniversary and wished the seminar all success. Among those present at the meeting were: Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chief of the CPC Central Committee's United Front Work Department; Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch.
