After all, it was clearly to be expected that the coalition partners would use this as a precedent during the discussion on the restitution of church property, which is exactly what has happened. Will it not be difficult to explain, and defend, that a principle that applies to one type of property does not apply to another type, that is, to church property? [Klaus] I and, I think, also the overwhelming majority of ODS members consider the exception made with regard to Jewish property not repeatable, singular, and unique. This exception is due to the quite extraordinary suffering of citizens of Jewish origin during World War II. It does not mean any precedent, however, and nothing of this sort can be repeated. [Krejci] The ODS is preparing a specific proposal for a complete stop after restitutions. What will it look like and on what will it be based? [Klaus] The ODS Executive Council will deal with a complete stop after restitutions this weekend and I hope that we will make progress on this issue. It is precisely the variant of the restitution of Jewish property that was approved by Parliament last week that is causing the ODS to speed up the work on the proposal for a complete stop on restitution. [Krejci] The treaty on Palestinian autonomy has been signed. On the one hand, there is the view that this process is really leading toward peace in the region. On the other hand, according to other voices, this is the beginning of new conflicts with a potentially very tragic ending. What is your opinion? [Klaus] Such matters as this are very difficult to assess from the outside. Czechoslovakia's partition is the best example of that. We knew at that moment that partition was unavoidable. I can exceptionally agree with [Deputy Foreign Minister] Mr. Bratinka that it was a contribution toward calm and peace in Europe. I remember well, however, that assessments from the outside were quite different. Therefore, I really would not dare predict whether this step, that is, the formation of Palestinian autonomy, will contribute to internal peace between Jews and Arabs and I believe that no one else should dare make that judgment. During my visit to Israel I spoke with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres, both of whom were pinning all their hopes on this step. Those familiar with their past know that the two had not always been such dovish characters, wanting to make peace at any price. They had often sided with advocates of a more vigorous solution to this issue. I believe, however, that they have now arrived at a mature and balanced conclusion. There can be no doubt that the signing of the agreement on Palestinian autonomy will not bring peace overnight. In the short run, unrest in these territories could even grow stronger and the very first hours already suggest that this may very well be the case. I do not think, however, that there is any other path toward peace.
