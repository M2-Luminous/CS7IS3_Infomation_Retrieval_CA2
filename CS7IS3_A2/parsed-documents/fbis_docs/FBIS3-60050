The officials of Khania Customs Department believe that shocking things will be found as the ghost yacht is inspected completely. The hashish, which was very carefully packed in 1-kg and 2-kg cakes as well as in the form of tiles, was being taken by stages this morning by small trucks to safe storage at the Customs Department. (Marco Ribic), 50, of Dubrovnik, who was the captain of the yacht and engineer (Denis Vitmar), 39, of Zagreb in the former Yugoslavia, who were the only two persons aboard the yacht, have been arrested and will probably be arraigned before the Khania prosecutor tomorrow. According to reports, the yacht sailed from Yemen and through the Suez Canal was heading for Slovenia. However, because of engine trouble, it sailed into Khania port three days ago.
