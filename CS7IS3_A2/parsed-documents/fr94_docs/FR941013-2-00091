FR941013-2-00091 FR941013-2-00069 The transfer of Respondent to Mr. Ehule's wife occurred shortly after Mr. Ehule was informed that DEA would oppose the modification and seek revocation of All In One Stop Pharmacy's DEA registration. In addition, Mr. Ehule continued to operate as Respondent's pharmacist. Moreover, on three occasions, Mr. Ehule accepted controlled substance prescriptions on behalf of Respondent although he had no authority to do since Respondent was not authorized to handle controlled substances. In its request for a hearing, Respondent argues that Mrs. Ehule is the current owner and sole assignee of Respondent and therefore the application should be granted. Yet Mr. Ehule retains a substantial financial interest in Respondent. He is liable as a guarantor under the franchising agreement and lease. Respondent also obtained a loan from the franchisor; the collateral for this loan was the personal residence of Mr. and Mrs. Ehule and the corporation of Respondent, Real Vitality Inc., in which Mr. Ehule was the majority stockholder. Respondent offers the assurance in its request for a hearing that Mr. Ehule will not be involved in the ownership of Respondent. Given Mr. Ehule's substantial financial stake in Respondent, this assurance cannot be realized. Respondent also maintains that Mrs. Ehule has not been convicted of any offenses relating to controlled substances and that any errors attributable to Mr. Ehule should not reflect on her fitness to operate the Respondent pharmacy. While Respondent's former assertion may be true, it is not relevant. The relevant issue is whether Mrs. Ehule will operate Respondent independently of Mr. Ehule. In this respect Mrs. Ehule has demonstrated that such a scenario is very unlikely. Under similar circumstances, DEA has denied an application based upon the sale of a retail pharmacy to a spouse. Cumberland Prescription Center, Docket No. 86&hyph;91, 52 FR 37224 (1987). Mrs. Ehule owned 40% of All In One Stop Pharmacy and operated the non-pharmacy portion while Mr. Ehule was abusing the pharmacy's controlled substances privileges. Mrs. Ehule exercised no control whatsoever. Mr. Ehule continued to operate as a pharmacist of Respondent (and represented that he had legal authority to accept controlled substance prescriptions when he did not) even after Mrs. Ehule became owner of Respondent. Nothing in the present record gives the Deputy Administrator any confidence that Mrs. Ehule could or would prevent Mr. Ehule from operating the Respondent pharmacy, her belated assertions in the request for a hearing notwithstanding. Mrs. Ehule's promises are even more suspect in the face of the fact that the transfer of ownership to her occurred shortly after Respondent was informed by DEA that modification of his registration would be opposed. Under these circumstances, there is no assurance whatsoever that the public interest would be protected if the present application were granted. No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent except the assertions and objections in its request for a hearing which in no way refute the numerous controlled substance violations that occurred. The public interest cannot be protected by granting Respondent a registration in light of Mr. Ehule's involvement with Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certification Registration must be denied. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application executed by The Medicine Shoppe, on July 30, 1993, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a retail pharmacy, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective October 13, 1994. Dated: October 5, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25272 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
