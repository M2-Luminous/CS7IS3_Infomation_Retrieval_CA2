Our air, ground and naval forces have been able to repel and foil these attempts and to rout the hostile forces, inflicting on them heavy losses of life and material. On the Karish-Tawr al-Baha axis, our forces were able to shoot down two enemy aircraft and destroy four Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. On this front the enemy lost dozens of officers and men, including a lieutenant colonel and a major. In a hysterical attempt, two enemy aircraft tried to bomb the Aden refinery, but our air defenses foiled them. One of the aircraft released its destructive load over one of the government schools in al-Burayqah, wounding six women and children living near the school. In the Abyan-Shabwah axis our forces continued delivering crushing blows on the invading enemy forces, compelling them to withdraw and return to where they had come from. God is great.
