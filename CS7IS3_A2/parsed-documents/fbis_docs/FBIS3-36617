In his interviews and statements he urged officers who retired from the Russian armed forces and who, under the laws of the Estonian Republic, are threatened with deportation, to form self- defence units and to resist by force any attempts to evict them. Petr Rozhok told ITAR-TASS: "We live in the Russian land." Mikhail Toporov, executive secretary of the Veterans Union in E stonia, said that this is a provocation aimed at creating another hot spot in Europe. "We have decided to defend our rights by political methods. We sent complaints against the denial of residence and eviction of former officers to the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Council and other organisations. We must take realities into consideration which representative of Zhirinovskiy's party refuses to do...", he said. Estonian newspapers reported on Tuesday that the activity of representative of the LDPR in Estonia, Petr Rozhok, will be discussed by the next cabinet meeting.
