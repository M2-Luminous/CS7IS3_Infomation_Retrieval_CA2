The (4) impoundment is about 2 miles long, having a surface area of about 75 AC, a gross storage capacity of 467 AF, and a usable storage capacity of 432 AF, and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 465.66 to 473.66 feet msl. The (5) power tunnel conveys water from the intake structure at the impoundment via a 12.5-foot-diameter, 1,514-foot-long concrete and brick-lined horseshoe shaped tunnel that leads to the powerhouse forebay. The (6) powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate capacity of 1,600 kW each, and a hydraulic capacity of 1,490 cfs. The powerhouse also contains appurtenant facilities. Deerfield No. 3 The Deerfield No. 3 Dam is composed of (1) a concrete gravity spillway about 15 feet high and 475 feet long with a crest elevation of 396.66 feet msl, topped with 6-foot-high wooden flashboards; (2) 2 sluice gates and a (3) power tunnel intake located in the south abutment. The power tunnel exiting the gated intake is a 677-foot-long, 17-foot-wide by 12.5-foot-high concrete conduit. The (4) impoundment is about 1.3 miles long, having a surface area of about 42 AC, a gross storage capacity of 221 AF, a usable storage capacity of 200 AF and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 396.66 to 402.66 feet msl. The (5) Deerfield No. 3 powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate capacity of 1,600 kW each and a hydraulic capacity of 1,490 cfs. The (6) switchyard is located within the powerhouse and contains appurtenant facilities. Deerfield No. 2 The Deerfield No. 2 facility contains a (1) concrete gravity spillway about 70 feet high and 447 feet long, with a top elevation of 284.66 feet msl, topped with 6-foot-high wooden flashboards and four sluice gates. The (2) impoundment is about 1.5 miles long, with a surface area of about 63.5 AC, a gross storage capacity of 350 AF, a usable storage capacity of 300 AF, and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 284.66 to 290.66 feet msl. The (3) powerhouse is located adjacent to the Deerfield No. 2 Dam, thus there are no canals, conduits, or tunnels required at this development. The powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate capacity of 1,600 kW each and a hydraulic capacity of 1,450 cfs. The (4) switchyard is located within the powerhouse and contains appurtenant facilities. The existing project would also be subject to Federal takeover under Sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power Act. m. Purpose of Project: The purpose of the project is to generate electric energy to meet New England Power Company's peak energy demand and provide electric system operating reserves. n. This Notice Also Consists of the Following Standard Paragraphs: A4 and D9. o. Available Location of Application: A copy of the application, as amended and supplemented, is available for inspection and reproduction at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, located at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, or by calling (202) 208&hyph;1371. A copy is also available for inspection and reproduction at New England Power Company, 25 Research Drive, Westborough, MA, 01582. p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is using a scoping process to identify significant environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information related to the following items: •Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues. •Identification of and information from any other EIS or similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the subject river basin. •Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present effects of the project(s) and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For example, fish stocking/management histories in the subject river, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to develop land and water resources within the basin. •Identification of any federal, state or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass the subject river or basin. For example, proposals to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, or implement fishery management programs. •Documentation that would support a conclusion that the project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute to adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources and therefore should be excluded for further study or excluded from further consideration of cumulative impacts within the river basin. Documentation should include, but not be limited to: how the project(s) interact with other projects within the river basin or other developmental activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and, reports from federal, state, and local agencies. Comments concerning the scope of the environmental document should be filed by the deadline date. 2a. Type of Application: New license. b. Projects Nos.: 2404&hyph;017 and 2419&hyph;007. c. Date Filed: December 30, 1991. d. Applicant: Thunder Bay Power Company. e. Name of Project: Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project. f.
