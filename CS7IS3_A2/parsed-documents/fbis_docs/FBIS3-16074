The statement points out that the assassination was "committed in the Tajik capital by two members of an anti-state criminal gang headed by Mullo Kasym". The assassins fled from the scene of the crime. On their way they stopped an oncoming VAZ-469 car being driven by a policeman. The criminals seized the policeman's gun and inflicted gunshot wounds on him. Later on the criminals attacked a food-laden truck, brutally beat its driver and rode the vehicle in the direction of Semiganch village of Kofarnikhon District. The law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan brought it to the notice of the general public that Said Abdullah Nuri, leader of a self-proclaimed "government-in-exile", who is now in Afghanistan, had urged individual groups, who avoid prosecution for particularly grave crimes against their state to put vigorous pressure on the Tajik Government in order to destabilise the socio-political situation in the republic and fan up ethnic strife by using measures of intimidation, terror and physical removal of persons unwelcome to the opposition, particulary democratic-minded people and to work out plans for armed actions and other acts of sabotage. The Tajikistan prosecutor-general's office has instituted criminal proceedings against the assassins of the vice-premier. A manhunt for the assassins was launched.
