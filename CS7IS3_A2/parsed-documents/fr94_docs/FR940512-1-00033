Executive Order 12866 encourages Federal agencies to solicit earlier and greater public participation in the development of regulations. In response, the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Acting Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) sent, on December 20, 1993, over 400 letters, along with computer diskettes that included the most up-to-date draft of the proposed regulations, to State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, Statewide Independent Living Councils, centers for independent living (centers), constituent organizations, and other interested parties and individuals, inviting their participation in a series of public meetings and teleconferences on the proposed regulations. On that same date, the Assistant Secretary of OSERS and the Acting Commissioner of RSA also made available the draft of the proposed regulations on the ``DIMENET'' and ``RSA BBS'' electronic bulletin boards. Public meetings were held on January 10 and 13 and February 1, 1994. The teleconferences were conducted on January 24, 25, and 26, 1994. A cross section of individuals representing a wide variety of independent living (IL) organizations and viewpoints on IL participated. In general, most commenters were pleased with the draft regulations. The Secretary carefully considered all comments received during the public meetings and teleconferences.
