FR940803-0-00026 FR940803-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;98; Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;87] Special Conditions: Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 Variant), High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special conditions; request for comments. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) airplanes manufactured by Canadair Inc. of Montreal, Canada. These airplanes are equipped with digital electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) and an integrated instrument display system with active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCD's) that perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of the EFIS and the LCD's from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF. DATES: The effective date of these special conditions is July 14, 1994; Comments must be received on or before September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on these final special conditions; request for comments, may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn.: Rules Docket (ANM&hyph;7), Docket No. NM&hyph;98, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel at the above address. Comments must be marked ``Docket No. NM&hyph;98.'' Comments may be inspected in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Lium, FAA, Standardization Branch, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1112. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance, however, interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM&hyph;98.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Background On December 17, 1993, Canadair, Inc. of Montreal, Canada, applied for an amendment to Type Certificate A14EA to incorporate the model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) water bomber aircraft. This aircraft is similar to the Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11, approved March 30, 1993, as a retrofit conversion of the reciprocating engine-powered CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10. It differs, however, in that it is a production model featuring the same turboprop engines, but incorporating certain product improvements. The design of the CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 includes the installation of digital avionics consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and an integrated instrument display system with active matrix liquid crystal displays that are potentially vulnerable to high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane. Supplemental Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of ยง21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Canadair Inc. must show that the Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A14EA, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.'' The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A14EA for the Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 are part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;61, except for certain requirements found inappropriate for the intended special purpose. Those exceptions, which are not relevant to the special conditions proposed herein, are listed in Report RAO&hyph;215&hyph;100, Supplement 1, Part 2.1, pages 47 through 117, dated September 19, 1991. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification basis. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of ยง21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
