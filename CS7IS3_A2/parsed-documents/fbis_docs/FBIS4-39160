Our free-lance military correspondent reports: [Correspondent] The combat training of Ukraine's Armed Forces during the winter training period was summed up at the session under the chairmanship of Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, minister of defense. The main conclusion drawn at the collegium was that the troops had achieved a high level of discipline and combat capability during the winter period. This allows one to efficiently fulfill the main task of Ukraine's Armed Forces: to defend the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity. At this session of the military collegium, the minister of defense set tasks for the summer training period and outlined the set of issues that it is necessary to resolve urgently. Among them are the tasks of establishing strong statutory order and military discipline in the units and subunits and to prevent injuries and noncombat losses among personnel. Commanders at all levels should pay great attention to the storage and operation of hardware and armaments and to the precise organization of mobilization work. Radetskyy stressed that resolute and urgent actions would continue to be used in relation to officials who abuse their official position and have an indifferent attitude to the theft of military property and other illegal actions by servicemen.
