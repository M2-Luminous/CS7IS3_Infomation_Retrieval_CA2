No meeting has been held over the past three years and this can be attributed to the failure of this joint committee. According to the source, the idea to set up a new apparatus to promote U.S.-Thai economic and trade cooperation was based on a discussion between Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and President Bill Clinton when they were attending the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] meeting in Seattle in November last year. At that time, the Thai prime minister proposed the establishment of an apparatus to coordinate cooperation between the Thai and U.S. private sector. President Clinton expressed interest in the idea and promised to study the Thai prime minister's proposal. The source says: "Shortly after that, David Lambertson, the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and John Finney, chief of the Thai-Burmese section of the U.S. State Department, had a meeting with Sarasin Wiraphon, director general of the America and South Pacific Department. Sarasin was informed that the United States agreed with the Thai prime minister's proposal on the establishment of an apparatus for cooperation between the Thai and U.S. private sector. The United States also proposed meetings of officials from both countries to work out the structure of the new apparatus. Both sides also agreed to hold a meeting in March to discuss this project." The Foreign Ministry has two options to propose concerning the establishment of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. First is the establishment of the mechanism to coordinate Thai-U.S. cooperation. Second, based on a proposal by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, is the establishment of a forum for discussion with the participation of agencies from both countries such as the foreign ministries, commerce ministries, and the USTR [U.S. Trade Representative]. This will ensure the forum has a power for decision making and implementing measures. The source says: "The Foreign Ministry is speeding up work on the format and structure of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S. economic and trade cooperation based on the two guidelines. Moreover, it also is taking into consideration the existing apparatus under bilateral agreements, such as the Joint Commercial Commission, American Chamber of Commerce, Thai-American Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-Thai Leadership Council, and even the U.S.-ASEAN Council for Business and Technology. The ministry wants to find the most appropriate proposal to present at a meeting with U.S. officials in March." At the seminar on U.S.-Thai Business Workshops held in New York in October last year, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan proposed the establishment of a council for economic cooperation between the Thai and U.S. Government and business sectors. No progress, however, has been made.
