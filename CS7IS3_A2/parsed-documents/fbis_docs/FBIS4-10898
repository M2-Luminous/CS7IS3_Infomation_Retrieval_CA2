On numerous occasions, the U.S. troops deployed inside the base have staged serious acts of provocations aimed at creating a conflict that could justify a large-scale military attack against Cuba. On some of those incidents, U.S. soldiers, in an evident state of drunkenness or perhaps under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, have hurled objects at Cuban soldiers deployed along that dangerous border, uttered vulgar insults, or staged pornographic scenes with prostitutes from the base brothels. On other occasions, during times of crisis, they have fired at the Cuban side, once killing two young border soldiers, whom General Raul Castro remembered in his speech on 16 April. More recently, other incidents have been reported, with people trying to leave the country by crossing the mine fields located along both sides of the dividing line or by swimming across Guantanamo Bay in shark-infested waters mined by both sides. During those incidents, some of those escaping have perished, giving the opportunity to news media which are enemies of Cuba to weave dark yarns that sparked irresponsible protests from the U.S. State Department, something which Cuba rejected, as it convincingly denied those false accusations. In his 16 April speech, Raul Castro admitted that since President Bill Clinton has been in office there have not been the serious provocations that took place during the years of greatest tension. He affirmed that should there be at any time a military clash with the United States which did not begin at the Guantanamo base, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba would expedite evacuation of the families of the soldiers of that enclave. He also assured that Cuba will do everything within its power to preserve the climate of calm on both sides of the dividing line, which has prevailed in recent years. Raul Castro warned the Cuban security corps will try at all cost to keep citizens who want to migrate to the United States from using that venue. The U.S. Government has been asked to take measures to discourage these actions. If the U.S. Government is truly interested in maintaining peace at Guantanamo Naval Base, which it is occupying against the Cuban people's will, it has the power to do so. Despite having suffered painful casualties due to the acts of provocation along the border, Cuban troops have never given any cause for concern to U.S. authorities or dishonored their discipline, which under such circumstances requires an extremely courageous and calm conduct. The responsibility to guarantee peace around the Guantanamo base falls, therefore, on the U.S. side, until that base is returned to the sovereign authority of the Republic of Cuba.
