Speaking at a news conference of the Civic Democratic Party yesterday, he emphasized once again that this civil war should be solved not by external interference but by internal settlement. Klaus was skeptical in particular about air force deployment. He felt that, in humane terms, this is unfair. Given this type of civil war, in which there are no fronts or clearly defined positions of the armies, any global solutions, and air strikes, in particular, pose a threat of far greater massacres and catastrophes, he asserted.
