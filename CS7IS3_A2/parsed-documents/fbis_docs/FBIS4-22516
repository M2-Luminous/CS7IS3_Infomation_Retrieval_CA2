We are celebrating it in a difficult period in the life of the country. The broad masses of people are concerned about the unstable socioeconomic and political situation, the cataclysmic decline of production, and the growing unemployment. Voices of protest against the impoverishment of immense segments of the population and the grossest violations of the constitutional rights of people related to failure to pay wages for many months, the curtailment of social programs, and the outbreak of crime--these voices are becoming ever louder. The president, the parliament, the government, and various sociopolitical forces are calling for Russia to achieve universal civil accord as the main condition for the country's emergence from the deep economic and social crisis, in the name of stable movement toward a better life for us. Trade unions of the FITUR support the idea of civil peace as the only way of avoiding a national catastrophe. We are convinced that the real path to this accord is an immediate and effective solution to the most critical social problems. Based on the growing mass demands of the workers, we consider it necessary to adopt emergency measures which should provide for: --an end to the decline of production through changing the tax policy, supporting the domestic entrepreneur, and solving problems of mutual nonpayments; --a guarantee of full and prompt payment of wages with indexation according to the indebtedness; --the adoption of a state employment program that prevents the threat of mass unemployment; --security for citizens on a firm legislative basis. We call for the trade union organizations, labor collectives, and all workers to support these demands. Through active participation in the 1 May measures we will demonstrate the unity and solidarity of working people in their fight for their rights!
