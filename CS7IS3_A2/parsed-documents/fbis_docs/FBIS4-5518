The article said: President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea became a head of state in the 40s of the present century. In those days he was known as the youngest leader in the world. He is recognized as the most experienced and authoritative elder, a leader of worldwide fame, today nearly a half century since then. He has some 70-year long record of political activities. There is no man who has political experiences of so many years like him, we dare say. His policies have been lauded by the Korean people and whole mankind for years. This is interpreted as the incomparable greatness of his immortal idea and his feats as a leader. Once, many states of the Third World considered the destiny of their nations in relation to the orientation chosen by the big powers of the East and the West. But President Kim Il-song, with his high national dignity based on the chuche idea, indicated the unique way of building a new society. Therefore, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea could avoid the mistakes committed by the East European countries. A U.S. journalist who witnessed the reality of Korea admitted that though the U.S. President was delighted to say socialism was living its last days, the socialism of Korea led by President Kim Il-song is victoriously advancing, gripping the hearts of the people of the five continents of the planet. The Korean people deem it a great pride in their national history to have such a leader.
