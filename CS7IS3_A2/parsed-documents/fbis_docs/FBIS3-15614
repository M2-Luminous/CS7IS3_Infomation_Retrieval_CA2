Although this decision has been adopted somewhat late, which is an unforgiveable mistake of the authorities, it still gives us an opportunity to retain and reinforce the state independence toward which we have all made invaluable contributions. I hope that the leaders of Georgia's political parties will manage to overcome isolationism and work with a deep sense of responsibility for raising the role and authority of our country within the CIS.
