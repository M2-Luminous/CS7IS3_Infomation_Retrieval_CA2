But she also plans to make the police more responsible to the community. Ms Duarte was speaking to journalists after being sworn in as PWV Executive Committee member for public safety and security at Sandton, north of Johannesburg, on Friday. Her central philosophy was community policing which involved locals getting to know policemen in their areas. Complaints against policemen would be taken seriously, and she further suggested an independent ombudsman to examine complaints not handled properly by police. While insisting police should act against suspects within clearly defined perameters, she would have little sympathy for criminals, even those motivated by poverty. "We are not going to make excuses for criminal activities... We think people ought to learn how to respect the rights of other people." On the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD], Ms Duarte proposed some of its 8,000 members in the region be integrated into other units. The policing budget, effective until March 1995, did not allow her to increase personnel, so increased visible policing would be achieved by a reshuffle. But she ruled out disbanding the ISD at this stage. "We can't lose their skills." Ms Duarte was confident the PWV police force would not be controlled by Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi. His proposal for a council of ministers from the nine regions suggested there would be an integrated police service. Ms Duarte, who has worked as a special assistant to ANC leader Nelson Mandela since the unbanning of the African National Congress in early 1990, agreed she was not a stranger to law and order. She was restricted in terms of emergency regulations from 1986 until the ANC's unbanning. In 1989, Ms Duarte was detained at Johannesburg's "Sun City" prison for eight months. But she has no ill feelings: "It's all in the past."
