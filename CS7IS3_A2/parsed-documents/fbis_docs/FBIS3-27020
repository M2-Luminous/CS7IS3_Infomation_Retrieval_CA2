The comprehensive economic returns index for China's manufacturing industries reached 96.6 in 1993, an increase of about 7 percentage points over the previous year, said a report jointly issued by the State Statistics Bureau, the State Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. The report, which was released here today, said that profits and taxes made and handed over by industrial firms at and above the township levels increased by 36.8 percent last year over the previous year. Profits made by the firms totalled 145.2 billion yuan (about 16.68 billion U.S. dollars), up 62.4 percent over the previous year. The comprehensive economic returns index for China's large and medium-sized enterprises climbed to 106, about 9 percentage points above the country's average. The report said that this shows the advantages of those firms in production scale, management, technology and equipment. The comprehensive economic returns index for industrial enterprises of other ownerships including foreign-funded firms is 134, 37 percentage points higher than the country's average. In comparison, collectively-owned industrial firms in China are still falling behind in economic performance. According to the report, heavy industry performed better than light industry and the gap between them has been gradually narrowed. Driven by excessive investment in fixed assets and growing demand, heavy industry recorded better production performance and sales of products. Its economic returns are much better than light industry. Statistics show that the comprehensive economic returns index for heavy industry is about 103, compared with 93 for light industry. About one quarter of heavy industry is operating at a loss, compared with 36 percent of light industrial firms in the red. The State Statistics Bureau said that industrial growth is still characterized by extensive development, low economic returns and imbalance. The improvement of economic returns depends on the expansion of production scales and price rises. Officials attributed the low economic returns to increasing expenditure by industrial firms and their decreasing profits. They said that irrational industrial structure is still an outstanding factor affecting the improvement of economic returns since at present the country's total supply meets the total demand. Excessive investment and irrational investment structure and revenue distribution systems are responsible for the problems, the officials said. The report said China should maintain a reasonable industrial growth rate and pay more attention to the improvement of economic returns so that industrial production will grow in a sustained, fast and healthy way.
