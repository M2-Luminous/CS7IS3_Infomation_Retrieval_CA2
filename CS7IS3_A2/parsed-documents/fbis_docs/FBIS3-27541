The lawmakers at the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) voted 253-67 for the resolution on an amnesty to organizers of the 1991 "August 19 Event" and leaders of the armed rebellion in the parliament building in Moscow last October. Kostikov stressed in a statement that the decision is detrimental to cooperation between the president and the newly-elected parliament. He said that the State Duma had "not learned lessons from the bitter experience of the former parliament" which was dissolved by President Boris Yeltsin after over two years of stand-off. He accused the State Duma of "playing ruinous political games" and struggling for power. When the president was "making resolute steps to strengthen the weight and dignity of Russia in the world," the State Duma adopted decisions which would lead to destabilization and "a weaker Russia," he said. "This is a dangerous way," the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Emil Paine, an aide to the Russian president, told reporters that Yeltsin would not approve the decision. The aide described the Duma's amnesty decision as "an open symbolic challenge" to the president on the eve of addressing his state of nation message. However, he said the decision would not delay Yeltsin's speech which is a message to "the whole society instead of the parliament solely." Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council (the upper house of parliament), said in a televised interview this afternoon, "the public prosecutor's office and court will handle this issue. Lawmakers should not be involved in it." Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's choice, warned that the freed rebels would retake their activities against the president, which might result in a new bloodshed. However, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma Committee on CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States) Affairs, stressed that the amnesty and the memorandum on accord adopted by the lawmakers would "give Russia a chance to civic reconciliation." Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expressed "a feeling of certain satisfaction" when the decision was passed by most Duma factions.
