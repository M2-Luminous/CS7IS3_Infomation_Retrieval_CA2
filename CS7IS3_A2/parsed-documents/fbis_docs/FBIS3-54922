Work in the new residence has already begun. This was announced yesterday by Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the Russian Federation Government apparatus. The first to move in, Vladimir Kvasov explained, was the prime minister and all of his deputies. Government services have also been located at the new address. But only part of the apparatus has been accommodated. Ruslan Khasbulatov's office has been occupied by Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Aleksandr Rutskoy's has been taken over by a general department. On the third level of the 20-story building a complex has been set up for the Russian president and his services. This is necessary so that the president could work in closer contact with the government. Generally, there are plans to trim the government apparatus by 20 percent, Vladimir Kvasov said. Some ministries and subdivisions will be fully abolished. Today it can be said with certainty that subject to axing will be those departments that have outlived themselves in the present economic conditions. [passage omitted] A department chief in the Russian Government, who declined to give his name, told POSTFACTUM that Gennadiy Burbulis, commenting on this event, categorically stated: "Just as they have moved in, so will they move out!" A former adviser to the Russian president, according to the official, said that in protest against the fact that the White House has not been turned over to the Duma the deputies will hold their first session out of doors. The department chief also noted that as a result of the government's relocation the work of its apparatus will be paralyzed for at least half a month because there are not enough phones in the White House; there are also difficulties with government communication channels. All elevators operate well up to the sixth level, beyond which only some do. [passage omitted]
