Environmentally dangerous waste from the rich Western Europe is being dumped in Russia. The waste is exported as recyclable but in actual fact it is unusable poison, says Russian Greenpeace. Russian Greenpeace spokesman Dima Litvinov: "Now they are looking to Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union as a good place where they can get rid of their waste." Correspondent: This is Dima Litvinov, one of the Russian Greenpeace activists who have warned against this development, that Western Europe is beginning to dump its dangerous waste in Eastern Europe. Russian Greenpeace has just discovered 16 train carriages standing unprotected in a railway siding in the Orenburg area in the region bordering on Kazakhstan. The railway carriages hold 1,200 tonnes of waste from Germany and France. The waste contains poisons, including cadmium and arsenic. The waste has been sold as raw material for the region's nickel industry but it is totally useless. Because of the dangerous cargo, the Russian railways refuse to have anything to do with the carriages any longer and the authorities have not found anyone willing to receive the dangerous cargo. Right now most of the cargo is frozen, but soon spring will arrive, melting it, and a catastrophe will not then be far away, says Dima Litvinov. Litvinov: "There is a huge risk that if nothing is done with this material, there will be a real disaster in the area." Correspondent: What might actually happen? Litvinov: "If the material gets into the drinking water tables it is certain that the people in the city will become ill, they may have to be evacuated. I don't know whether it can be calculated now how many might die from it." Correspondent: Although the so-called Basle Convention bans export of waste that is dangerous to the environment, the convention makes an exception for waste that may be defined as recyclable. As early as next week, this export is to be discussed in Geneva, and several West European countries, led by Denmark, have demanded a tightening of the convention so that there will be no repetition of the case involving the railway carriages in Orenburg.
