In actual use in a demonstration project using microorganisms to treat wastewater from electroplating at Jingjiang Electric Motor Plant, they have obtained excellent results in purifying wastewater and recovering heavy metals. Now, this project, which is a project to attack key problems in the State Science and Technology Commission's Eighth five-Year Plan, has passed examination and acceptance by experts in Chengdu directed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In use, this method mixes selected excellent quality and high efficiency bacteria with heavy-metal wastewater that absorb water like a piece of bread and cause the heavy metals to precipitate at the bottom of the tanks. Inspection by environmental protection departments indicates that the rate of removing heavy metals from wastewater is as high as 99.7 percent, with a heavy metal recovery rate of more than 80 percent without causing secondary contamination. The treated water completely conforms to the discharge standards stipulated by the state.
