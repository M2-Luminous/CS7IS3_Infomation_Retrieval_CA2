FR940207-2-00055 FR940207-2-00028 The existing and provisional annual revenue requirements for the P&hyph;DP* are as follows: * The first steps of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates are in effect from February 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995. The second steps of the P&hyph;DP provisional rates are in effect from October 1, 1995, through January 31, 1999, or until superseded. Annual Revenue Requirements 1Existing 1Provisional step one rates (FY 1994&hyph;95) 1Provisional step two rates (FY 1996&hyph;98) $28,348,137 $36,083,885 $42,068,860 The rate increase is necessary to satisfy the cost-recovery criteria set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. Apportionment of Cost Study The provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm and nonfirm transmission service were based on the Apportionment of Cost Study that analyzed the split between annual transmission service and power service costs. The firm transmission service rate is established to assure that the P&hyph;DP customers have an equitable share in payment of costs associated with the P&hyph;DP transmission system. The beneficiaries of the P&hyph;DP transmission system include customers for firm electric service, firm transmission service, and firm transmission service for SLCA/IP power. The Apportionment of Cost Study, dated FY 1977, determined an apportionment of 55 percent and 45 percent for power costs and transmission costs respectively. The latest Apportionment of Cost Study, dated FY 1992, determined separate apportionments for step one of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates and step two of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates. The apportionments for step one of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates are 34.11 percent for power costs and 65.89 percent for transmission service costs. The apportionments for step two of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates are 25.82 percent for power costs and 74.18 percent for transmission service costs. Since the 1977 Apportionment of Cost Study was completed, P&hyph;DP's initial power investment has been repaid and the transmission system has deteriorated, requiring more replacement and refurbishment activities. These factors are causing a shift from power to transmission service related costs in the Apportionment of Cost Study. The provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm transmission service will earn an additional annual amount of $5,670,495 from 1994&hyph;95 and $9,857,542 from 1996&hyph;2047. The current Apportionment of Cost Study derives the percentage of required revenues to be recovered from firm power customers and firm transmission customers. The study is performed separately for each step of the P&hyph;DP provisional rates. Western has adopted a three-step process that evaluates capital expenditures, annual operating expenses and other revenue, and customer use of the P&hyph;DP transmission system. The first step of the study assigns project investments to either the power system or the transmission system. This step is used in the second step of the Apportionment of Cost Study. The second step entails apportioning annual operating costs and other revenues to either the power system or the transmission system. Annual operating costs and other revenues were determined by taking an annual average of future years in the cost evaluation period. Annual costs include O&M, multiproject, CSRS, interest, and principal payments. Other revenues include rent and miscellaneous, fuel replacement, multiproject, project use, and nonfirm transmission service. If an annual operating cost or a component of other revenue was determined to benefit both the power and transmission system, the apportionment was assigned in accordance with the apportionment of investment costs derived in the first step. The transmission system is used to deliver power committed under electric service contracts. Therefore, a portion of the transmission system cost should be recovered by power sales revenues. The third step of the Apportionment of Cost Study determines the share of transmission costs to be recovered by power sale revenues. Annual costs are assigned to transmission or power production on the basis of power system use by each customer. The assignment by use is based upon contract capacity commitments for the P&hyph;DP transmission system. Users of the P&hyph;DP transmission system include customers for (1) P&hyph;DP wholesale firm energy, (2) P&hyph;DP firm transmission service, (3) SLCA/IP firm transmission service, and (4) project use. Commitments under transmission service agreements are assigned to transmission, while commitments under electric service contracts and project use are assigned to power production. The tables below show the development of revenue requirements from power sales and transmission service agreements and the assignment of cost into their related revenue categories.
