He said the Visegrad group of countries was of special interest to Russia because it has long been linked to them by traditional political, economic, cultural and religious ties. During his visit to Prague, the Russian minister was received by Czech President Vaclav Havel and held talks with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Czech counterpart Josef Zelenc. President Havel said the talks were "very intensive" and touched upon European security and the roles of NATO and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the European security process. Naturally, the Bosnian conflict was one of the main items on the agenda of the talks. Havel said that the Czech Republic was backing the NATO ultimatum but believed that preliminary consultations with Russia were necessary. According to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus the two countries expressed "very similar views" on all the problems under discussion. This applied to bilateral relations and to international issues, including the situation in Europe. Speaking about the Czech Republic's attitude to NATO, Klaus said that "Prague was striving to become a "standard" European state and consequently a member of Europe's standard structures, including NATO and the European Union". In this respect the Czech Republic's membership of NATO would not mean that it seeks "to protect itself from Russia". It is intended to ensure national security and is not targeted against any other country. The Russian minister told the Czech president that the aim of his visit to the Czech Republic, in accordance with President Boris Yeltsin's wish, was "to try and understand how our neighbours and our friends are feeling". He said that the desire to continue political dialogue on wide range of problems of European security and bilateral relations, confirmed by the sides during his visit to Prague, was an important result of talks in the Czech Republic. He stressed that there are extensive possibilities for the development of traditional cultural and religious ties between Moscow and Prague. Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Russian minister said he was leaving Prague with an understanding that two schools are now acting in the Czech Republic -- one of President Vaclav Havel and the other of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The first one teaches how to combat totalitarianism in any form and how to struggle for democracy and human rights. The second school teaches radical economic reforms. The development of religious and spiritual ties between the two countries was considered at a meeting between archbishop Milo Vilka of Prague and Archimadrite Feofan, who arrived in the Czech capital as a member of the Russian delegation. The Russian foreign minister will continue his East European tour today. He is due to fly to Budapest.
