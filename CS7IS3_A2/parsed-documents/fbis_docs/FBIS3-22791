Initial reports of the German press claimed that the plane might contain radioactive materials bought in Riga. However, when the plane had been recovered neither bodies nor metals were found in it. Ilgvars Samins, a top official of the Latvian Prosecutors Office, said that by now there were no grounds to allege that the missing persons had bought rubidium and cesium in Riga. It is more likely that the metals have come from the East. I. Ruemmele and K. Eichler, whose names appear in materials of the Latvian Prosecutors Office and German press, are the former employees of the East Germany's intelligence service while Pavel Minarzik, said to be an interpreter, actually was a former captain of the Czechoslovakia's secret service. For many years he had been working for the radio station "Free Europe" but later was convicted for the attempt to blow up the same radio station. Minarzik also was the author of the book titled "The Come-back of a Secret Service Man". The name of a certain Klaus Peter Nedvig, the former colonel of Berlin Criminal Police, could also be found in the prosecutors files. On October 24 they were in Riga, negotiating a purchase of 66 kilograms of rubidium and 6 kilograms of cesium-133 for a price of $2 million. Meantime the subject of the deal was stored at the airport of a Swiss town. The talks in Riga focused on the term of payment which the foreigners asked to postpone as the final customer for the metals had yet not been found. Following the talks at the office the guests were rounded up by 6-8 masked and armed men. They were pushed into a minibus and whisked to a cottage on the outskirts of the city where the demands for money were put up to the victims. Eichler was left hand-cuffed to a radiator, but the rest of the captives were freed soon and given "advice" to leave Riga. After 10 days Eichler managed to escape. The mediator of the deal, a Riga resident named A. Korizno, who apart from $2.2 million demanded extra $17,000 for his services, was arrested. The Latvian Prosecutors Office said that in Riga only laundering of money took place, therefore at present the case have been filed only for taking hostages.
