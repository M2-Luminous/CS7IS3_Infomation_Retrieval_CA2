FR940606-1-00069 FR940606-1-00012 Several sections of part 154 would be revised to clarify misinterpreted provisions. These are in §§154.630, 154.901, 154.1831, 154.1832, and 154.1834. See ``Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes'' for the details of each clarification. Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes The following is a section by section explanation of the proposed changes. 1. 46 CFR part 40 would be removed. See the discussion in this section of the preamble on §154.1745. 2. Existing §154.1, Incorporation by reference, would be moved to new §154.8 and revised to conform to current formatting practices. 3. The following sections would be revised to include requirements from the amended Gas Carrier Code applicable to internal insulation tanks: §§154.7, 154.235, 154.350, 154.454 through 154.459, 154.468, 154.615, and 154.902. 4. The following sections would be revised to update references to other sections of this chapter and to incorporated material and to correct spelling errors: §§154.12, 154.15, 154.151, 154.174, 154.176, 154.188, 154.195, 154.420, 154.439, 154.440, 154.448, 154.471, 154,1005, 154.1020, 154.1115, 154.1135, 154.1735, 154.1800, 154.1803, and 154.1820. 5. Section 154.19 would be revised to refer to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk and to correct the date on the Gas Carrier Code for Existing Ships. The correct date is 1976. 6. Section 154.170 would be revised in accordance with an amendment to the Gas Carrier Code which sets the design temperature of the primary and secondary cargo tank barriers. Also, paragraph (a) would be revised to comply with present procedures for incorporating material by reference. 7. Table 1 (§154.172) would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by including higher tensile steel grades AH, DH, and EH for vessels designed for prolonged exposure to low service temperatures. The revisions to this table also would allow the use of grade A steel for design temperatures of down to ^5 ○C for thicknesses of up to 15mm. The reference in the table to an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) standard would be updated. 8. Section 154.300 would be revised to allow category A machinery spaces, for example spaces for bow thruster machinery, to be located forward of hold spaces if specially approved by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH). 9. Section 154.315 would be revised to allow the Coast Guard to accept arrangements where the cargo pump room or cargo compressor room is located outside of the cargo area, as ``cargo area'' is defined in §154.7, if the limits of the cargo area are extended to include the cargo pump or compressor room and the areas below those spaces. The Coast Guard has accepted these arrangements in the past, but only on a case by case basis. In granting those acceptances, the Coast Guard used the same criteria that is contained in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which this notice proposes to adopt. Proposed §154.315 continues to exceed the Gas Carrier Code in that the Gas Carrier Code allows cargo pump and compressor rooms to be located below the weather deck. The Coast Guard takes the position that locating the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms on the weather deck reduces the likelihood of permitting vapor accumulation in those rooms. Of course, such arrangements would be considered under the provisions of §154.32 on equivalents. This is consistent with the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which require special approval for specified locations of the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms. Section 154.315 also would be revised to require that personnel wearing protective clothing have complete access to cargo pump and compressor rooms and are able to operate all valves necessary for cargo handling. 10. Section 154.320 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by specifying allowable openings for cargo control stations not having access to accommodation, service, or control spaces. 11. Section 154.330 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by allowing less stringent requirements for openings to accommodation, service, or control spaces on vessels dedicated to cargoes which are neither toxic nor flammable. 12. Section 154.340 would be revised to clarify what is considered to be an acceptable access to gas-dangerous spaces, such as duct keels and ballast compartments, and also to clarify that entry into fuel oil tanks must not be necessary in order to perform inspections of the inner hull in the cargo area. These revisions correspond to amendments made to the Gas Carrier Code. 13. Section 154.345 would be revised to make it clear when airlocks are required. The proposal also would prohibit essential electrical equipment which is non-explosion proof from being in a space protected by an airlock. This is necessary because non-explosion proof electrical equipment in such a space must be automatically deenergized upon pressure loss in the space.
