This conclusion was drawn today at its first session by the information judicial chamber, which examined an appeal of the guild of parliamentary journalists. Valentin Sergeyev, head of the government press service, gave explanations on the incident. He said it had taken place when he had not been there, and the cause of the incident was some technical complications, connected with the moving of the Cabinet of Ministers to the "White House". Commenting on the resolution of the judicial chamber, its Deputy Chairman Igor Yeremin said that "one should not dramatize the situation and present an individual fact as a trend." At the same time, the chamber's resolution suggested that the legal status, rights and duties of press services of state bodies, as well as matters related to the accreditation of journalists, should be clearly reflected in the legislation.
