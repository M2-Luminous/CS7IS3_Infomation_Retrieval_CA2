Gu Qixuan, deputy director of the economic department of the FIC, said that China should consider setting up private banks to use the country's great amount of savings to supply individual businesses with much-needed cash for capital construction. This has become clearly important, as the country's individual savings now exceed 1,200 billion yuan ($138 billion) and at least an other 400 billion yuan ($46 billion) is lying idle in the pockets of the public. At the same time, many private firms are plagued by a severe shortage of capital for expanding production and updating manufacturing technology, he added. Gu noted that some 10 per cent of the country's private businesses have suspended operations due to financial problems, while another 30 per cent are losing money in their operations. The introduction of privately run banking firms would not only increase market competition to stimulate the State-run banks to strive for better operations, but would also create a new financial channel for the country's fledgling private industries. The country's privately run industries, whose output last year surpassed 397 billion yuan ($45.6 billion), were often denied loans by the State banks, which give priority to the government's key projects. In order to receive government financial support, some provinces and regions have given at least 83 per cent of the privately run rural enterprises the title of "collective firms," he added. Gu predicted that by the end of this year, private businesses will number 370,000, up 55 per cent from the same period last year. Their workforce will hit 5.35 million, up 54 per cent, and their registered assets will amount to 200 billion yuan ($23 billion), a rise of 193 per cent from the end of 1993. While strengthening the financial and tax management of the private businesses, government officials should also change their prejudice against individual businessmen, which have already become a major financial contributor to State coffers, he suggested. China's private businesses are now awaiting government treatment equal to that given to State firms, even as the country wants to diversify its service industry as part of the efforts to develop a market-oriented economy. Along with the central government's decision in 1992 to encourage non-governmental businesses, most local authorities have also formulated their relevant policies on facilitating the development of local private businesses. However, there remain imbalances in the development of private businesses among different regions of the country. Official figures show that at least 69.85 per cent of the country's private businesses are now in East China, where economic development is faster than other areas. Another 19 per cent are in Central China and only 1.18 per cent are in the western part of the country.
