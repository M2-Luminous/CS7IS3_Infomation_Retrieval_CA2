The interim constitution has both a bill of rights and makes provision for a statutory human rights commission. In this light, HRC [Human Rights Commission] is changing its name to Human Rights Committee of South Africa so as to avoid any confusion. The Human Rights Committee will continue the work done by the commission but will also examine how human rights issues can best be monitored and reported on in the new political environment. HRC is also pleased to announce the appointment of Patrick Kelly as national director of the organisation. He replaces Safoora Sadek who resigned to take up a seat in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] provincial legislature.
