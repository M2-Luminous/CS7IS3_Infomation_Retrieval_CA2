Summit talks there will take two days, after which he will have several days of rest in that country at the invitation of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. A memorandum on cooperation is expected to be signed during the visit. It will further develop the already close cooperation ties between the two neighbouring countries, which believe that they are related to each other by the spirit, language, and ethnic origin. This is going to be Niyazov's fourth visit to an Asian country over the recent period of time. The first three countries he visited were Iran, Malaysia, and Indonesia. A new political-geographic zone is being formed in that region following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who shares Niyazov's ideas, told ITAR-TASS. It includes the Indian peninsula, part of the Near and Middle East, Central Asia, the Caspian and Black Sea basins. According to Shikhmuradov, Turkmenistan's situation changed in the new geographic zone. It moved from the outskirts of Central Asia to the centre of the new political-geographic structure, which focused on it the interest of both Western and Asian countries. Taking into account the fact that the natural and manpower resources of the region, as well as its scientific and technological potential, are truly enormous, the Turkmen leadership and its president find it expedient to make use of them on the basis of the mechanism of bilateral and multilateral systems, without inventing or creating new ones. A series of Niyazov's recent visits is in line with that task, Shikhmuradov said.
