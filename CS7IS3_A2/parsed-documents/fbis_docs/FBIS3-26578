The relevant department of the State Council was optimistic about this, and held that China's imports and exports would both increase in 1994. They predicted that exports would increase by 14 to 15 percent, and amount to somewhere between $104 billion and $106 billion, imports would increase by 10 percent and amount to $115 billion, and the trade deficit would remain about $10 billion. This department held that there are a number of factors promoting China's export increases in 1994. First, overall trading conditions would be better than in 1993. In particular, as the central authorities continue to strengthen macro-control over the economy, the advantageous effects in increasing exports will be more prominently shown. For example, the prices of some major industrial raw materials and capital goods have substantially declined, and this will make enterprises shift their attention back to the international market; the strained conditions of funds and export goods have been mitigated somewhat; the central authorities have completed the action of merging the two foreign exchange systems in one move by seizing this opportunity, and the de facto devaluation of the currency will certainly stimulate exports. In addition, international trading conditions are also better than those in 1993, as the world economy is recovering, the Uruguay Round trade talks have succeeded, and the protectionist trend in international trade has been restrained. Second, with regard to the operational system, establishment of the modern enterprise system provides an effective way to resolve deep-level problems in foreign trade enterprises. For example, previous corporations set up in various trades have been reorganized into large, transregional, multi-trade, internationalized conglomerates engaged in both production and trade. Thus, export- oriented productive enterprises can directly face the international market. Third, in the form of trade, processing-related trade [jia gong mao yi 0502 1562 6319 2496] is now the main trading form adopted by China, which has become China's obvious advantage in international trade. It is expected that exports through processing-related trade will amount to $52 billion, and increase by over 17 percent. Fourth, exports made by enterprises with foreign investment will continue to increase at a high rate. In 1993, more than 70,000 new foreign-funded enterprises were set up, and most of them are export-oriented enterprises. A larger proportion of them are capital- and technology-intensive enterprises, so they will increase exports of products with high added value. It is expected that their exports will increase at a high rate of over 35 percent, and the volume of their exports will reach $34 billion. Fifth, changes are occurring in China's main export markets. Through four years' difficult struggle, the U.S. economy stepped into obvious growth in the last quarter of 1993. The U.S. economy has recovered earlier than those of the European Community and Japan, and this made the U.S. dollar firm and kept import costs low. Such firmness of the U.S. dollar will last throughout the year 1994. Being the major consumption market of the Chinese products, increased imports in the United States will benefit China. In 1994, China will substantially increase its exportation of farm produce to Japan, and overall exports to Japan will also increase at a moderate rate [zhong su zeng zhang 0022 6643 1073 7022]. However, China's exports to the European Community in 1994 will increase rather slowly. In 1994, China's imports will increase by about 10 percent. As far as policy is concerned, the state will further lower import tariffs for many products, and this will further stimulate imports. In addition, China will maintain a certain size of imported raw materials, equipment, and technology, and will continue to import a large quantity of raw materials for re-export-oriented processing. The number of foreign investment enterprises will continue to increase in 1994, and this will bring about a rapid increase in the importation of equipment and materials. It is expected that such imports will increase by 50 percent over 1993. The department concerned held that there will remain quite a few factors unfavorable to expansion of exports: Protectionist practices continue to prevail in international trade; it is hard to solve the contradiction of the distribution of raw materials which are needed in export business and are also needed in the development of the national economy; the economic growth rate, the inflation rate, the currency supply, and the actual process of economic structural reforms this year in China will all affect the growth rate of exports. On the whole, however, the prospects of China's exports and imports in 1994 are good.
