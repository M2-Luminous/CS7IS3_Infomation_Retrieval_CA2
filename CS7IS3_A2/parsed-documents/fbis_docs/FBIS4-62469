An accord on this was reached in Moscow today during the talks between the defense departments of the three sides, with the mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Questions of the first stage of settling the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict with a cease-fire and separating the sides within the framework of the protocol that was signed on 18 February this year were discussed. Under the accords that will be signed by the leaders of the military departments tomorrow, the lines of contact from which the troops will be withdrawn beginning 25 May -- to a distance of five to 10 kilometers, depending on the local conditions -- will be set. It is intended to create and set up by 24 May 49 observation posts along the demarcation line. Russian officers will command the posts, but their companies will comprise representatives of the sides, possibly of the CIS states, and the CSCE. It is proposed that special peacekeeping forces of Russia or the CIS states numbering around 1,800 should be set up to guarantee the safety of the posts. Moreover, a reserve of forces and weapons on the scale of one motorized rifle battalion will be set up. It has been provisionally agreed that the peacekeeping will be funded equally by Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. The parties agreed that the protocol on today's meeting would stipulate the commencement of the second stage -- elimination of the consequences of the conflict, withdrawal from Azerbaijani territory, and return of refugees -- immediately after the first stage. The question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will then be decided at a political level. General supervision of the peacekeeping has been entrusted to Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of defense. Plans for this peacekeeping operation are to be drawn up by 19 May for approval by the Russian president and agreement with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. For the first time, the talks were held with the press present. The military delegations of the participants in the talks were headed by Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mammadrafi Mammadov, Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and Samvel Babayan, the commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense army. The Armenian and Azerbaijani ambassadors and Russian Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov also took part.
