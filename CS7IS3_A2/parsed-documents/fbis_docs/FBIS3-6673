"Yi In-mo could fight resolutely with an unshakable faith in the party and the leader, unflinchingly defending the principle of a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, not yielding to the sufferings in prison for 34 years in South Korea, because he revered the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the mental pillars of the Korean people, the speaker said, and stressed: "Through Yi's destiny, the Korean people have become more convinced and keenly felt that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the destiny of our country and nation, the destiny of socialism and a great symbol of all our victory, glory and happiness". Yi In-mo said that it is the dear leader who has brought him back to life from the jaw of death and extended warm thanks to the dear leader who has brought him the happiness today. He said he came to the meeting with a floral basket, wishing the great leader President Kim Il-song and general Kim Chong-il a long life in good health. Yi Hyon-ok, daughter of Yi In-mo, referring to the loving care shown by the dear leader to her father, said that the dear leader is the destiny and a tender-hearted father of all our people.
