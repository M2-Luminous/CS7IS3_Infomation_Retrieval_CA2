Mr Lau envisaged that the radical democratic party, which would confront the future sovereign power, would become an anti- government force after the changeover. The dissident, who was jailed for 10 years in China for "counter-revolutionary activities", said the radical faction believed China was a totalitarian state. Mr Lau did not say who might join the party, but that he would devote himself to setting it up. He said the newly-announced Democratic Party would be nothing but a bloc put together for election purposes and its weakness would gradually be exposed as 1997 approached. The party would not be able to endure political pressure from Beijing and would backtrack on its opposition to China. Mr Lau cited as evidence the case of Law Cheung-kwok, former vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. He had been widely attacked by the liberals for supporting the dismantling of the three-tier election structure in 1997 in the recent Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference after being appointed as a local delegate. "They are very naive if they think that their relationship with China can be mended because of the new composition of the party or the middleman role played by (Meeting Point chairman Anthony) Cheung Bing-leung." The emergence of a radical party was a natural development in the worsening political climate, and Mr Lau believed people would accept this line. Mr Lau said United Democrats and Meeting Point had never played a leadership role in Hong Kong's democratic movement. "They are only eyeing their own political interests. They are not genuine democrats," he said. "If they are so, why don't they seek full democracy by 1995?"
