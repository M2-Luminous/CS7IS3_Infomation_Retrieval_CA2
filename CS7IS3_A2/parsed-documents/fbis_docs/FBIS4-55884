What did the deputies say about it? In spite of the Assembly discussion for several days about the draft law on Serbia's budget, this year's budget was also adopted without much tension. The government's starting point in setting the volume of public spending, which was publicly explained by President Mirko Marjanovic, as well as his finance minister, Mr. Dusan Vlatkovic, is that this sort of budget projection actually makes a concrete contribution to implementing the Program for Reconstruction of the Monetary System. The argument is as follows: Since the consolidated balance-sheet for public spending for this year in Yugoslavia (i.e., the classic budget plus social insurance funds) provided for Serbia's right to 6,664 million dinars, or 52 percent of the social product, the government of Serbia, "acting frugally and rationally," established the volume of public spending at 49.71 billion dinars (or 30 percent less than the permitted limit), which reduced the share of its total public spending, according to that calculation, to 42 percent of the social product. Government's Calculation In fact, the total public revenues are projected to be 41.91 billion dinars, and public expenditures to be 49.71 billion, with the imbalance in its fiscal books, 780 million, to be covered by funds from the National Bank of Yugoslavia's reserves and by issuing securities. The basic sources for financing the republic budget (of 28.60 billion new dinars) are the tax on personal incomes and the sales tax and excises. The revenues from the tax on personal incomes constitute 33.3 percent of the anticipated basic revenues (of a total of 22.37 billion dinars). Actually, they were proceeding from an estimate that the average wage this year would amount go 63.10 dinars and the guaranteed wage, by which the tax base is reduced, 20 dinars. This also took into account a reduction in the tax rate on wages from the present 30 to 25 percent. The revenues from the sales tax on products and services and excise taxes are projected at 37.8 percent of total revenues. Those sources, along with the republic's borrowing, 21.8 percent, constitute 90.9 percent of the basic revenues, so that all the others represent a quite minor share in the structure of revenues. Thus, for instance, revenues from corporate profit taxes are expected to be only 20 million dinars, or 0.7 percent of the total. Somewhat more revenues are expected from the tax on independent activities (36.72 million, or 1.3 percent), while 16.50 million dinars, or 0.6 percent of total budget revenues, is expected from the property tax. According to the balance-sheet for the republic's budgetary expenditures, 16 percent of the total of 28.60 billion dinars is planned to be for the wages of employees of state bodies, 18.2 percent for encouraging development (1.9 percent or 55 million for the fund for the lowest wages, and 1.8 percent or 55 million dinars in funds for surplus employees), and 14.5 percent or 414.73 million dinars for other incentives in the economy. The funds for exercising republic rights established by law constitute 42.6 percent of the total budgetary expenditures, primarily for education, science and technology, culture and physical education (28.5 percent), as well as social protection (3 percent), social care for children (7.9 percent), and protection for disabled veterans (1.5 percent). As many as 80 amendments were submitted in the Assembly for this draft budget, of which the government submitted four and Assembly committees submitted three, while the remaining 73 were submitted by 25 deputies. The amendments mostly demanded a different distribution of the money, but also additional funds. The government complied by approving additional funds for the work of the Vojvodina Autonomous Province, 3 million, and then 5 million each for the highway industry and the railroad, from the budget reserves. Comments and Criticisms If we ignore the favorable attitude of deputies from the Socialist Party, which was expressed on this occasion as well through truly numerous discussions (but not them alone, because a majority was needed to adopt the budget), it remains for us to note the points in the discussion that had quite reasonable suspicions and comments about this proposal. The first group of those comments should include, above all, those pointing out the deceptive impression of frugality, which can be reduced to saying that this had to do with a fiscal trick and deception, as Mr. Milan Bozic said. It was explained in most detail by Mrs. Jorgovanka Tabakovic: "It is claimed here that the total volume of public expenditures is 49 billion, about 30 percent less than the amount projected in the consolidated federal balance-sheet. These so-called savings, however, are based on the share of the volume of public expenditures in the social product, which is obviously overestimated." She said, "You could have estimated the social product to be 20 billion, and then the share of the volume of public expenditures would have been only 25 percent. And that way no one has been responsible for the plan and the estimate." At the same time, she challenged the position of the government that borrowing from the National Bank of Yugoslavia to cover the deficit would not be inflationary, claiming that it really could have been avoided if the republic had ensured additional real revenues from which it would repay the loan. The law itself, however, already says that the loans will be used under the conditions established by the federal law, which, however, specifies that loans to cover budget deficits will only start to be repaid in December 1998. The same federal law also reschedules the obligations coming due this year on that basis, namely the ones from 1987 and 1988. If the foundation of Avramovic's program is a strong dinar and a revival of production, then this proposed budget does not guarantee the achievement of those goals, through Mrs. Ljiljana Lucic, primarily because the main source of revenue is the tax on personal incomes, and so it is quite logical to expect that the government will not be a serious obstacle to their growth, which does not always have to be covered by production and earned income--or else that means that the government, in fact, does not believe in a revival of economic activity, because the planned revenue from profits is minimal. In fact, she sees the budget as a collection of requests submitted by various ministries, and the government only rationalized them a little, since one cannot see from the budget what its program is and what its priorities are. Dr. Vladan Batic called attention to the fact that the drafting of this budget, except for balancing the budget, did not follow certain basic principles, such as the principle of publicity, budget accuracy, or the principle of budget integrity. He requested that the government not come back in a month or two with a request to rebalance the budget, especially if there was no inflation. He, and many others, pointed out the amount of the funds planned for the police, which were several times higher than the amount planned for the judicial system. Zivorad Jeremic called attention to another inconsistency. Specifically, Avramovic's program uses the figure of close to a million people who, as a technological surplus, should be the state's concern, but the budget mentions the figure of 210,000, and specifies the amount of only 50 million dinars for them.
