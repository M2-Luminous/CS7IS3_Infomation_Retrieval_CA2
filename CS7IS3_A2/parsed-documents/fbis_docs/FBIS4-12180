The reason for this is the current situation in the region and that of the peace process. The peace process is still at square one because of the intransigent Israeli position. AL-BA'TH notes that the two presidents discussed developments in the Arab arena, the peace process, and the obstacles placed by Israel in the wayh of peace. The Arabs, Syria in particular, have done everything possible, in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy, so the peace process will achieve its objectives. President Mubarak has stressed that the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton gave great momentum to the peace process. However, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre obstructed this process. AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel does not want peace. It only seeks agreements, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, because such agreements achieve its dreams. At any rate, Syria will continue to work seriously to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region, but for peace to prevail Syria must restore its territory in full.
