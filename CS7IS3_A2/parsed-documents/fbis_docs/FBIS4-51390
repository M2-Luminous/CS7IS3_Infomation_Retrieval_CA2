Also under auction are barren valleys, wastelands and uncultivated mountain slopes. China's land law stipulates that all land, including mountains and rivers, is state property. Therefore, what has been auctioned is the right to explore the undeveloped areas. Underground minerals, however, are excluded. Hebei provincial sources said that Zhanhuang County has sold the right of use for some 11,000 ha [hectares] of uncultivated areas, more than 60 percent of the county's total such areas. Pingshan and Tangxian Counties have ``auctioned" off another 11,600 ha of such areas. The Taihangshan Mountain Range, winding through 110 counties, cities and districts in Hebei, Henan and Shanxi Provinces and Beijing, has a mountainous area of more than 12 million ha. The Taihangshan Mountain Afforestation Project, one of China's largest afforestation projects in full swing, has been written into the "21st Century Agenda of China". According to the project, by the year 2000 the total green area in the Taihangshan Mountain Region is projected to top nine million ha and the forest cover rate there will climb from the current 18.1 percent to 43.6 percent. The three counties have promulgated a set of policies stating that all capable individuals, enterprises, institutions and departments can participate in the bidding for the right to develop barren areas, either individually or jointly. According to the policies, which set no limitations on the area of land a bidder can offer to buy, the auctioned barren areas can be inherited, leased or transferred before the auction contracts expire. They also stipulate that the bidding winners must strive to achieve the initial afforestation target set down by related departments for the first three to five years. Otherwise, the auction deal will be invalidated and the areas covered by the contracts re-auctioned. An official at the Forestry Department of Hebei Province said that the auction of the right of use of barren areas is an experimental reform measure that has a direct bearing on agricultural property rights relations in the countryside as well as on the interests of farmers. He added that the reform is also a bold experiment to integrate the land with the market. The official said that the long-term limit applied to auction deals, generally ranging from 30 to 70 years, has helped form a direct and stable relationship between investment and economic returns. This has triggered farmers' enthusiasm to channel more money and labor into improving the uncultivated areas, he said, adding that in the places where the reform measure has been introduced, economic and social benefits have become obvious. Qin Wenping, Forestry Bureau director of Zhanhuang County, said that since the county first started auctioning the right of use of undeveloped areas in 1990, the county's forest cover rate has risen from 13.7 percent to 20.4 percent. He also said that the county's annual output of fruit has doubled to 20 million kg and per capita income increased by some 1000 yuan (more than 120 U.S. dollars). Official sources said that the auction practice has also been started in Henan, Shanxi and Liaoning Provinces.
