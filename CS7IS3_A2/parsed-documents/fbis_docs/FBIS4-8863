Reception is fair. Updating the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that "the early evening hours bring only continuation of the agony, chaos and hell. The Chetniks are intensifying their murderous attacks. They are about to enter the town." He says that "while NATO planes continue their futile flights high above Gorazde, the aggressor is continuing the slaughter of civilians. The Chetniks have fired dozens of thousands of shells today alone, and it is a miracle that anybody is still left alive here." In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "throughout the day, Chetniks have been shelling the defense positions and civilian targets from several artillery strongholds. The enemy has been pounding Djukici, Vranovaca, Boderiste, and the central part of the Brcko defense with mortars and recoilless guns. A B-1 hill cannon [as heard] has been firing from Cadjavac at Vranovaca and Omerbegovaca." He says that "the general alarm was sounded twice today, at 1200 [1000 GMT] and 1600, thus marking the periods of the heaviest shelling of the free Brcko territory, which has been exposed all day to fire from the Chetnik 120-mm and 155-mm howitzers." The Teocak Press Center reports that "this morning howitzer and tank shells, and mortars fired from the Chetnik stronghold of (?Dzemad), Priboj, (Dusanovo Brdo), and Lokanj landed today on the villages of (Snjeznica), Jasikovac, (Bivalici), and Stari Teocak. Several people were wounded." The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade reports that "since the early morning hours, tanks, howitzers, and mortars of all calibers have been used to indiscriminately pound Sapna, Kobilice, Vitinice, Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kodus. Over 150 destructive shells landed on the free Zvornik territory, but miraculously there were no casualties." Jasmin Puskarevic reports from the "free territory Doboj-East" that "in the operative zone of the 109th Doboj Brigade the aggressor has been continuously shelling the defense lines and the civilian targets in the area of Lukavica, Rijeka, and Klokotnica. Several civilians were wounded in these attacks." He says that "one interesting thing is that the Chetniks have recently been firing Russian-made 57-mm missiles." Reporting from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that "early this morning the Serb aggressor launched a fierce artillery attack on the defense positions of the 109th Doboj Brigade, and the civilian targets of Klokotnica, Lukavica, (Sanic Rijeka), and Hodzici. The attacks continued during the day. The Chetniks attempted several infantry breakthroughs in the region of Mujanov Mezar, but without much success." As for Gracanica, he says that "the Chetniks fired with tanks, howitzers, and cannons at the defense positions of the 111th Gracanica Brigade; then they pounded Lukavica, and (Lukavica Rijeka) with artillery." Smajl Terzic reports from the operative zone of the 7-South Operative Group that "this afternoon new armored-mechanized units were spotted in the region of (?Smajevac), which indicates that the aggressor is preparing new artillery and infantry attacks. One should add this: Today the enemy continuously pounded Jelah, Tesanjka, Matuzici, and Alibegovci for five hours, and there are dozens of casualties." As for Sarajevo, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Press Center reports that "a sniper from Faletic is firing at Grusulje, and an antiaircraft machine gun is firing from Gradina at Hodivode."
