The idea is to promote Tibet's economy with massive and large doses of preferential policies, so that the region can be incorporated in the country's modernization effort and launched on the fast track of development as soon as possible. This person said that, over the last 40 years, the central authorities have pumped tens of billions of yuan into Tibet and have actively supported and assisted its economic development, regarding it as a matter of great importance. The highest levels are currently conducting a comprehensive review of their rule over Tibet and the successes and failures of their policy, comparing the region's economic development with that of its neighbors, and studying the experiences gained over the last few years in border opening. The central authorities believe that Tibet is now ready to be opened to the outside world, particularly southern Asia, and has the right conditions for being incorporated in the country's modernization effort. In view of its geographic and various unique features, the central authorities have decided to jump start Tibet's economy with massive doses of preferential policies. The authoritative person said that Tibet's unique position among the country's provinces, cities, and autonomous regions means that the special policy to be pursued toward Tibet will not be applicable to other minority nationality autonomous regions. It is understood that the special preferential policy for Tibet, which the highest levels in the central authorities are working on, is only at the discussion stage. It is not known when it will be unveiled, and there have not been any disclosures of detailed procedures for the policy. However, the authoritative figure was certain that the central preferential polices to be granted to Tibet will be much more favorable than those for the five special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hainan and Shanghai's Pudong.
