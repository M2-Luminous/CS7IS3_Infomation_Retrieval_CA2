FR940826-0-00015 FR940826-0-00006 The marketing policy of the marketing order states that the final percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior to the end of the marketing year, or earlier. The Board recommended immediate release of the final percentages, in accordance with the authority of the marketing policy. The marketing policy also requires that procedurally, the Board recommend interim final and final percentages. Therefore, the interim final percentages were established even though they would not be utilized this marketing season. The marketing percentages were based on the Board's production estimates and the following supply and demand information for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year: ␣ 1Inshell supply 1Tons (1) Total production (Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Boardhandlersurveyestimate) 37,700 (2) Less substandard, farm use (disappearance) 2,700 (3) Merchantable production (the Board's adjusted crop estimate) 35,000 (4) Plus undeclared carryin as of July 1, 1993, subject to regulation 338 (5) Supply subject to regulation (Item 3 plus Item 4) 35,338 Inshell Trade Demand (6) Average trade acquisitions of inshell filberts for three prior years 4,033 (7) Increase to encourage increased sales (20 percent) 807 (8) Less declared carryin as of July 1, 1993, not subject to regulation 937 (9) Adjusted Inshell Trade Demand 3,903 (10) 15 percent of the average trade acquisitions of inshell filberts for three prior years (Item 6) 605 (11) Adjusted Inshell Trade Demand plus 15 percent (Item 9 plus Item 10) 4,508 ␣ 1Percentages 1Free 1Restricted (12) Interim final percentages (Item 9 divided by Item 5) x 100 11 89 (13) Final percentages (Item 11 divided by Item 5) x 100 13 87 In addition to complying with the provisions of the marketing order, the Board also considers the Department's 1982 ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' (Guidelines) when making its computations in the marketing policy. This volume control regulation provides a method to collectively limit the supply of inshell filberts/hazelnuts available for sale in domestic markets. The Guidelines provide that this primary market have available a quantity equal to 110 percent of recent years' sales in those outlets before secondary market allocations are approved. This provides for plentiful supplies for consumers and for market expansion while retaining the mechanism for dealing with oversupply situations. An additional increase of 20 percent (807 tons) was included in the calculations used in determining the inshell trade demand. The established final percentages make available 4,508 tons from the 1993 crop plus 937 tons of declared carryin which is 135 percent of prior years' sales, thus exceeding the goal of the Guidelines. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Board, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register [59 FR 9068, February 25, 1994] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
