The incidents in Bophuthatswana will "cast a shadow over South Africa, encouraging ANC [African National Congress] attempts to topple Chief Buthelezi and increasing the chances of White Right resistance." Warning Against `Bophuthatswana Treatment' for kwaZulu -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 14 March in its page-6 editorial notes that the "Bophuthatswana crisis" has ended with the takeover of the Bophuthatswana administration by the South African Government and ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council and the appointment of Mr Tjaart van der Walt, until now South African ambassador to Bophuthatswana, as administrator. THE CITIZEN hopes kwaZulu "will not be given the Bophuthatswana treatment and that Chief Buthelezi will allow the election to take place, even without IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] participation, without offering any resistance. As for the White Right, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has proved a paper tiger and the Conservative Party [CP] is in danger of splitting. With the CP in disarray, the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] is weakened, and with the IFP isolated, so is the Freedom Alliance." THE STAR IFP Must Allow Others To Campaign Unhindered, Vote -- Having decided against participating in South Africa's first nonracial election in April, the IFP "must accept the responsibility of ensuring that it does not hinder those who do wish to vote," declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 15 March. The IFP may deny that it intends to use "undemocratic methods to discourage those wishing to cast ballots" but "events on the ground look ominous. On Sunday at least five people were killed in Umlazi, near Durban, after armed IFP supporters occupied a stadium where the ANC was due to hold a rally, forcing the meeting to be held elsewhere." "The IFP leadership is facing a test -- and so is the Transitional Executive Council, fresh from its admirably decisive performance in Bophuthatswana." BUSINESS DAY Divisions in IFP Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 15 March in a page-10 editorial sees "divisions" in the IFP with the organization saying it will not participate in the elections, and others, like central committee member Ben Ngubane, saying "the election is still a definite option." BUSINESS DAY believes there is "a slender chance of participation despite the apparent firming of deadlines. Barring this, Inkatha has only one card: the king." If the IFP refuses to contest the polls, Mandela "can afford to tone down the rhetoric and simply point to the fallacy of Buthelezi's claims. But he has still to convince Zulus generally that the future of the monarch and traditional chiefs is safe with an ANC government, and that rank and file public servants need have no fears of being dismissed or victimised." "If the ANC wins a handsome share of the Natal vote, and finds the mediation tiresome, it will be sorely tempted to dismiss Inkatha as irrelevant, and pull out. Buthelezi will then be consigned to the political wilderness, and there will be no coming back." Call for Prosecution of Killers of AWB Members -- A second editorial on the same page refers to the execution of two AWB men in Bophuthatswana, saying the ANC's Popo Molefe "may be unmoved by the killing members of a group of armed, racist invaders, some whom had reportedly been shooting black civilians. He may feel the AWB men got what they deserved, but to move from there to the argument that nothing should be done about cold-blooded murder is a slippery and dangerous path." "Rights are universal and freedoms indivisible," and we cannot "believe it is wrong to shoot Chris Hani but not Alwyn Wolfaardt. The last thing the ANC should be encouraging is the belief that only crimes of which it disapproves will be prosecuted, or that some people can take the law into their own hands." SOWETAN Need To Woo Azapo Into Election Process -- "While we will be watching with trepidation the Inkatha Freedom Party's non-involvement in the election, we need to bite the bullet and get on with it," states a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 15 March. However, it makes SOWETAN "uncomfortable" that "Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] has been ignored despite the fact they are the only party to stick to their guns. If the IFP is wooed back into the process every attempt should be made to get Azapo back."
