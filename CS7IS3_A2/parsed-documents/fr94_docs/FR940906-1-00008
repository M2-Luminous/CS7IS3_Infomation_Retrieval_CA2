(2) Perform a daily check for free rotation of the gas generator, when T4 temperature is below 150 degrees Centigrade, by rotating the compressor manually. (3) While checking for free rotation of the gas generator, perform a check for engine rubbing noise. (b) For Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines Models 1A, 1A1, 1A2 that have modification TU 76 but do not have modification TU 197 or TU 202; and Arriel Models 1C, 1C1, and 1C2 that do not have modification TU 197 or TU 202; accomplish the following: (1) Within 50 hours time in service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, perform a check for unusual engine rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown or within 5 seconds after engine motoring. (2) Thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS since the last check, perform a check for unusual engine rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown or within 5 seconds after engine motoring. (3) Perform a daily check for free rotation of the gas generator when T4 temperature is below 150 degrees C, by rotating the compressor manually. (4) While checking for free rotation of the gas generator, perform a check for engine rubbing noise. (c) If any engine rubbing noise is detected during the checks required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD, prior to further flight replace gas generator module M03 with a serviceable module. (d) Install the improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane, modification TU 202, at the next engine overhaul after the effective date of this AD, but not later than December 31, 1999, in accordance with Turbomeca Service Bulletin 292 72 0150, dated April 10, 1992. Installation of this hardware constitutes terminating action to the checks required by this AD.

(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
