Traveling businessmen of all the world's military companies of any significance are frequent visitors to government offices and headquarters at the very highest levels located in the capitals of the Asian states. These are the nations which are increasingly becoming the managers and organizers of prestigious military exhibits and shows. What the world press refers to as the "next great arms race" is being played out there. According to many Western experts, the market in weapons of the Pacific Rim is becoming the most promising. Its potential economic volume reaches the astronomical amount of 100 billion dollars. In order to understand the next (this time "Asian") miracle, one has to turn to both foreign and domestic factors. The former group embraces the process of forced economic growth of the Pacific Rim countries. Suffice it to say that in recent decades the combined gross national product (GNP) of China and Japan, and the so-called "little tigers -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, newly industrialized countries (NIC) -- has grown by 160 percent, reaching 4 trillion dollars. The military budget of the vast majority of Asian nations is growing annually, most of which goes for the purchase of weapons abroad. The foreign factors are interregional conflicts pertaining to the unresolved status of territorial disputes, the struggle for leadership in the region (the traditional rivalry between China and Japan, for example). All of this creates a qualitatively new situation in the world market of military exports, where a very fierce battle is underway for dominance of the gold-generating Asian niche -- the absolute leader is the USA, with Western Europe and Russia attempting not to fall behind. The entire belt of Pacific Rim countries can be hypothetically broken down into three subgroups with certain common patterns of development of their armed forces and military imports. The first includes the countries in the northern part of the region -- China, Japan, Taiwan and the two Koreas -- which have a developed military industrial base and diversified military trade ties. The most impressive is China's project for establishing an airborne assault grouping in the South China Sea, which would permit Beijing to establish domination in the body of water of the "inner China Sea." According to experts, this would cost China 4-6 billion dollars. A component of this plan is the purchase of supersonic Tu-22M bombers from Russia. Japan's military budget reached 34 billion dollars this year. The American military-industrial complex, the strategic rival in the region and main supplier for Tokyo, is in strategic competition with Continental China. This is how one Japanese diplomat puts it: "If China actually purchases an aircraft carrier, we shall have to reconsider the strategy of the entire region." The second group of countries (which, incidentally, actively import foreign weapons) includes the states of the southern part of Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. At the end of the 1980's the leaders of most of these countries adopted large-scale programs for modernizing their armed forces. The government of the Philippines, for example, approved a 10-year plan for the development of its army at an estimated cost of five billion dollars. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have set themselves the task of establishing a "deep-water" navy by the end of the century; that is, forces capable of conducting operations in the open ocean, not just in coastal waters. Within the framework of these programs purchases of surface ships are being planned and implemented, their own rapid-deployment forces are being formed, formations of long-range fighter bombers are being formed capable of supporting the operations of naval task forces. It should be mentioned that the fiercest competition for weapons sales among the exporting nations is developing precisely in these countries today. Washington is the unquestionable leader, but Russia also has a fairly good chance. According to the LOS ANGELES TIMES, Russia has something to take to this market. And the importing countries are taking the initiative. In June 1993 Malaysia's leadership announced its intention to purchase 18 MIG-29 aircraft. Thailand's military leadership is considering the purchase of transport helicopters. The third group of countries includes the nations of post-communist Indochina. Due to their economic difficulties the leaders of these countries are a long way from buying modern armaments at the present time. Nonetheless, one should not forget that the 700,000-man Vietnamese army is outfitted mostly with our equipment and weapons. The Soviet naval base established in 1978 at the port of Kamrahn is an advantageous project for Hanoi today. It could become a stable source of foreign currency. Russia is the most likely competitor here, since in July 1992 Vietnam's leadership expressed its agreement with Moscow's intention to retain this naval base. And so, a boom in military purchases in the Pacific Rim countries is in the offing. Overall outlays on military imports have increased there from 2.5 billion (1979-1981) to 4.6 billion (1987-1989) dollars, an increase of 84 percent. Russia's military-industrial complex, which has some indisputable aces to play (including comparatively low prices, as well as the possibility of barter agreements) has a perfectly realistic chance for the future development of this market.
