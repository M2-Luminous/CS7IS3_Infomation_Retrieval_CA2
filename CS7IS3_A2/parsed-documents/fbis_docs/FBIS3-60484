Incidentally, one of them is sick with AIDS in the hospital, but cannot be sent back home if only because no one has $3,000 to pay for the trip. The uncontrolled stay of foreigners in Kiev triggered an outbreak of different "exotic" contagious diseases -- the last thing that we need after the Chernobyl catastrophe. This year, 123 cases of malaria were reported in Kiev, compared to 9 in 1991. There is no need to emphasize what consequences this might have for a city with 3 million inhabitants. In Kiev, 92 individuals were reported to have AIDS, of which 27 are Kiev residents and the rest foreign citizens. [Shestomatoz], a highly unusual disease in Ukraine, also appeared in the country. The spread of skin and venereal diseases has recently grown at a particularly alarming rate -- their number tripled over the past 10 years. [passage omitted]
