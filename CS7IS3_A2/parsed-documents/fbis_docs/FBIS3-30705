The main subjects of discussion were Romany education, the development of Romany culture and social issues. Kovac said the Romany leaders' suggestions would be worked into a new government Romany policy program, which will be discussed by the Slovak Government this March. Kovac praised the shift in the approach of the Romanies, who had managed to unite in the Associative Council and to defend their interests together. This allowed government policy to be formulated in the spirit of Romany needs, he said. He also expressed "certain fears" of the possible immigration of Romanies from the Czech to the Slovak Republic connected with a tougher policy on Romanies in the Czech Republic. The latest report on human rights in the world by the U.S. State Department had drawn attention to this, Kovac said, adding that the Slovak Republic would never manage to deal with such immigration without foreign aid.
