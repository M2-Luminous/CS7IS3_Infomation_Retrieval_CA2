He highlighted his country played an important role in the promotion of a system of cooperation in the Black Sea region, a system relying upon economic relations, joint investments, and a free trade. Cetin said the purpose of the setting up of the organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone was rather economic, but that did not mean that political difficulties cannot be overcome through economic cooperation and development. The organization will develop economic and technological cooperation in every domain, but especially in telecommunications, transportations, and tourism. The organization was not set up as an alternative to the existence of the European Union, but it was rather a step toward achieving the European architecture.
