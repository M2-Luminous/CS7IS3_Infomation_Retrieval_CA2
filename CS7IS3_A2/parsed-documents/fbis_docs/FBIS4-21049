FBIS4-21049 "jptdd015__l94010" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 24 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Government, Coca Growers Sign Five-Point Agreement Government, Coca Growers Sign Five-Point Agreement PY0604130194 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 6 PY0604130194 La Paz PRESENCIA Spanish BFN [Text] After lengthy talks, government officials and coca growers leaders at 2230 last night signed a five-point agreement to end the wave of violence that affected the Cochabamba tropical region as a result of the forceful eradication of coca plantations. Signing the agreement for the government were Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, Government Minister German Quiroga, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Sustainable Development Minister Jose Guillermo Justiniano. The other side was represented by leaders of peasant organizations and coca growers led by the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB). The agreement was signed after lengthy talks that were at one time almost broken due to the intransigence of both sides. The agreement, which was described as successful by the peasant leaders, begins by stating that government and labor leaders are committed to jointly fighting the drug trade. The second point focuses on the government's commitment to refrain from further forced eradication of coca plantations and, to this effect, agrees to issue within 15 days a ministerial resolution containing pertinent instructions to the appropriate organizations. The next point recognizes the government's commitment to continue "to search for and to destroy maceration pits and/or laboratories, without destroying adjacent coca plantations." The fourth point was the most conflictive, to the point of having threatened to causing an impasse in the talks. It states: "The government and coca growers leaders will participate in the implementation of the provisions of Articles 10, 14, and 24 of Law 1008. The government vows to implement the Alternative Development Program jointly with coca growers leaders." The fifth and final point provides for the creation of joint commissions to address all problems concerning production, marketing, processing, alternative development, and the legal and institutional aspects concerning coca production. Following the signing of the agreement, government officials and leaders of peasant organizations expressed their satisfaction over the outcome of their talks. Foreign Minister Aranibar announced that the government yielded on the conflictive fourth point "to safeguard social peace and because the fight against the drug trade must be waged within a framework of respect for the people and for the country." Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers, described the agreement as "a major step forward" in the defense of coca, which is the only source of income for the peasants of Cochabamba and said that the task remaining now is to implement alternative development as a condition for replacing the surplus coca production.
