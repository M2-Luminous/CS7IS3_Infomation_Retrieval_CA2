But some analysts said bilateral relations could take a new twist in the not too distant future, depending on who replaces Hosokawa. Hosokawa's resignation announcement amid allegations of financial misdeeds came a week before Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was expected to call for early resumption of the stalled trade talks in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. The two were scheduled to meet at a multilateral ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, Morocco. But Hata's name has emerged as a likely successor to Hosokawa. "Everything will have to wait until after the formation of a new cabinet. We will have to make another fresh effort to explore ways to resume trade talks," said an official involved in Japan-U.S. trade relations. While Japan is unlikely to change its support for a free world trading system or rethink its rejection of U.S. demands to introduce numerical indicators to guide trade, the next leader could take a different approach, the official said. If leadership reverts to a more experienced politician, the old- style power structures could come back into play, namely collusive deal-making among politicians, bureaucrats and business that Hosokawa vowed to break, he said. While this could make it easier for the United States to pressure Japan into delivering on demands, it could also slow down Hosokawa's efforts to free business from heavy-handed government controls -- a move also applauded by Washington. The U.S. has been fumbling in its relations with Japan in part because it could not grasp the power structure of Hosokawa's seven- party coalition government, the first non-Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government to rule in 38 years, claimed Ikuo Kabashima, professor of Political Science at Tsukuba University. If Hata, a close associate of Ichiro Ozawa, the key behind-the- scenes player in the coalition government, emerges as next prime minister, "the U.S. can feel comfortable because it knows it can deal with him," said Kabashima. That has some bureaucrats worried. Although Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed in February to come up with an agreement on contentious trade issues, some Japanese diplomats regard the breakdown in trade talks as an opportunity to establish a new style of working relationship. "Ozawa likes the traditional type of management where he resolves friction by pressuring interest groups, and he is not the type of person who really pushes for market principles," said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If we go back to the traditional way it would not be instrumental in making a new partnership," he said. But other sources here are confident that no new leader can reverse the legacy Hosokawa established during his brief eight-month stay in office. Hosokawa, a former governor who rocketed to power last summer after the LDP lost its majority in the House of Representatives, leaves office with support ratings hovering around 50 percent. While this is down over 20 percentage points from his early ratings, Hosokawa remains more popular than many of his LDP predecessors who were at the height of their careers. Merle Okawara, vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, lauded Hosokawa for ushering in many reforms that more experienced LDP prime ministers had failed to achieve. "At least he got the machinery going in the right direction, which is good for U.S. businesses in Japan," she said, noting he partially liberalized the rice market, achieved political reform and was making headway on tax reforms. Political reform had unseated Hosokawa's two immediate predecessors -- Kiichi Miyazawa and Toshiki Kaifu, both of the LDP. Hosokawa said he was resigning because the budget was blocked in parliament by the opposition LDP, which demanded he respond to allegations over questionable handling of stock and real estate deals, not because the people wanted him to resign, said Okawara. "The machinery is in place and whoever follows him will have to continue because otherwise he will be very unpopular," she said.
