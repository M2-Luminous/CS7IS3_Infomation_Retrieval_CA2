Orlando da Conceicao, aka Orlando Jogador, who was known to head the trafficking in nine shantytowns in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro--from Penha District to Olaria District--was killed together with his brother Anderson da Conceicao, aka Dilson, and 11 members of his gang. This is the bloodiest battle ever fought in the shantytowns over drug sales control. One Military Police agent--soldier Jose Carlos Castro Pontes, 31--was also killed. He is believed to have cooperated with Orlando Jogador in Nova Brasilia shantytown, one km from the Alemao Hill shantytown. Jogador and his gang were surprised by members of another criminal gang, the Red Command, and others linked to the gang headed by Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka Ue; Fabio Pinto Soares, aka Fabinho; and Marcelo Fonseca de Souza, aka Marcelo Xara. The conflict began over the distribution of just over $27,000 (nearly 60 million real cruzeiros) resulting from a bank hold up. The criminals' bodies were later found in three cars dumped in Sao Cristovao District, Maria da Graca District, and Barros Filho District. The money was stolen on 13 June from the Bank of Brazil office in Tijuca District. Orlando Jogador, who owned an empire of 500 drug selling posts, rented the rifles and revolvers used in the hold up to the bank robbers. When the money was distributed, however, he deemed his cut too small. The dispute began when Orlando Jogador was speaking on one of his cellular phones with another drug trafficker--probably Ue--complaining about his share. The gang's cook, who was only shot in the left ankle, reported that the shooting then began--using the rented guns. He told policemen of the 23d Police Precinct (in Meier district): Orlando Jogador was on the phone and had no time to defend himself.
