At last everything here was "as with other people." I mean the heated budget battles in the Federal Assembly, which centered, as is proper, on defense spending. If we disregard the results and the fact that the figures approved by the State Duma for the military budget bring the Armed Forces to the verge of mere survival or even push them beyond it, the very fact of this debate must, at first sight, provide definite grounds for optimism. Our parliamentarians have finally realized that they can influence the country's development -- and influence it perfectly really -- not through endless arguing over political questions. But the way this is done in all civilized countries -- through the budget. Throughout the world, by allocating or not allocating money under a particular heading to a particular government program, the people's elected representatives shape the state policy which they deem necessary. In this context the present difficulties of the defense department and of our military industry would seem to be on a par with those encountered by the military department and the military-industrial complex of, let us say, the United States. The Pentagon always gets less than it asks for. But, alas, the similarity here seems purely superficial, a similarity of procedure and form, certainly not one relating to the crux of the matter. For, at least in the perception of the public, the heated parliamentary fighting centered on highly abstract figures. It turned out that 37 trillion rubles [R] was arguing with R55 trillion. And yet fundamentally different approaches lie behind these figures. Not even approaches to the future fate of the Army, for which undying love is sworn by all Russian politicians (who, it is true, forget that the Army must not only be loved but also fed). I am talking of approaches to ensuring the country's security. So the Ministry of Defense, relying on the main provisions of the military doctrine, having reckoned up the possible threats to our security, and mindful of the problems facing the Armed Forces and of Russia's international obligations, formed a certain military budget. The Ministry of Finance disagreed with it, which apparently is normal. At the same time the approach itself was formulated in a fundamentally different way: We will give as much money as we can, based on the state's assumed income. The Duma inclined toward the second approach. This, taking the state of our economy into account, would also be understandable in general. But for one highly material circumstance. Parliament failed to take the next step, which was absolutely essential in that situation. Namely, it did not, as far as I know, assume the responsibility of deciding just how, in fact, the Ministry of Defense should dispose of the funds allocated and what it should renounce. In giving this money to the Army, it was necessary to say honestly: It is the State Duma -- an organ of legislative power -- and not the "notorious bureaucrats" of the Ministry of Defense which, owing to the economic situation, is depriving servicemen of a considerable proportion of the privileges that were granted them previously. In giving this money to the Army, parliament should have acknowledged that for the same reason soldiers would be fed and clothed worse. The legislature should also have assumed responsibility for the fact that considerably fewer apartments than planned would be constructed. Consequently, with the legislators' blessing many units and formations being withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic republics would be housed out in the open. Moreover, precisely the parliamentarians should have taken the trouble to decide who, essentially, was to abandon combat training and where, and who was to make the switch exclusively to guarding storehouses and military installations and to mothballing military property. For it is perfectly obvious that it is impossible, within the framework of the funds being allocated, to maintain the combat readiness of all units, formations, and districts. That is, in adopting such a budget, parliament should have recognized that not even the minimum requirements of all the Armed Forces would be satisfied. And defined the vitally important elements of the country's security structure which it considers it necessary to finance, as well as the less important ones which can be abandoned. And assumed responsibility for those decisions. There should have been a debate on those priorities, not about abstract figures. But there was not. Instead, the opinion was widespread that the military was sabotaging reforms in the Armed Forces, which is why the Army cannot manage on the funds allocated to it. All this talk is painfully reminiscent of what our leaders were saying about conversion at the end of the eighties. Conversion, they said, will not only provide the military-industrial complex with work but will also give a boost to the entire country's development. The only hindrance is the sluggish thinking of the corps of directors. Something else was and still is a hindrance: A reluctance to understand that any reform, be it conversion of military production or Army reform, requires huge additional funds. And yet those who sit in the State Duma are certainly not naive. There are sufficient qualified economists there to be aware of the obvious. But for some reason they prefer not to talk about real, basic problems. There can be just one explanation for this, although it is not quite pleasant for the legislators. They do not believe that the budget is realistic. They do not believe that, by discussing it, they are really financing a particular aspect of the state's life. They believe that the government will fail to secure the income on which it is reckoning. If this is so, then the crumbs that are gathered up will be distributed "on a current basis," i.e. according to the method of stopping holes. In this case all debate resembles the torments of one of Zhvanetskiy's characters. The one who agonized over whether to buy crayfish at "yesterday's R5" or "today's R3," when he neither had R5 yesterday nor has R3 today. Then, in discussing the military budget, it is hardly worth going deeply into such complex matters as defense capability. Then it becomes clear why the budget's approval became a field for interparty intrigues, loud statements, and overt politicking. It follows from this that our politicians, alas, have not matured to the point of real parliamentarianism, which embodies, above all, responsibility for the country.
