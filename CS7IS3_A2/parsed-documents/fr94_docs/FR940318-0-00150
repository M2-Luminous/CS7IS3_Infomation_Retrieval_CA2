FR940318-0-00150 FR940318-0-00023 (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new ice skating rinks. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new ice skating rinks. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new ice skating rinks. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (15) CFC&hyph;114 Uranium Isotope Separation Processing, Retrofit. (a) Cycloperfluorobutane (C 4 F 8 ). Cycloperfluorobutane (C 4 F 8 ) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in uranium isotope separation processing. C 4 F 8 is a PFC. It has a very long lifetime and a very high GWP. The Department of Energy (DOE) has examined several other substitutes and none meets the requirements for this application. DOE is pursuing a leak reduction program which should further restrict emissions of this refrigerant. (b) Perfluoro-n-butane (C 4 F 10 ). Perfluoro-n-butane (C 4 F 10 ) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in uranium isotope separation processing. C 4 F 10 is a PFC. It has a very long lifetime and a very high GWP. The Department of Energy (DOE) has examined several other substitutes and none meets the requirements for this application. DOE is pursuing a leak reduction program which should further restrict emissions of this refrigerant. (c) Perfluoropentane (C 5 F 12 ). Perfluoropentane (C 5 F 12 ) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in uranium isotope separation processing. C 5 F 12 is a PFC. It has a very long lifetime and a very high GWP. EPA strongly encourages users to pursue leak reduction strategies and to recover the fluid when the unit is retired. (d) Perfluorohexane (C 6 F 14 ). Perfluorohexane (C 6 F 14 ) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in uranium isotope separation processing. C 6 F 14 is a PFC. It has a very long lifetime and a very high GWP. EPA strongly encourages users to pursue leak reduction strategies and to recover the fluid when the unit is retired. (e) Perfluoro-n-methyl morpholine (C 5 F 11 NO). Perfluoro-n-methly morpholine (C 5 F 11 NO) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in uranium isotope separation processing. C 5 F 11 NO is a PFC. It has a very long lifetime and a very high GWP. EPA strongly encourages users to pursue leak reduction strategies and to recover the fluid when the unit is retired. (16) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Cold Storage Warehouses, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B. R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. For further information, see the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (d) R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B. R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, propane, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. For further information, see the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.
