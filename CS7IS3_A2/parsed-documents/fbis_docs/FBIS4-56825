Munguia, president of the National Development Bank. There are at least five factors that the government should be aware of before it reaches the conclusion that there are not enough funds in the National Development Bank for cotton production. 1. Is Mr. Munguia out of touch with reality? Anyone who lives in Leon or Chinandega knows how serious the crisis is in this western region. The level of unemployment in areas where peasants are out of work is shocking, and 100,000 manzanas of land lies fallow, out of production thanks to bureaucrats like this one. 2. The current neo-agricultural policy of the Development Bank: This financial institution was founded to deal with sectors like cotton that have an impact on the country's economy. There are three factors that the governments' Economic and Productive Committee should be aware of: a. Cotton is a crop that farmers are familiar with, and they have mastered the techniques of growing it. b. According to German Technical Aid (GTZ), cotton is grown today with superior technology and at reasonable production costs. c. The price of $76.60 per gold quintal, given current costs, makes this a profitable activity that would bring in substantial amounts of foreign exchange for the country. 3. The possibility of shoring up the cotton loan portfolio: Cotton is a financial activity that is loaded down with balances and restructuring. Yet the international price could turn cotton into a profitable activity again and help cotton producers with their debts. It used to be said that "a cotton debt can only be paid with cotton." 4. The generation of employment in the western region: The cultivation of cotton generates much direct and indirect employment, so there is an urgent need to create profitable initiatives that will create jobs. Besides, did not the current government promise the people prosperity? Is not the role of government to create jobs to benefit the poorest and neediest segments of society? This is an opportunity to make up for the negative consequences of the neoliberal financial policies that are so dehumanizing. 5. Set up a consultation with cotton experts: The economic importance of this crop and the foreign currency that it can bring into the country mean that we need a more prudent consideration of the matter than an attorney can provide. I suggest that we consult with people who know the field and who can also help arrive at a more comprehensive, professional, and prudent decision based on consensus, rather than the decision made by Attorney Munguia, which I consider to be dogmatic and irresponsible. It should be noted that one swallow does not make a summer, and, on the other hand, the suggestion "Cobbler, stick to your last" comes to mind. In conclusion: - I suggest that we pay more attention to the real plight of our people, who are jobless, hungry, poor, etc. This will only lead to social instability, and in short, a minimal private and foreign investment. - We need to orient our resources toward profitable initiatives that producers are familiar with and that can contribute to the improvement of the bank's cotton loan portfolio. - Unemployment in the western region and banking and financial reforms should not be handled in a dogmatic manner, or without consideration for the people's socioeconomic interests; the socioeconomic interests of everyone are one thing, and lending the bank's money to serve the interests of a single group is quite another. - Be open to the different options for financing cotton production, because peasant unemployment and idle land are not conducive to social stability; on the contrary, all social tension or social tranquility begins in the countryside.
