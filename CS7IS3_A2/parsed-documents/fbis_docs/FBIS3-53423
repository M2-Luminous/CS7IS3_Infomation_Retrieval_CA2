The recent crisis in foreign exchange is actually a political issue, because with the protraction of this crisis the United States expects the downfall of the anti-U.S. government in Iran. This crisis arose immediately following the explicit remarks by the leader concerning the United States. Foreign radios and the mouthpieces of the policies of the West and of Zionism have stated that by the end of 1993, the exchange rate would reach 2,500 rials to the dollar and that by the end of the Iranian year it will reach 3,000 rials. Some have also said that it should be 10,000 rials to one dollar. Actually, the United States wants to use this method to increase inflation and drive up prices. This will make the people disenchanted with Islam and the revolution and force them to agree to establish relations with the United States, thinking that such relations will resolve all our problems. If the Iranian statesmen are not willing to do so, they will be overthrown! And a pro-U.S. regime will come to power! It is very interesting to know that the dollar-rial exchange rate is determined in the United States. As the United States cannot establish direct contact with Iran, it operates through the Dubayy foreign exchange market. At the outset of the crisis, foreign exchange dealers have only been purchasing foreign exchange and transferring these funds abroad--to Dubayy--because a higher rate for the dollar can be obtained there. There is a clear answer to why this mechanism is being used. Through the banking mechanism, the United States is instigating inflation in Iran. With the rise in foreign exchange rates, the prices of imported items increase. In turn, the high prices of foreign exchange-related goods affect the prices of domestic products, and inflation becomes a vicious circle. It may be asked how the United States benefits from all this. The United States is ready to spend billions of dollars to defeat an independent government. During 28 Mordad 1332 [19 August 1953 coup which overthrew Dr. Mosaddeq's rule] and other similar coups, the United States showed that it is willing to spend whatever is necessary to establish its new world order and diktat. These financial interventions concerning Iran, however, are made indirectly; in other words, the United States makes up the difference in the exchange rate of the Iranian rial and pays for it with its arrogant expenditures; and foreign exchange dealers and the fugitive Iranian subservient elements who are living in the United States are ready to invest billions of rials in order to be able to return to this country and once again take power. Everything will be clarified by the end of this year [21 March 1994]. Inflation and high prices will assume crisis proportions. In view of this, there are two alternatives. If the people are unable to deal with the crisis and complain about high prices and inflation, the government will either fall or will have to accept the unwritten resolution of the United States in this economic war. But if the people resist and declare, as they did at the outset of the revolution, that they will tolerate oil and electricity shortages and pledge allegiance to the martyrs, then it is the U.S. Government that will fall, because the crisis will be transferred to the United States, which will then disintegrate. The United States will, however, actually be harmed from two directions in the process: On the one hand, it is spending taxpayers' money in its futile attempt to overthrow the Iranian Government; and on the other, if it fails it will be unable to start a new propaganda wave because the United States is actually playing with U.S. public opinion now and is showing its people that it has been able plunge Iran's economy into crisis. If it succeeds in defeating Iran, no one in the United States will protest. But if Iran wins, then opposition inside the United States will definitely grow.
