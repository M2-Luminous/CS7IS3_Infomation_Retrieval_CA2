The defense minister arrived today at the Western Group of Russian Forces, where he will spend two days getting himself acquainted with the progress in the preparations for the farewell ceremony, and will discuss the details of the final stage of the event with the group's commanding officers. Pavel Grachev pointed out that "the only right decision" was made yesterday at the highest level concerning the farewell ceremony for the Russian forces in Berlin, with the Russian president and the German chancellor attending. "Now it is our turn to get down to business" -- the Russian defense minister said. Pavel Grachev said that the main political outcome of yesterday's Russian-German summit was that the leaders of two major European countries had confirmed their striving for closer cooperation not only in bilateral relations but also in ensuring security throughout the continent. Replying to a question on Russia's concept for relations within the framework of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, the defense minister said that thorough preparation work is continuing on the Russian concept. After it is agreed on by the Russian Federation Security Council and the Russian president, Pavel Grachev will present it to Brussels on 24 May. In connection with this he noted that it is a question not of an "alternative" document but only of Russia presenting its views as a great power on its role and place in the "Partnership for Peace" program. The defense minister recalled that Boris Yeltsin stated in Bonn yesterday that an agreement on this program was reached in principle and that readiness was expressed to join the programme after Russia's views are presented and it's role in this program defined.
