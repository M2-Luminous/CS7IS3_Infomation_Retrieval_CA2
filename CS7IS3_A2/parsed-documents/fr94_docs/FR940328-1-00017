FR940328-1-00017 FR940328-1-00007 A second California population of Parish's alkali grass was discovered in a remote area of Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County in 1992 (D. Charlton, Edwards Air Force Base, pers. comm., 1993). An estimated 50&hyph;400 plants occupy a total area of 50 sq m (500 sq ft) at an elevation of 700 m (2,300 ft). The associated halophytic vegetation includes Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda moquinii (inkweed), Calochortus striatus (alkali mariposa lily), Atriplex confertifolia (shadscale), and A. spinifera (spinescale) (Charlton, pers. comm., 1993). This population is located between the base of a stabilized dune on the east side of Rosamond Dry Lake and a small barren playa. Additional habitat probably existed where a road now borders the playa. Past land use is unknown. There are currently no activities in the area, but due to its roadside location, the site remains vulnerable to accidental disturbance. This population occurs in an active dune field and could be buried if the dunes shift or destabilize. The largest known population of Parish's alkali grass occurs at a privately owned spring in Grant County, New Mexico (Phillips and Phillips 1991). This spring has been captured and the outflow comes out of two pipes. Parish's alkali grass occurs in a low-lying seep area about 300 m (1,000 ft) downstream from the spring. This population occupies approximately 4 ha (10 ac) and varies from 200&hyph;5,000 plants, depending on environmental conditions. Associated riparian species include Distichlis stricta (saltgrass), Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton), yerba mansa, Scirpus olneyi (Olney bulrush), and Juncus balticus (wire rush). Misidentification of Parish's alkali grass by botanists has led to the inclusion of erroneous localities in the literature. A grass specimen collected in 1967 near Winkleman, Navajo County, Arizona, was later identified as Poa annua (annual blue grass). A specimen collected in 1982 from Clark County, Nevada (Wallace 1993), was later identified as Leptochloa filiformis (red sprangletop). A specimen collected in 1966 near the town of Red River, Taos County, New Mexico, was recently identified as annual blue grass (R. Sivinski, New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, pers. comm., 1993).
