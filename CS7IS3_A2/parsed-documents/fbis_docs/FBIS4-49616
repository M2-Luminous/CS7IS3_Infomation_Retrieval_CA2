On the afternoon of 29 April, after hearing the report submitted by the Yanan Prefectural CPC Committee and administrative office, Liu Ronghui said: The ongoing fiscal and tax reform touches on a wide range of endeavors. We should strive to meet the requirements of the reform, seek new tax funds in line with the new requirements, and properly handle the relationship between the state, the local enterprises, and the individuals, with the stress on the active disposition of new tax funds. State income tax comes mainly from state-owned and individual enterprises. We should pay close attention to the collection of the business tax from tertiary industrial undertakings and [words indistinct] tax. We should approach tax collection from a strategic prospective.

On one hand, we should upgrade and readjust tax collection and management, and on the other hand, [words indistinct].

In refining, we should coordinate with colleges and universities, large enterprises, and scientific research institutes. As for the issue of coal, when put on the market, coal should be priced appropriately. If we set too high a price, we will be unable to sell it, but if we set too low a price for coal, we will suffer losses in operation. We should energetically develop a diversified economy and [words indistinct].
