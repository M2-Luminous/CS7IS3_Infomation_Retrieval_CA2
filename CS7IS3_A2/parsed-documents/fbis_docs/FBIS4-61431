Ivan Shabunin, head of the Volgograd Oblast administration, ordered that the peasants be paid all the state's debts for last year's grain back in early April. The countryside was provided with fuel and lubricants for the entire campaign. At night on the field near the village of Novyy Rogachik, Gorodishchenskiy Rayon, the tractor drivers were harrowing the winter fallow. "They are hurrying to lock in the moisture," explained Nikolay Telitchenko, deputy director of the "Luch" agro-industrial limited partnership. "Put you hope in god, but don't slip up yourself. That is why people are working day and night. We shall do the harrowing and start the sowing...." That is the sowing technology. It was elaborated by scientists from the Volgograd agricultural institute and from the V.I. Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The point of this program is to obtain the forecasted grain harvest in any weather conditions. Even if not a single drop of rain falls all summer, which in the Lower Volga region happens quite often. That is why no one here ever pins any hope on the weather. "The present harvest was conceived the year before last," Nikolay Telitchenko explains the essence of dry arable farming. "It was then that the entire winter crop area was left to bare fallow." This year the "Luch" limited partnership obtained an average of 45 quintals of wheat [per hectare]. And that is on clay or at best on red soil. In addition on these arid steppes the grain that is grown is strong. In barter exchange between farms this grain is very advantageous: One tonne of elite wheat seed grain is equal to two tonnes of feed grain. Sometimes this home-grown barter can provide three or five tonnes of feed grain. That is how "Luch" survives. No one here is groaning, panicking, or intending to go on strike. There are no stoppages, everyone is working. And that even with our ubiquitous nonpayments. [Cherkasov report ends] Specialists' Opinion Today the spring field work is at its height and in the opinion of Ivan Gridasov, chief of the Ministry of Agriculture plant growing administration, it is ahead of last year's schedule. Over 3 million hectares have already been sown to spring crops. Unfortunately, the state of the winter crops is considerably worse. About 3 million hectares will have to be resown -- it is a long time since that happened and it is connected primarily with the weather. In the fall they sowed without rain, into the dry soil, and in addition frost struck immediately. As a result 1 million hectares have already been resown and last year this figure was only 100,000 hectares. The saddest thing is that this affects primarily winter wheat and as a result there is a reduction in the gross harvest of this crop. In the opinion of Ministry of Agriculture experts losses will be about 10 million tonnes. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that this year at least half the amount of fertilizers and plant protection agents will be applied to the soil. Moreover sown areas are being reduced by approximately 4.5 million hectares, primarily because of the lack of land in suburban regions. Of these hectares half are usually sown to grain crops. Cottages are now growing up in their place.
