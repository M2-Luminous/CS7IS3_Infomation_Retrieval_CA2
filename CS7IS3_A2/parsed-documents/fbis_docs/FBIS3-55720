Pavel Borodin from the administrative office of the president told the lawmakers, who are mostly regional leaders, that their chamber will get 500 office cars, a special polyclinic, country houses, as well as four-room apartments in Moscow. Some of the lawmakers opposed the privileges qualifying them as "impermissible luxury". But Borodin said that the accomodation privileges may be expected only in the middle of 1995 when a corresponding complex of buildings with a total space of 360,000 sq metres is to be constructed. Besides, it will be the parliament which is to adopt the final decision on the issue, he said. For the time being, lawmakers will have to tolerate some inconveniences. They will live in hotels, share one office for two people, work in a poorely prepared conference hall which has dark walls and unpleasantly looking chairs. But Borodin promised fast improvements, including an office for each lawmaker.
