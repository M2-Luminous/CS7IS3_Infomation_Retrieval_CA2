The reason -- as was repeatedly and continuously commented by this daily -- was that the foreign debts accumulated by the Indonesian Government and the private sector have reached nearly $100 billion. In fact, the overall current amount of foreign debt, as what is termed as outstanding debt [preceding two words in English], is around $90 billion. A psychological effect will be felt the moment Indonesia's foreign debts hit the $100 billion mark, that is, the donor countries would be hesitant and would reconsider extending any attractive loans to the debtor countries [two preceding words in English]. Thus, it was clear that ever since the implementation of the first Long-Term Development Program, the debate on the foreign debt issue has proved to be futile. The foreign loans had supplemented the development programs. This daily has since had a "correct" conviction with regard to the government's New Order policy, which is to continuously acquire foreign loans for development programs. Therefore, this daily could should not be branded as being "anti-development". However, development is part of the developing nations' physical struggle in their effort to ensure the existence and perpetuation of their political life, economy, and culture after the colonialists were ushered out. If this daily had proposed from the beginning that national development was undertaken based on a principle of "self-reliance" and not through being dependent on any nation or international body, then such a proposal would have been made out of concern and love for the people and the country. When Indonesia's "new" loan stood at around $21.76 billion in 1983, most people in developing nations feared that their foreign debts would spiral drastically within the next decade. In accordance with the World Bank's monetary list, the 1984-85 "World Debt Table" [preceding three words in English] projected the increase of foreign debt incurred by the developing nations as "serious" and running up to billions of dollars in 1983. The developing nations referred to are as follows: India with foreign debts totaling $24.429 billion; Indonesia with $21.768 billion; South Korea with $23.07 billion; Argentina with $24.592 billion; Brazil with $58.068 billion; and Mexico with $66.731 billion. It is not only this daily but almost every other Indonesian newspaper expressed its concern that if the developing countries' foreign debts were left unchecked, then those countries with the most serious foreign debt problems would be ensnared in what is termed a debt trap [preceding two words in English]. Why then the cause for concern? At that time, rhetoric such as "the foreign loans will not impose any burden on the people" and many other statements was heard from Professor Wijoyo Nitisastro, who held that foreign loans were a form of assistance, considering them important for Indonesia's successful implementation of national development programs and so on. The majority of the people believed that the foreign debts would finally be "easily" settled through income derived from petroleum exports. In fact, such a consideration never even materialized. The petroleum prices in international markets plummetted to $13 per barrel and the country's foreign debts spiraled upward, thus causing the financial reserves from petroleum sources into a more serious situation. In this daily's 28 March 1994 editorial titled "The G-15 Summit Should Solve The Foreign Debt Crisis," it was clear that the developing nations' foreign debts had doubled and tripled compared with the amount incurred during the previous decade and a "debt crisis" was imminent. In such a situation, the developing nations' income derived from their exports would be absolutely insufficient to even repay the principal borrowed, let alone the interest. Also, last year when Indonesia's foreign loans reached $78 billion (as stated in THE STRAIITS TIMES 2 July 1993), the head of CGI (Consultative Group for Indonesia) [preceding expansion in English] Guatama Kaji, stated that with Indonesia's six percent growth rate, there was no pressing need for the country to acquire a $5.11 billion loan. In 1992, Indonesia's foreign loans approved by the World Bank totaled about $4.9 billion. At that time, the dollar appreciated sharply against the yen. This would increase Indonesia's foreign debts -- without even receiving any yen. It was very clear that the policy employed by economists from the Berkeley Group with regard to the acquisition of foreign loans during the First Long-Term Development Program was one of a "hasty" nature, thus reflecting an inability to contain the numerous financial leakages. Indonesia would not have been cornered into, as what is termed as, a debt trap if ever a glimmer of patriotism ever existed within the hearts of this group of people. The country's financial situation has worsened, but do not let the people bear the "consequences."
