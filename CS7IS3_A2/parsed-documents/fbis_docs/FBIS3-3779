Chairman Murray Hosking, speaking during a meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, noted that officials in Taiwan are taking wildlife conservation very seriously as evidenced by amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which significantly increase fines and penalties for violators and establishment of a wildlife protection unit. He added that CITES was satisfied with the amendments to the law, but reserved final comment until an English-language translation of the bill is given to the CITES Secretariat. Hosking also said CITES was satisfied that Taiwan is working to consolidate government stockpiles of endangered species products and has established a database for the registration, marking and sizing of confiscated stocks of rhino horn or tiger parts.
