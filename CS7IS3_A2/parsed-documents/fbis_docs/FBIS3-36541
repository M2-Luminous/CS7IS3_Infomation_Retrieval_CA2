Gaydar pointed out that continuous debates in parliament were caused by a draft resolution "On Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation." The draft resolution on amnesty was submitted to parliament for approval by President Boris Yeltsin. The Duma decided to return the draft resolution to parliamentary commissions and committees for thorough consideration since it caused a different reaction at a session of the Duma council. Explaining the position of the Russia's Choice bloc on this matter, Gaydar said that "we asked the president not to submit the resolution to the Duma, on the grounds of the existing criminal situation in the country and inadequate interpretation of the problem." The Duma council also discussed the appointment of the Duma chief of staff. According to Gaydar, chairman of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Ivan Rybkin, was suggested to select one of three candidates planned to be given the post and express his opinion at a session of the Duma council. Gaydar did not say exactly, but merely mentioned that the Russia's Choice bloc supports the candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora. However, Podoprigora cannot be relieved of his duties yet as chairman of the Federation Council's Committee for International Affairs, which is regarded by many deputies as a serious obstacle preventing his appointment to the post. According to Gaydar, the Duma council did not discuss recent developments in former Yugoslavia. However, he added that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is expected to make a statement on this problem at a plenary session of the Duma on Wednesday.
