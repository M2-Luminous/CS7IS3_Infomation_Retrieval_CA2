This is how Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski summed up the discussion on Partnership for Peace at Monday's government meeting, which preceded the Prague summit of the Visegrad Group. Olechowski said that the Council of Ministers "welcomed the Partnership for Peace as an interesting initiative that goes in the right direction" and authorized the prime minister to support this program. The government assessed the decisions that are expected from the Brussels NATO summit (reassurance concerning the U.S. presence in Europe, the opening of NATO to new members in an evolutionary process, Partnership for Peace, and a definition of new relations between NATO and the Western European Union) as favorable from the point of view of Poland's interests, but it has reservations because they are not specific enough. President Lech Walesa, who took part in the meeting, left the Office of the Council of Ministers without making any comment to the press.
