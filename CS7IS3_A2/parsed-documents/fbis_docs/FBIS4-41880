The Russian battalions have embarked on a peacekeeping action in the conflict zone. Its progress and certain aspects of Russian-Georgian military cooperation are the subject of your TRUD correspondent's interview with Major General Vasiliy Belchenko, assistant commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcausasus. "Two battalions have been assigned from the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus to carry out this mission," Vasiliy Fedorovich says. "They will be deployed along the east bank of the Inguri river, where seven checkpoints and the same number of observation posts will be set up. Overall leadership of the peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will be exercised by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. The mission, which is to be fulfilled by some 3,000 officers and men, will involve not only disengagement, but also the withdrawal and storage of heavy equipment and artillery and the protection of facilities and main railroads and highways with a view to safeguarding the passage of refugees and humanitarian freight. "Security guarantees have been given at the highest state level. Railroad communication will be restored very soon, as Vladislav Ardzinba has said. The bridge over the Inguri by which the refugees will return will also begin to function in the next few days. So everything is ready for the process to begin." [Sarishvili] Russia is taking on a grave and responsible mission. What could hamper its implementation? [Belchenko] For a long time it was impossible to find points of contact for a reconciliation. We recognize the full complexity of the role we have assumed. But the Georgian and Abkhazian sides should also take a very responsible attitude to the political settlement process. Unfortunately there have been many examples of local resistance leading to the disruption of peacekeeping efforts. But in this case there is the firm hope that, on condition that there is support from the sides, the action will achieve its goal and the war, which everyone is sick and tired of, will become a thing of the past. We wish wholeheartedly for this, because the road through Abkhazia is a vital road for Russia too. The paralysis of railroad communications is ruinous for all of us. [Sarishvili] Let us concentrate on some of the details. It was reported on television that total mine clearance is not possible today. What is this -- a display of distrust? [Belchenko] No, and again no. The point is that the troops are tasked with going in within a very tight time scale. Therefore mine clearance will take place first and foremost in the sectors where checkpoints are to be established and people are to be stationed. The rest of the territory will be cleared later. [Sarishvili] What reaction is envisaged in the event of armed provocations? [Belchenko] If a battalion carrying the peacekeeping flag comes under fire, it will return fire for effect. Russia is sending its soldiers not to be killed, but to help establish peace. [Sarishvili] And if Georgian-Abkhazian fighting flares up again? [Belchenko] We are under orders to suppress any seats of fire, after a warning. But I do not think it will come to that, since the heavy equipment and artillery is to be withdrawn to a safe distance. [Sarishvili] Have the peacekeepers had special training? [Belchenko] At all events, they are not Spetsnaz [special-purpose forces]. They are regular servicemen, only rather better "welded together" and drilled. [Sarishvili] How will disputes over houses unlawfully seized by mercenaries in Abkhazia be resolved? [Belchenko] That question is not within my competence. But on the basis of the experience of the Tskhinvali region it can be assumed that the work of restoring justice and sorting out all the problems will be carried out by mixed commissions under the protection of the peacekeeping forces. [Sarishvili] Do you detect any signs of a thaw in Georgian-Abkhazian relations? [Belchenko] Judging by Shevardnadze's and Ardzinba's remarks, there is a sense that contact is becoming a reality. This is also perceptible in people's mood. [Sarishvili] Vasiliy Fedorovich, the question of Russian military bases in Georgia is also on the agenda. On what principle will they operate? [Belchenko] Most likely on the basis of compensation. For instance, as we reduce the numerical strength of our units we will hand over to Georgia the housing stock, which can be regarded as a rent in exchange for the use of the territory. [Sarishvili] A kind of military barter system? [Belchenko] You could call it that. But the military camps are just one possible illustration. [Sarishvili] What do you see as the points of contact of interests in military cooperation between Georgia and Russia? [Belchenko] First and foremost, mutual membership of a system of collective security, which gives us a basis for mutually beneficial cooperation. Rather than each racking your brains to invent the bicycle, it is better to make use of the rich experience of the former Soviet Army. Talk of the "enslavement" of Georgia and the "imperial ambitions" of Russia seems to me to be idle or provocative. Colonel General Fedor Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcausasus, invites both the Georgian head of state and the defense minister to attend any of our measures. It is in our interests to see Georgia a strong and prosperous state. Military cooperation will open up broad economic prospects. Why lose, for instance, the Batumi uniform factory with its trained personnel and production base? Why waste money on transporting goods unnecessarily when everything is already available? The same could be said of food and raw materials bases. In conclusion I would like to mention the thoughtful and considered stance of head of state E. Shevardnadze. Today he has chosen, I believe, the only correct path -- that of rapprochement, which I am sure will be to everyone's benefit.
