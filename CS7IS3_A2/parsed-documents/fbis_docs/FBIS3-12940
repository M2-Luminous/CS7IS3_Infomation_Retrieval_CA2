Describing Islamabad raising the human rights issue in Kashmir at Geneva as totally uncalled for, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that Pakistan has no locus standi other than that of an aggressor. The prime minister said the government will carry out the mandate of Parliament expressed in its unanimous resolution in letter and spirit. He was replying in the Lok Sabha today to the marathon debate on the motion of thanks to the president's address. The house later adopted the motion by a voice vote after rejecting all opposition amendments. Mr. Rao regretted that the basic question on Kashmir has taken a back seat and peripheral issues like human rights have come to the fore. He said the Parliament resolution reflects the determination of the nation to protect the territorial integrity of the country, but the house should go into further details so that the world must know what our Parliament thinks about the issue. Amid thumping of desks by the treasury benches, Mr. Rao said that the export of terrorism by Pakistan into the Kashmir valley should stop and the government is determined to do it. He said the development efforts in the valley will be intensified and details will be given to the house later. The prime minister dealt with wide-ranging issues including Ayodhya, Dunkel draft, economy, rural development, and reorganization of states. On Ayodhya, he appealed to the members not to be agitated any more as the Supreme Court is seized of the matter. He said once the apex court gives its opinion, action will be initiated taking the house into confidence. On reorganization of states, the prime minister said he is not in favor of opening the Pandora box. However, specific schemes have to be initiated to remove imbalance in development. Referring to the situation in the northeast, he said the overall situation has improved and special attention is being paid for the development of the region. He pointed out that for the first time in 40 years, Mizoram has representation in the council of ministers. Turning to the Dunkel draft, the prime minister declared that the farmers' interest will not be compromised and on the other hand the agriculture exports will get a boost.
