Japan may be forced to import rice for the second straight year in 1995 if the 1994 domestic harvest is also affected by bad weather. According to the outline of an annual production-supply plan to be formulated at the end of March, the ministry will have no rice left in stock to carry over to the new rice year. "Such a situation is unavoidable after last year's extremely poor harvest," a ministry official said. The plan calls for the ministry to ease the rice production adjustment this year to ensure a government stock of 660,000 tons at the end of October 1995. The program will have to be overhauled if rice production is poor again this year. A rice production target of 10.58 million tons was set for 1994, an increase of 320,000 tons over the previous year's original target. To achieve this goal, rice acreage reduction this year will be limited to 600,000 hectares rather than the 676,000 hectares originally planned, and additional 32,000 hectares of land will be restored to production to bring the total restored acreage for rice production to 108,000 hectares. The ministry estimates domestic rice demand of 9.92 million tons for the year ending October 1995, down from the preceding year by approximately 30,000 to 130,000 tons. Japan will also import an estimated 379,000 tons of rice in 1995 in accordance with an agreement reached under the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
