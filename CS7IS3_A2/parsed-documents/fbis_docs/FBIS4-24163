He talked about the institution of the president, the pirate radio which can currently be heard on the national territory, security, the economy, etc. I suggest you listen to the statement he issued before allowing journalists to ask their questions. Before issuing his statement, the interim head of state said the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. Christian Sendegeya, had tendered his resignation to him. Here is President Ntibantunganya. [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] [Words indistinct] April 1994, Burundi is once again at a political impasse without a head of state with all the powers invested in him by the Constitution. This followed the untimely death of President Ntaryamira. Since 12 April, there has been an interim presidency which ends on 12 July. Many of you are asking yourselves several questions related to the future of this beautiful country which everyone cherishes, but which causes concern. One question lingers on the lips of everyone: When will we have a head of state with all the powers endowed to him by the Constitution. This question is even more pressing when one sees what is happening around us, first in our country, and then in the neighboring country of Rwanda. In the light of this, people are very worried. [passage omitted] Besides the serious, shameful and reprehensible interethnic massacres, political score-settling, and all sorts of crimes which have been committed, the country today is on the verge of an abyss. Distrust among citizens, notably with reference to their political and ethnic affiliations, has reached its climax. [passage omitted] For the last few days, pirate radio broadcasts have been heard in some parts of the country. It broadcasts messages which are contrary to peaceful co-existence between the various groups in the country, notably ethnic and professional groups. The government would like the population to note that the radio is functioning in violation of the country's laws. The government is determined to do everything to cripple it. [passage omitted] Peace must be everyone's priority. That is why the government has been working hard all week to accelerate and finalize, through consultations between the various political and social partners, the process of establishing the institution of the president of the Republic with all the powers invested in him by the Constitution. This is an extremely strategic objective for peace and security in the country. That is why all the national political partners must combine efforts, show proof of good will, and be sensitive to the call issued to them by the Burundi people who are concerned about what they consider to be stagnation of this process.
