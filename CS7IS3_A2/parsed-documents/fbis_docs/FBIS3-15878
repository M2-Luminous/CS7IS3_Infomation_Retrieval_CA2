First, Chechnya must stop accusing Moscow of imperial ambitions and, second, the talks must be guided by the agreement on the divisions of powers already signed between Russia and Tatarstan, an informed source in the Russian president's staff told Interfax on Thursday. He said that Groznyy has yet to respond. He also noted that the Russian leadership was not planning to hold parallel talks with the Groznyy officials and the Chechen opposition. In experts' estimate, parallel talks could strengthen the position of Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is currently staying in Chechnya and who is the shadow leader of the opposition. Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was recently released from Lefortovo prison, currently lives in his native village of Tolstoy Yurt near Groznyy. To quote this source, talks will begin after Chechnya accepts Moscow's terms. The Russian delegation will be led by Chief of the president's Staff Sergey Filatov and the Chechen delegation by Chechen State Secretary Aslanbek Akbulatov.
