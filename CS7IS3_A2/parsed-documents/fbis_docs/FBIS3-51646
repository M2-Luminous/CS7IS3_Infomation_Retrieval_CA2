However, there are right now very few deputies at the Chamber. Edner Jean reports live: Parliament is basically waiting. In the Legislative Palace, the deputies are still expected; they were due to respond to the invitation of the president of the Chamber for this special meeting scheduled today. Right now, there are very few deputies present. The president is here. Only five or six legislators are here. There is also a waiting outside, by those demonstrators who came on 20 January to the parliament to submit the resolution of the national congress forming a government of public security. They came back this morning. They are demanding that the Parliament consider the matter right now. They demand that the government be seated as soon as possible at the National Palace. Right now, they are calm outside and are waiting until later to start demonstrating. It should be recalled that on 20 January, Deputy Monde, president of the Lower Chamber, stated to the office of the Congress for the National Salvation that he would not act under pressure. However, a few hours later, President Monde issued a note convening the legislators to a special meeting. It is known that ordinarily on Fridays, most of the deputies do not work.
