HCR and radical opposition member Christian Badibangi is unhappy about this gesture, and he spoke to Jean-Claude Medome. [Begin recording] [Badibangi] It is just a gesture for the outside world. It is a way of justifying the overture, as Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo seems to be saying. However, for USOR, we know that Kengo Wa Dondo's election is entirely illegal. USOR and Allies have already taken the stand of telling the whole national and international community that any existing or supposedly existing government does not concern the opposition especially as the government or the prime minister must be presented by a group other than the one belonging to the head of state. [Medome] Some Zairians could nonetheless accuse you of going rather too far. Do you not think that it is about time you collaborated with Kengo Wa Dondo to enable Zaire to get down to work? [Badibangi] We want to establish the rule of law and judicial security in our country. We must ensure the security of everybody. Even the holding of future elections will depend on this. [Medome] Why not accept this overture from Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo, that is, to form a government and prepare the elections together? [Badibangi] Indeed, the problem seems simple when it is presented at the tail end. To believe that we simply have to allow him to form his government with the radical opposition without knowing the actual motive of Kengo Wa Dondo, who it would seem has assumed the premiership through a personal and unilateral move, and to commit the entire radical opposition in this manner, I think, is to take the wrong tack. [Medome] What do you have to say to those who feel that USOR is promoting the interests of one man, Etienne Tshisekedi, to the detriment of the nation's supreme interest? [Badibangi] No, I do not think that's true; we believe that there is a popular will. We believe that our people decided [words indistinct] of the Republic by the National Sovereign Conference and that this prime minister-elect has not been able to carry out his functions. Why this injustice especially as he has not been able to exercise the mandate entrusted to him by the people for two years. That is the reality. [end recording]
