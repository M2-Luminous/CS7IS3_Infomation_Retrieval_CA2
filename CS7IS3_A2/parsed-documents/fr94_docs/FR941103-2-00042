FR941103-2-00042 FR941103-2-00029 Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Name of Firm: Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. Date of Filing: July 20, 1993. Case Number: LEF&hyph;0074. On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to distribute the funds which Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has remitted $100,697.87 pursuant to the order, to which $3,919.39 in interest has accrued as of September 30, 1994. In accordance with the provisions of procedural regulations at 10 C.F.R. part 205, subpart V (subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. I. Background During the period relevant to this proceeding, Beacon Bay operated 11 retail service stations in Southern California. The ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Beacon Bay on July 29, 1980. The PRO alleged that, during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The DOE amended the PRO and issued a Final Remedial Order on June 21, 1982, after considering Beacon Bay's objections to the PRO. Beacon Bay Enterprises, 9 DOE ¶83,039 (1982). On August 23, 1982, Beacon Bay appealed the DOE's Final Remedial Order to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC issued a Proposed Order on November 15, 1982, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 21 FERC ¶62,295 (1982), and an Order on January 25, 1983, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 22 FERC ¶61,059 (1983), both of which affirmed and adopted the DOE's Final Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has since remitted $100,697.87 to the DOE, in compliance with the Remedial Order (the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund), which is now available for distribution through Subpart V. II. Jurisdiction and Authority The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan for the distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.; Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981) (Vickers). We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute this fund. III. Refund Procedures On August 19, 1994, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PD&O) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. That PD&O was published in the Federal Register , and a 30-day period was provided for the submission of comments regarding our proposed refund plan. See 59 FR 44720) (August 30, 1994). More than 30 days have elapsed and the OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures for the distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. Consequently, the procedures will be adopted as proposed. We will implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order Fund. In the first stage, purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order may submit Applications for Refund. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally with fall into the following categories: (i) End-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as cooperatives; and (iii) resellers and retailers. A. First-Stage Refund Procedures In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order_August 1979 through March 1980. If the gasoline was not purchased directly from Beacon Bay, the claimant must establish that the gasoline originated with Beacon Bay. Additionally, a reseller or retailer claimant, except one who chooses to utilize the injury presumptions set forth below, will be required to make a detailed showing that it was injured by Beacon Bay's overcharges. This showing will generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller or retailer claimant will be required to show that it had ``banks'' of unrecouped increased product costs in excess of the refund claimed. 1 Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficient to establish injury, a claimant must also provide evidence that market conditions precluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs associated with the overcharges. See Vaqueros Energy Corp./Hutches Oil Co., Inc., 11 DOE ¶85,070 at 88,105 (1983). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration that a firm suffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchases from Beacon Bay. See National Helium Co./Atlantic Richfield Corp ., 11 DOE ¶85,257 (1984), aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. DOE , 618 F. Supp. 1199 (D. Del. 1985). 1 Claimants who have previously relied upon their banked costs in order to obtain refunds in other special refund proceedings should subtract those refunds from any cost banks submitted in this refund proceeding. See Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc., 16 DOE ¶85,090, at 88,179 (1987). Additionally, a claimant attempting to show injury may not receive a refund for any month in which it has a negative accumulated cost bank (for gasoline) or for any prior month. See Standard Oil Co., (Indiana)/Suburban Propane Gas Corp./Sturdy Oil Co., 15 DOE ¶85,187 (1986). If a claimant no longer has records showing its banked costs, the OHA may use its discretion to permit the claimant to approximate those cost banks. See, e.g., Gulf Oil Corp./Sturdy Oil Co., 15 DOE ¶85,187 (1986). Our experience also indicated that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. See, e.g., Marathon Petroleum Co ., 14 DOE ¶85,269 (1986) ( Marathon ). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R. §205.282 (e). Accordingly, we will adopt the presumptions set forth below.
