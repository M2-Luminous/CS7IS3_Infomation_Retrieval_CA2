The Publication in SHUKAN BUNSHUN Is Based on a Hoax. There Will Be No Official Investigation in the General Staff"] [Text] The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN recently printed excerpts from a top secret memorandum by the Center for Military Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff, "The Russian Federation Military Policy in the Asia-Pacific Region Under the New Military Political Conditions." The document makes clear that at the end of the 80's Russia was actively assisting the DPRK in creating a nuclear missile capability, and as a result, now Pyongyang has several nuclear warheads, as well as a considerable number of medium-range missiles. The document is dated 22 October 1993 and was to be presented first to General Grachev and then to President Yeltsin. The Japanese weekly obtained the memorandum from an anonymous officer at the General Staff who also commented on it. On 27 January IZVESTIYA printed an account of the SHUKAN BUNSHUN publication written by its Tokyo correspondent Sergey Agafonov, who added his comment that "there are no doubts about the authenticity of the document" because it is printed on a Defense Ministry form and has registration number 001 CM-137. General Staff chief General Mikhail Kolesnikov told SEGODNYA's correspondent that "there has never been a Center for Military Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff." The General Staff has a center for military strategic studies but its functions do not include analysis of the military, military-technical or military- industrial potential of foreign countries. That is the jurisdiction of various structures in the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU GSh). The relevant Russian bodies are surely watching the developments on the Korean Peninsula. General Kolesnikov said that "according to information in our possession, today there are no nuclear weapons in the DPRK. Nor are there any medium-range missiles. The creation of nuclear missiles in the DPRK any time soon is unlikely." The memorandum published in SHUKAN BUNSHUN, which says something quite different, was indeed printed on a Defense Ministry form, but this kind of form is usually used to respond to citizens' letters, not to report to the defense minister or the president. The index showing that the document is "top secret" (not "absolutely secret," as is stated in Agafonov's article) has been placed other than where it should be. The serial number CM-137 stamped on the memorandum (apparently the main evidence of its authenticity) belongs not to the Defense Ministry but to the former USSR Council of Ministers and naturally has not been used in correspondence since 1991. After an additional in-house inquiry the General Staff made sure that such a document has not been worked out in any of its structures and therefore it was not reported to General Grachev or President Yeltsin. The General Staff chief is not going to conduct any official investigation into the origin of this hoax. General Kolesnikov expressed his surprise at the unscrupulousness of SHUKAN BUNSHUN and IZVESTIYA. True, many Moscow journalists (and not only journalists) know that representatives of the Japanese press (unlike, for instance, the Americans) willingly and generously pay for exclusive information and have a special liking for various "documents." Which is exploited by our "specialists."
