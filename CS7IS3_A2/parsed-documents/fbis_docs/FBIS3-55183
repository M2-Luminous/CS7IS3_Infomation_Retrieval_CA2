According to a well-informed source, Russia's Choice, Communists, Agrarians and Liberal Democrats are ready to agree on a speaker to represent one of the smaller groups -- Yavlinskiy's bloc or the Women of Russia -- on condition that his or her four deputies represent their four biggest groups. Communists favor a strong, not decorative speaker as well as the formation of a leading body such as a council of the Duma. According to the source, the four biggest groups are also discussing the formation of parliamentary committees. Russia's Choice is claiming leading posts in two or three (economic) committees, Liberal Democrats in the international affairs committee, Communists in defense and security committees, agrarians in committees on agriculture, constitutional legislation and legal reform. A former member of the Supreme Soviet and a representative of the Agrarian Party Vladimir Isakov intends to head the latter committee.
