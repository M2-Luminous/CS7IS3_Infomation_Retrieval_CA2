The world's largest steelmaker said the plant, comprising a continuous steel annealing unit and two tin plate producing lines, is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997. It will be the first time for the Chinese steelmaker to engage in the production of tin, company officials said. Consumption of tin plate has been increasing rapidly in China along with rising sales of canned food and beverages, they said. Baoshan is undergoing the third phase of expansion to boost its annual crude steel production capacity to 10 million tons by the year 2000 from the present 7.2 million tons, they said. The officials said the Japanese firm will provide engineering and operational training for Chinese employees at the plant. The Japanese steelmaker has been providing technical assistance for the Baoshan plant since its construction began in 1987.
