Our sources report from Tehran that government agents secretly took aerial photographs from the rooftops of Tehran. After seeing these photographs the leaders of the Islamic Republic realized that there are too many of these antennas for the police to be able to collect them. Prior to this, the chief of the Police Antismuggling Office threatened owners and importers of this type of antenna "in whatever rank or position they may hold" with "legal" penalties. The reactions, however, especially from the Majles, were very instructive for the minister of the interior. One deputy accused him of "speaking rashly" and another, noting the 12 years of fruitless struggle against videos, said efforts to collect satellite dishes will not serve the goal of "fighting the cultural invasion." Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000 throughout Iran. In an interview with the publication TEHRAN TIMES, 'Ali Mohammad Basharati retracted his harsh words about collecting the satellite dishes and said: Antennas that receive satellite television programming are not illegal, but the government has decided to discuss them in the next month. Therefore, the use of satellite dishes must be approved by the government. Basharati discussed the things the press wrote about his remarks on collecting these antennas. He added: A commission to include representatives of the Islamic Propaganda Organization and the minister of culture and guidance will set the laws and regulations on the use of satellite dishes. In this interview, Basharati also announced: Until the Council of Ministers makes its announcement and a statement is issued by the Ministry of the Interior on this matter, no one has the right to collect satellite dishes. If someone goes to homes for this purpose, the home owner should report him to the nearest police station. The TEHRAN TIMES wrote that after the minister of the interior announced his opinion that satellite dishes were illegal, it created the worry that there might be trouble for those who use these antennas. The minister of the interior said: The subject of satellite dishes is being studied. It will take a month to get a conclusion from the research that will lead to a decision. The Council of Ministers will announce the final decision. The TEHRAN TIMES writes: Satellite dishes have been installed extensively on the rooftops in Tehran in the last two years. The minister of the interior said: The Council of Ministers is making a decision on the laws and regulations for the use of satellite dishes, and the Ministry of the Interior will have the responsibility of enforcing them. Last week 'Ali Mohammad Basharati said: No law is needed to collect satellite dishes. The Ministry of the Interior views them as a form of corruption, like other kinds of pollution and the cultural invasion. Therefore, it will not wait for a law to be approved to collect them from the rooftops. After Basharati's remarks, and in view of the past experiences with assaults on homes by thugs and ruffians, the trouble the revolution guards and committees caused with their intrusions into the homes of Iranians since the beginning of the revolution and the repeated thefts and killings committed by people bearing membership cards in revolution groups, Rafsanjani and others asked him to retract what he said. Following the minister of the interior's remarks about collecting the satellite dishes, in some cities, including Shiraz, revolution guards and irresponsible individuals went into homes on their own initiative and took the antennas. The next day the confiscated antennas turned up in the markets and were sold at lower prices to others. After the statements by the minister of the interior on his own initiative about the satellite dishes, and before he retracted his remarks, the general manager of the Police Antismuggling Office announced at a press conference that satellite dishes are a smuggled item and that their owners would be dealt with as smugglers. He said a project called the "Kusar Project" was being prepared under which "an extensive campaign against various kinds of smuggling deals" will begin. He said since goods that are not listed on the nation's import and export guidelines are considered smuggled goods, satellite dishes, which mostly come into Iran through the northern ports of the Persian Gulf, are subject to this prohibition. "Satellite dishes throughout the country are considered smuggled goods and will be confiscated." Citing the minister of the interior, he also said: "The minister of the interior, in comments published in the newspapers...said there has been no change in his views as minister of the interior and those of the government concerning the collection of satellite dishes." However, after the minister of the interior did a 180-degree turn in less than 48 hours, Morteza Nabavi, an influential Majles deputy and editor of the newspaper RESALAT, said in a Majles speech that although viewing some of the programming broadcast by satellite has "bad effects," a "reactionary approach" should not be taken. He called upon the minister of the interior to "speak more deliberately." Addressing the minister of the interior, he said if there is "order with regard to the satellite dishes, there will be no need to collect them." It would have been better, before announcing the decision to collect the satellite dishes, if the minister of the interior had "weighed all the aspects of the matter." Hojjat ol-Eslam Zadsar, Majles deputy from Jiroft, said concerning this: "Collecting these receivers will solve nothing. It will only have minor short-term effects." He added: "The foreign invasion must not instill fear," because "the religious beliefs of the people will prevent them from dominating us." It is still not clear whether the minister of the interior said these things on his own initiative or after discussing the matter with the Council of Ministers. On the other hand, the Majles has also gotten into the fray. It has announced that a law is needed to collect satellite dishes. Therefore, the law must be approved by the Majles and a government edict on this matter is not sufficient. KEYHAN's sources report from Tehran that after the remarks by the minister of the interior, the government ordered that precise aerial photographs be taken from the rooftops of Tehran. These photographs showed that there are too many of these antennas for the police to be able to collect them. Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000 throughout Iran.
