Always pleasant to talk to, rationally interpreting political events, he shook my hand at the door to his office, saying "Good afternoon" in Croatian. I replied in Hungarian. This was the first long interview with him, and I felt that I should start from what has already become history. However, I skipped the first nine centuries of Croatian-Hungarian history. [Uranic] Minister Jeszenszky, how would you assess the relations between Croatia and Hungary from the fall of communism to the present day? [Jeszenszky] I think that every Croat and every Hungarian realize that these two nations and two countries have for centuries lived within one state and that this life together was not at all bad. It was only in the 19th century that there were serious controversies and tensions between the two nations. The relations were good -- whether we discuss the present, the time of the former Yugoslavia, or the time of the Croato-Hungarian Compromise of 1868, which was also not bad. Naturally, we could discuss its implementation. However, if I am to talk about how relations between the two countries have developed since 1990, then I would like to say with the utmost sincerity that I am very happy that another "compromise" has been made between Croatia and Hungary. This one was much easier to make, since we are living in two states. Hungary never wanted to meddle in the relations among the peoples of Yugoslavia, but it also respected the will of the Croatian people when we realized that the Croats saw their future in an independent state. After Croatia established peace following a very difficult war, which peace is, unfortunately, still very fragile, political relations were established between Hungary and Croatia at all levels. Much has been done in the areas of economy and culture. Unfortunately, economic cooperation is not as strong and intensive as we would like it to be, which the war is largely responsible for. For instance, you see that Hungarian tourists have understood this unusual situation of the war being waged in certain parts of Croatia, while it is possible to swim in the Adriatic in peace, so there have been many on holiday in Croatia in the past two years. I think that, generally speaking, permanent and solid foundations have been laid for good relations between the two countries and two nations in this period. [Uranic] In your opinion, how does the war in the Balkans influence Hungary, and how does it influence the political situation in this part of Europe? Do you agree with those who say that "Europe is dying in the Balkans"? [Jeszenszky] The war in the Balkans is undoubtedly a burden to primarily the Balkan peoples, the peoples of the former Yugoslavia. The neighboring countries also feel the consequences of the war -- naturally not the way the people of Vukovar or Sarajevo have felt it, but Hungary does indeed feel the consequences of the war. We do not see this war as an American who sees it all on TV and thinks: "This is far away. What is happening there is terrible, but the main thing is that it is not here." This war is close to us, and the Hungarian people have shown their solidarity with those who suffer by accepting refugees and through the significant aid offered by the members of the Maltese order and many others. Unfortunately, the war in the Balkans does indeed have a very bad influence on the entire region. I am not only talking about these direct consequences. Looking from a distance, the war is here, several hundred kilometers away, in this part of Europe. More tourists and more investors from the United States would have come to Hungary if this war had been over. I will not say that this war could stimulate others to fight wars, but, unfortunately, it indicates that the use of force and occupation of territory have so far yielded results. It is, therefore, a very bad example to the entire world, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. I personally think that the events that have occurred there are a hard blow to the civilization of Christian Europe. We know that war conventions have been in power since the last century and that they were mostly observed even then. Let me quote from a work of a great Hungarian writer Sandor Maroy, who said: "To be European means to believe that reason and solidarity are stronger than the tyranny of low passions." Unforfunately, we have seen that this basic principle of Europeanism was not actualized here. Moreover, I think that it should be in the interest of all Europeans, especially those who have been inflicted by the war, to stop the conflict and that it is their obligation. [Uranic] Do you think that the UN action, which has so far been unsuccessful, indicates the international community's weakness? Should the keeping of peace be replaced by the imposing of peace or, more precisely, military intervention? [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, we can conclude that the international community has not been able to deal not only with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the entire Balkan crisis. It soon threw the ball in the European Union's court. After the mediation of the three failed, as did the very reasonable Carrington plan, the issue fell into the hands of the United Nations, and since then, I have seen much willingness to deal with the issue. The UN countries are providing considerable amounts of aid for the people who are suffering. The fact is that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the war, but it should also be said that several dozen Europeans from the countries participating in UN missions have also lost their lives. Thus, they became a part of the suffering, too. I would, therefore, not say that either Europe or the international community have completely failed in the Balkans. We could have said there was a true failure if no efforts had been made to achieve peace. Unfortunately, there were no appropriate means; there was not enough political willingness to impose peace. The issue is that it is not enough to keep the peace because that would come into power when peace or at least some cease-fire has been achieved. The United Nations has so far only been prepared to keep peace. The member countries were not prepared to take the risk for which military experts established would take an army of at least 100 soldiers to impose peace, but with the uncertainty as to how long such peace would last. We may conclude that the United Nations has learned from all this that, in fighting similar crises in the future, preventive diplomacy should be instituted on time. [Uranic] There have been many accusations recently concerning Croatia's alleged military involvement in the Bosnian war. How do you think the existence of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be secured, knowing they are a minority, both in relation to the Serbs and the Muslims? [Jeszenszky] The world's reaction to the events during the entire war have always been strong but somewhat late. The world did not pay any attention to the destruction of Vukovar and Dubrovnik or to the fact that hospitals and churches were being shot. Only later did everyone realize that the Muslims and the Croats were the victims in the beginning of the Bosnian war. However, when the truth did emerge, it took quite some time before the public started to apply pressure and stimulate activity. It seems to me that the Bosnian Croats are really the victims at the moment. It is they who are threatened. I can understand that the Croatian Government and the Croat people are very worried about it. However, I also hope that we neighboring countries and the international community will find a way to prevent the threat of their extinction or exile and that not only Croatia will have to protect them. The question is whether Croatia has the power to protect them alone, and what the reaction of the international community to such attempt would be. I do not know how much truth there is in the news according to which there are regular Croatian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Even if it is undoubtedly aimed at protecting the Bosnian Croats, it could cause the imposing of sanctions against Croatia, which should be avoided at all costs. However, the Bosnian Croats becoming victims of ethnic cleansing or being forced to flee to Croatia should also be avoided. The world should not only watch what the Croats are doing; it should pay equal attention to all the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Uranic] To what extent does the delicate issue of Hungarians in Vojvodina influence the Hungarian policies toward Belgrade? [Jeszenszky] It is clear that Hungary would like the entire crisis to be resolved, but it has paid particular attention to keeping up with the position of the Hungarians, as well as the Croats, Slovaks, and Ruthenians in Vojvodina. When ethnic cleansing was in full swing, so to speak, we were worried that the Hungarians in Vojvodina would not only flee because of poverty and forced mobilization, but also because of the possibility that some paramilitary formations could expel them and other non-Serb people from Vojvodina. A large number of Hungarians fled from there -- almost 15 percent of the total number. I hope that this is temporary and that the situation will improve. This direct danger has subsided in the past several weeks, which is perhaps because the radicals there have lost a certain amount of power -- this was shown in the election results. Naturally, the economic situation has not changed at all. All we can do to mitigate it is to send as much humanitarian aid as we can. However, Hungary has not considered giving up certain principles to try to buy peace for the Hungarians in Vojvodina or their rights. I think that we have abided by a principled policy during the entire crisis and that we have worked on trying to retain good relations with all the peoples who are part of it, which we succeeded in with Slovenia and Croatia. On the other hand, the Serbs were condemned by the international community but, in that case as well, we keep in mind that they are our neighbors and that they will continue to be so. Bearing in mind not only the future of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, but also the long-term Serbian-Hungarian relations, we wanted to keep good relations with them, too. We did not introduce compulsory visas; we enabled the regular flow of the local traffic and so on. However, at the same time, we believe that the concept of autonomy, which the Democratic Union of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, is their right. In that we do not believe that this is some special right of the Hungarians, but that this model of local self- management is one of the possible ways of democracy and coexistence in the Balkans and even further. As Croatia is, to my knowledge, prepared to provide minority rights for the Serbs, Serbia should provide a special status to the Croats in Serbia. All in all, it seems to me that in the past few weeks, as recent events have indicated, the government in Belgrade has realized that what the Hungarians are asking for is not all that impossible. They have realized that it does not endanger the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and that with that move, they could win some positive points with the international community and maybe even come closer to a solution for Kosovo. I do not want to be too optimistic, but there have been serious suggestions lately, primarily from Serbian President Milosevic. Andras Agoston was invited to negotiate. This is a sign, and the days and weeks to follow will answer the question if it was a tactical move or a political decision that could have positive consequences in the long run. I sincerely hope that this will be actualized, and I would like to point out that during my stay in Belgrade, I felt that the government there was seriously prepared to make certain steps toward peace and that they will start serious negotiations with the Hungarians. The Serb-Croat agreement, which happened several days before, had to me been a good sign of "breaking the ice" and more than that. It showed that Serb-Croat relations had moved from a standstill, which is extremely important for us, because it means that there is no danger of another conflict in our neighborhood, which may open the possibility of the return of the refugees, the opening of the Adriatic pipeline.... [Uranic] Hungary has achieved remarkable success in European political integration. However, many believe that this is not accompanied by a corresponding level of economic prosperity. [Jeszenszky] It would be difficult to summarize the condition of the Hungarian economy in a few sentences. However, I think that the achieved level of transformation of the Hungarian economy is not at all bad. I would like to point out that our inflation has never reached the proportions that most of our neighbors have experienced; it is currently kept at approximately 20 percent a year, and it will be even lower. We have made a significant part of state property private and half of the capital intended for this part of Europe still flows into Hungary. I would not like to embark upon a rivalry concerning who is in a better situation -- us, the Czechs, or the Polish. The most important thing is that a lot of capital is arriving here. As far as I am concerned, let there be talk that other countries are better off, as long as the greater part of the capital comes here. Capital does not read the papers and does not listen to propaganda, but simply goes where it pays to invest. That is why I think that the success of the Hungarian economy is at a far more serious level than is commonly thought. I recently visited Ukraine, and I went to the foot of the Carpathians. The Hungarians there are surprised at the people in Hungary complaining about the situation so much. Not only because things are much worse there, but also because they see how much is being built here, and not only concerning infrastructure. There is a large number of new companies, new technology is being implemented, apartments built. All in all, I think that we have achieved relatively good economic growth in Hungary. We have not achieved everything we wanted, precisely because of the general international crisis and the war. Nevertheless, we did protect the people from the economic crisis that has struck all our neighbors. [Uranic] Hungary has accepted the "Partnership for Peace" plan. Do you think this was the most the West could have offered to the Central and Eastern European countries, considering the situation in Russia? [Jeszenszky] Many say that this is less than we expected and that the West has given in to Russia, or at least shown too much consideration toward Russia. I do not think this is true. Hungary and other East European countries clearly want to be full members of NATO, and they would not mind this coming into power immediately. However, a long transition period would follow. The conditions in the Hungarian Army, in the economy, and the education of the officers would certainly not enable us to become part of this integrated military structure immediately. However, I do not claim that we could not have done more. The United States bears a historical responsibility, not only concerning Russian-U.S. relations, but also for what course Russian politics will take. It was, therefore, motivated to make Russia its partner and thus encourage those who are positively disposed toward the West, the democratic forces. Hungary, Poland, and other countries therefore accepted this -- I would not say sacrifice, but waiting patiently. It is also best for us not to have to fear Russia forever and to have Russia not only stop being a military threat, but also start on the way of economic development, to continue being the source of raw materials and all its other potentials. We have a special interest in Russia becoming a large eastern market and in Russia and the Baltic countries becoming the center of Europe, as now they are its outskirts. Therefore, if Russia and Ukraine stabilize and start going the way of democracy and market economy, we will be the first to profit from that. Hungary supported the "Partnership" under those terms. This is why we are not complaining. We believe that this is an achievement that was unthinkable a year ago. We have come closer to NATO membership and we have been given promises that this plan would lead to it. This depends primarily on us, on our handling of the situation, our progress, and our readiness to cooperate. [Box p 15] Lifting the Sanctions Against Belgrade [Uranic] According to some sources, Hungary is prepared to support the lifting of the sanctions against the FRY. Could you comment on that? [Jeszenszky] I think we can establish that over a year ago, the international community decided to achieve the desired aim -- the end to the war -- by imposing economic sanctions instead of carrying out military intervention. The sanctions have undoubtedly been effective. Serbia's economy has collapsed. I was there myself and I saw the direct consequences. Naturally, this is still a lesser price than having a city or people destroyed. However, it was no one's intention to make the innocent suffer the sanctions -- for instance, the Serbian opposition or the non-Serb population, which certainly did not support the policies that were to be punished by these sanctions. The aim of sanctions is not to destroy a nation and a state but to force them to change policies. The European Union has, therefore, recently made a proposal that mentions the suspension or lifting of the sanctions -- not unconditional, but in case those whom these measures relate to, that is, the government in Belgrade as well as the Bosnian Serbs, make the moves they are expected to make. Hungary supports this way of thinking. It should be seen if the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian Muslims accept this within the framework of the peace plan. The Bosnian Muslims have suffered a lot. I can understand their bitterness. They presently think that they have grown militarily stronger. However, I think it is clear that a military solution really does not exist. The Muslims may perhaps occupy several villages or maybe towns, but they can certainly not win against the Serbs. They will certainly not make it to Belgrade. Therefore, a peaceful solution is still the only solution there. I talked to international mediator Stoltenberg and Romanian Foreign Minister Melesceu today. We have arranged to suggest that the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia hold a special session at the level of foreign ministers, at which we would discuss how we, the closest neighbors, can contribute to a peaceful resolution of the entire crisis. On the basis of the plan of the European Union and the peace envoys, we would seek the ways of putting an end to this war, and then, naturally, the lifting of the sanctions could follow.
