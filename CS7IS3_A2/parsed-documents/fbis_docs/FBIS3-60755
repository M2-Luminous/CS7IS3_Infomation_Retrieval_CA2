In mid-November, Middle Eastern sources told CORRIERE DELLA SERA that two important figures from the Greek "17 November" terrorist group went to Tehran for secret talks with Pasdaran officers and cadres of the Iranian intelligence services. During their stay in the Iranian capital, the Greek extremists met with Mohsen Rezai, the powerful and influential leader of the "Guardians of the Revolution," and with officers charged with exporting the Shi'ite revolution. The "17 November" leaders went to assess the possibility of cooperating with Tehran and asked their interlocutors to provide arms and funds. According to leaks, the visit to Iran was the first step toward a new offensive by the Greek extremists, not only against local targets but also against Western offices, personalities, and institutions. Tehran, therefore, apparently has been successful in bringing into its fold one of Europe's most dangerous and mysterious subversive groups. The formation takes its name from the fierce repressive action implemented on 17 November 1973 by the Greek military junta. Consisting of no more than 20 to 30 members, the "17 November" group has played a major role in a spectacular series of attacks. The assault groups have killed judges, politicians, and even the CIA's "mission chief" in Greece. The extremist group always has been shrouded in mystery. Indeed, the police have failed to capture even one of them, a situation that has fueled the strangest speculation. Some people even have gone as far as to suspect the secret services, while others have accused Papandreou's PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] of complicity. In the past, evidence has surfaced linking the "17 November" group to Arab or Palestinian 007's. In recent weeks the ayatollahs once more have loosened their purse strings to fund Middle Eastern extremist formations. In fact, during a recent meeting in Damascus, the Iranians promised Hamas $10 million.
