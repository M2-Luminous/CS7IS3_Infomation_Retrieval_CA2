The incident was limited to that day. It has been learned that, at around 0500 on 1 April, 10 public security personnel from the Xiayong police substation of the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau went to Bogang Village to arrest blackmailers Chen Renshan and Chen Yonghui. These two criminals committed four crimes last July and August, extorting over 13,000 yuan. When the public security personnel were ready to escort both criminals to the police substation, they were intercepted by Chen Renshan's brothers and his wife, who were armed with sticks and stones. Chen Renshan's elder brother Chen Renchao hit the policeman walking in front on the head with a brick, knocking him unconscious. In the chaos that ensued, Chen Renshan was taken away. Unwilling to let the matter drop, Chen Renchao picked up a 1.5 meter-long thick stick and gave chase to special policeman Zhou Xinbao. The latter fired a warning shot, but Chen kept on rushing at him. At the critical moment, when his life was seriously threatened, Zhou opened fire and hit Chen Renchao at the leg, forcing the mob to abandon their siege. At approximately 0900 that day, at the instigation of Chen Renshan and others, over 100 villagers went to the police substation, called for the release of Chen Yonghui and tried to force their way into the substation. The public security personnel formed a human barricade to stop the villagers from storming the substation. Finding it impossible to enter the substation, Chen Renshan incited the villagers to smash the substation signboard and attack the policemen. Eventually, public security personnel arrived led by Zhang Xinde, chief of the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau. While vigorously conducting education on the need to observe the law, they rounded up the chief troublemakers, including Chen Renshan, Chen Shaowen, Chen Renhua, Chen Huijun, and Chen Qiaoling, and thus put an end to the incident.
