Instead, Delhi has offered to host the summit in April 1995, senior External Affairs Ministry sources told THE STATESMAN over the phone. The Prime Minister's preoccupation with elections in several States--which are scheduled between November and March--was cited as the cause for the postponement. The SAARC charter stipulates that heads of States and Governments of the member States meet once a year. The postponement of the eighth SAARC summit will upset the summit cycle. Officials point out that the ninth summit cannot be organized in the winter of 1995, as there is no provision for two meetings in one year. However, India intends to get the decision ratified in the July meeting of the SAARC Foreign Ministers in Dhaka.
