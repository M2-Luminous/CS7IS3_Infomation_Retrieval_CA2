FBIS4-56593 "drlat088_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Nicaragua FSLN Member Criticizes National Directorate FSLN Member Criticizes National Directorate 94P20717B 94P20717B CSO [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 14 April 1994 reports on page 4 that Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) member Fernando Cardenal criticized the National Directorate (DN) for the actions it has taken since Chamorro took office. These include the lack of criticism of the pinata (the confiscation of property by FSLN leaders following the party's defeat in 1990). By not rejecting the pinata the DN was "discredited" in the eyes of the rank and file to the point that its subsequent actions were rendered ineffective. The DN also erred, Cardenal says, when it forced Sandinist Assembly members to elect the DN as a slate rather than by secret ballot prior to the first party congress in 1991, and when it refused to recognize the Assembly as the party's highest authority between congresses. Furthermore, the DN has ignored "the minimal and most basic ethical principles...and has been unable to prevent detractions, insults, and calumnies on the part of Sandinist militants." Cardenal refers to an interview by DN member Henry Ruiz who said in February that the FSLN secretary general makes decisions in lieu of collective decisionmaking by the Directorate so that "today there is no National Directorate but rather a leadership crisis." Cardenal hopes that his reflections will serve as a guide to participants in the FSLN extraordinary congress which will be held on 20 May.
