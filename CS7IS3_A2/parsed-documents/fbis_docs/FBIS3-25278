Considering that the Togolese opposition has always been the first to cry thief and assassin as soon as it has done something condemnable, the RPT would like to make the following clarification: 1. We have concrete proof which confirms 24 constituencies for the second round of the legislative elections were put at the disposal of the CAR militiamen. 2. The traditional chiefs of the southern region of the country, concerned with the need to make peace and harmony prevail among ethnic groups in their territories and surprised to see these militiamen propagating tribal hatred, drew the government's attention to the situation. 3. The RPT leaders were informed about the situation by their activists and the people with great precision. 4. In order to avoid frigtening the people and inciting the anger of the grassroots activists, the RPT leaders preferred to manage this situation by ensuring government authorities in charge of the security of men and goods would secure the implementation of the laws in force. The RPT considers the CAR communique a serious accusation and a provocation based on misinformation. The RPT would like to warn the CAR leaders that fraud, cheating, intimidation, threats, violence, and sabotage with which they hindered the presidential elections and the first round of the legislative elections will not go unnoticed. 7. [as heard] The RPT, attached to the ideals of peace, serenity, brotherhood, solidarity, and harmonious cohabitation among all ethnic groups, will do all in its power for brotherhood, national unity, territorial integrity, and improved condition of citizens to prevail. Finally, the RPT would like to reassure the people concerned by the 20 February legislative elections that no one can prevent them from enjoying their civic rights without facing the full rigors of the laws in force. For the RPT, the national chairman of the campaign committee, Signed, Ayite Gachin Mivedor.
