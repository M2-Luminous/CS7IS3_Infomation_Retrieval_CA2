Mondale, head dropped with hands covering his face, and Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama among the high officials on both sides lined up beside both U.S.-Japanese leaders at a joint press conference -- probably symbolically indicated the state of the recent U.S.-Japan Summit Talks. At any rate, if President Clinton could say, "It is better not to make an agreement with no substance," Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa responded, "There should be no nebulous settlement," and the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiation ended without agreement at the U.S.-Japan summit talks on 11 February. It was the first time in history of postwar U.S.-Japanese relations extending over 49 years to see a U.S.-Japan summit conference ends in collapse with flat opposition. The fact that the economic framework negotiations of two preeminent economic superpowers, the United States and Japan, ran aground in a complete deadlock means a great risk not only for both countries, but also for the world. Why did it end up in a state of collapse? What was behind this worst conclusion? What first can be pointed out as a direct cause is the "misreading" committed by both the United States and Japan. Both sides mutually misread the other's thoughts and attitude more than once and that was linked to a conclusion causing them greatly to lose sight of the route to agreement. Both ambassadors, Mondale, a figure who appeared on television holding his head, and Kuriyama, were those among "responsible parties." Ambassador to Japan Mondale returned to the United States accompanied by J. Foster, councilor of the U.S. Embassy in Japan, on 8 February [1994] in advance of Hosokawa's visit to the United States, and reported to President Clinton information and feelings about the Japan side obtained from Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa with whom he had talked on the 7th, the previous day. He transmitted to the president his judgement that "The Japan side probably will give in at the end." No doubt this Mondale report greatly influenced the negotiation attitude of the U.S. side. On the other hand, when Ambassador to the U.S. Kuriyama returned to Japan for a short time and visited Prime Minister Hosokawa at his official residence on 1 February, he strongly urged that a worsening of U.S.-Japan relations must absolutely be avoided and advised that "We should make concessions since numerical goals in the government procurement area will be acceptable. At this time, however, high officials on the U.S. side considered to be the Japan-reconciliation group such as presidential aide R. Rubin (in charge of National Economic Council or NEC) and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury R. Altman, people with the greatest influence in the White House, had been leaning toward abandonment of "numerical goals." The advice of Ambassador Kuriyama, therefore, exposed his own low level of intelligence. The multiplication effect of these misreadings caused both sides to make a misjudgment on agreement. However, a more substantive cause that drove the economic framework negotiations to collapse was the negotiation stance itself of both the United States and Japan. While the Clinton administration was citing "change" and the Hosokawa regime was advocating "reform," the basic perception of both sides about their negotiating partner remained unchanged. In other words, the reading of the United States was that if it initially hurled big demands and continued to exert strong pressure, Japan ultimately would completely surrender as usual; and the Japan side, convinced that the U.S. side would keep pushing with no room for compromise, thought only of dodging the other's attack. What actually happened was that the United States was studying concessions with basic demands at a certain stage and Japan said "No" at the last moment. Victorious Mood Only at Kasumigaseki Of course, there was neither victory nor defeat because it collapsed without reaching agreement. Notwithstanding, as soon as the decision was made to break it off, the tone of the media was all a warning of "U.S. retaliation," and voices of irritation were raised in the industrial sector such as, "Anyone can say `No' and worsen relations. It is diplomacy to improve relations" (major precision machinery company president). However, Kasumigaseki was different, and bureaucrats had a sort of victorious mood. Especially Koichiro Matsuura, deputy minister for foreign affairs (in charge of economics), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and others who had crossed swords with the U.S. side on the very front line of the economic framework negotiations related somewhat excitedly just as the summit conference ended that "This (having said `No') was a symbol of a new U.S.-Japan era." Then words of merry self-praise were also heard from among the officers at MOFA, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and MITI, such as "We have said `No' for the first time in U.S.-Japan relations since the war," "This is the beginning of a mature U.S.-Japan relationship," and "Japan has become on par with Europe by this." Viewing the government agency side which had continued to be swayed by the U.S. side in previous U.S.-Japan trade relations, it probably was a refreshing thought to have said "No" to the United States for the first time. That is understood, but can it not be said that the merry attitude of such joy at just saying "No" is itself proof that U.S.-Japan relations still are immature. Also at the same time, one feels that there is a dangerous omen in their manner of nationalistic applause at "No" to the United States. The danger that a "government official led" anti-U.S., hate-U.S. mood will be fomented probably is clear. However, it does not seem that Prime Minister Hosokawa himself said "No" with the intention of opening "mature, adult relationships." In the plane that flew to Washington on 10 February, the prime minister had rehearsed his English speech and took a nap. He hoped for the best and seemed to have thought at worst "partial agreement" was possible. How and where had that been misread? Before investigation of the circumstances in detail, I would like to summarize here the points of the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations. The economic framework negotiations started based on "a framework for a new economic partnership between the United States and Japan" decided at Tokyo talks between [former] Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President Clinton in July 1993, and the Structural Impediments Initiative and individual field talks that previously had been conducted were consolidated together here. There are 23 structural fields that are the targets of the discussions, but three fields of government procurement, insurance, and auto and auto parts are considered the priority fields. Since September 1993, over 10 U.S.-Japan discussions had proceeded by field with vice minister level meetings as the axis, but "objective criteria" and "numerical goals" became the greatest problem points among them. A U.S.-Japan agreement was made on objective criteria as "a method to measure the degree of Japanese market openness," but as opposed to the U.S. side which considered this "establishment of future goals," the Japan side thought it to be "a method measuring the current degree based on past performance," and these opposing views became a cause of dispute to the end. Regarding numerical goals, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) M. Kantor says, "We have not used those words even once." However, the Japan side criticizes that "The numbers which the U.S. side has brought out as objective criteria are numerical goals themselves" and has refused to accept them. Especially the U.S. demand that "(Japan) also guarantee the past growth rate of 20 percent for auto parts in the future" has become the biggest point of opposition and became one of the major factors that caused the U.S.-Japan summit conference to collapse. "Compromise Proposal" Offered What were the actual moves at the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations, and what offense and defense unfolded on the surface and behind negotiations? With the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11 February near at hand, the discussions centering on vice minister level talks were at the crucial moment. A government source who participated in the negotiations says, "At the beginning of February, there were prospects for an agreement on most of the insurance field and government procurement, and the situation was that about 80 percent could be settled at the summit talks." But the opposition in the auto and auto parts field became a bottleneck and negotiations became deadlocked. On the afternoon of 8 February, USTR Kantor gave notice that "he would like to suspend negotiations temporarily." A dark mood spread through the Japan side negotiation team. However, on the evening of the 9 February [1994], Deputy Minister Matsuura of Foreign Affairs was invited to dinner by B. Cutter, deputy presidential aid (in charge of international economics), who was the responsible person on the U.S. side at the administrative level, and offered "a compromise proposal." It was verbal. The contents of it were 1) numerical goals would not be included, 2) macro fields, government procurement, and insurance fields would be lumped together, and 3) auto and auto parts would be postponed one to two months. By this, it would be acceptable to the Japan side. Wondering "can it be true?," the Japan side took heart. Immediately, the Japan side tried to confirm "the Cutter proposal," in the negotiations between Matsuura and USTR Deputy Representative S. Bashevski (government procurement); Vice Minister Okamatsu of International Affairs, MITI, and Under Secretary J. Garten of Commerce (auto and auto parts); and Vice Minister Kosuke Nakahira of International Affairs, MOF, and Under Secretary of the Treasury L. Summers (insurance); but there was no such feeling or a sentiment for concessions on the U.S. side. It was strange. Internal Leadership Struggle on U.S. Side Amidst this, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata went to Washington a bit earlier than Prime Minister Hosokawa. The first Hata-Kantor talks began at 0730 in the morning on the 10th. At the outset, Kantor faced Hata and appealed, "Let's aim at goals." Since Hata had received a report regarding "the Cutter proposal" of the previous evening, he responded, "I understand what you are saying. That's probably the thing." However, this was a strange Zen dialogue. Hata intended to express his resolve that "Because we accept the Cutter proposal, let's take it down to the administrative level once on that line before bring it to agreement." Kantor, however, took it that Hata had shown an attitude of concession and agreed to reopening practical level discussions. For both, it was jumping to such a hasty conclusion that it is difficult to believe. Such being the situation, the Hata and Kantor talks did not proceed at all. Worried, Matsuura contacted Bashevski and asked, "What is the matter?" The curt reply was, "The USTR attitude has not changed at all." Furthermore, at the vice minister level meeting in the afternoon of the same day, the U.S. side strengthened its demands for numerical goals. At the second Hata-Kantor talk that began at 1600, a heated argument was exchanged concerning the meaning of "aim at goals." There was an important move between this first and second Hata-Kantor talks. The National Economic Council (NEC) was held for a talk with Kantor at the White House, and President Clinton, who had received the report of "a sense of concession on the Japan side" from Kantor, instructed, "Let's go with the original plan. Don't make an agreement without substance." The foreshadowing was laid here for the breakdown of discussions. At 1700 on the 10th, with Prime Minister Hosokawa, who had arrived in Washington, the Japan side held "an Imperial conference" until late at night in Blair House, the accommodations for the prime minister. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who was informed of the hardline attitude of the U.S. side by Hata on this occasion, was considered to have made up his mind on "the inevitable collapse." After this, although the final Hata-Kantor talk was conducted beginning at 0100 on the 11th, it was more or less mutually to confirm the other's intransigence and subsequently proceeded all at once to the conclusion of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks. The above was the scene of the finale of the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations, but main point in this process was the "illusionary Cutter proposal." That this ended in an apparition was clearly because of an inside fight for leadership on the U.S. side. In other words, as opposed to the reconciliation group of Rubin, Cutter, and others who moved toward concessions with Japan, the hardline group centered on USTR Kantor rolled back and President Clinton gave the nod to the hardline group. However, the Japan side, which could not read the movements beneath the surface on the U.S. side, believed in the "Cutter proposal" until the next day, misread the other's attitude, and added to that, misreadings by the U.S. side which took the attitude of the Japan side to be "concession" complicated the negotiation. In other words, it was a collapse which "misreadings" by both sides invited. Proposal Carefully Read by Clinton There are two very interesting facts concerning the U.S. perception of Japan and attitude determination in the economic framework negotiations. One was a letter (dated 20 January) sent to President Clinton before the summit conference by Glen Fukushima (chief, General Policy Division, Japan Branch Office, AT&T and vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Japan), who was thoroughly conversant of the ins and outs of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations as a former acting deputy USTR representative (in charge of Japan). It has been confirmed by the notes of the president himself and signatures of high officials that the president carefully scanned this Fukushima paper and also had high officials at the White House read it. The contents of the Fukushima paper essentially were an analysis of the current state of the U.S.-Japan relationship, frank criticism of the Clinton Administration's policy on Japan, and a proposal concerning concessions to Japan as well as strategy on Japan. For example, concerning the attitude to which the Clinton Administration should adhere in negotiations with Japan, he advised that they must not deal with Japanese bureaucrats, "Premised on the power of (Japan's) central government bureaucrats, the U.S. Government will unfortunately take the wrong road if it pays heed to the advice of Japanese bureaucrats whose own existence depend on maintaining the status quo." It is interesting to learn the places that attracted the attention of the president in the Fukushima's letter by President Clinton's notes and underlines. Like thus, for example. There is the scribble "agree" at the places where it says "The recession will continue longer than expected, but the roots of the Japanese economy will not be harmed. They will come back again as the strongest enemy" and "On the problem of opening Japanese markets, the Clinton administration...does not understand when, where, and in what degree to apply it (pressure)." Moreover, he underlined it in 15 places such as "Even if an agreement is made (with Japan), problems will occur several months later due to interpretation of words." A copy of this Fukushima paper was passed to nine high officials in the Clinton administration such as USTR Representative Kantor and secretary of the treasury Bentsen by instruction of the president. Another interesting fact is the "performance" that was carried out at the White House directly after the U.S.-Japan summit talks. After the joint press conference following the summit talks, special Washington correspondents of the Japanese media, one from each company, were invited into the Roosevelt Room, which is next door to the Oval Room (president's office). Tea and cake were served, and there were three hosts to the special correspondents: Kantor, presidential adviser D. Gargen, and S. Bargar, deputy presidential aide in charge of the National Security Council. The reason for this get-together was "because we do not want to create a misunderstanding among Asian people because of this collapse" (Gargen), but when they got into the briefing, the talk of the three on the White House side was in the tone that "President Clinton emphasized that he sympathized with Prime Minister Hosokawa" (after the summit talks), and when the two left the East Room, the president took the arm of Prime Minister Hosokawa. This is important." They made many comments that emphasized the strength of the ties between Hosokawa and Clinton. A special correspondent who participated [in the get-together] commented that "The U.S. side is annoyed by the attitude of Japanese bureaucrats in the recent U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations. So, the White House held a performance to separate Hosokawa from the bureaucrats." Hosokawa and Clinton Secret Agreement Theory Of the recent U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations which was complicated by misreadings on both sides, the most disappointing issue to the president was the Japanese income tax cut. Having continued to press for expansion of Japanese domestic demand, the hopes which the U.S. side had pinned upon an economic stimulus measure through an income tax cut by the Hosokawa cabinet was greater than imagined by Japan, and the desire of the U.S. side was "at least 10 trillion yen" as the tax cut amount. On this point also, it seems that the U.S. side had obtained the feeling through the pipeline of Councilor Foster and Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa that "If the political reform issue were cleared, Hosokawa would undoubtedly carry out a large tax cut." Then, there is the "Hosokawa-Clinton secret agreement theory" concerning the income tax cut. According to this secret agreement theory which has been greatly circulated by stock market sources, if the Hosokawa regime implements a domestic demand expansion policy of "an income tax cut on the scale of about 7 trillion yen and a three-year period of the consumption tax deferment," the Clinton administration would consider some type of concession regarding numerical goals at the final stage of economic framework negotiations. Or, there is also a theory that the agreement with Clinton was continued acceptance of economic framework negotiations, not numerical goals. The Hosokawa cabinet took up tax system reform when the political reform bill was completed, per those expectations of the U.S. side. However, the concept of a 6 trillion yen tax cut combined with a "national welfare tax" announced at early dawn on 3 February encountered opposition within the coalition ruling party and the disfavor of public opinion and was scrapped in one day. As a result, "a single fiscal year 6 trillion yen" income tax and residential tax cut were brought out again on 8 February right before the U.S.-Japan summit talks. President Clinton was disappointed by this. Since it would have been three years before a raise in the consumption tax rate if it had been the scrapped tax cut bill, the tax cut amount for a three years' portion at 6 trillion yen would total 18 trillion yen. However, it will end at 6 trillion yen with a single fiscal year limit. The U.S. side decide that it would not serve to expand domestic demand. Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen, therefore, came to sound out the MOF about "whether the 6 trillion tax cut could continue in the second year and thereafter," but Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii only repeated the vague response that "future issues await a consensus among the ruling party." Even at vice minister class discussions, Vice Minister Nakahira of International Affairs could not respond at all to the inquiries by Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury. The president, who had been betrayed in expectations that "Hosokawa would make a large tax cut," explored "the possibility of a prime minister's political decision concerning a tax cut for a second year and thereafter" at the summit talks, but Prime Minister Hosokawa only said, "because of the Japanese budget compilation system and political situation, under present conditions, I can only agree to a tax cut measure for a single year. One high official at the White House relates that "Hosokawa gave the president the impression that he was dancing to the choreography of MOF bureaucrats." The "secret agreement" on "some type of concessions in numerical goals" was called off by this. Ultimately, even though refusing "an agreement without substance," President Clinton undoubtedly had tied expectations to the attitude of the Japan side until the last moment. At the stage directly before the summit talks, he awaited "a souvenir" from the Japan side because it had been the old trick of the Japan side in previous U.S.-Japan negotiations that while being noncommittal up until the final phase of negotiations, the big shots of Japan would fly into Washington at the last moment carrying some "souvenir" or a nice "hidden jewel." "Doesn't Want To See His Face" The U.S. side seem to have thought that the Japan side would make similar moves again. They thought that "the U.S. visit by Kiuchi" on 8 February "probably would be that." Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France, "set out to explore the feelings of the U.S. side" as a special envoy of the prime minister (MOFA source), but the U.S. side viewed it as perhaps coming with "a souvenir" because he was specially flying in before the summit talks. Actually, however, Special Envoy Kiuchi was completely empty-handed. Next, the U.S. side expectations were for the "the U.S. visit by Hata." Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata was initially scheduled to go with Prime Minister Hosokawa, but he entered Washington a day earlier than the prime minister on 9 February. On the day before his departure, Hata had invited Ambassador Mondale to the MOFA Iikura Kokan Building to talk. There even was the observation circulating among U.S.-Japan negotiations sources in Washington who welcomed Hata that "the `souvenir' would be either a policy of enlarging the income tax cut or concessions in the field of auto and auto parts." However, Hata was also completely empty-handed and he did not bring so much as a "hidden jewel." The ones who bring the "souvenir" or "hidden jewel" are generally influential men because of the very fact that they are big shots, and the ones who prepare them are bureaucrats. Therefore, if they do not know how to handle the bureaucrats, they have no choice but to go empty-handed. So, doubts increased on the U.S. side about the leadership ability of Prime Minister Hosokawa. Such being the circumstance, the Japanese side being at the beck and call of the bureaucrats was markedly noticeable in the recent economic framwork negotiations. With their state of self-complacency that "we have squelched them because they have brought out unreasonable numbers" even at the division chief class on the administrative level, the repulsion of the U.S. side at the excessive "bureaucratic leadership" style had escalated. Amidst this, the communications gap between the MOF and the Treasury Department on macro policy matters was terrible, and Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury, who was the responsible person for U.S. side negotiations in the insurance field, had spoken out that "I don't want to see the face" of Vice Minister Nakahira of Foreign Affairs, the person responsible on the Japan side. High Yen Inducement Strategy in Future The fact that "a Japan that can say no" showed itself to the world in the recent U.S.-Japan summit talks can probably be called a harvest in its own way. At the same time, however, it also has angered the United States to the extent that voices have been raised, "Why did Hosokawa especially come as far as Washington if it was just to say `No'" (U.S. government authority)? Just by the fact that the United States got into a rage, the exchange market swung to a high yen directly after the collapse of the U.S.-Japan summit talks and leapt to $1 equals 101 yen. It seems that lately the yen market somewhat has recovered its composure, but full-scale invokement of U.S. "high yen inducement strategy" will be in the future and the possibility must be viewed of a yen rise to the "$1 equals 105 yen to 95 yen" level advocated by F. Bargsten, the director of the Institute of International Economics (IIE), who is an influential adviser on economic policy in the Clinton administration. Japan's export industry is calculated to become a minus of 1 trillion yen overall if it becomes 5 yen higher to the dollar. However, this is strictly a macro number and viewed on the corporate level including subcontracts and sub-subcontracts, that damage probably will be close to a fatal blow. In addition to that, as a retaliatory measure for the "No" of Japan, the United States has worked out various sanctions against Japan. The demand to open the market for mobile telephones was the first shot, but sanctions against Japan centering on electrical communications instruments and the auto-related undoubtedly will accelerate and expand in the future. There also has been a move to restore the Super 301 Clause (designation and sanction of unfair trade nations) of the General Trade Law. From the outset, President Clinton is a man who has advocated the revival and strengthening of the Super 301 Clause since during the presidential election and together with pressure from Congress and government circles, the restoration of the Super 301 Clause by presidential order is a very great possibility. It will take time procedurally until such sanction measures move to implementation, but it seems that the aim of the U.S. side is to produce a "combined effect" with the high yen strategy which has an immediate effect. There is also the ominous view that "If the two-stage strategy of high yen and sanctions is invoked, a Clinton Shock to rival the previous Nixon Shock will attack Japan" (international finance source). In any case, the compensation for having asserted "No" in Washington will probably be a lot more pain than the politicians and bureaucrats anticipated. Cost of "No" Really Is Expensive Prime Minister Hosokawa, who found that the retaliatory reaction of the U.S. side was unexpectedly strong, is trying hard to put together a new open market policy along with tendering his submission that "the U.S. Government take sensible decisions and actions," but so long as he does not propose anything more than the recent demands by the U.S. side, the U.S. side would not consent. A move is now proceeding within the U.S. Government that will cause Prime Minister Hosokawa anxiety. That is the move toward regression by the Japan-reconciliation group and an enlargement of the voice of the hardline group. Before the U.S.-Japan opposition concerning the economic framework negotiations deepened, Presidential Aide Rubin (former chairman of Goldman Saxs), Deputy Secretary Altman (former vice chairman of the Blackstone Group) of the Treasury, and others who have been called "the Wall Street mafia" in the U.S. Government and the White House because of coming from the financial sector, had a voice as the Japan-reconciliation group. However, Altman was angry that the Hosokawa regime broke its pledge with the United States with the income tax cut and has left the Japan-reconciliation group. Rising in position there is the Japan-hardline group such as USTR Kantor and USTR Deputy Representative Bashevski, considered the "attorney mafia" having been attorneys, who scored in the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations. The trend of this "Wall Street mafia" versus "attorney mafia" greatly influenced the conclusion of the economic framework negotiations. In the future, the hardline group probably will also have an increased voice in the aspect of sanctions against Japan. Japan has been treated lightly, such as saying that in Japan, "They can say No...." However, as we have just found out, the cost of "No" is really expensive. In the advanced diplomatic nation of Great Britain, when they want to say "No," they say, "Yes, but..." or in other words, that is right, but....
