According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, (Livingston) alleged this in an article entitled, "The Dangerous Area," contributed to a recent issue of the publication "Sea Power," published by the Navy League, an organization supported by the U.S. Navy. Stressing that the North Korean leadership which triggered a war on the Korean peninsula on 25 June 40 years ago is the Kim Il-song system, (Livingston) said that "the ROK is very vulnerable to North Korean attack, and therefore, it is very clear that Seoul, the fourth largest city in the world approximately 60 km away from the Military Demarcation Line [MDL], will undergo enormous damages at the initial stage, whatever type of war may break out there in the future." He estimated that if the ROK Army fails to check the North Korean Army midway, the North Korean fighters will reach Seoul within five minutes and tanks will pressure Seoul in its outskirts within an hour. In particular, he assumed that North Korea has stored an enormous quantity of chemical weapons in the areas near MDL in the North Korean side of the Armistice Line, and will likely blow off the poison gas to South Korea in an emergency by taking advantage of weather conditions, including wind, and that some of these chemical weapons might have already been hidden in secret places in Seoul or other areas of the ROK. SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote that this suggests the possibility that armed spies, who will commit a terrorist act with chemical weapons at the directive from Pyongyang, might have already infiltrated into Seoul, or the forces that blindly follow North Korea might already possess these weapons.
