People across the country must seize the opportunity, take the overall situation into consideration, pluck up their spirits, and make concerted efforts to carry out China's economic construction. During the discussion, Liu Huaqing listened attentively to the deputies' remarks and interposed from time to time. He showed great pleasure when Hubei Governor Jia Zhijie briefed the deputies saying that last year the province's gross domestic product exceeded 100 billion yuan; total industrial and agricultural output value topped 200 billion yuan; revenues rose above 10 billion yuan; and urban and rural residents' income registered a considerable increase. Liu Huaqing said: For Hubei, which is situated in the hinterland of central China, the construction of the Three Gorges project -- to divert water from Danjiang reservoir to north China -- and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi cities present a very good opportunity. If the province's 56 million people make concerted efforts to advance in an invigorated spirit and handle relations among reform, development, and stability well, accelerating Hubei's development looks very promising. Liu Huaqing pointed out: The state has promulgated many new reform measures this year, which involve the readjustment of certain interests. This requires everyone to correctly handle relations between overall and partial interests, subordinate minor interests to overall interests, and foster the thinking of coordinating all the nation's activities as in a chess game. In the transition from the old to the new, some localities will encounter difficulties. The important thing is to take into consideration our actual conditions, display the spirit of plain living and hard struggle, be diligent and frugal, and work hard to overcome difficulties. Liu Huaqing stressed the need to attach importance to building socialist spiritual civilization. He said: The drive to combat corruption and promote clean government launched in the entire party, army, and country last year was a great success. However, it has not achieved all our objectives. The drive to combat corruption and promote clean government is a long-term task. We must carry it out to the end and never relax our efforts. When speaking of social practice, Liu Huaqing pointed out: We must advocate new socialist practice and fine social ethics, and vigorously promote the spirit of plain living and hard struggle to change prevailing habits and customs. We must adhere to the principle of fostering both material and spiritual civilization, attaching equal importance to both. We must work hard to nurture a new generation of socialist people with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline.
