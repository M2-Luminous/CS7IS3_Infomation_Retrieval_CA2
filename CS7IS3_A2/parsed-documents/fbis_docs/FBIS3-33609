[passage omitted] DC [Christian Democratic Party] President Deputy Gutemberg Martinez said he thinks the terrorist attacks that began shortly before midnight on 22 February are an answer to the transfer of 44 inmates serving sentences for terrorist activities to a new maximum-security prison, where there is a strict system regulating visits, and inmates will not be able to dig tunnels such as the two discovered in February. Police think terrorist leaders, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the old Santiago jail system, have not only continued directing their respective groups but also have established coordinated action between different prisons. Visits by relatives with direct contact with inmates have made possible the introduction of weapons into the prison. On 20 February, two inmates and four guards were wounded when inmates being transferred to the new jail opened fire on the guards with half a dozen small guns. Martinez said the new maximum security prison respects all the human rights of terrorists inmates, three of whom are in the third day of a hunger strike in defense of what their relatives describe as "the right to escape."
