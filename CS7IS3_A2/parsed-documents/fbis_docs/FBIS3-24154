During the more than two years of his presidential rule, Ukraine has achieved impressive results--meaning that the paralysis of the economy and the financial and credit system, the hyperinflation which has now become superhyperinflation, the plundering of the wealth of the people, and the association of nomenklatura officials of all hues with the criminal underworld--from law enforcement organs to the staff of the president and the leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers--have reached unheard-of proportions. I have already had occasion to conjecture that the generally not-so-poor country could have been brought to its present condition either by an absolutely unprepared, incompetent, and incapable person, a typical creature of the Communist Party system who has leached off the people all his life, or on the contrary, by a very skillful and flexible tactician pursuing the goal set for him by his own party comrades: to pervert the idea of acquiring independence and statehood as thoroughly as possible, to extinguish the enthusiasm of the people, and to dispel illusions of an independent path for Ukraine. They say that a blind person leading the blind will unavoidably lead them into an abyss. We had not even managed to grasp this and catch on to it before we found ourselves in a state of "free fall." Enterprises are closing down; people are being thrown out onto the street; wages and scholarships are not paid for several months in a row; the threat of the destruction of the Donbass and other large industrial regions is real; the Crimea has virtually been surrendered without a fight--but they continue to do an ideological "snow" job on us with a crooked half-smile: Nothing horrible is happening, they say. If the statement that the retinue makes the king is true, then Leonid Kravchuk's circle, all those Slepichevs-Simonenkos-Ternopolskiys-Mikhalchenkos--have worked hard to create the image that now accompanies our president. One could ascertain this easily by entering just any store (where, incidentally, neither L. Kravchuk nor his retinue have ever set foot). They have long been barricaded in the "golden cage" of the former Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine as they "resolve their issues." The "acting prime minister," Yefim Zvyahilskyy, who is operating deep in the underground, carried on even more clandestinely. He is the one whom nobody has ever seen anywhere in person: Yefim Leonidovich prefers to give leading instructions from the chambers of his personal office, studiously avoiding meetings not only with "commoners" but even with leaders of all ranks. Meanwhile, his appearance in the position of prime minister (even if "acting") is far from random. As Ivan Plyushch observed once, Ye. Zvyahilskyy is one of the richest people in Ukraine. Please note that he was not confirmed as a candidate by the parliament; he ended up in his present position thanks to an edict of the president. Aware of what many edicts of L. Kravchuk stand for, the most odious of which have been "retracted" under pressure from public opinion, one may only guess which influential forces and how many powerful people were behind this appointment! Last week RUKH-PRESS voiced, among others, yet another version of the disappearance of Mikhail Boychishin: He was in possession of documents concerning the involvement of major government figures with mafia circles. Let us note that xeroxed copies of these documents are in the possession of the NEZAVISIMOST editorial office. (It is just that they should not be in any hurry to "hack" the documents out of me or other members of the staff because, as far as is known, a few copies of the documents are being held by the editorial offices of Moscow and foreign publications which are prepared to publish them at any time). Their authenticity is beyond doubt. Judging by their content and peculiar details found in the documents, they were drawn up with assistance from the special services, if not with their direct participation. We are prepared to furnish them to competent organs, but only on one condition: If they unravel the "mystery" of Boychishin's disappearance, after all. If this case is going to be "swept under the rug" just as the investigation of the murder of Vadim Boyko was, the editorial office will have to release the materials in its possession, after all. To be sure, last week our law enforcement organs distinguished themselves, after all. On 12 February (do you remember the horrible cold?), a group of UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] riflemen was arrested during a "drill session" at Lysaya Gora in Kiev. There were candidates for people's deputy among the riflemen (therefore, a violation of the Law on Elections, according to which the electoral commission should sanction the arrest of a registered candidate, is obvious). In general this entire episode seemed strange from the very outset. "Exercises" of UNSO commandos have been underway for several years now, frequently with real weapons rather than, like this time, with the use of "models." However, this is what is noteworthy: The searches conducted produced no results, although a lot of "froth" arose. Is it a surprising coincidence that the persecution of UNSO combatants coincided precisely with the beginning of the election campaign? The arrests at Lysaya Gora came close to frustrating the second regional conference of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] in Lvov. While commenting on the events, the leader of the assembly from Lvov, Andrey Shkil, promised at the conference: Even if they arrest everyone, we will come to power anyway. As far as the situation in the Crimea is concerned, he noted: We are men of action, and for this reason the Crimea will either be Ukrainian or it will be uninhabited. It is hard to say what the actions of law enforcement organs exhibit more of--awkward and helpless attempts to prevent the existence of an unregistered paramilitary organization which holds its "exercises" virtually in downtown Kiev or the aspiration to promote the UNSO before the elections. To be sure, there is someone whose example they follow. Can one look more helpless than our president in the context of the latest Crimean events? And yet, the results of elections in the Crimea are truly impressive. For the first time since 1917, the people have elected as their leader a man "in the street" who is not burdened by the communist past and who has never belonged to the nomenklatura merry-go-round. We happened to hear about Yuriy Meshkov for the first time in August 1991, when having tried in vain to persuade the Communists in the parliament to move on Foros to "rescue their general secretary," he made a desperate single-handed attempt and...was apprehended by the already mentioned law enforcement organs, perhaps so that he would not "get in the way" and disrupt the "putsch" scenario. Even then it became obvious that Yu. Meshkov has a quite nonstandard, original personality. This was confirmed by his unconventional visits to Kiev and Moscow and the selection of the "foreigner" Yevgeniy Saburov as prime minister, to say nothing about the tenor of his presentations on TV and the sacramental phrase at the latest press conference: "I do not report to the president of Ukraine on work performed"--an elegant flick on the nose. In the Crimea presidential elections have already been held, whereas here it is still unclear whether such will indeed occur or whether Leonid Kravchuk with "the comrades" will try to "nix" them. There is much indirect evidence in favor of this supposition, for example, the colossal activity of representatives of the party of power, their altogether sickly interest in districts being "jammed" with candidates--you go and figure out who to vote for. In this case, elections to the Supreme Council may not be validly held, or Ukraine will get bogged down in permanent elections. A lot of energy and funds will be needed! This is when the president will come on stage in order to announce magnanimously: Given that the Cabinet of Ministers in essence does not exist, and the parliament has not been elected, I have resolved to stay on as president a little longer. As far as the parliament is concerned, it will be federal: There will be 10 people from each oblast (on the personal responsibility of the representative of the president--note by Vladimir Kuleba). A different turn of events is not ruled out. Leonid Kravchuk will announce his firm intention to not run for president a second time even before the parliamentary elections. There will be no need to look far for explanations: For Kravchuk to become a candidate in the catastrophic situation which Ukraine is now facing would be pouring oil on the flaming fire of discontent. In this case, he has one last hope: The parliament of the new term will cancel the previously announced presidential elections. At present, when the election campaign is merely beginning to "get in gear," the editorial office is receiving a multitude of letters and calls from the localities concerning all kinds of violations and contrivances on the part of the nomenklatura: undisguised sabotage, obstruction of meetings between candidates and the people, delays in processing documents, and so on. The method of "neutralizing" particular democratic candidates by nominating "doubles" is widespread. For example, if a doctor of sciences who is a democrat registers in a district, it is countered with another doctor. If you are a colonel, we will nominate a general. Let the people wrack their brains later. Or else, a complete joke: Rukh is fielding a candidate, a metal worker named Nikolay Nikolayevich Levchenko, and the local bureaucracy hustled and found a worthy rival for him, likewise Nikolay Nikolayevich, and likewise Levchenko, except that he is a milling machine operator. On the ballot, their last names will appear next to each other. If we were to try projecting the overall picture, I think that left-wing forces, the Communists and the Socialists, will dominate the parliament. This is logical in a way. Within a comparatively short period of time our society has travelled the path from euphoria to disappointment and pessimism. Impoverished, undernourished, poorly clad people who have lost faith and are tired of instability are instinctively backing up in order to return to life as it was, though "the boat has already been missed." Since the Communists-Socialists are not up to offering any alternative creative idea, they are doomed to a crushing defeat, just like the national-radicals at present. Paradoxical as it is, it might be better for them to win the election after all, and to form their own government. Two or three years from now it will be possible to ask: "Well, our Communist friends, what has been accomplished?" This will be when they will be forced to retire forever from the political arena. I believe that such a scenario is still better than the current one, whereby anything and everything is being exported from Ukraine, the country is on the brink of disaster, but those responsible are nowhere to be found because one is sick, another stupid, and yet another is just an "acting" official.
