Are there actual specialized positions and jobs awaiting these youth or will the appointees turn into more of the masked unemployed with which ministries and government agencies abound? Is there demand for appointment? How will the appointees be treated in terms of salaries and social allowances? How did the youth spend the recent years before their turn to be appointed arrived? Appointment to Real Jobs Muhammad Amin Mahfuz, general director of employment at the Ministry of Manpower, has said, "For the first time, this year we are following a new policy of appointment to real jobs in order to meet actual needs. Youth with high school diplomas will be appointed according to grade point average and those with college degrees, according to general evaluation. Unlike what happened in past years, not all graduates of the same year will be appointed, because this system has proved to be a failure and because it has resulted in masked unemployment that saddles the government with enormous financial burdens, with nothing produced in return. This year, there is an actual need to make a total of 54,066 appointments in order to meet the shortage in a number of government agencies, including the Ministry of Education, al-Azhar, local government agencies, the Ministries of Health, Social Affairs, and Agriculture, the Public Book Authority, and the Higher Youth and Sports Council. The Ministry is committed to making these appointments by the end of April. The Domestic Employment Department has prepared its plan to complete the appointment of graduates from among the graduates of 1983 to 1993. Different levels of qualification are required from the classes graduating in different years. [High school and college level] qualifications are required of 1983 graduates. College degrees are required of 1984 graduates (like this year's main class). From the years 1985 to 1993, honors graduates are needed. "For example, graduates of Islamic law colleges, law schools, arts sections, documentation, and library sections from 1984 to 1993 [will be appointed]. Graduates of 1992 were appointed last year, and 1993 graduates, as well as graduates from previous years who haven't been given jobs, will be appointed this year. Graduates of English, Arabic, French, and other language sections and of al-Azhar colleges from 1984 to 1992 will also be appointed. The required number of appointees from each educational level will be selected according to specialization and from the year entitled to appointment, and then from subsequent years." New Unemployment "Even though this new system will, as Muhammad Mahfuz says, eliminate the masked unemployment phenomenon because it calls for appointment to meet actual needs, it may lead to unemployment among graduates of colleges which aren't in demand, such as schools of arts and oriental language schools. This requires correction of the educational direction (as a long-term plan) to make it compatible with the market's actual needs and to give the new generations skills that enable them to work for themselves on the one hand and, on the other hand, to create new venues for the appointment of these graduates in small projects. "This correction also requires focusing on the role of conversion training to divert employees toward truly productive jobs and to create private sector associations so each association will appoint its own members, solve their problems, conduct feasibility studies for their projects, and train them. There is no doubt that the ministry has a role to play in drafting plans for projects to be undertaken by graduates. A conversion training plan (for a two-month training course) has been prepared with the Ministry of Education for graduates of psychology, philosophy, and oriental languages so they will be trained on documentation and library tasks and will work as librarians. No plan has been drawn up yet for graduates of other theoretical colleges and high schools. However, there is an urgent need for such a plan, especially when we learn that high school graduates represent 75 percent of the unemployed [graduates] generally. College graduates represent just 12 percent and graduates with above high school diplomas represent the remaining 13 percent. We must note here, as the general director of internal employment has said, that vocational conversion training must be compatible with every group of graduates independently. Else, we must enhance the qualification level of the graduates of each group within their own specialization so as to make them compatible with the private sector's needs. "As for the financial position of the graduates who are to be appointed, they will collect the established salaries, namely 64.80 [pounds] as a basic salary for college graduates and 51.30 pounds as a basic salary for graduates with high school diplomas. Social and periodic allowances will be certainly added to these salaries. Law No. 47 of 1978 will apply to the appointees and they will be granted legal seniority as of 1 February 1994, giving them the full opportunity to receive their first allowance as of 1 July 1995." Demand for Appointment As to the degree of demand for these appointments, Mahmud 'Askar, chairman of the section for appointment of graduates with a business diploma at the Ministry of Manpower, has said that there is an extremely strong demand for the jobs and that some of the applicants are unemployed and others are actually employed in the private sector but wish to either combine this employment with government employment or to completely give up the former and take up the latter. Some of the applicants even avoid making insurance payments of their own volition and avoid insuring themselves while employed in the private sector so as to get the opportunity for government employment when their turn comes. It is well known that an insured private-sector worker is totally excluded from government employment. Moreover, we do not exaggerate if we assert that some groups, especially self-employed free professionals, avoid insuring themselves so as to get an opportunity to work for the government and then to carry on with their self-employment after official work hours. 'Askar went on to add that all applications will be checked by computer at the Ministry of Social Affairs to verify whether applicants are or are not actually employed, so vacant positions will be filled by the unemployed and not by people who wish to combine two jobs. Youths' Opinion We had to interview a sampling of the youth who have applied for appointment, especially 1983 or 1984 graduates who have spent nearly 10 years awaiting a letter from the Ministry of Manpower and who have been forced to take up jobs totally unrelated to their specializations. To begin, we assert that clinging to government employment has been the basic thread binding all graduates we have interviewed. However, their justifications and their wishes vary in this regard. Some wish to give up their private sector work altogether and others wish to combine it with government employment. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Atiyah Muhammad, who got a BS in chemistry in 1984, works as a railroad conductor. He has said, "My wages from my work amount to 200 pounds monthly because I get additional wages for fines that I collect. I know that my government salary will not amount to one-half this sum. However, I wish to work in my field of specialization, which I love, and I am prepared to give up my current job for its sake." Layla Mahmud al-Qirabi, who got a licence [equivalent of MA] in English literature in 1989, works as a switch operator at a major hotel and earns 350 pounds monthly. She wishes to work as a teacher, and she is willing to accept a salary that will not exceed 86 pounds under any circumstance. She has said, "I have to sacrifice the big salary from my current job because this job requires me to work evening and morning shifts, which isn't convenient to me as a wife and a mother. I am looking for government work that ensures me comfort, regular work hours, and maternity leave." Ramzi Judah 'Abd-al-Baqi, who got a business diploma in 1983, is a citizen of al-Sharqiyah Governorate. He has been unable to work in his governorate due to the lack of employment opportunities there. So, he came to Cairo and worked at a restaurant and confectionery. When his turn to be appointed by the Ministry of Manpower came, he did not hesitate to apply and to express his willingness to leave his current job, which pays him 300 pounds monthly. Ramzi justifies his willingness by pointing out that his work is extremely demanding and that he works 12-15 hours daily. Moreover, he feels that the job is unstable and insecure and he fears that the business owner may terminate his contract at any moment. Family Appearance Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Sa'idi, who obtained a business diploma in 1983 and who works as a tile layer, has said, "I hate this job. I have been forced to work in it in order to spend on my needs. I collect 20 pounds daily or 600 pounds monthly. But now I wish to work in my field of specialization so as to preserve proper family and social appearances." Mujdi Mahmud, who received a BA in commerce and business management in 1984 and who works as a teacher at a private school, wishes to be appointed by the Ministry of Manpower so he can get his full due, in terms of promotion, allowances, and the right to do rotations, plus wages for the entire year. In his current position, Mahmud gets no salary for the school summer vacation months. Nabil Khalifah, a French language graduate in 1985, works as a security officer at a major five-star hotel. He has said, "I don't wish to give up my current job, in which my work ends at 0600. I can then go to my government job and secure a reasonable monthly salary with which to face the high cost of living. Moreover, government jobs are stable." Samir Fadil 'Abd-al-Jawad, who got a BS in geology in 1984 and who works as a typist at a private company, has said, "I wish to work in the government in the morning and then carry on with my current job after the official work hours because this job is a source of livelihood for me and my family. This is, in any case, better than going abroad." Problem of Laws Dr. 'Izzah Karim, a sociologist at the National Social and Criminal Research Center, has said, "In the youth's mind, employment in the private or public sector has a specific significance and specific logic that are based on the Egyptian society's laws and circumstances. The pursuit of government jobs started with the inception of the 1952 revolution and with application of the socialist system. This system strengthens the government sector with laws that regulate it and ensure a stable monthly salary, insurance, and pensions in case of sickness or death. These laws do not permit the dismissal of a worker except under extreme circumstances, and they do not require full and conditional productivity. These guarantees motivate the youth to seek government employment. This is in contrast with the private sector whose regulations cause the youth constant anxiety, even though this sector's wages are high. But the wage may be unstable and may depend on profit. Moreover, the assurances that the private sector worker gets may not be enough to make this worker feel secure about his future and old age. Therefore, youth cannot be blamed if they are determined to pursue government employment. "As for combining private and government employment, it can be excusable despite its numerous demerits--most significant of which is that the worker is required to exert a redoubled effort which could damage his health and cause him to be delinquent in performing his duties to himself, his family, and his society. Another demerit is that this worker denies other unemployed people the opportunity for real employment at a time when we are experiencing high unemployment. If we view this matter more logically, we can perhaps find an excuse for youth who do not wish to tackle the difficult task of balancing a rewarding income from the private sector on the one hand with security and stability from government employment on the other hand." Wasteful Spending Here, Dr. 'Izzah Karim raises another point connected with the same issue, namely the years spent by the youth while waiting for appointment. These years are either spent in true unemployment--and there is no doubt that 10 years of unemployment are sure to destroy the youth educationally and psychologically and to turn them into a time bomb threatening to explode at any moment because the youth feel intellectually empty and unable to contribute to society--or spent in a job totally unrelated to the youth's specialization and field of studies. Even though this is less harmful than complete unemployment, it is still an enormous problem because it represents money spent wastefully by the government. This is a problem because it means that all the money spent on the student throughout the various phases of education goes to waste and no benefit is derived from this spending. Moreover, the worker [graduate student] works in a job he does not like, to which he does not belong, that does not satisfy his identity, and that afflicts him with psychological diseases that make him want to retaliate against society. This is definitely a problem of a government that grants high school certificates and that does not create work opportunities to absorb people with such certificates, despite the numerous work opportunities in Egypt. We should keep in mind that we live on just 4 percent of Egypt's area and that the other 96 percent remains unproductive and absorbs no manpower. Thus, the problem lies in the poor population distribution and not in population growth. Finally, the sociologist at the National Social Research Center offers a prescription to overcome this crisis that Egypt experiences annually. She says that the solution lies in two things: first, have the government begin drafting public sector laws that protect this sector's labor at all levels so people will seek employment in the sector seriously and more courageously. The problem is a problem of laws and not of the nature of work in the sector. Second, attention must not be confined to the overcrowded mother governorates but must be directed to the new governorates that are capable of absorbing the youth's capabilities and that can employ the youth and enable him to achieve immense productivity far from the government sector.
