Malevanyy, editor in chief of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA; place and date not given: "Zhumagul Saadanbekov: `I Belong to That Generation of Politicians Who Are Returning From the Market'"] [Text] Instead of a Preface I worked with Zhumagul Saadanbekov for many years. I have seen him in various situations. And I can testify: You cannot conduct his level of politics on such (excuse me) trash as tribalism. It is too simple and absurd. But what, nonetheless, happened? Why has his name been cropping up in the press in recent weeks in connection specifically with tribalism, against which, it will be recalled, he spoke violently and furiously, obeying his conscience and convictions? Zh. Saadanbekov himself answers these and other questions today. I am confident that the inquisitive reader, scrutinizing his answers, will judge intelligently and soberly and will understand what is what. [Signed] A. Malevanyy, editor in chief of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA. [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, how did it happen that one day you suddenly became the personification of tribalism? [Saadanbekov] Everyone knows the traditional methods of any opposition. There is populism here, and the fight against privileges, and the accusations of corruption and of tribalism, and other innumerable "isms." The people, thank God, are already developing a certain immunity to this kind of manifestation of opposition combat. But why did my generally inoffensive declaration to the deputies of my oblast to stay behind in the hall for consultations during the break evoke furious anger and indignation in the opposition camp, while at the same time very few reacted when the Supreme Council under the "flexible" leadership of the speaker encroached on the Constitution of the republic and rudely smashed it? The fact is that long before the session, while speaking on television, I predicted, and it turns out now very correctly, impending battles at the Supreme Council session. In particular, I said that it would become an arena of political fights of the two branches of authority--the representative and the executive--and the arena of a crudely selfish fight for portfolios in the government. I said this not because I have any kind of biased attitude toward the Supreme Council and its leadership. But because in all of the republics of the former USSR, the mutual relations of the legislative and executive branches of authority up to now developed or are developing sharply, and by means of conflict. And this is not accidental. Our society and our people were brought up under conditions of the monolithic authority of the CPSU. Even Zyuganov, the leader of the communists of Russia, today recognizes that the CPSU was not a party, but a monolithic hierarchical state structure. We did not know what the division of power was. We knew only one authority--the authority of the rayon political committees, the oblast political committees, and the Central Committee. After the August putsch of 1991, the CPSU left the political arena. All of the republics, based, of course, on good intentions, implemented the separation of three branches of authority. But it soon turned out that everywhere, with the exception, perhaps, of the Baltic republics, conditions did not mature for their civilized interaction. From Moldova and Ukraine to the very ends of Russia and Central Asia, a struggle for power evolved between the soviets and the executive structures. Everyone knows how it all ended. Parliament was dissolved in Russia with salvos from tank guns, and in Azerbaijan, just the opposite, the defeat of the executive structure was crowned with the flight of Elchibey. In Kazakhstan, this fight ended with the self-dissolution of the entire vertical of soviets, etc., and the like. Today, various politicians are talking profusely in the Supreme Council: They say that Kyrgyzstan is an exception in this process, that we have calm and plenty, that our "legendary" parliament does not think about power, etc. But then what kind of evil forces (having in mind Saadanbekov most of all) think and act otherwise. Indeed, a lot of them! The very first day of the Supreme Council session fully confirmed my assumptions. Unexpectedly for many, it began with the report of the speaker and demands for his resignation. But this kind of outcome was prevented. And at this point, an unheard-of tragicomedy unfolded, an inevitable fight for the chair of the prime minister and ministerial portfolios. Everything was put into motion--from violations of procedure and the Constitution to threats by individual deputies. His majesty "Interest" united everyone--leftist extremists and social democrats, liberals and orthodox communists, political plebeians and the political elite. The decisive force was a vector consisting of three components: 1. The offended, or the so-called "BU" [previously discharged]; 2. Contenders for portfolios; 3. Individual very contradictory, but powerful, regional forces. And what is most important, all of them concurred with the desires and interests of the higher leadership of the Supreme Council. This "Afanasyev majority" was opposed by 104 deputies from all regions of the republic. Among them is national poet Zhalil Sadykov, the well-known entrepreneur Yu. Dunlarov, the prominent public and political figure Zh. Akimaliyev, the heads of rayon administrations B. Silayev, Zh. Zhamankulov, and others. [Malevanyy] And nevertheless, what have you to do with it, and where did this label of tribalism come from? [Saadanbekov] As I already said, it was I who, even before the session, disclosed both the global and the specific reasons for the impending fight for power; I sharply criticized the Presidium of the Supreme Council and many parties and movements that directly or indirectly are exaggerating the notorious question of gold for unseemly purposes. Could they excuse me for all of this? No. They waited for an opportune moment in order to deliver a blow. And they found it. They charged that my statement to the deputies of Issyk-Kul Oblast was the sin of tribalism. Almost a half million multiethnic and multifaced people live in our oblast, and it is absurd to attribute some kind of one-dimensional mentality to its deputy staff. The deputation of the oblast represents very opposite positions. For example, Deputies Idinov, Kalashnikov, Novikov, and many others not only did not support, but even fought against the position of the 104 deputies. Incidentally, among the 104 deputies, a little more than 30 are from Issyk-Kul Oblast. But if we are talking substance, then, of course, tribalism is regional egoism--it is an evil, and it is our misfortune, about which I speak continuously and consistently. And I not only talk, but I also act. In the last year and a half to two years, we were the first in the oblast to begin the rotation of the chief of the rayon administrations. The now-deceased Madiyev Eshimkan, the chief of administration of Issyk-Kulskiy Rayon, was from Talass Oblast, and the present head of this same rayon, Mukhtarov Erkin, is a native of Osh Oblast. The chief of the oblast UVD [administration of internal affairs]--People's Deputy M. Abdyldayev--is a native Bishkekian, and several chiefs of oblast administrations come from Narynsk and Chu Oblasts, and so on. Almost half of the personnel and the managerial staff of the power structures are also from other oblasts of the republic. [Malevanyy] You are being blamed for protecting former Prime Minister T. Chyngyshev and that for the sake of keeping him in his post you almost used forceful means to compel the deputies of Issyk-Kul Oblast to vote collectively for confidence in Chyngyshev's government. Is he really from the same place that you are? And what kind of letter is it that was signed by 104 deputies in defense of the prime minister, which, as is asserted, was organized by you? [Saadanbekov] Yes, Chyngyshev is from the same place I am. But if someone else were in his place, for example, Eshmatov from Osh Oblast, I would just as fiercely defend him as I would Chyngyshev in the same situation. Deputy Sh. Mambetov is also from the same place I am. I think that he did a lot of damage to the Kumtor contract. And if a person from another region were in his place, I would fight against him exactly as against Mambetov. Chyngyshev left. A new government was formed. It was headed by Apas Dzhumagulov, an experienced administrator, and a loyal and moderate politician. I believe that he will become a consolidating figure, uniting all forces. When I am accused of tribalism, I recall the plenum of the Central Committee on the eve of the first session of the Supreme Council of this convocation. At that time, the party apparatus, the KGB, and other repressive organs were omnipotent and mighty. But at that time, I came out against all of them and put forth the candidacy of Apas Dzhumagulovich for the post of chairman of the Supreme Council as an alternative to A. Masaliyev. Persecution, shadowing, and prosecution started. A little later I established and headed the "deputy group of 114." The Supreme Council approached the presidential elections through our efforts. There were three contenders in the first stage: A. Masaliyev, Dzh. Amanbayev, and A. Dzhumagulov. It was precisely at my initiative as the manager of the group that our faction fought for Dzhumagulov, and not for Amanbayev, who comes from my area. Where in those difficult times were today's ardent fighters for democracy and enemies of tribalism? As for those 104 deputies about whom you are asking, they united in behalf of the defense of the Constitution, but not for the defense of Chyngyshev or other persons. All it takes is to violate the Constitution one time, when the destructive process will begin to reshape it thoroughly. That is why when the Supreme Council, after violating the Constitution, knocked Chyngyshev out of his post, the president was compelled to request the resignation of the entire government. In this way, he saved the face not so much of Chyngyshev as of the Supreme Council, and he saved the Constitution. [Malevanyy] Do you yourself belong to any kind of a party? [Saadanbekov] No. [Malevanyy] How did you interpret the statement of the leaders of political parties and movements, in which they insist on removing you from the position of oblast chief of administration? [Saadanbekov] Most of all, it is amazing and amusing. I long ago thought that we were living under a democratic system, and that the Bolshevist method of selection had vanished in the summer. It seems that the danger of a return of 1937 has not passed. It appears that I am threatening the state integrity of the republic, and that it is necessary therefore to dismiss me from the post of the chief of administration immediately. And people are writing this who consider themselves democrats. Incidentally, among them are E. Aliyev and Zh. Zheksheyev, who come from the same area that I do. Not knowing this themselves, the signers drove themselves into an ideological swamp. There is a new century outside and fresh winds of democracy, but they are arming themselves with the Bolshevist club of violence. In essence, both the extreme right and the extreme left radicals are Bolsheviks, only with a different symbol. [Malevanyy] In your time, you were one of the creators in the Supreme Council of the opposition platform of the "group of 114"; that is, you rendered definite services to democracy and the "silk revolution" that took place in the country. And suddenly everything is forgotten and discarded, and a wave force of nine of rejection both from the side of part of the deputy corps as well as of political parties is being raised around your name. What has caused this, the change of direction of your positions to the right, an evolution of views, or do you see something else here, and what specifically, then? [Saadanbekov] It is necessary to look into the peculiarities of mass psychology. You recall when, at the last session of the Supreme Council of the previous convocation, I was one of the first to raise the question about national state sovereignty and about a state language, literally an explosion occurred in the social conscience, and here, there, and everywhere they applauded, standing. You remember the story with Khrustalov's notorious article "Duplicity," when I, risking everything, defended the right of the existence of national traditions and customs, and society applauded warmly at that time. Society accepted and applauded when we completed, as they say, the "silk revolution." But apparently the social nature of the mass psychology is such that a lot is forgotten quickly. I saw with my own eyes how people calmly gazed at the swastika that adorned the walls, they read fascist leaflets, laughing while walking along and, shrugging their shoulders, went past a mob that declared: "We are the black hundred." To what extent have people forgotten everything! They have forgotten the known and unknown soldiers who believed that they were fighting against fascism, and they betrayed them. They betrayed relatives and friends, the millions who perished on the GULAG islands and indifferently looked at the rallies of Anpilov and Barkashov. Only in a society that is stricken with a lack of memory and an absence of disgust can be like this. But Kyrgyzstan's umbilical cord is still firmly tied to that society where for the time being the Zhirinovskiys are winning victories. You talk of my rejection by a part of the deputy corps. And here the psychological effect begins to work--the effect of delayed vengeance. Perhaps they can really forgive one of the authors of the "silk revolution"; that is, those who still yearn for the "golden age" of stagnation, those who lost their party chairs and privileges. Perhaps the new aggrieved and the new "previously discharged persons" can forgive me when I still find myself in the epicenter of democratic reforms, which are moving slowly, with difficulty, and that frequently run into rejection by the broad masses. And more. I am one of those who frequently dares to say unpopular and painful things in the interests of the psychic health of society. Social conscience cannot base itself on stereotypes and fraud. Individual political parties, for example, are betting on national prejudices and antipathies. I cannot reconcile myself with such a statement of the question, and I criticize them openly. I also criticize for primitive populism, for neo-Bolshevist ways, for the lack of clear political positions and a social base. And it is understandable why they undertook a reprisal against the obstinate Saadanbekov in an organized way. As for my positions and views, of course, they are changing and are corrected in the channel of the dialectics of real life. But the core of my position was and remains common sense everywhere and pragmatism in everything. [Malevanyy] I happened to hear that your trip to Canada this year allegedly was financed by Kameko and that henceforth you are obligated to this firm. Is this so? [Saadanbekov] The trip to Canada was official. For nine days I visited mines, pits, enterprises, and projects of institutes, banks, and funds of the Kameko firm. We were shown in detail the conditions of life and labor of the workers, we were shown the newest technologies, dwellings, and the infrastructure that it is planned to introduce in Kumtor. We discussed future variants of accommodating manpower, food, transport, building, and material technical support for implementing the Kumtor project. The Kameko Corporation is one of the world's largest producers of uranium working at low costs. Moreover, it is engaged in prospecting for and extracting copper, zinc, and diamonds. Kameko's property on 1 January 1993 was valued at $1.3 billion. According to the results of nine months of this year, the net income of the company totaled $197.8 million, as compared with $184.3 million for the corresponding period in 1992. According to the data of expert organizations, Kameko is easily able to invest up to $100 million per year. And this investor, recognized in the whole world, has been subjected to insults in our country for more than half a year, and it is slanderously suspected of all kinds of thinkable and unthinkable sins. Do the enemies of this project realize what immeasurable damage and what kind of unjustified offense they are committing against their own people and their future, if this corporation leaves us due to their pressure? [Malevanyy] What is your estimate of the political situation in the republic? Do you think that the change in government will play a stabilizing role? Your prognosis for the near future? [Saadanbekov] The political situation, if it is examined in a global context, is normal. A quite normal democratic struggle for power is going on in a normal democratic society. Only in this struggle, a neo-Bolshevist propensity for reprisal against dissidents is not permissible. I think that the change in government and an especially successful outcome of the forthcoming referendum will stabilize the situation more profoundly. Regarding the prognosis, this is a thankless and very tricky undertaking. It is better to live with hope and faith. This is simply necessary for a person in our difficult time. [Malevanyy] You are frequently reproached for political ambition: It is said that you see yourself at one moment in the speaker's position, then in the chair of the prime minister, and even in the chair of the president. And that you are subordinating today's tactics to the achievement of one of these aims, and that you are even conducting some kind of behind-the-scenes game. What do you say in this regard? [Saadanbekov] There is a Russian proverb that says: "People are coming from the market, but Nazar is going to the market." I already belong to that generation of politicians that are returning from the market. It is necessary to clear the way for the young. We have talented and very promising youth. It is necessary to foster and continuously cultivate them. Not to interfere, and not to trip them up, as our individual Nazars are doing today. Thus, I assure you that I have no pretensions to the aforementioned posts. At the session of the Supreme Soviet, when a president was being elected, I was the only one who removed his candidacy out of moral considerations, and I advised the leaders of the Central Committee at that time to follow my example. They did not heed me, and they suffered defeat. It is my profound conviction that politics should be built on principles of morality. I do not acknowledge the position that politics is really dirty work, but we, they say, are clean. It is this kind of approach that makes politics dirty. But it should be the opposite, work that is very clean and a service to the citizens. We must not leave this sphere of work to people who are dishonorable; this will cause damage, it is a betrayal of the intellect itself, and the abandonment of responsibility for the world around us. Politics should be engaged in by people who are the most selfless and the most sagacious, the kind who better than others see the common connection in various phenomena. As for my political ambition and my kind of behind-the-scenes games, this is being written about by two or three inveterate yellow-press newspapers. I do not read the hogwash with which they regale a narrow circle of readers, holding them to be loonies. I am a normal person who has his work, thoughts, family, hopes, and faith, and, therefore, I am not interested in the ideological prostitution of aggressive ignoramuses who thirst, as the classic often used to say, "to play a role" at any price. [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, in light of the recent elections in Russia, what will be the fate of democracy in our country, and will it not collapse under the weight of economic conditions and political reprisals? [Saadanbekov] Some kind of cave-in has occurred with these elections in Russia. It is very difficult to rethink and realize all of this, but one thing is clear. Democracy suffered a serious defeat. And it serves the democrats of Russia right. As it is here, they have not had unity for a long time, and they literally fought among themselves. Many democrats stood on the sidelines in a struggle that was going on not for life, but to the death between the representative and executive branches of power. But the same thing, if not worse, is going on in our republic in the democratic camp. Few of the democrats remain, as they say, of the first callup, the first wave, with genuine democratic convictions. Some slammed the door loudly and made for the near abroad, and others head the opposition to the government. Still others, working in the executive structure, show themselves to be in no way better than the former officials. The democratic movement today abounds in selfish, arrogant, and foolish people. The people are tired of their dilettantism, from the complex of failures who on a wave of criticism became deputies and entered the government structure, but who cannot work. They replace genuine activity with the appearance of activity. Because these people, from one side and the other, do not know how to work. Some of them absolutely do not fit the position they occupy; therefore, they put everything they have into a fight with someone. But if you are fighting with somebody, you do not have to work, and then it is sufficient to devise scathing arguments against one's opponent. All of them joined the democrats, when this was safe and even prestigious, and it also promised dividends. After all, there is nothing more gratifying than to join the victor, and to stand under victorious banners. This turn left a mark on both the character of the movement and on its individual activists. I think that today's leaders of the democratic movement are capable of realizing the situation and that they will draw the appropriate conclusions, that they will achieve unity and agreement within their ranks, and that they will shift its activity onto constructive and creative tracks. Today, no matter who we are according to party convictions, we should have one aim--to lead the country out of the economic crisis. To throw all our forces into a revival of the economy. Because the economy contains in itself the greatest capability for organizing society. When people are engaged in work, they do not have the time to be involved with nonsense.
