In a radio and television interview this morning, Mr. Adeli, the governor of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Central Bank, announced: Following negotiations with the representatives of some Japanese companies, an agreement was signed in the early hours of this morning, Tehran time, between an Iranian delegation from the Central Bank and representatives of the Japanese companies. He added: This document will provide Iran with more than $2 billion in credit to pay Japanese exporters. Mr. Adeli said: The credit is for a period of around two years and repayment period is three and a half years, which makes a total of five and a half years. The Central Bank governor also said: Two weeks ago a similar $2.6 billion agreement was signed with Germany, which will help our country pay off more than 50 percent of its postponed credits. He said the cost of those credits is just over 4 percent per year. He stated that Central Bank delegations are currently holding talks with other countries to pave the way for negotiations. The people will be informed as soon as other agreements are signed. Mr. Adeli added: The signing of the documents allows Iran to postpone the expiry dates of its condensed and short-term credits [e'tebarat] which were not repaid in 1992, 1993, and 1994 due to the fall in oil prices. He said: We expect to pay off all our postponed payments to exporters of those two countries within the next couple of months. Therefore goods which were not dispatched because of nonpayment will gradually be sent. The Central Bank governor went on to say: A group of importers and production companies used to purchase their foreign currency needs in the free market to pay off their debts. With the payment of debts to foreign exporters there will no longer be any need to do that. He said the signing of the agreements will reduce cash purchases and cut foreign currency demands in the free market. He added: It is expected that some cases of limitation imposed by a number of countries on government insurance will resume. He stressed: Obviously countries that provide insurance cover to facilitate their trade transactions with Tehran will be given a greater share of the Iranian market in the future and will be given priority over other countries.
