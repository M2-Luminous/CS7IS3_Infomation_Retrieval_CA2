The State Council gave final approval for a programme spelling out more specifically what tax collectors can do to gather revenues, the State Administration of Taxation said. The State Council, China's cabinet, wants tax collectors to have broader authority in order to increase State revenue and better regulate the market economy. Tax collectors are also asked to foster a growing sense of tax obligations among the public. Although the country's tax revenues registered steady growth in recent years, tax collectors still struggle with tax evaders, among them both enterprises and individuals. The administration seeks to speed up tax collection and help sustain fast and healthy development of the national economy. The administration will increase its involvement in drafting tax laws, regulations and detailed rules, and studying, improving and implementing the tax reform programme. The changes are also expected to strengthen the role of taxation in carrying out national industrial policies, readjusting the economic structure, and more rationally allocating resources to ensure fair competition. The goal is to establish a standardized and more rational tax collection system. By the end of February, the country's industrial and commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per cent from the corresponding period of last year.
