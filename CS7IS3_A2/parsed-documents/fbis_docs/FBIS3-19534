FBIS3-19534 "drweu053_i_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-053 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 FRANCE Statistics Institute Revises Growth Forecast Upwards BR1703135694 Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in French 17 Mar 94 p 11 BR1703135694 Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS Language: French Article Type:BFN [Text] The National Statistics Institute (INSEE) yesterday slightly increased its short-term growth forecasts in France, but stuck to its projection for unemployment--which it expects to continue to rise in the first half of this year--and for inflation, which is expects to slow further. According to the new forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) should rise by an average of 0.7 percent over the six months from January to June, whereas, in December, INSEE was predicting growth of just 0.5 percent. If activity continues to progress at the same rate of 0.7 percent in the second half of the year, GDP would rise by 1.3 percent as a yearly average in 1994 over 1993. This slight recovery would, however, be insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment, which is expected to reach 12.7 percent of the active population at the end of June, as opposed to 12.2 percent at the end of December. According to INSEE, the total number of jobs fell by 260,000 in 1993, a fall of 1.2 percent after the fall of 1.1 percent in 1992. The fall included 215,000 salaried jobs cut in non-agricultural sectors (down by 1.5 percent). INSEE noted that, in the second half of 1993, the number of stable jobs cut was similar to that for the first half (down by 80,000), although the creation of insecure jobs rose slightly (up 15,000, as opposed to the cut of 60,000 in the first half). Overall, INSEE's revised its growth forecasts slightly upward because the increase in household consumption and foreign trade was more vigorous than expected. Foreign trade, which initially was not expected to contribute to growth, rose by 0.1 percent on a six month average. Germany no longer acts as the engine of growth. According to the forecast, the fall in German activity recorded at the end of 1993 should extend into the first half of 1994. Economic activity should be propped up by the United States and through a stabilization of European domestic demand, in particular thanks to the halt in the decline of investments. French exports are up, especially to high-growth zones. Moreover, they are benefit from an improvement in the European economy. According to surveys of European employers, foreign demand among France's main trading partners (the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, and Spain) has risen above the average for the last 10 years. INSEE expects French household consumption to rise by 0.4 percent on a six month average, as opposed to the 0.3 percent predicted in December. Car purchases also outstripped December's forecast. The savings rate, after peaking at the start of 1993 at 13.8 percent, then fell continually to reach 12.5 percent at the end of 1993. INSEE, however, expects that this rate will level off in the first half of 1994.
