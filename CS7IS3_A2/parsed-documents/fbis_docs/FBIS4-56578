In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Bob Monde conveyed his disappointment with the Democratic congressmen's attitude of the Black Caucus, who want to impose -- even through genocide and force of arms -- a so-called solution to the Haitian crisis. In his letter to President Clinton, the president of the Chamber of Deputies points out President Aristide's obvious tendency toward provoking an upheaval within the command staff of the Haitian Armed Forces by soliciting on the very day of his installation [7 February 1991] the dismissal of the entire military command of that time and by demanding five months later the resignation -- under pressure -- of the commander in chief of the Army, General Herard Abraham who was replaced by Gen. Raoul Cedras. Cedras was appointed provisionally, something that the Constitution does not provide for, Monde points out. While looking for a solution that can put an end to the distress of the Haitian people before the accelerated deterioration of their living conditions, the office of the Chamber of Deputies initiated a series of consultations with the various sectors in order to fill the institutional vacuum created by the departure of Robert Malval, Bob Monde further states. It is no longer time for war, writes Bob Monde, but for peace, the noble objective for which the United Nations was created. In conclusion Robert Monde says: I appeal to the wisdom and the clear-sightedness of the head of state of the most powerful country of the world so he does not let himself be influenced by those men who -- all things considered -- are exploiting the Haitian crisis, the anguish, and the misery of the Haitian people to seek and defend their own interests. Thus concludes the letter Chamber President Frantz Robert Monde sent to U.S. President William Jefferson Clinton.
