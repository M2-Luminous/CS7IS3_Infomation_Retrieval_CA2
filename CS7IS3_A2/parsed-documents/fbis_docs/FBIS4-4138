The proposal was declared by Pak Kil-yon, DPRK permanent representative to the UN, when reading out an official statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry. The statement said the recent move by the U.S. to ship "Patriot" missiles and a squadron of "Apache" helicopters constitute severe violation of the Korean armistice, which required non-introduction of any operational material from abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean peninsula. "Now that they have failed to live up to their responsibility for stabilizing the situation on the Korean peninsula and curbing military buildup there and they have been used for covering up the United States' policy of strangling DPRK," the statement said, "there is an absolute necessity for establishing a peace arrangment." The statement added that such a new agreement could "prevent arms buildup or recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and reliably guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula on a practical basis." It called on the UN to respond to the proposal.
