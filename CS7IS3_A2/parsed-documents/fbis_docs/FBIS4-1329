The Electoral Act stipulates that at least 200 of the assembly seats are to be determined from political parties' regional lists for the national assembly. Parties are entitled to also submit a national list of candidates for up to 200 seats. This allowed parties such as the ANC to draw up a list of 200 candidates from a broad spectrum of people at its head office that are not necessarily regionally based. The NP was the only party that opted for the second method of determining its national assembly seats -- arguing that by submitting only regional lists it showed its commitment to a federal system. It is estimated that, assuming a 100 percent poll, each 55,000 votes will be worth one seat in the assembly. This is calculated by taking the estimated 22.2-million eligible voters, divided by 400 seats. All parties expect the NP will have their seats in the assembly determined by, firstly, taking the total number of votes cast for their parties respectively divided by, say, 55,000, to determine the number of seats they will have in the national assembly. Half of these seats won will be filled by those on their national lists. The rest of their seats will be filled from their respective regional lists of candidates for the national assembly. This will be determined by taking the respect regional tally of votes won by each party and dividing this by 55,000, to give the proportion of seats that party can fill in the national assembly from that region.
