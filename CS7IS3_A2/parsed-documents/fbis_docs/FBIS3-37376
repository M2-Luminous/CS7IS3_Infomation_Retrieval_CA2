The Party's chairman Vyacheslav Grechnev told the congress delegates that the Party is being forced to protect the interests of the Russian middle class: representatives of the creative intellectuals, of small and medium businessmen, of youth, war and labor veterans, that is of the majority of Russia's population. The party is needed, said Grechnev, because the country faces the threat of annihilating a vital stratum of society. Russia is threatened by the prospect of becoming a country of the proletariat. Speakers said that the party was conservative and against radicalism of any form. The Party sees as its allies any political forces in the country are oriented around the priority of the state being the guarantor of freedom, the rights and dignity of its citizens. Grechnev said that during the next parliamentary elections the Party expects not simply to win seats in parliament, but to form a majority in it. The Party of the Majority has its representatives in 50 Russian regions, said its leader. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov sent a message of greetings to the delegates. Observers believe that the Party considers the possibility of nominating Luzhkov for presidency during the 1996 elections.
