Does this mean resignation? [Mock] It certainly does not mean resignation. There have been crises in the European Union [EU] in the past, but one must not regard it too lightly either. The atmosphere among the 12 member states is becoming increasingly difficult. We have a situation where the four rounds of negotiations with Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria have been concluded, and this cannot, so to speak, be used because there is a dispute between the 12 over the minority vote and the necessary number of votes. Therefore, I appealed very vigorously to President Pangalos. I said that we had come to Brussels three times. This was no joke. We noted three times that an agreement was not achieved. There is more at stake than a little more influence of one or another member state. However, I must say it is my impression that the majority of the EU states, excepting Spain and Britain, are resolutely sticking to their position, the position of the treaty. [Oberhauser] You are not the only one who has expressed dismay and concern. Let me put it like this: Kinkel, professional optimist and German foreign minister, says he is no longer prepared to predict whether the January 1995 entry date for the four members that one is striving for can be maintained. Do you think that it is still realistic? There are only a few days left. President Klepsch said on this program a few days ago that the whole thing has to be settled by early April. [Mock] I also had a long talk with Klepsch today and he assured me that the ratification proceedings could be compressed if the parliamentary groups agree. In that case, he thinks it is still possible. Actually, he was more optimistic than the members of the Commission, above all President Delors, or the members of the Council of Ministers. There they are openly talking about a possible major crisis. [Oberhauser] Why are the Britons so stubborn in this question? [Mock] You see, it is a fact that, in contrast to the general assumption, the voting rights of the medium-sized and small states are very strong. One must not forget that, when it becomes a member, Austria will have four votes in the Council of Ministers. We have more than 7 million inhabitants. Germany, with 80 million, has 10 votes. Britian is very concerned. It sees the danger that it will be at too much of a disadvantage, that it will have to pay a big country's share into the budget and to bear responsibility in many other respects, and that the medium-sized and small states will have too much say in determining the political course -- it cannot be that bad because otherwise the French and the Germans would also be concerned about it -- which is not the case. This is special behavior by the British, who always supported us in our efforts for membership. Thus, one really has to say that the whole thing is very complicated. [Oberhauser] You are a diplomat and -- I put it like this -- in Britain your party friends, the conservatives, are in power. Is there no opportunity to talk to the Britons on this level? They sit together with you in the European Democratic Union, for example. Or have there been negotiations on this level that have not been successful? [Mock] I assure you telephone conversations have been going back and forward all the time, not only with one's own party friends, but across party lines. It is an eminently political question, however, and it has also become somewhat a question of prestige. Therefore, there is a great danger the date for the ratification of the treaty will be missed. This problem will certainly also be solved. In the days when De Gaulle vetoed England's entry and on another occasion De Gaulle refused to go to Brussels no government member went to Brussels for six months. The EU even survived that. We are not here to deal with crises, however; we want to act. [Oberhauser] When you have talks, for example, with Prime Minister Major.... [Mock] Yes? [Oberhauser] Once again, how much chance is there of achieving the result you are striving for before this deadline? [Mock] Let us say fifty-fifty. You have rightly said that these are speculations. Next Saturday and Sunday, the ministers will meet in Greece with the new applicants for membership with whom the negotiations have been concluded. For the first time, we will participate in a Council of Ministers meeting. It would be somewhat macabre if one had to state on that occasion that we have lost one year. This crisis will also be solved, but the question is at what cost. [Oberhauser] However, Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, said a few days ago that it is a mistake to go ahead with this enlargement now. Is this not a background against which there is little hope for the whole thing? [Mock] I would say that the number of those -- I do not number Pangalos among them -- who believe that the EU should not be enlarged further is increasing. The problems are increasing and are becoming more difficult. This is what I always meant when I talked of a window. Either one manages to become a member or one will not manage it for a very long time. Last week, a Norwegian diplomat told me the following: If we had signed in 1972, it would have been far cheaper for us. Spain became a member before Norway and made demands regarding fishing waters. I do not want Austria to be forced to negotiate again when perhaps the Czech Republic or Poland make demands because they also want to become members. [Oberhauser] One final question, Mr. Foreign Minister: If all goes smoothly in Greece on Saturday, you will say that all has worked out well and nothing has happened. If all is not well, however, and the entry date of January 1995 for which one is striving cannot be maintained, what will be the consequences in terms of substance for Austria's efforts? For example, what effects do you expect on the mood of the population? [Mock] There will definitely be a certain disappointment. There is no doubt about it. However, if the objective is considered as worthwhile, one has to continue one's efforts. Today, compared with 1955, this treaty has been called the new state treaty for Austria. In those days, one traveled to Berlin and Moscow for 10 years. We did not have to travel for such a long time to get it this time. Unfortunately, we now have to watch how the creators of the EU are unable to come to agreement on one point. They will come to agreement, hopefully very soon. [Oberhauser] That is to say, your readiness to continue to travel to Brussels, if necessary, is unchecked? [Mock] Yes. [Oberhauser] Thank you for having been our guest.
