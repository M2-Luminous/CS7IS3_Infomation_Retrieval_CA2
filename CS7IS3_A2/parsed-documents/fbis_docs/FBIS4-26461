The state reform and opening-up policy has been an eye opener for this remote province. For this inland province, the construction of the markets has promoted exchanges and circulation of commodities between Gansu and other parts of China. Lanzhou, capital of the province, is now the biggest wholesale and commodity distribution center in northwest China, especially in garments, daily-use articles, manufactured goods and cloth materials. The Lanzhou Guanghui cloth material wholesale market is now one of the six biggest of its kind in China. Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture is one the biggest wholesale centers of leather, wool, timber and tea in the northwest. With rich resources of nonferrous minerals and petrochemical products, the northwest petrochemical market in Lanzhou is now the biggest in China. The brisk markets have also helped farmers to gauge the real value of their products such as apples, pears, dates and some precious Chinese medicinal herbs which sell well on the domestic market. Farmers in Gangu county have founded their own grain, edible oil, timber and garment markets. Increasing numbers of farmers have engaged in business and transportation. They have become more and more aware of the importance of market information in production.
