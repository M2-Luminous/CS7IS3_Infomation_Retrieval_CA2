In a report on the situation in the zone covered by the 7th Operations Group, Smail Terzic says that it is "very difficult in the zone. The aggressor is incessantly launching shells and destroying civilian buildings. Since the morning hours, he has fired about 2,000 shells on the defense lines and the towns of Tesanj and Maglaj. The situation in the zones covered by the 201st, 207th, 203d, and the 110th Glorious HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Brigade is fierce, but our brave fighters are withstanding all attacks. About 200 tank shells have been fired at the regions of Kriz, Obli Kamen, and Filipovici. Moreover, the enemy is bringing in new forces, mainly from Bosnian Krajina, and several dozen guns and mortars have been brought to the temporarily occupied region of Novi Seher. Since last night, two enemy batteries of 122mm and 150mm are present in the Potocani region, which means that the enemy has not given up his offensive." A studio announcer says that "our correspondent from Fojnica reports that at about 1100 [1000 GMT] today, 12 projectiles from a 128-mm multiple rocket launcher fell. Therefore, Ustasha artillery hit civilian targets in the town for the third time in a month. Some people are injured, but the final number is still not known. Ustasha snipers are particularly active and are opening fire along defense lines. They are active along the entire zone covered by the 310th Mountain Brigade."
