The meeting was attended by local government officials, representatives of some republican ministries and agencies, senior executives of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the Zugdidi, Tsalendzhikh and Chkhorotskus districts of western Georgia were ready for launching election campaign and holding elections. When elections to the republican parliament took place last October, the Central Electoral Commission ruled to postpone the polls indefinitely in some regions of western Georgia because of a tense political situation. At the time, these regions were under control of armed formations supporting Georgia's late ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Since then the situation in western Georgia has improved, which made it possible to fix a preliminary date of elections for July 12, 1994.
