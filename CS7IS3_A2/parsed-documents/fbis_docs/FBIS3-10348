In the transportation sector the two governments' representatives agreed to grant reciprocal access to trucks and trailers so they may use the facilities and terminals in each country. Tello and Ouellet recognized commercial drivers' licenses and reached an agreement on technical cooperation in the transportation sector. Minister Ouellet said the conflict in Chiapas will not prevent an increase in the flow of Canadian investments in Mexico. Four topics were discussed within the framework of the 10th Mexico-Canada Ministerial Meeting: politics, trade, transportation, and the agrarian-livestock sector. Regarding trade issues, the government representatives explored ways to increase the potential of an exchange in assets within the NAFTA negotiations. The Canadian foreign minister said his government intends to increase the trade of cereals, beef, cattle, agricultural products, canned fruits, and other agricultural food products. Canada exported $771 million to Mexico in 1992. This represents 37 percent of that country's sales abroad. This figure would increase to surpass the $1-billion mark if shipments are included. The export of Canadian manufactured products to Mexico increased almost 15 percent that year. Bilateral trade will substantially increase once NAFTA is implemented. Canada has launched the "Access to North America" initiative, a trade development program worth $27 million. Ouellet said his government intends to promote trade with small and medium- sized Canadian enterprises in the market opportunities given to that country. Telecommunications, plastics, machinery, tools, and metal engraving tool companies operate in Mexico. The same goes for agricultural and industrial products, particularly processed food and similar high-quality products, a significant opportunity that the Mexican market has granted Canadian companies. Regarding the transportation sector, Communications Ministers Douglas Young and Emilio Gamboa signed three memoranda of agreement to strengthen relations between Canada and Mexico and, consequently, expedite the flow of merchandise. Young explained that the three memoranda of agreement called for technical cooperation in the transportation sector, where Canada offers great advantages to Mexican transportation companies; reciprocal access to trucks and trailers for circulation in the two countries; and, he recognized, the use of Mexican commercial driving licenses in Canada. Referring to political issues, Ouellet said they discussed the situation at the national, regional, and world level. On the national level they reviewed the problem in Chiapas and he reviewed reports on those events, and the operation to solve the conflict. The Canadian foreign minister said his country's investments will not be negatively affected by an internal conflict because President Carlos Salinas de Gortari guaranteed it is a local problem that will be peacefully solved, and human rights will be fully respected. The foreign minister said he will take a report from the National Human Rights Commission, led by Jorge Madrazo, back to his country so his government may have firsthand knowledge of the causes and ways to settle the conflict. Moreover, Manuel Tello said the agreements signed within this bilateral framework will strengthen relations between the two countries; and he said the cultural and education exchange will be particularly intensified. At the end of the meeting Tello accepted holding the 11th ministerial meeting in Canada in 1995.
