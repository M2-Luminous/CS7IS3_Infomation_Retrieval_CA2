FR941222-1-00003 FR941222-1-00002 26 CFR Part 31 [EE&hyph;83&hyph;89] RIN 1545&hyph;AN57 Time for Furnishing Wage Statements on Termination of Employer's Operations AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations under sections 6051 and 6071 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 concerning the time for furnishing wage statements to both employees and the Social Security Administration upon the termination of an employer's operations. These proposed regulations will affect employers and their employees in the year the employer ceases to pay wages. These regulations will improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social Security Administration and the IRS. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by February 21, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (EE&hyph;83&hyph;89), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under sections 6051 and 6071 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed regulations are to be issued under the authority of sections 6051, 6071 and 7805. Explanation of Provisions The proposed regulations improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by generally requiring an employer that is required to file a final Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, to file Forms W&hyph;2, Wage and Tax Statement, and W&hyph;3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements, with SSA and to furnish Form W&hyph;2 to the employees at the same time the employer is required to file the final Form 941. Prior to 1978, employers had submitted quarterly tax returns to the IRS listing both the aggregate wages and taxes for all employees (Form 941) and each employee's name and Social Security number, showing the amount of wages paid to the employee for that quarter (Schedule A of Form 941 or Form 941A). The IRS forwarded Form 941A to SSA, which used it to post earnings to individual Social Security records. In order to minimize the burden on employers, Congress changed the requirement for submission of detailed wage statements from a quarterly to an annual basis, effective in 1978. As a result, under the current system, an employer submits quarterly tax returns (Forms 941) to the IRS listing the aggregate wages and taxes of all of its employees. Annual information returns are submitted to SSA listing the wages of each individual employee (Forms W&hyph;2, accompanied by Forms W&hyph;3 listing aggregate annual wages of all employees). A reconciliation problem arises when the aggregate wages on the annual reports to the SSA do not match the aggregate wages on the four quarterly reports submitted to the IRS. Where the wages reported to the IRS exceed the wages reported to SSA, this indicates a possible underreporting of social security wages to SSA. One source of these discrepancies is the termination by employers of their business operations. In some instances, employers that have gone out of business well before the due date for the annual filing of Form W&hyph;2 have failed to file Forms W&hyph;2 with SSA as required. These failures have occurred even though the employer might have filed one or more quarterly Forms 941 with the IRS during the year. In these cases, the failure to receive the Forms W&hyph;2 means SSA is unable to credit wages to the social security accounts of affected employees. This problem can be eliminated by requiring employers that terminate business operations to file Forms W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 at the time they are required to file the final Form 941. Generally, under ยง31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(1) of the existing regulations, the Form 941 is due on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the period (generally a calendar quarter) for which it is made. Thus, the Form 941 is generally due on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. There is a ten-day extension if the employer timely deposited the taxes due for the quarter. Section 31.6011(a)&hyph;6(a)(1) of the existing regulations requires an employer that ceases to pay wages in a quarter to mark and file the Form 941 for that quarter as a final return. The proposed regulations require an employer that is required to file a final Form 941 to provide Forms W&hyph;2 to the employees and Forms W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 to SSA at the same time that the employer is required to file the final Form 941. Different time frames apply to monthly Form 941 filers. Under ยง31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(2) of the existing regulations, if the district director notifies an employer that it is required to make monthly returns on Form 941 in lieu of quarterly returns, the Form 941 is due on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month following the period (generally a calendar month) for which it is made. For employers that are required to file Form 941 monthly, requiring the filing of the Forms W&hyph;2 at the same time as the final Form 941 might be unduly burdensome. Thus, the proposed regulations would not require a monthly filer to provide Forms W&hyph;2 to the employees until the end of the calendar month in which the final Form 941 is due, rather than by the fifteenth day of that month. The proposed regulations leave in place the provisions of ยง31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(3) of the existing regulations requiring a monthly filer that files a final Form 941 to furnish Forms W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 to SSA on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the period for which the final Form 941 is due.
