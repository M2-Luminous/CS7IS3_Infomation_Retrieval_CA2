Under an earlier agreement Gazprom undertook to pipe 10 billion cu. m. [cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukrainian underground storaging facilities located predominantly in West Ukraine. A part of the above amount will be redeemed by Ukraine, though the bulk of natural gas stocks are supposed to secure stability of Russian exports to other nations, whose gas consumption will naturally grow in the fall-winter period. Gazprom supplied 5,257.9 million cu. m. of natural gas within the 1-10 June period, which exceeded the target figure by 174.7 million. Within the same period, Turkmenistan piped 601.9 million cu. m. of natural gas to Ukraine, which also exceeded the agreed amount, by 90.2 million cu. m. Ukraine's aggregate natural gas consumption during the very same period totalled 756.2 million cu. m., which allowed to save 450 million cu. m. of natural gas and increase Ukrgazprom's underground-stored pool by 4,103.6 million cu. m. If natural gas supply rates are maintained at their present magnitude, Ukrgazprom will be able to pool the necessary 25 to 30 billion cu. m. reserve by the summer season's close.
