He is the author of newspaper commentary in DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. He believes that President Mario Soares is acting as an opposition force and not as an organ of sovereignty. His opinion mirrors that of Jorge Lacao. [Correspondent Sandra Sousa] Jorge Lacao's criticism of President Soares has inflamed the Socialist rank and file, who immediately shied away from the stand taken by this distinguished member of the party's national secretariat. Armando Vara, a socialist leader, however, fanned the flames of this controversy. In an article published today in DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, Armando Vara says President Soares is acting not as an organ of sovereignty but as an opposition force. He says that in this way, Soares is diminishing the role of the Socialist Party. Without beating about the bush, he said it is legitimate for the Socialist Party to feel its territory has been invaded. And just like Jorge Lacao, he asked the president to let them work. [Announcer] Socialist Party Secretary General Antonio Guterres continues to distance himself from this controvery. Guterres, who declined to react publicly to Jorge Lacao's article, is doing the same with regard to Armando Vara's article. [passage omitted]
