Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, presided over the conference and gave a speech. Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the region, made a speech on doing a good job in the region's judicial and state security work in line with the region's realities. Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, relayed the guidelines of the national conference on judicial and public security work. Qian Fenyong, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the conference. In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: Development is our purpose, reform is the motivation for development, and unity and stability are the essential prerequisites for reform and development. Regarding stability as an overriding task is precisely to ensure development. Reform, development, and stability are mutually conditional. The region's political, cadre, and work foundations are good and are based on the good tradition of national unity. The current overall situation is also very good and are favorable to reform and development. However, leaders at all levels should remain sober-minded and should understand that some factors affecting social stability also exist. Therefore, we should strengthen party leadership and strengthen ideological education for cadres and the masses. Leaders of party committees and governments at all levels should all persist in the fundamental principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands," that is, they should not only pay attention to economic construction, but also to building spiritual civilization. We should unite the ideas of the whole party and the whole society with the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should strengthen unity in all fields and mobilize the initiative of all fields to positively greet the critical year of 1994 and to create a new situation in the socialist market economic system. In his speech, Wu Liji pointed out: Persisting in the fundamental principle of grasping both economic construction and spiritual civilization to create long-term and stable social and political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization drive constitutes an important content of the theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. Next year is critical to deepening reform. All localities should conscientiously implement the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee. All localities should not only persist in development without the slightest degree of deviation, increase the dynamics of reform, and accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic system, but also steadfastly put stability in an important position, implement the principle of "regarding stability as an overriding task," truly regard economic construction as the central task, and make reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability promote one another. Party and government leaders at all levels should actually shoulder the duty of safeguarding political stability, should conscientiously persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands" not only in holding meetings and issuing documents but also in actions, and should pay attention to the work of safeguarding social and political stability in the course of paying attention to reform and development. He said: In our Inner Mongolia, national unity constitutes the foundation of social stability. The unity of the party, the unity among all levels of leading bodies in particular, constitutes the guarantee for maintaining unity among all nationalities. We should firmly and unremittingly educate the cadres and the masses of all nationalities with the Marxist viewpoint on nationalities and with the party's policies towards nationalities. We should always hold high the banner of developing the economy and promoting national unity. In promoting the cause of national unity and progress, we should correctly approach and handle the issue of nationalities in line with state laws and pertinent policies. He stressed: Under the new situation, the most fundamental and effective way to make judicial, procuratorial, and state security organs persist in the party's basic line and facilitate economic construction, is to fully exploit the function of the people's democratic dictatorship entrusted on these organs by the state in order to create a good and stable social environment for accelerating economic development and establishing new systems. We should effectively exploit the functions of state security organs, actually strengthen the struggle against covered fronts, and frustrate subversion, infiltration, and sabotage of the hostile forces outside the territory. We should further organize cadres and the masses in the region to study and propagate the "state security law" to enhance their patriotic spirit and their sense of state security. At the same time, we should continue to deal severe blows to criminal cases, concentrate on investigating and handling major and appalling economic cases, such as corruption and embezzlement cases, punish serious criminal cases as severely and promptly as possible, and actually overcome and correct the phenomena of failing to enforce laws strictly and failing to deal severe blows to crimes. We should strengthen supervision over law enforcement of judicial, procuratorial, and state security organs in order to successful build these organs and successfully build the ranks of judicial, procuratorial, and security workers. He also set forth specific demands on further strengthening leadership over judicial and state security work, on trying the best to solve conspicuous problems and difficulties, and in strengthening state security work. A responsible person of the regional security department relayed the guidelines of the national security work conference. Attending the conference were the comrades who were attending the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee, responsible persons of the regional judicial and state security departments, and responsible comrades of judicial and procuratorial, public security, and security departments of various leagues and cities.
