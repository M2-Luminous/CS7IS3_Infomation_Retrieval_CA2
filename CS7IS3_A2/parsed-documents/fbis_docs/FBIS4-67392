Seen from an economic point of view, this is not a catastrophe, according to a lecturer in social economics. Green taxes will change attitudes toward consumption and resources. It will be expensive to use unnecessary energy. Seen in another way, if Mr. and Mrs. Jensen absolutely must lie in a heated water bed, then they must pay more than the rest of us who remain on a mattress and slats. With the government's tax reform of the summer of 1993 it will be the housekeepers who will notice the green taxes. Now a committee across party lines is sitting to put the finishing touches on the details of a proposal in which it will be industry's turn to pay taxes that will provide an income of about 3 billion kroner over a period of a few years. All industry has been against the tax, arguing that the medicine can be so strong that it knocks the patient for a loop. "But seen from an economic point of view, green taxes are not a catastrophe for industry," Jesper Jespersen, a lecturer in social economics at Roskilde University Center, says. "What industry can fear is that the government may rapidly introduce higher taxes without any form of repayment to industrial firms. This would create problems. Therefore I also think that the government's signal to industry should have been clearer so that everyone would understand that the introduction of green taxes is something that is coming but that at the same time requires a long-run strategy." Green Success Japan is the history of a green success. But it didn't look like this 20 years ago, when the country was about to choke in environmental problems. The energy crisis in the 1970's came to Japan's rescue. Instead of letting the gas-guzzler stay in the garage and riding a bicycle to the baker, the Japanese developed the technology for a small, environmentally friendly, compact car. Today the Japanese have overcome their problems in resources and environment with very tough taxes. This has not meant any economic catastrophe. On the contrary, Japan has reduced its energy consumption to a third of that of the United States, which means that they are three times more energy efficient. "In the Danish industrial cost picture, energy makes up today about 3 percent. Therefore, for example, a doubling of the price will not be an cost catastrophe." ``But industry must have the necessary time for the change so that in its investment plans it can take into account that energy has become more expensive, that to a greater extent than before more must be invested in energy-saving machines and in the necessary preparation for production." ``If in addition, political care is taken to connect the green proceeds to the development of resource and energy saving technologies, this will contribute to an increase in the rate of industrial change so that in reality businesses will not be particularly burdened economically. They will simply have some earlier costs that would have come anyway and that they would have had to pay just the same.'' Question of Style Will green taxes primarily be used to change attitudes and conduct? "Green taxes are primarily environmentally regulating. They must not be used to fill up the national coffers. They are to hit marginal consumption -- extreme consumption -- both in industry and in housekeeping. And not, for example, like carbon dioxide emission, which is screwed together completely backwards. If you are a little pig in the environment, you must pay 50 kroner per ton in taxes. If you are a somewhat smaller pig, you only pay 25 kroner. And if you pig out in high style, you may have to pay according to the environmental provisions of industry. ``One does not get a better environment free." ``Today most of the environmental taxes are imposed upon total consumption." That is, we pay the same 50 ore in taxes for the first and the last kilowatt hour [kwh]." ``This is falling between two stools. The first kwh that is used in a company or in a house is a necessity. Without it, we cannot survive economically or physically. Therefore the tax on the first part of the consumption is not conduct-regulating, either. But at the other end it can become so, when you use kwh to warm up the water bed -- or you don't close the chimney or replace the energy-consuming bulb with an energy-saving one in the factory." ``Fifty ore in tax for the last kwh does not push people much in a conduct-regulating direction. But it produces perhaps five kroner in five years." ``The important thing is to make people understand the saving percentages and green taxes in good time. In five years things will work fine. In a few years industry can adapt its activity either by lowering the temperature, rationalizing production, or by carrying out energy savings. The point is that it must be expensive not to save where it is possible to do so.'' Repayment Shall industry have a direct share in the repayment of profits from the green taxes? "The ideal competitively would be to give the money back to the individual businesses. But some companies are more locked into their methods of production. Even if they get a part of the profit, it is not certain that they will be able to use it to save energy. Therefore I would much prefer to give it back on a branch level, so that the firms that have the possibility of changing their production structure can have some of the money." ``In repaying on a branch level, there is always the danger of being cost-neutral, even if this is not completely correct, because the moneys originally came from the businesses themselves. But this must be seen in the light that one is getting a cleaner environment and possibly also products and production processes that will be more competitive when energy prices rise." ``It is a gamble. But one of the gambles that is less uncertain." ``Finally, there is an important difference in the way one measures the environmental effect. The choice is between administrative regulation and a market one. In their report of May of last year, the wise men concluded unanimously that it is up to seven times cheaper to use the economic instruments, because they can be adapted to the businesses that can most easily change their production structure." ``Whereas if one forces a uniform regulation onto all businesses, then one forces a costly task upon the ones that have difficulties in changing.'' Danish Solitary Path Is the Danish solitary path useful in the environmental area? "As far as value growth and consumption possibilities are concerned, it does not make a lot of difference whether Denmark alone introduces the carbon dioxide tax or whether it is made into part of a larger common European action. This is also in the wise men's report. A coordinated effort will give a little minus in value growth of 0.3 percent, while an isolated Danish effort will give a minus of 0.4 percent." ``It would be a little harder on private consumption, where a coordinated effort leads to a fall of 0.3 percent, while an isolated Danish effort gives a minus of 1.0 percent." ``Where one considers that consumption is rising by 3 percent a year at the moment, it is only a third of one single year's consumption rise that we lose by going our own way." ``But this is not the impression one gets when one hears comments from industry and political organizations. They have simply not digested the results. This is too bad for the wise men, and it is too bad for the debate.'' National Coffers What do you think the finance minister means by conduct-regulating green taxes? "Conduct-regulating taxes can lead to a cleaner environment and a less energy-dependent production and consumption. But it can also be done in a way that makes the finance minister happy." ``What there is a lot of, namely labor, will be made cheaper. And what there is little of, resources, will be made more expensive." ``There are not many wage taxes left in Denmark to regulate. But the gross tax and the earmarked labor market taxes are in reality the gearshift the finance minister can back up with." ``He can also use the gearshift to back up with the withholding tax by saying that the businesses that change their cost structures do not have to pay all the withheld amount of worker taxes if they in turn are willing to have resource consumption be taxed by a corresponding amount." ``And what's the trick? Well, the finance minister gets just as much money in his coffers. He eases the tax on the use of labor and increases it on the resource side." ``There may be businesses that will have difficulties in managing a change. Therefore such an arrangement can be done voluntarily at first." ``With the great unemployment we have, we must now work on the environmental sector. This is enough to work on.''
