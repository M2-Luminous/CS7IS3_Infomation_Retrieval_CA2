Senator McMullan is expected to join trade talks with the American Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Canberra later today. His unscheduled attendance has been prompted by Washington's threat to use a trade clause allowing special sanctions on trading partners using unfair practices. Camille Funnell reports Senator McMullan has already moved to make his concern clear to the United States. [Funnell] Australia is concerned Washington will strike a side deal with Japan at the expense of countries like Australia. Senator McMullan claims the U.S. has a history of hurting third parties in resolving its disputes with other countries. He's told American television there's no country in the world that supports the approach being used by the U.S. with Japan, although, he says, there's sympathy with America's wish to open up the Japanese market. But Senator McMullan also says there's no sign the U.S. wants to do anything to appease Australian concerns about American markets which remain closed to Australia. Senator McMullan is also warning against any action that's likely to reduce Japan's economic recovery, saying if the world's biggest economy doesn't recover all countries will lose.
