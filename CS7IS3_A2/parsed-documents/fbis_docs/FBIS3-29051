North Korean businessmen have lost interest in contacting their South Korean partners this year and instead are turning to American or Japanese firms to pursue joint-venture projects, the official said. The change in their position is understood to be in connection with the dismissal of reform-minded Kim Tal-hyon as a vice premier and chairman of State Planning Commission and the mounting tension over the nuclear issue, the official said. South and North Korean businessmen have continued their contacts in Beijing even when the nuclear problem became an international issue, he said, but the North is making no efforts this year. Pyongyang is also very cold on allowing South Korean companies taking part in its infrastructure projects and instead is seeking partnership with U.S. or Japanese firms, he said. Kim of North Korea reportedly met with Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo leaders in December 1992 and asked for their participation in Pyongyang's economic development projects.
