Addressing students at Bloemfontein's Vista University on Friday, Mr Lekota said his organisation was aware of the rightwing's bombing campaign against the ANC, which had already damaged offices in Parys, Bothaville, Harrismith and other areas. Referring to "civil war preachings" by elements in the Freedom Alliance, he said: "Let me warn them. Our peace gospel should not be taken for cowardice or inability to take on anybody if there is need to fight. We are given today to solve the problems of this country peacefully, so let's not waste that chance, for it may not come again," said Mr Lekota.
