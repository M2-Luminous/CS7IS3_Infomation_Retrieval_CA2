[Iwai] Without the combination of the movements toward splitting and unity, realignment will not occur. For the time being, the trend toward splitting will not stop. I think a "survival game" will continue for awhile. [Nakano] I agree that the tendency to split is strong, and integration will occur after the next general election. But I also feel that if discussion on the division of election districts occurs and the cabinet is reshuffled, then some integration could take place. [Kobayashi] My reading is different from Mr. Iwai's. I think things will head in the direction of integration. Under the single-seat election district system, one cannot win unless he comes in first. Therefore, victory will be determined by what the catchup [who against whom] is. There will be people, in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and in the coalition government parties, who will lose their seats [be unable to secure a candidacy] in the single seat electoral districts. [In that sense] we can say that realignment has already begun in a different direction, away from the previous framework. Take the "Democrats," for instance. The Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Japan New Party will be heading in the direction of merger. It is also a fact that the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] have been meeting. [Nakano] There are also some external factors: the corruption scandals involving the major construction companies have produced a ripple effect on the central political world. [Kobayashi] That effect is significant. If the LDP receives a great blow [from the scandals], the coalition government parties may split into two groups. If the blow is not too great, however, the coalition government parties will be obliged to stick together. Under the single-seat electoral district system, by next year at the earliest, in the fall of 1996 at the latest, realignment will take place. This realignment will take place before the general election rather than after. With single-seat electoral districts, the result will be clear before the election. With the single-seat districts, since everyone wants to be on the winning side, they will go over to the more advantageous side, regardless of its virtues. [Iwai] Realignment will certainly be triggered by the single-seat electoral district system, but I do not think the parties will suddenly become integrated. In the provinces, head-on fights of one against one may not be avoided, but in the urban areas, each party will have an equal chance to fight. So even under the single-seat electoral system, three to five parties will emerge. [Kobayashi] Splits will occur only on the premise that integration will follow. It means that they will not just temporarily disintegrate. I also do not think that there will be a nationwide, unified integration right from the beginning. [Nakano] We three have three different ideas, but they are not all that far apart. I think, as Mr. Kobayashi said, that splits and integration will occur in tandem. But still, it will take some time before a permanent new "system" will be established. It will not be clear after only one general election. It is questionable if a system for political funding and support will come into place in a year or so. Also, it is unclear who the "top leader" will be. [Kobayashi] As you say, a "structure" such as the 1955 one will not be created in 1994. That will have to wait until after the upper house election of July next year and the following general election. It will become clear in a decade or so whether that happened in 1996 or 1997. [Iwai] The key will be whether they can tie a support association-backed election race to the local political party branch. They are still groping for [a way to secure] political funds. But it is not certain whether political party [financial] assistance can be an important factor for integration. Still, overlapping candidacy is permitted, so 90 percent of those elected will come from single-seat electoral districts. Therefore, basically, representatives from single-seat electoral districts, as a system, will act as a unifying force. The bulk of the struggle will be over the single-seat constituencies. [Kobayashi] The support associations will [make the transition] smoothly. Political party subsidies will be received, not by the party headquarters, but by the branch units in each city, town, and village. Moreover, there will be multiple regional branches, such as the youth and women's divisions. Therefore, there will be as many as 120,000 recipient organizations. Hence, in contrast, the representative's existing support organizations will continue to exist. I think that a "division of labor" is quite possible. What the problem is, rather, is whether this will lead to regulations which will govern political funding or political reform. Combinations for Political World Realignment [Nakano] What do you think about combinations [of parties] for realignment of the political world? [Iwai] The simulations in every newspaper are based on ideology. But the situation is more complex, including among other things the existence of study groups. There are cases, when adjustment of candidates is carried out skillfully, where the situation is more advantageous without integration. The Shinseito-Komeito relationship is a good example. Elections are fought not by two major parties but by multiple parties. Yet, when it comes to forming a government, the composition of LDP against non-LDP will not change as long as the LDP is the largest force. However, when it comes to policy decisions, things can move beyond the framework of the parties. The combining [of parties] is not simple. It has become clear that the restraint [on members] by party decisions is an illusion. This kind of trend will not be reversed. In [forming] a government, some [party] combining will emerge, but combining policies will be another matter. [Kobayashi] As for the Heiritsu system [a combination of single-seat districts and proportional representation], it is possible for some parties to allocate candidates for both single-seat districts and the proportional representation list. But for other parties, it is not possible. A representative of one of the coalition government parties said that "the proportional district will be sufficient. Do not make me battle the LDP in a single-seat election district." Unlike Mr. Iwai, I do think that Shinseito and Komeito would have difficulty pursuing their own courses. When Komeito runs a candidate in a single-seat district, I am not sure if the Shinseito supporters will vote for him without hesitation. It is easier to make an allocation whereby Shinseito competes in the single-seat election districts, and Komeito competes in the proportional contest. Combinations will be determined by what the voters want. Regrettably, political ideology will not likely be a key factor. [Iwai] The Japanese people feel that realignment of the political world is mainly a subject of concern for Nagata-cho. The newspapers wrote that "there will be a second act in the new year," but nothing has fundamentally changed. It is more like "act one, scene two." [Kobayashi] On the contrary, restraint by party decision will become more strict. That is the difference between the Heiritsu system and the medium-sized election district system. Victory in an election is only possible through cooperation between parties. Independent activities cannot be permitted. The [electorate] votes for a party in the proportional competition. So here, subsidies to the parties will work as shackles [on individual members]. [Iwai] As for funding, it cannot help but become tighter. Because of the emergence of the multiple parties, it has become a seller's market for candidates. For the next year or two we do not know what will happen. [Nakano] To begin with, the incentive for combining forces is the election, and there are two "levels," namely, the individual and party levels. The question is what is going to happen so far as forming the government is concerned. First, everyone wants to get reelected and, if possible, wants to gain government power for the party he belongs to. That is the representatives' true intention. What is deficient is that policy is put forth only as a means or as a matter of expediency, though sooner or later policy will become an issue. That is where the voters are betrayed. Lack of Ideology/Ideas [Nakano] Ideology and ideas are lacking in today's political world. The important subjects today are countercyclical measures and political reform. How should they be dealt with? [Kobayashi] A political party should make its opinions clear and should be bound by them. But in reality, this has not been the practice. There is a saying that "for political parties and politicians, election victory is an end in itself, and policy is formulated to facilitate election victory." If one says anything too radical, he cannot receive votes. So everyone's policy becomes similar. Just as there is hardly any difference between the Democratic and Republican Parties in the United States, everyone becomes similarly moderate in each election district. [The similarity of viewpoints is shown by the following examples:] The rice issue has already been settled and is at the stage to hand over subsidy money to the farmers. And the UN issue is one everyone feels important. No one has an answer for the countercyclical measure. I wonder if a more clear-cut confrontation will occur not among the political parties but, rather, between regions. [Nakano] The Thatcher government in Great Britain tried drastically to change the Labor Party's policy. But looking at the budget, it was not all that different where welfare was concerned. It was clear that policy was contracting in a converging manner. Confrontation between political parties, except with the Japan Communist Party [JCP], will not come up. [Kobayashi] Opinion surveys, with relevance to political realignment, have dealt with: first, the economic issue, whether to emphasize national interests and eliminate monopolies or to pursue deregulation and a free economy; second, the welfare issue, whether to support the great burden of a high level of welfare or a low level of welfare; and third, the constitutional issue which includes the UN and Self-Defense Forces questions. As for the first two issues, there are no clear differences of view. In the single-seat electoral district in the United states, the Democrats and Republicans say the same thing, so elections are perfunctory. In Japan also, it is questionable how much choice the voters have. Will democracy function [under such circumstances]? [Nakano] In three aspects -- between generations, between regions, and against external pressures -- confrontations will necessarily emerge. But none will arise from within the political parties. [Iwai] Japanese society prefers inclusive political parties. In addition, everyone wants to appear agreeable in the single-seat district system. So party positions will become very similar. How much unity can they have when the trend is that each Diet member will act on his own in making policy decisions. When I analyze the United States, where there is absolutely no party discipline, I find that there is party unity for Congressional activities when it comes to issues on the tax system, government versus private business, countercyclical measures, and welfare. There is the issue of the Constitution/Security Treaty that places special conditions on Japan. The current realignment contains an excessively strong personal element. Just as Shigeru Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama united in the 1955 structure, logic which transcends [personal differences] is needed. When elections, political power, and actual parliamentary activities are not coherent, the voters will be confused. It is a question as to what kind of verdict the voters will hand out on the convenience of the politicians. Ideals are important, but the question is how will they judge achievements. [Kobayashi] I am more pessimistic about Japan than about the United States. There are hardly any national or local referendums in Japan. In the United States, the regional and class gap in society is coming to the surface. But in the Japanese framework, very little regulatory power for dealing with regional differences and economic classes is found in the LDP or in the coalition government parties. Each party has its own party constraints, but I think they are heading in the direction of not absorbing the differences in the ideals held by the voters, more so than in the United States. Moreover, from the beginning, they have abandoned the framework of direct democracy which could compensate for this deficiency. [Nakano] If party politics cannot deal with such a discrepancy, what can? [Kobayashi] It is difficult under the single-seat district system, because they cannot win an election unless the oppressed class reaches the 51 percent line. It means that minority opinion will be excluded more than ever. [Nakano] What about the bureaucratic system? [Kobayashi] The bureaucratic system will be strengthened. I do not know whether two or three major parties will emerge. But in the situation of a power struggle, the bureaucratic presence will grow. When MITI opposes, political power will be stalled. Bureaucratic power will keep growing, and the bureaucrats and vocal people, rather than the voters, will have their way. [Nakano] I agree. Under a bureaucratic system, the minority will have an easier time riding the tyranny of the special interests. Under the current political reform, the ideals of party politics will go further away. [Iwai] The bureaucratic system has been fiercely seeking legitimacy under the imperial system, the GHQ [General Headquarters of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan after World War II], and the LDP. Now Mr. Ichiro Ozawa intervenes in bureaucratic personnel matters, and tries to increase the number of parliamentary vice ministers. The bureaucrats' keiretsu phenomenon will probably occur too, and conflict between the bureaucracy and politicians will arise. The bureaucrats will emerge representing the interests of the silent majority, whom the political party can not rescue. The composition of bureaucratic control will become more and more ingenious with the support of the public opinion. The Future of Japanese-Style Democracy [Nakano] What do we think about the future of Japanese-style democracy? As for the party political system, last year, Prime Minister Hosokawa predicted that "it would be a moderate multiple-party system." Will it be a two-major-party system or a multiple-party system? Will it be like the American system where slogans are just words and the important factor is the individual politician himself, or will it be like the British system where the party plays the greatest role? Or will it be satisfactory to continue with the current bureaucracy-dependent style? Absolutely no discussion has been made on these points. What worries me the most is that every party talks about, yet, in actuality, has nothing to do with, an international perspective. [Kobayashi] As for the ideal form, it should be one placing priority on the people, rather than on party, politics, or bureaucracy. Whether it be two major parties or three, the choices of parties would be only three or four that have a policy on every issue. As for the "moderate multiple-party system," what constitutes a multiparty system? In reality, it will be two plus the JCP or three plus the JCP. Whichever it is, it will inevitably be a party-oriented rather than politician-oriented system. Unlike in the United States, we do not have primary elections. So the party, rather then the electorate will determine the candidates. If one opposes the party leadership, one cannot become a candidate. [Nakano] What about the central and regional relationship? [Kobayashi] There would not be much change in the central versus regional relationship. The regional governments have no autonomous authority to levy taxes. Only Tokyo, Osaka, Kanagawa, and Aichi could have fiscal independence. [Iwai] The Ministry of Finance will not let go of their authority to levy taxes. And the regional governments will not want to involve themselves because they have neither the human resources nor the know-how. [Nakano] It would be different if the system were changed from the current one of local municipalities to a broader area block system such as the Do-Shu system [similar to a state system]. [Kobayashi] Even if Shikoku is made into a block, for instance, it will have a much smaller tax base when compared to the capital region. [Iwai] I think it would be easier to obtain a national consensus on securing equality rather than admitting inequity among regions. What kind of equality do we want to secure? Would it be better to switch to the American/European type right away? We must grope for a form of regional autonomy different from the current one and must secure vitality and equality. [Kobayashi] I agree. We can tolerate private enterprises going bankrupt, but not the local regions, because the whole premise is that if that happens equal competition can not be possible. [Iwai] When we disperse authority, the concentration of power in one place occurs in reverse. As for the fields of transportation and communications alone, the cost is higher in the local areas. We should have bold ideas, such as adopting a flat fee throughout Japan. [Nakano] Still, the centralization of power is too strong. I think we could have a little more diversification of power. [Iwai] It is not clear how we can define Japanese-style democracy. The slogan came first, but no definition has been made. Will People's Political Consciousness Change? [Nakano] Will the Japanese people's political consciousness change through electoral system reform? [Kobayashi] I think affirmatively about the point that the people can choose the governing authority under the Heiritsu system. The opposition parties have no choice but to unite. The kind of irresponsible policies we have experienced in the past will not be established, in the sense that people can choose a governing authority which submits achievable policies. In this sense, the people's consciousness will change. What I want to ask, rather, is if the politician's consciousness will change by this reform. [Iwai] In last year's general election, the voting rate was really low. We can also say that it has become a theatrical style. If the people who participate in exercising their choice become a minority, the voice of the silent majority will be heard even less. If there is no party the people can choose, the distance between the Japanese people and society will develop further. Every party will try to please everybody and will become the interest-induction type. [Kobayashi] Responsibility lies on the side of the parties. Even if there are voters who do not want to choose a party and the rate of voter abstention goes up, there is no damaging effect for the parties or for the politicians. Unless we set a minimum number of votes one must obtain to get elected, no politician will suffer. [Nakano] When I look at the years when a change of government took place, namely 1976, 1979, 1983, 1986, and 1993, the inconsistencies contained in Japanese style democracy gushed to the surface, triggered by the tax hike and the large scale political corruption. What would be the points that will surely emerge under the new system? [Iwai] The fact that we can choose the governing power is a great factor, so the politicians will have to be serious and tense. If it is to be party-dominated politics, I think it would be better that the interest distribution should be left to the greater discretion [for the party]. For instance, give them power over personnel in the bureaucracy. [Kobayashi] Under the position-seeking system in the United States, those who gave in the election campaign openly join the administration. [Nakano] What do you think about having the Ministry of Finance's budget making authority handed over to the parties? [Kobayashi] It would be different if we are to adopt the presidential system, but then, what would we do with the imperial system? Coexistence would be difficult. Japanese politics would improve if we placed greater expectations on the electorate rather than on the political parties, through the introduction of national referendums and so on. [Iwai] Anyway, such a supplemental system is necessary. [Nakano] Only the problem is that those who decide that are also the politicians.
