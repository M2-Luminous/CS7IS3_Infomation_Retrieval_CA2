Noting that contacts between the two countries have been on the rise over the past few years, Qiao expressed the conviction that Arbnori's China visit will promote the further development of bilateral ties. "We are willing to develop friendly ties with all other countries, based on the principles of peaceful co-existence," Qiao said. Arbnori said that China was and is a great nation which has made special contributions to the progress of mankind. Albania appreciates what China has achieved in the past few years, Arbnori told his host. Qiao said that China is still in the process of development, with coastal areas developing faster. He added that it will take great efforts of generations to bring about a fairly high level of development in the country's central and western part. During the meeting, Qiao expressed appreciation of Albania's stance of "one China" and not developing official ties with Taiwan. After the meeting, Qiao hosted a banquet in Arbnori's honor. Also in the afternoon, NPC Vice-Chairperson Lei Jieqiong held talks with the Albanian delegation. Arbnori and his party arrived here earlier today as guests of the NPC standing committee. Apart from Beijing, they are scheduled to visit Shenzhen in southern China.
