Breaking with its rather protectionist tradition, France has come out in favor of imposing import quotas on a minimum amount of Chinese products. To the great displeasure of some of its traditional trading partners, notably Spain, the French foreign minister will probably vote with the "liberal" countries on 7 February in Brussels to liberalize trade between the EC and China. The "Chinese quotas" issue conceals the wider problem of the single-market-inspired requirement to replace national quotas imposed on state-controlled countries with EC quotas. In actual fact, because of the GATT membership of many of the countries in the former Communist bloc and the bilateral agreements concluded between certain other countries and the EC, the only thing left for discussion are the some 6,000 quotas imposed on China. Eliminating these quotas raises the question of the number and volume of EC quotas to be set up in their place. The Commission proposed nine categories of products: gloves, shoes, china, ceramics, glass articles, radios, toys, bicycles, and chloramphenicol. France has aligned itself with the liberal countries, which have suggested limiting these categories to seven. Toward Conciliatory Attitude by Germany This would appear to be a doubly profitable choice since it seems to have enabled Paris to ensure a conciliatory attitude by Bonn next Monday -- barring any surprises -- on one aspect of the Union's new "trade defense" device, which was left out of the political compromise reached on this issue last 15 December: the decisionmaking mechanism within the EC regarding procedures for settling GATT trade disputes and for "managing" arbitration. In actual fact, all these issues are linked. It will be up to the ministers to adopt the legislative texts on 7 February that will transform the political agreement reached in mid-December -- in the margins of the Uruguay Round -- in order to strengthen the Community's trade defense instruments. This involves the improvement of antidumping and antisubsidy measures and the implementation of safeguard clauses, thereby accelerating retaliation and making it less dependent on majorities that cannot be reached among the Twelve. With regard to the "new trade policy instrument" -- which is supposed to allow Europeans to retaliate against unfair practices on the world market but which in reality is never used -- it was merely agreed that if the other members of GATT did not abrogate their unilateral retaliatory weapons -- in this case the United States and section 301 of its trade legislation -- then the Twelve would take "the appropriate steps."
