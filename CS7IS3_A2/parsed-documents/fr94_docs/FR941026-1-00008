FR941026-1-00008 FR941026-1-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;16] Proposed Establishment and Alteration of VOR Federal Airways; Florida AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposal would establish new Federal airways and modify existing airways in the Miami, FL, area. Establishing new airways and realigning existing airways are necessary because of the commissioning of the Virginia Keys, FL (VKZ) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range and Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME). DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, ASO&hyph;500, Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;16, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, GA 30320. The official docket may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 916, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the office of the Regional Air Traffic Division. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;16.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination in the Rules Docket both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Availability of NPRM's Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;220, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3485. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and alter various Federal airways in the Miami, FL, area. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative. Biscayne Bay VOR was a significant navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently, several of the airways previously based, in part, on the Biscayne Bay VOR had to be realigned with other navigational aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to support the air traffic operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational aid will necessitate the realignment of existing routes. Also, a new airway would be established to provide additional support for air traffic operations in the Miami area. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Domestic VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. ICAO Considerations As part of this proposal relates to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices. Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve the safety and efficiency of air operations. The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for the safety of civil aircraft. Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10854.
