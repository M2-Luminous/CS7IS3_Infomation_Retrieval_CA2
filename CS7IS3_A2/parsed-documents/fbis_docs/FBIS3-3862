"I don't want to speculate on it," a STAR TV spokesman said when questioned on the report in the latest issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review. The newsmagazine said STAR TV -- which Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. acquired last year for 525 million U.S. dollars -- would cease relaying the BBC to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in May in favor of the new movie service. The BBC would still be available to STAR TV viewers in other parts of Asia and in the Middle East, according to the report. Media analysts believe Murdoch is keen to drop the BBC -- which enjoys editorial autonomy -- in favor of his Sky News channel, now seen in Europe. China strongly criticized the BBC last year for a critical documentary on late chairman Mao Zedong that was aired in Britain, although it has yet to be repeated on the BBC's Asian service.
