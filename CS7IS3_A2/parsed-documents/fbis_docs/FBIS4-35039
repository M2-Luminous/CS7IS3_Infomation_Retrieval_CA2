He made a statement to this effect when he presided over the ceremony at which the National Council Against Poverty was established. The organization, which held its first meeting on 24 May, is made up of representatives of different national groups with experience in the field of social development. The government's intention was to bring together persons coming from the most representative areas of national life, both from the government as well as from the opposition, including social organizations, employers and workers, churches, and nongovernmental bodies. The names of the members of the council speak for themselves: Alberto Echegaray, president; Benito Baranda, executive secretary; Gonzalo de la Maza; Claudio Di Girolamo; Roberto Fantuzzi; Bishop Erasmo Farfan; Jose Antonio Guzman; Juan Pablo Illanes; Fernando Leniz; Haidee Lopez; Patricia Matte; Manfred Max-Neef; Ana Maria Medioli; Eugenio Ortega; Maria Rozas; Alberto Undurraga; Sara Vasquez; Humberto Vega; Monsignor Manuel Camilo Vial; and Jose Zavala. According to the decree which approved its establishment, the objective of this council is to coordinate the participation of different social groups in answering the national challenge to overcome poverty; to propose action, programs, and strategies to make the social policy of the state more coherent in this sense; to advise the president and the interministerial, social committee; to propose ways of reducing poverty at the regional level; and to contribute to the program that Chile will present to the Social Development Summit Meeting of the United Nations. President Frei was the only speaker at the ceremony. In his speech he said: "From this place we must be able to call on the conscience of all Chileans so that the task of wiping out extreme poverty will not just be a government policy but the fundamental concern of the nation." He recalled that the basic priority of his administration is to concentrate its efforts on the nine percent of the population, or about 1.2 million Chileans, "who live under subhuman conditions in the most extreme poverty and destitution." At the same time he added that he will fight to raise minimum wages and to improve living conditions among some three million people who live under precarious conditions. As to where the emphasis will be placed in the national program to overcome poverty, President Frei pointed out that efforts will be concentrated on specific programs aimed at infants, senior citizens who lack resources, young people, women, urban and rural small businessmen, farmers, the indigenous peoples, and the handicapped. He stated: "In short the program for overcoming poverty will emphasize the development of backward sectors and will ensure better opportunities for the most vulnerable groups of society." He emphasized that he hopes to see that an additional public effort is made through the "contributions and the generous initiatives of employers, workers, academic personalities, church leaders, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, who can design a program as ambitious or even more so than what the government will do." For his part Luis Maira, minister of planning and cooperation, announced that within the next two weeks the interministerial social committee will unveil the national program for abolishing poverty in the budget of 1994 and the criteria for the preparation of the budget for 1995. He said: "These criteria are going to redirect public expenditures and social priorities toward the poorest groups among the people, such as the regions and territories which now have the greatest cumulative problems." The minister also said that during the second half of June a meeting will be held of all senior administrative officials, called by minister of the interior German Correa, to discuss the implementation of the plan at the national level.
