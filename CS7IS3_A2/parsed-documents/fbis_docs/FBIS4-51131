The railway items which will be carried out in 12 provinces and municipalities have already been included into the Ninth Five Year Plan period which will lie between 1995 and the year 2000. There were 81 local trunk railway lines across the country as of 1993 which ran for a total length of some 4,800 kilometres in 17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions while nearly 20 others measuring a total length of 2,000 kilometres are now under construction. Work on railway lines in localities proceeded at the greatest pace during the past ten years with the track laying of trunk lines measured 2,460 kilometres. The gross spending was valued at nearly RMB [renminbi] 4.6 billion, of which RMB 4.1 billion was local capital while the Ministry of Railways accounted for RMB 440 million. The so-called local railway lines are constructed with the use of capital shouldered by local governments which make them different from the state level railway lines. Local governments are either partly or fully responsible for the running of the railway lines. Local railway lines which have already been part of China's transport network have seen their development and construction planning included into the local as well as the state level programmes. China has in recent years formulated a number of measures to speed up construction of railway lines in a bid to alleviate the tense state of railway transportation. Those measures included encouragement given to local governments to raise capital for the building of railway lines. Some preferential practices were available such as the setting of transportation charge by local governments, exemption of revenue tax, allocation of steel for railway track replacement without payment and subsidiary loan specially for local railway lines. The central government also encouraged local governments to bring in foreign capital to construct railway lines. The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, some Japanese financial groups and Taiwan offered capital to fund some local railway lines which are now under construction. Six local rail lines are ready for introduction of foreign investment for construction. State level railway lines rose from 22,000 kilometres since 1949 to 54,000 kilometres at present, a gain of some 30,000 kilometres. Among them there were 41 rail lines running for a total of 3,100 kilometres which were handed over by local governments to the state for management, some of them became trunk lines. Local rail lines will cover a gross length of over 8,000 kilometres across the countries and the handling capacity will reach 100 million tonnes by the year 2000. [sentence as received]
