That would be an extreme measure that would not solve everything, this can only be done by the warring parties themselves, he added. Sixty-eight Sarajevans were killed and nearly 200 injured when a Serb artillery shell exploded in a crowded marketplace on Saturday [5 February], causing NATO and United Nations diplomats to consider anew, now with greater likelihood, launching air attacks against the Serb besiegers.
