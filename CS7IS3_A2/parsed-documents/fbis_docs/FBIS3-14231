Qrasan was also asked to estimate the number of people that can, theoretically, occupy each such home (probably to determine the number of settlers that can barricade themselves in the homes and oppose evacuation). Qrasan has given the Army his answers. The Hebron settlers believe the request indicates that the IDF is attempting to prepare a contingency or practical plan for the evacuation of the site, where seven families currently reside. The curfew on Hebron and its surroundings will be lifted today or tomorrow at the latest. The curfew was imposed on the city three weeks ago, immediately after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The decision to lift the curfew was made after a series of discussions in which the participants heard reports about the distress of the Palestinian population. At the same time, fear was expressed that once life in Hebron returns to normal, riots might erupt and clashes between the Army, the residents, and the settlers might take place. Before the curfew is lifted, additional IDF and Border Police troops will be stationed in Hebron. The Tomb of the Patriarchs will not be opened to the public at this stage. The IDF is currently working out new procedures and security measures for the site, including separate entrances for the two nationalities. It has already been decided to prohibit bringing arms into the tomb. Security sources believe that riots will break out when the curfew is lifted. If the riots evolve into serious incidents, the curfew will be reimposed. The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza has begun preparing for the possibility of the government's ordering the IDF to evacuate the Hebron settlers. The settlement leaders have contacted groups in Qiryat Arba' and other settlements in a bid to thwart the evacuation. They plan to call thousands of people to Hebron once they learn of an imminent evacuation. Seven families currently reside in Tall al-Rumaytha: The family of Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who is currently wanted after an administrative detention order was issued against him; the family of David Shir'el, whose gun was taken from him; the Ra'anan family (headed by the grandson of Rabbi Avraham Hakohen Kook); the family of Uri Qrasan, the Hebron Jewish settlement security officer; the Ben-Yitzhaq family; and the Horowitz family [six families named as published]. The rising tension in Hebron and the fear of terror attacks have led the General Staff to decide to cancel the training schedules of infantry units and deploy them for active duty in the territories and Lebanon. For example, a combat unit that has just completed a tour of active duty in Lebanon was about to begin a series of exercises. By order of Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, the soldiers were sent for active duty in the West Bank. The same has happened with other military units. A senior military source said: "Everyone is waiting for the big bang. Canceling training schedules is not good, but everyone is under pressure. We are expecting an Arab retaliation. No one is happy about canceling drills and exercises, but this is dictated by the reality in the field."
