[Spychalska] We can no longer hold back and wait for the government. There are certain issues which need to be sorted out now, without delay. We all know that the situation is difficult; the previous government did not conceal that, either. After all, as we prepared for the projected economic transformations, we were all hoping (along with representatives of the state's executive powers) that that state of affairs could be reversed reasonably quickly. However, there still have been no proposal to set up a group of competent people to analyze what should be changed and how it should be done. Meanwhile, people are getting impatient and disappointed. After all, this is not what they chose the new authorities for -- but no obvious changes are forthcoming, and it does not look as if they were forthcoming in any foreseeable future. [Kwasniewska] But you seem to have little power or influence to change the course of events, do you not? After all, price rises are being introduced regardless of whether you approve of them or not. [Spychalska] Some price rises are the effect of the last budget, and that was drafted and approved by the old Sejm. Others are the consequence of the switch to the free market economy. After all, no one wants or expects to see a return to the old system of central steering of the economy. [Kwasniewska] What about the social contract which you were proposing? [Spychalska] That concept was announced by Premier Pawlak, but to date the government has not come up with any proposals for such a social contract. That is why we are suggesting our own theses and proposals. [Kwasniewska] Has there been much interest in your proposals on the government's part? [Spychalska] The government showed so much interest in them that we were forced to make our proposals available to it while they were still being drafted and perfected by the relevant working party. That was because it turned out that the government had no specific concept of how to work out such a contract in the first place.... [Kwasniewska] What elements should be included in the social contract you have in mind? [Spychalska] Generally speaking, such a contract should map out the principles of our social and economic policy that should see us through the next four years. It should also give a more detailed outline of that policy for the approaching year. Even more specifically, it should include proposals on how to galvanize the economy, which directions of foreign economic cooperation should be adopted, how to create opportunities for expanding the market, and which products to concentrate on. Also, how to halt the spread of unemployment, and how to find the best methods to create new jobs. The social contract should specify the extent of proposed investment outlays, the principles of our policy regarding state enterprises, and also the principles of our proposed pay and price policies. It is high time to begin talking about bringing our wages and our incomes into line with the free market rules. The abolition of the enterprises tax on above-normative pay ["popiwek"] does not solve any problems here. To date, there have been no talks with the government on the question of the value of labor in the finished product. And such talks should definitely take place soon. [Kwasniewska] When do you think is such a social contract most likely to be signed? [Spychalska] It would only make sense to sign it before the state budget is approved. That in turn should be ready for submission to a Sejm debate by the end of March or beginning of April. Thus, there is still plenty of time to negotiate its terms in talks with the government. [Kwasniewska] But do you not preclude the possibility of testing the government's -- your own government's -- strength in a confrontation of forces? [Spychalska] Regardless of whether or not there are own trade union representatives in the government, the government is a social consensus government, since it was appointed as a result of a democratic election. Apart from that, the government will always be just a side to negotiate with as far as the trade unions are concerned. And it is certain that we will often stand up against this government. [Kwasniewska] The needs of the population increasingly exceed the government's ability to meet them.... [Spychalska] We know about that. However, it is the government's brief to expand its ability to meet the needs of the population. It is high time indeed for the government to activate the mechanisms which can increase state budget revenues and not merely go on curtailing budget expenditure. [Kwasniewska] Will Solidarity take part in your negotiations with the government? [Spychalska] We have had no response to the public invitation which we extended to Solidarity to engage in joint work with us. However, we will yet again approach our colleagues from other trade unions. After all, the stronger and better represented the union side, the better guarantees we will have to obtain some satisfactory results -- such as the decent minimum wages in the "Social Welfare Guarantees Charter." [Kwasniewska] The "popiwek" tax is scheduled to be abolished on 31 March, but the men at the helm of our economy are still nursing many anxieties about it.... [Spychalska] Their fears are unjustified. As a result of restructuring, today many enterprises are able to reduce employment in the interest of paying higher wages to their remaining work force, who are thus more efficiently employed. However, they often give up this chance during the transition period, in the situation where the government is unable to guarantee work for everyone. They keep many of their employees on, thus giving them a chance to continue earning money and avert the specter of becoming dependent on unemployment benefit. Such gestures are very noble. But this state of affairs cannot last very long. Nor does the government have to worry that the entire profit will be absorbed by the wages. Today every employed person knows that unless a proportion of the company profit is invested in development and modernization, there will be no job for him -- or for anyone else in the company -- to count on in the long run. [Kwasniewska] Will the OPZZ not encourage people to strike? [Spychalska] If we manage to negotiate an agreement with the government that will offer us sufficient hope that the situation will improve, we will obviously be obliged to promote attitudes of calm among the population, to talk to people, and to persuade them that it is well worth remaining patient. If the public has even the slightest evidence of some tangible improvement in their situation, we can ask them for still more patience. On the other hand, I see no chance of calming the public if nothing is seen to be improving....
