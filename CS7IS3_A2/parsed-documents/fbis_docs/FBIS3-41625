Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister for protection of the environment and natural resources, by ZELENYY MIR correspondent N. Filimonova; place and date not given: ``New Does Not Mean Better''] [Text] At ZELENYY MIR's request, V.I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister for protection of the environment and natural resources, comments on the idea of creating a state oversight system in a conversation with our correspondent N. Filimonova. Filimonova: Viktor Ivanovich, do you believe that there is a need to create a new system? Danilov-Danilyan: No, and I do not share the draft authors' position, although I do understand what it is based on. Dissatisfaction with the state of the environment in the Russian Federation is causing many people contemplate how the situation could be improved. Unfortunately, many opt for a traditional Soviet way--asking themselves how to reorganize environmental protection bodies. I often read initiative memoranda on this topic, proposals to the government, specialists' letters in newspapers and magazines. And all of them are structured following a standard scheme: First they register the fact that the ecological situation is very alarming, quote some statistics--all of them usually borrowed from the national report ``On the State of the Environment in the Russian Federation in 1991,'' which was prepared under the auspices of the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources, and then propose a new structure for an environmental protection system which, they say, will help to solve all the problems. Filimonova: This standard approach does not mean that the proposals are worthless. Some of them deserve attention perhaps? Danilov-Danilyan: The draft document we are looking at would not withstand criticism on several points. First, in principle. A completely wrong conclusion is drawn from an unquestionably true premise: Since the environment is in terrible shape, we need to reorganize environmental protection bodies. Second, they propose to reorganize not only our structure but the entire system of monitoring and oversight. That is, the conclusion extends far beyond the premise. In addition to the three oversight committees currently in existence (the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight, the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, and the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety), the draft proposes to create seven new committees! In the current situation, when there is not enough money for the most urgent undertakings, to start such a reorganization is socially wrong! We need to think how, to the extent possible, to cut the number of agencies, not breed new ones. Filimonova: In the opinion of some economists, however, separating oversight and monitoring services will allow us to bring order to our economy. Danilov-Danilyan: The source of these proposals is the perception that the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources, they think, combines these functions with economic activities. This is not the case, however. We are not involved in any economic activities whatsoever! There is not a single natural resource that is utilized by the ministry's units or enterprises and organizations subordinate to it. We only regulate resource consumption by other sectors' enterprises using direct limitations (quotas) or indirect means (payment amounting to in-kind taxes). And what is monitoring and oversight if not a form of regulation? Separating monitoring and oversight services into independent organizations will only make conducting an integrated long-term ecological policy more difficult, since it includes setting norms and standards; forming a system of sanctions for violations; introducing payment for discharges, environmental pollution, and utilization of natural resources; improving the taxation system and the mechanism of ecological expert evaluation; management of the natural preserves system; and development of ecological programs--scientific-technological and investment. Unfortunately, quite often the people whose job includes development of ecological policy are unable to grasp this set of problems in its entirety. They overestimate the importance of some components of this policy while underestimating others. Such an approach is ruinous right now for the system of environmental protection, Environmental protection bodies should not be playing the role of slave-driver--they need to work with producers rather than just crack the whip... It is said that the standards we set for producers are too low... Well, let us raise them--and bankrupt most enterprises. Is this what we need? A pauper is not capable of anything. Only he who has property, opportunities, and means can do something (including in the area of environmental protection). Yes, it would be best for the environment if we cease all production activity. But if this is impossible, let us look at things realistically. Filimonova: But you would agree that the environmental protection inspectorate is in such a dismal shape now that precisely the monitoring and oversight components of an integrated ecological policy may fail. Danilov-Danilyan: Our inspectorate had always been financed as a different ``line item'' than the actual environmental protection bodies, and therefore in worse shape. I think we have resolved this problem--unless there is a return to the past in the process of making changes in the 1993 budget, the inspectorate's situation will improve considerably. Now we are taking the next step--getting the needed material and technical support for these services: instruments, transportation, communications, information processing capabilities, etc. Have you ever seen financial and material and technical support of an organization improve when it is split into separate parts, or at least not deteriorate? If we start dividing territorial environmental protection committees now, we will have to divide financing, staff rosters, facilities (in some oblasts this will be a catastrophic development), means of transportation... For a year nobody will work--everybody will be busy dividing property. Filimonova: Well, what can we do--this is the way it is always done in Russia... Danilov-Danilyan: This is the last thing we need right now. We will again have a situation which our prime minister (on a different occasion) described this way: ``We wanted to do better, but it came out is usual.'' Filimonova: And personnel? How do you divide personnel? Danilov-Danilyan: There are not too many good cadres, highly skilled and capable of being good administrators, on the local level. If we start breeding new agencies on a scale proposed in the draft under consideration, it will inevitably lead to a decline in the quality of administration in each of them. Under the powerful pressure of the geological, forestry, and water management lobby (all these lobbies we have now!), the corresponding committees have been separated from the ministry. They have become autonomous entities under the government as committees or federal services. I am convinced, however, that this has not strengthened the environmental protection system; on the contrary, it has weakened it, because it is more difficult now to resolve coordination problems. For objective reasons, however, this splintered system has to be managed as an integral whole, while retaining within limits of expediency independence of its units. Unfortunately, the initiators of the creation of state oversight of technology-related and ecological safety, while painting a pretty organizational scheme, did not have a good conception either as to how to implement this scheme or of the consequences of its implementation: where they will get the expected results, and where exactly the opposite. They obviously lack knowledge of reality.
