Reporter Kim Chin-suk reports on the details of the poll: [Begin Kim recording] The reaction of our people to the possibility of North Korea's military provocation is, above all, negative. As the result of the telephone poll of 600 male and female adults living in Seoul, 60 percent of the respondents said that even if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against North Korea, North Korea will not carry out a military provocation, and only 32 percent replied that it will commit military provocations. Seventy-two percent of the respondents, namely three out of four citizens, denied the possibility of North Korea's triggering a full-scale war such as the 25 June Korean war on the Korean peninsula, and only 24 percent replied that there is such a possibility, thus reflecting our people's insensitivity to war. However, more than half of the respondents pointed out diplomatic efforts through dialogue as effective means for blocking North Korea's nuclear development; 27 percent pointed out economic sanctions; and 15 percent pointed out South Korea's nuclear development. Meanwhile, 4 percent of the respondents stressed that a preemptive attack should be launched against North Korea. Concerning international community sanctions against North Korea's nuclear development, 83 percent of the respondents replied that sanctions must be imposed by all means. This shows that most of the people are sympathetic with the necessity for sanctions by the international community in order to prevent North Korea's nuclear development. In view of the results of the poll, we come to a conclusion that our people, based on their negative assessment of the possibility of North Korea's military provocation, think that the North Korean nuclear problem should be resolved through dialogue to the most possible extent, and, even if this resolution method is difficult, North Korea's nuclear development must be blocked by all means through economic sanctions against North Korea.
