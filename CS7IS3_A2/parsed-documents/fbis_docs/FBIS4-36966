Maj. Gen. Biran added that it is clear that many residents of the territories will want to enter Jericho during this period and the IDF will not prevent them from doing so. It must be realized, however, that the small Jericho area cannot contain hundreds of thousands of people. Maj. Gen. Biran spoke in a briefing to foreign correspondents. Qol Yisra'el English Department correspondent Dick Winter reports that according to Maj. Gen. Biran, the Cave of the Patriarchs will be reopened in five to six weeks at the earliest.
