President Tudjman's letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton reads as follows: Esteemed Mr. President: It is with particular pleasure that I wish to inform you that the negotiations between the Croat and the Bosnian delegations concerning the comprehensive implementation of the Washington Agreements have been brought to a successful conclusion. I would like to express particular gratitude to the U.S. Administration and to you personally, Mr. President, for your role in the search for lasting and just solutions for the achievement of peace through the realization of the Croat-Bosnian Federation and Confederation. Let me once again assure you that the Republic of Croatia will remain firmly committed to the spirit and letter of the Washington and Vienna Agreements, wishing to be a factor of stability in this part of Europe and a permanent partner of the United States in the promotion of peace and stability in this part of Europe. The leading role of your country in the achievement of a lasting political solution is crucial in this, the final stage of the peace process. Any freezing of the present state of affairs and any delay in this solution only prolongs human agony and threatens peace in the greater European area. This is why the present peace efforts of the international community should be focused on shaping the means and guarantees for the implementation of the achieved agreements and decisions of the international community. Let me remind you once again that the problems of the Serbian occupation of parts of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina are inseparable, and let me reiterate the need to seek a lasting solution through an integral approach of the international community to the problem. Mr. President, I am firmly convinced that, with your personal involvement and the moral and every other determination of your administration, we will soon be able to focus our efforts on issues such as the return of refugees to their homes, economic reconstruction, reconciliation, and the strengthening of democratic processes to create a new, stable international order in this part of Europe. Signed, Yours Sincerely, Tudjman. In a letter that President Tudjman sent to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of the countries that took part in the Geneva talks, President Tudjman said, inter alia: I wish to thank the governments of your countries on their support for the peace process, especially to the U.S. Government, which actively mediated in efforts to reach a solution between the Croats and the Bosnians. At the present stage of seeking a political solution in former Yugoslavia we see as decisive your determination to bring the Serbian side around to accepting a just political solution and, if necessary, impose such a solution on the forces obstructing the peace process, Tudjman said in his letter to the foreign ministers.
