"I told the deputy premier that the current system of minority education in Slovakia is in any case more advanced than that it should give cause for introducing alternative education, which would mean a step backward," the ambassador told MTI. Since the plan gave rise to protest from ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, the ambassador suggested to Andel that the Slovak authorities should consult with minority leaders before introducing alternative education. Both sides agreed on the need for revising and prolonging bilateral agreements on cultural and educational cooperation. The ambassador asked the Slovak politician to decide where the Hungarian Cultural Centre in Bratislava should find its final home, an issue which he stressed has remained unresolved for eleven years through no fault of the Hungarian side. The Hungarian cultural mission opened in 1989, and has been operating in a temporary building for three years. Andel promised to examine the issue and come forward with a proposal in a month. The ambassador also raised the still unsettled issue of teachers' training in Nitra, pointing out that Slovakia's failure to launch a department of national and ethnic cultures gives reason for justified anxiety. The deputy premier promised that after considering the issue the Slovak Government will find a reassuring solution.
