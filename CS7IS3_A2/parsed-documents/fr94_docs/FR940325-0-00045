FR940325-0-00045 FR940325-0-00010 40 CFR Part 52 [IL 12&hyph;26&hyph;5785; FRL&hyph;4854&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Illinois AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 17, 1992, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) proposed to promulgate Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emission limits for coating operations at the General Motors (GM) Electro-Motive Division (EMD) facility in LaGrange (Cook County, Illinois), as representing Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for EMD's ``topcoat'' and ``final repair coating'' operations. At that time, the USEPA also proposed a compliance date of one year from the date of final promulgation. In this rule USEPA is promulgating the emission limits and compliance date. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective April 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 29, 1990, the USEPA promulgated Federal stationary source VOC control measures representing RACT for emission sources located in six northeastern Illinois (Chicago area) counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. 55 FR 26814. The USEPA also took final rulemaking action on certain VOC rules previously adopted and submitted by the State of Illinois for inclusion in its State Implementation Plan (SIP). Among the State rules that the USEPA disapproved was title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) subpart F, ยง215.204(m), which established VOC limits for ``Existing Diesel-Electric Locomotive Coating Lines in Cook County.'' The USEPA based this disapproval on its determination that the emission limits prescribed by the State did not represent RACT for EMD's locomotive coating operations. In lieu of this State rule, the USEPA promulgated more stringent emission limits for diesel-electric locomotive coating operations, codified at 40 CFR 52.741(e)(1)(i)(M). The only source affected by this rule is GM's EMD facility in LaGrange, Illinois. In response to the USEPA's actions, pursuant to section 307(d)(7) of the Clean Air Act (ACT), GM filed a petition for administrative reconsideration with the USEPA Regional Administrator for Region 5. 1 GM requested that the USEPA reconsider its decision to subject GM to a VOC limit of 3.5 pounds per gallon (lb/gal.) for its topcoat and final repair coating operations. 2 1 GM also filed a petition for review of the Agency's June 29, 1990, action in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. General Motors Corporation v. EPA, No. 90&hyph;2889. That action has been held in abeyance by the Court, pending USEPA action on GM's petition for reconsideration. 2 In its petition for reconsideration, GM also requested that the USEPA reconsider the rules applicable to EMD's silicone rubber priming and electrical insulating varnish operations. These two issues are not being addressed in this rulemaking action. On January 4, 1991 (56 FR 480), and May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24722), the USEPA announced a stay of the emission limitations and compliance date for EMD's topcoat and final repair coating operations until the USEPA completed its reconsideration. The USEPA also stated in those rules that the stay was to remain in effect until withdrawn by a subsequent rule, but only if and as necessary to complete reconsideration. The USEPA further indicated that, upon taking final rulemaking, it would publish a rule in the Federal Register notifying the public of the withdrawal of the stay. The USEPA also stated in the May 31, 1991, notice that if the reconsideration resulted in emissions limitations and standards that were stricter than the applicable (on May 31, 1991) Illinois rules, the USEPA would propose a compliance period of one year from the date of final action on the reconsideration. On July 17, 1992, (57 FR 31678), the USEPA proposed VOC RACT limits for EMD topcoat and repair coating operations of 3.5 lb/gal. The USEPA's analysis was based in large part on the fact that this limit was consistent with both the Control Technique Guidelines (CTG) for miscellaneous metal parts and products; and that coatings meeting this limit were being used successfully at the General Electric Company's (GE) Erie, Pennsylvania locomotive coating operations. For more information about the background and substance of these proposed limits, please see the July 17, 1992, proposed rule. Because the 3.5 lbs./gal. limit is more stringent than the Illinois rule in effect on May 31, 1991, the USEPA also proposed on July 17 to provide a compliance date of one year from the date of final action on reconsideration. This one-year compliance period was the general compliance period provided in the June 29, 1990, Federal RACT rules. Finally, the USEPA proposed to withdraw the stay pending reconsideration.
