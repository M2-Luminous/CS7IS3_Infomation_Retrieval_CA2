FBIS4-6260 "dreas075_c_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 North Korea Foreign Former Heads of State Continue Visit Foreign Former Heads of State Continue Visit Foreign Former Leaders Tour Kaesong SK1804114094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1053 GMT 18 Apr 94 SK1804114094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting group of former heads of state and government and politicians from different countries toured Kaesong Municipality on Sunday. Keenly experiencing the tragedy of national division of the Korean people, they expressed their resolution to strive for a peaceful reunification of Korea. They, participants in the second meeting of the summit council for world peace, were to visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom late March. Owing to the obstructions of the South Korean authorities, however, they had to make a long detour, though this place is no more than 70 km away from Seoul. After inspecting Panmunjom, former President of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio who is leading the group said he had flown to Central America and came here by making a detour of 35,000 km through the United States and China because passing through Panmunjom was not allowed. "This makes us feel sick at heart," he added. Former Governor-General of Canada Edward Schreyer said he learned at first hand that Korea is not building armament, contrary to what he had heard in the West. "Your country wants peace, not a war, and is making a great progress in socialist construction," he noted. William Taylor, vice-president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies of the United States, said that the continued tense military confrontation along the Military Demarcation Line may create an unpredictable situation with an accidental incident and so, the DPRK and the United States must have further talks and find a solution to the matters, promoting mutual understanding through talks. After seeing the concrete wall built by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean authorities in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line bisecting one country, one nation and families into two, the guests said they learned well who was the very one blocking the reunification of Korea. Noting that the concrete wall is a very torturous one for the Korean people who are suffering the sorrow of the division for nearly 50 years, Antonio Betancourt, executive director of the Summit Council for World Peace, stressed that the Summit Council for World Peace will strive to achieve the reunification of the country, the final aim of the Korean people, through international efforts. Togashi Takayoshi, vice-president of the Summit Council for World Strategy of Japan, said: "To build even a barrier dividing one nation shows that the South Korean authorities pay no heed to the nation." That day the guests went round the Panmunjom cooperative farm. Noting the South Korean rulers' propaganda that people do not live here is a sheer lie, the guests said in unison that they could see at first hand the people in the North taking part in peaceful construction, not in war preparations.
