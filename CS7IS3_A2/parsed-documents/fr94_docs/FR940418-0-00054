The term ``meeting'' does not include any procedural deliberations required or permitted by §§6.1, 6.2, 7.4, or §7.5 of these bylaws. §7.2 Open meetings. (a) It is the policy of the United States, established in section 2 of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94&hyph;409, 90 Stat. 1241, that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government. The Postal Service is charged to provide the public with this information while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities. Accordingly, except as specifically permitted by statute, every portion of every meeting of the Board of Governors is open to public observation. (b) Except as provided in §7.3 of these bylaws, every portion of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation.

Members of the public may obtain access to documents considered at meetings to the extent provided in the regulations of the Postal Service concerning the release of information. (c) Without the permission of a majority of the Board, no person may participate in, film, televise, or broadcast any portion of any meeting of the Board. Any person may electronically record or photograph a meeting, as long as that action does not tend to impede or disturb the members of the Board in the performance of their duties, or members of the public while attempting to attend or observe a meeting of the Board. The rules and penalties of 39 CFR 232.6, concerning conduct on postal property, apply with regard to meetings of the Board. §7.3 Exceptions.

(c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552), provided that the statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, such as market information pertinent to Postal Service borrowing or investments, technical or patent information related to postal mechanization, or commercial information related to purchases of real estate; (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;
