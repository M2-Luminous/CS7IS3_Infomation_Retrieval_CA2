In an interview this week Viljoen shed some light on how he views the future and how he plans to further the cause of what he calls "Afrikaner self-determination". A prerequisite will be to win the confidence of the new rulers and to convince them that the FF is sincere in its desire for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] and peace. "The concept of self-determination is new to Nelson Mandela. To bring the true meaning of this concept home, there must be peace and there must be straight talking. Mandela must have full confidence in the leadership of the Afrikaner people or else it will not work," he says. On how he plans to sell the volkstaat to an ANC-dominated government of national unity, Viljoen said the issue should not be forced. "We will have to convince Mandela that self-determination is the real desire of the Afrikaner. When I decided to opt for the peaceful way it was because I knew that the hostilities generated by war will take too long to heal," he says. He is adamant a volkstaat could "easily" have been taken by force, but that this course of action would have caused divisions almost impossible to heal. The achievement of a volkstaat by peaceful means will necessarily take time, he said, emphasising that the concept of a future volkstaat will have to revolve around political independence and economical interdependence. "We do not want to repeat the black homelands in a white homeland. They were never economically viable." To achieve Afrikaner dominance in a volkstaat, Viljoen envisages a gradual resettlement programme that may take from 20 to 25 years. In this regard he likes to mention the example of the state of Israel that started out with about 650,000 settlers in 1948. "But at the same time we would not like to withdraw the Afrikaner out of the South African community." Viljoen says the volkstaat must become an Israel to Afrikaners living outside its borders. Even if they do not live there they can always look to it as the home of Afrikaner nationalism. But if it is all about perceptions can't the Afrikaner preserve his heritage without a volkstaat? "No, it must be real," says Viljoen. Viljoen shies away from the issue of whether blacks will be accorded citizenship in a volkstaat. "That remains the subject of negotiations and there are many possibilities," he says. "One of these may be to entrench 25 percent of the seats in a national assembly for black representatives." Viljoen won't be drawn on a possible position for himself in a new government. "I will only talk about it when the offer is actually made to me," he says. But what if, for instance, he is offered the position of defence minister? If such a position can further the cause of peace in which the interests of the Afrikaner can be pursued, he will definitely consider it, he says. He says it will take a minimum of five years before a new and integrated defence force can be properly established. In the meantime the bulk of the existing armed forces still lies in the commando and citizen forces. "The armed forces will be of great importance to stabilise the situation during the next five years," he says. "And if I can play a role in ensuring that, I will do it."
