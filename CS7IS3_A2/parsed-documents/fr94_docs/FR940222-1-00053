In order to participate and receive payment under the Medicare program as an HCPP, an organization must enter into a written agreement with HCFA. (b) * * * (4) Not impose any limitations on the acceptance of Medicare enrollees or beneficiaries for care and treatment that it does not impose on all other individuals; (5) Consider any additional requirements that HCFA finds necessary or desirable for efficient and effective program administration; and * * * * * (7) Document the cost of part B services as required by §417.800(c)(4). * * * * * (d) * * * (1) * * * (ii) The HCPP is not in substantial compliance with the provisions of the agreement, applicable HCFA regulations, or applicable provisions of the Medicare law; (iii) The HCPP undergoes a change of ownership as specified in subpart M of this part; or (iv) An HCPP that furnishes inpatient hospital care has had a final overclaim, as determined under §417.532(b), for 2 consecutive years. * * * * * 9. Section 417.802 is revised to read as follows: §417.802 Other applicable regulations. (a) General rule. The payment rules set forth in §§417.530 through 417.550 for cost HMOs and CMPs also apply to HCPPs except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) Exceptions _(1) §417.532(d). HCPPs do not have the option of paying providers that furnish inpatient hospital services, SNF services, or part B services to the HCPP's Medicare enrollees. HCFA pays the providers, as indicated in §417.800(d). (2) §417.536(1). Return on equity capital of proprietary providers owned by the HCPP is not an allowable cost. (3) §417.536(m). These limitations on payment do not apply to HCPPs. The limitations that do apply are set forth in this subpart. (4) §417.548. The rules governing payment for provider services furnished through arrangements do not apply because HCPPs do not pay providers. (5) §417.550(b)(2). Payment of reasonable cost for independent certification of cost reports does not apply because HCPPs are not required to have their cost reports independently certified. §417.546 [Amended] 10. In §417.546, the following changes are made: a. Paragraph (b) and the Editorial Note are removed. b. In paragraph (a), the ``(a)'' designation is removed, and the ``(1)'' and ``(2)'' designations are changed to ``(a)'' and ``(b)'', respectively. §417.560 [Amended] 11. In §417.560, the following changes are made: a. Paragraph (d)(2) is removed. b.
