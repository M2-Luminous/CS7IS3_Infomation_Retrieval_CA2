Our society faces dramatic questions that require a clear and unequivocal answer. Will we create a new political climate and and atmosphere of national consensus, or will we continue the descend the downward slope of lethal disunity, intolerance, and confrontation? Will we strengthen the state, or will we allow chaos, anarchy, and war to prevail among the institutions? Will we stop the catastrophic destruction of our economy and plundering of our national wealth and allow Bulgaria to become a state of poverty and humiliated human dignity? Will we remain indifferent toward the growing unemployment, corruption, speculation, and the unprecedented increase in crime, or will we establish the rule of law, democratic order, and security -- guarantees of the protection of our life, property, and peace for our children, and their future? Will we reconcile ourselves to the collapse of intellectual life, the smothering of the Bulgarian language, the destruction of Bulgarian education and science, the commercialization of our art and culture, and watch them replaced by harmful imported surrogates, or will we revive the Bulgarian spirit and preserve our cultural assets? The choice between these alternatives is a choice between disaster and recovery for Bulgaria, between national destruction or revival. 1. The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] confirms its striving for a peaceful transition and its policy of dialogue and cooperation aimed at national consensus and reconciliation. It calls upon all citizens, political forces, and public organizations in Bulgaria to display prudence and good will in overcoming political hostility and the desire for revenge, and to create a civilized atmosphere in Bulgarian political life. The BSP is against the war between the institutions. It finds relations between the political forces to be anything but normal and nationally responsible, and rejects manifestations of ethnic confrontation. 2. The BSP favors holding early parliamentary elections in the fall of 1994. Despite the efforts of the people's representatives, the current parliament is about to exhaust its legislative possibilities and political and moral prestige. A new poll is the only democratic and nationally responsible way to stabilize power in the country. The BSP's success in the elections would allow a new policy of salvation to be pursued in Bulgaria that will help to overcome the acute crisis, stop the destructive processes, curb inflation, and change the model of transition. In its election platform the BSP will present its positions on those changes that are vital for our society. The way those positions are realized will depend on the voters. The BSP views the coalition agreement as the best formula for our country. If it is impossible to achieve this, the BSP is prepared to assume responsibility for governing the country. The main tasks of the socialist deputies during the period until the elections are: -- to adopt amendments and addenda to the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria; -- to adopt amendments and addenda to the Law on Electing People's Representatives, Mayors, and Municipal Councillors, and the Law on Municipal Self-Management and Administration; -- to adopt the Judiciary Bill and the Bill on Defense and the Armed Forces, and adopting amendments to the Law on Restructuring and Privatizing State and Municipal Enterprises and the Mass Privatization Program. The congress proposes to the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD] to implement until the elections systematic and strict parliamentary control over the government's work regarding timely and just income compensation, especially the incomes of the socially deprived, struggling effectively against speculation, enrichment that is not the result of work, and crime, and concluding a deal on our foreign debt. 3. During the period of transition the BSP supports an economic policy that will guarantee: -- a revival of production and its restructuring and renewal, and protection of Bulgarian national capital; -- the stimulation of a variety of forms of ownership and acceleration of privatization by applying market and social mechanisms; -- the efficient management of state property; -- the acceleration of agricultural reform with a view to creating a modern and efficient agriculture; the creation of state protection and stimulation of agricultural producers; the creation of conditions for developing all economic forms and advantages for cooperatives and associations as a means of improving the economic and social status of farmers and halting the fragmentation of the land; -- a qualitatively new budget policy that will stabilize the country financially and in terms of foreign currency, overcome the disproportions in the budget, improve the collection of taxes, finally resolve the bad credits problem, and bring about a gradual transition toward developing own sources if financing in the municipalities; -- the orientation of the Bulgarian economy toward exporting, creating conditions for changing the import-export structure, restoring our country's traditional markets, and linking Bulgaria with the European and world economy. 4. The BSP views the following as its basic tasks: -- guaranteeing the social security of the population; -- providing social compensations and social aid, conducting a struggle against unemployment, and providing every Bulgarian citizen with the possibility of self-fulfillment; -- effecting strict control over the prices of goods monitored by the government and conducting an anti-inflation policy; -- providing the necessary means for education, health protection, and the activity of the municipalities; -- forming independent pension, health, education, and other humanitarian funds. 5. The BSP declares the irreversible character of the democratization processes and supports the improvement of the political system; -- it draws public attention to the danger of the authoritarian degeneration of the transition and of the deliberate striving to destabilize the democratic institutions; -- it supports restoring and expanding local self-management, and expanding the possibilities of conducting a regional and local policy through developing financial, property, and organizational autonomy of the municipalities and settlements; -- it insists on real political independence for the judiciary, which implements the basic role determined by the constitution, namely, to be a barrier against crime and anarchy; -- it declares its adherence to the pluralistic and democratic character of the national media, overcoming their manipulative and confrontational character, and turning them into a public tribune. 6. The BSP supports the protection of Bulgarian culture and arts and the achievements of our education and science, language, and spiritual identity, and opposes the persecution of Bulgarian intellectuals for political reasons. 7. The BSP supports religious tolerance, but it is seriously concerned about the schism in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. It categorically opposes the infiltration of foreign religious sects and the continuing Turkicization of the Bulgarian population. 8. The BSP will seek cooperation in the future with the trade unions in protecting the people's labor interests, and it favors the further strengthening of the tripartite partnership. The BSP is against the use of the trade unions for achieving political goals and opposes their direct interference in governing the state. 9. The BSP supports the depoliticization of the armed forces and guarantees their high social prestige, financial situation, and combat ability. It protests against attempts to repoliticize the armed forces and views the kindling of conflicts associated with the military reform as a threat to our national security. The BSP is in favor of maintaining the stability of the security organs, providing their material needs, preserving their high professionalism, and improving their authority as protectors of law and order. The BSP is in favor of an uncompromising struggle against manifestations of corruption in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and attempts to utilize the agencies of law and order for political goals. 10. The BSP is in favor of conducting an active foreign policy that corresponds to Bulgaria's national interests and international obligations; -- it adheres to peace and goodneighborly relations in the Balkans and opposes dragging Bulgaria into the Yugoconflict in any form; -- it adheres to our further integration in the European structures; -- it supports strengthening confidence and cooperation with our partners on an equal bilateral and multilateral basis; -- it adheres to guaranteeing the country's national security; The congress adopts the report on the BSP's political line and approves the reports on the activity of the BSP Supreme Council, the All-Party Control Commission, and the socialist deputies after the 40th BSP congress. -- 6 June 1994
