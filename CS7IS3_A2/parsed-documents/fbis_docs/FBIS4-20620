III] [Text] Toyota Motor Corporation has developed a navigation system which automatically computes the route to the destination and guides the driver using a synthetic voice. This navigation system was developed for the purpose of providing a system capable of reducing the load on the driver and helping him reach his destination smoothly and more safely than by conventional means. This system has the following features: route information display by means of digital mapping, present position indication and guidance timing detection via signals from a satellite and vehicle-mounted sensors, high quality voice guidance on the course to take and the intersection name, automatic display of intersection routing diagram, route re-calculating function, etc. This paper describes these operations and the navigation system configuration. 1. Introduction At present, ways of making vehicles more intelligent are being energetically studied all over the world. In particular, the vehicle information system is seen as offering the possibility of early realization of operational application. Overseas, Intelligent Vehicle and Highway Systems (IVHS) and other research projects are being vigorously promoted. In Japan, Toyota took the lead in 1987 by developing a location system that indicated the present position with a cursor on a color cathode ray tube (CRT), followed in 1991 by a navigation system that calculated and displayed routing to a specified destination in 1991. Thus, Toyota leads the way in the development of a vehicle information system. This voice navigation system is a more advanced version of the conventional navigation system.[.sup]1[/] Figure 1 shows the progress of these navigation systems. Figure 1. Progress of Navigation Systems 2. Characteristics and Functions of the System Toyota's voice navigation system has the following characteristics: (1) Digital mapping indication using a full color Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT LCD) built into the instrument panel. (2) Automatic detection of present position using a hybrid map-matching and Global Positioning System (GPS). (3) Automatic calculation of a typical route to the vicinity of a destination that can be selected and specified from the address, telephone number and number of point, and on-screen indication of the route map. (4) Route guidance in a high quality voice using the names of intersections, destination names of the expressways and other proper names recorded on eight Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) discs. (5) Automatic indication of intersection guidance diagram that enables the driver to determine which way to go at intersections and their characteristics. (6) Route re-calculation function that makes guidance route changes to be made easily while traveling. 3. System Configuration Figure 2 shows the installation layout of the parts which make up the presently developed navigation system. Figure 3 shows the block diagram of the same system. Figure 2. Onboard System Layout Figure 3. System Block Diagram A 6-inch full color TFT LCD system is installed in the center of the instrument panel. The computer, CD-ROM auto-changer, GPS receiver and TV tuner are installed in the luggage compartment. The geomagnetic sensor is installed on the lower rear side of the roof. The front wheel sensor is shared with that of the Antilock Brake System (ABS). The GPS antenna is a planar microstrip type of a diversity receiving system. It is mounted under the instrument panel and the rear package tray so as not to degrade the body styling. The entire system employs a total of 10 CPUs. Principal functions of the main computer (hereinafter referred to as the computer) are as follows: (1) Calculating the present position, (2) drawing the digital mapping, (3) high-speed route calculation, (4) voice guidance, (5) indication of other audio and air-conditioning states, (6) indication of maintenance and other vehicle state information, (7) interpreting Compact Disc CRt Applied FormaT (CDCRAFT), (8) diagnosing and other processing. Hardware includes two high-speed, 16-bit CPUs, 7M bytes memory, a graphic control processor, video RAM, a speech data processor, a high-speed communication interface with CD-ROM, a signal input interface from the vehicle sensor, and a drive circuit for geomagnetic sensor. The mapping and voice guidance data are recorded on eight CD-ROM discs in ISO 9660 format. From the quality point of view, Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) is used for recording the voice guidance data. Decoding of ADPCM is processed by a special LSI. The voice data is monaurally recorded with a cutoff frequency of 9.5 kHz and compressed 16 times. The computer accesses the CD-ROM and reads the ADPCM data to carry out D/A conversion each time voice guidance is needed. The guidance voice is generated by a one-channel audio amplifier built into the computer and output from a speaker mounted in the door on the driver's side. The volume is adjustable in five stages. When the guidance voice is output, the radio and/or other audio system output is switched by relay for this speaker only, enabling passengers to continue listening to the radio and/or other audio system output while the route guidance voice is being output. 4. Basic Navigation Functions Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the basic navigation functions. The principal navigation functions based on the digital mapping recorded on the CD-ROM include the following: (1) mapping display of the present position along with the sensor, GPS and map-matching, (2) display of reference maps and destination designations according to the address and/or point names selected, (3) calculation and indication of the route to the vicinity of a specified destination from the present position, (4) guidance to the vicinity of the destination using voice and intersection guide diagrams. Figure 4. Basic Function of Navigation 4.1 Map Indication of the Present Position The present position is calculated by composing the findings of (1) geomagnetic sensor, (2) front wheel sensor, (3) steering angle sensor, (4) speed sensor, (5) GPS and (6) map-matching. Maps are displayed in 1/20,480 thousand [as published] to 1/10,000th scale (1 cm on the screen is equivalent to 100 m) in double pitch. The map of the present position is automatically and instantaneously displayed on the screen by pressing the ``Present position'' switch. The map scrolls smoothly as the present position moves. 4.2 Reference Map Indication and Destination Designation Seven methods of designating the destination are possible including specifying of the name of the point, telephone number, and an enlarged sectional map from the master map of the nation. There are 23 types of point names including addresses, stations, hospitals, etc. Moreover, using the touch-switch on the screen enables the destination to be set from a retrieved map. If a telephone number specified by the driver is not recorded on the CD-ROM, the area map is displayed from the telephone office number. If the ``previous departure point'' is specified, the system sets the starting point where the last routing guidance was made the present destination. This function is effective when starting out from a hotel or other point of previous destination. When the system is not operated for a period of time, a ``help'' function is incorporated that explains the operating method by voice. 4.3 Calculation of Route and Indication After specifying the destination, the driver sets the conditions for calculating the route. There are two kinds of conditions. One is whether the route includes passing points or not. If included, they are to be specified just as specifying the destination. The other is whether toll roads are to have priority or not. If there is a passing point, the route may be set separately from the present position to the passing point and then to the destination. When the route calculation conditions are set, the computer starts calculating the route to the specified destination. A map is indicated on the screen in a scale that allows both the present position and the destination to be covered on the same screen. For the route calculation method, the modified Dijkstra's algorithm is used. If the destination is a long distance away, calculation time is shortened by using precalculated expressway networks. The cost of road links is determined by the length of each link, type of road, width of road, traffic control, and right, left and U-turns. It takes an average of about 50 seconds for the computer to calculate and display the route. If the destination is far away and the area is recorded on a different CD-ROM disc, the calculation may require 10 to 20 seconds more time to allow the CD-ROM auto-changer to change discs. When the routing calculation ends, the entire route is indicated by a red link. The computer then describes the main roads over the entire route to the driver by voice, for example, ``Take Route 123.'' When the driver checks the guidance and touches the ``Start guidance'' switch, an enlarged map (in 1/10,000th or 1/40,000th scale) of the present position is displayed with a red link. If the driver takes the wrong route or intentionally detours from the set route, the screen indicates the ``Recalculate'' switch. When the driver touches the switch, the computer indicates the calculation for returning on to the initially set route in an area about 4 km away from the present position. Figure 6 [not reproduced] shows the recalculation function. If the driver desires to have the entire route to the vicinity of the destination indicated anew, he simply touches the ``Recalculate'' switch one more time. The computer then recalculates the entire route to the vicinity of the destination from the present position and displays the result. Helped by these functions, the driver can easily change the guidance route at will according to traffic conditions, restrictions and the current state of the road. 4.4 Guidance on Route Guidance on the route while traveling or navigating is basically provided through the coordinated operation of three guidance modes consisting of (1) display of a map showing both the route and the present position, (2) display of intersection guide diagram, and (3) route guidance by voice. The driver checks the relationship between the route and the present position or the topography of the vicinity and the present position according to the map (1). The driver checks the route and the name of the next intersection, the form of road connection at this intersection in detail, buildings that serve as road markers (for example, a bank), and the distance to the center of the intersection, according to the guide diagram (2). The driver thus receives correct information on the direction to go ample time prior to arriving at the intersection where branching is necessary according to the guidance given by voice (3), enabling him to drive with ease without having to frequently check the information displayed in (1) and/or (2). This contributes to safer driving. The screen automatically changes to the intersection guide diagram from the map of the present position approximately 300 m away from the intersection. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows typical intersection guide diagram. The intersection guide diagram indicates an area of approximately 150 m x 150 m in fixed state (without scrolling) with the direction of travel to the top of the screen. The distance from the present position to the center of the intersection is indicated by a bar graph in the lower right-hand corner. The circle and the arrow-shaped cursor move in about 50 m steps to indicate the present position. The screen indicates the route on the intersection road diagram using a separate colored line. When the vehicle travels about 50 m beyond the intersection, the intersection guide diagram automatically returns to the map of the present position. 4.5 Route Guidance by Voice Normally, the computer provides voice guidance automatically when needed. If the driver particularly wishes to listen to the voice guidance, pressing of the ``Guide voice'' switch actuates the system to respond according to the current situation. Voice guidance is provided in complete phrases using a combination of basic guide text patterns, word patterns, and data on proper names. The basic guidance pattern is determined by the direction of travel, distance to the next intersection and the one after it, the type of intersection (a four-way intersection of an ordinary road, roundabout or expressway exit), the type of road (ordinary road, expressway, urban highway or toll road), and the width of the road (number of lanes), presence of toll gates, etc. Data on the proper names are used as reference to enable the driver to check the intersection and the direction of travel. For example, it refers to the names of intersections, expressways, national routes, expressway interchanges, and expressway destination guides (road markers). A female voice is used similar to that of a tour guide. Figure 8 [not reproduced] shows some examples of spoken guidance. On a general road, the system provides guidance on the direction to travel and the name of the intersection about 700 m and 300 m before reaching it (in the case of a road having two lanes and driving on one side), or on an expressway, the name of the destination on the road sign or the road name about 2 km and 1 km before arriving at the junction. In cases where intersections appear in succession and no distance is available, guidance is given for two intersections at the same time. When the vehicle has to travel a long distance after turning at an intersection, the computer explains the distance to the next intersection by saying, ``Continue cruising-along this road for about 4 km,'' so that the driver can relax and concentrate on driving. If the driver presses the ``Guidance voice'' switch during or before the guidance, the system responds by saying, for example, ``About 500 m ahead, make a right at Toyota Town,'' according to the current distance to the intersection. Moreover, the system calculates the timing according to the vehicle speed and the time required to complete the guidance. Voice guidance is started slightly ahead of time so that the vehicle will be at the announced distance from the intersection by the time the guidance ends. The system uses over 120 types of guidance patterns according to the route and situation. As thus far described, the computer provides the driver with appropriate voice guidance in consideration of the road connection form, distance required for changing lanes, guidance timing according to the driving speed, difficulty involved in passing through a series of intersections, road sign matching, and so forth. It has been verified that this intelligent voice guidance reduces the number of times the driver is required to watch the display and the time needed for checking, and lowers the driver's heart rate before intersections, and the load on him.[.sup]2[/] 5. Navigation Data The computer mainly provides maps of roads over 3 meters wide, road connection data for routing, junction guidance diagram, guidance voice and index data. Figure 9 shows the amount of recorded digital mapping data available. Figure 9. Digital Mapping Data 6. Conclusion We have realized an intelligent system for correct navigation that reduces the load on drivers by using large-capacity CD-ROMs and a high performance computer, voice and road data for guidance based on actual surveys of 160,000 intersections, optimized voice guidance logic according to route and driving conditions, flexible modification of the guidance route, and so forth. Future research problems include the provision of dynamic route guidance based on traffic information on road congestion and restrictions fed back by the infrastructure, as well as cost reduction and standardization of mapping data and the development of infrastructure. In the future, we expect to be able to develop more intelligent and practical systems and expand their use along with the development of the infrastructure as a means of improving the traffic environment, economic efficiency and safety.
