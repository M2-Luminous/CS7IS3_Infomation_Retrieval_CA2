We are not going down the same path as the Northern League because they are behaving like the old parties. We will instead ask for absolute clarity about the program and we are sticking to our guns on this." This was said by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] during the the MSI-AN [Italian Social Movement-National Alliance] central committee meeting. According to Fini, the MSI and AN should be "the government's engine," and the government's program will have to contain clear commitments concerning "national unity, north-south solidarity, support for the weak, economic incentives, and a fight against waste and party power."
