FR940304-0-00021 FR940304-0-00007 (1) Revise the Limitations section to include appropriate operating procedures relative to operation of the modification required by paragraph (c) of this AD. These operating procedures must be approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Or (2) Revise the Limitations section to include the following operating procedures relative to the operation of the modification required by paragraph (c) of this AD. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Use of Bleed Air Anti-Ice System Caution The Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplane has a wing design with no leading edge high lift devices, such as slats. Wings without leading edge devices are particularly susceptible to loss of lift due to wing icing. Minute amounts of ice or other contamination (equivalent to medium grit sandpaper) on the leading edges or wing upper surfaces can cause a significant reduction in the stall angle-of-attack. This can increase the stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased stall speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) activation speed. [End Of Cautionary Note] The bleed air anti-ice system must be on whenever icing conditions exist or are anticipated, when on the ground, until immediately prior to commencement of takeoff roll.'' (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) The installation of a supplemental on-ground wing leading edge ice protection system shall be done in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 30&hyph;65, dated October 8, 1992. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51, as of July 22, 1993 (58 FR 33898, June 22, 1993).
