The Beninois team was led by that country's president, Nicephore Soglo, while the head of state, General Sani Abacha, led the Nigerian team. In the opening session of the talks, Gen. Abacha described President Soglo as a distinguished African who has worked to strengthen relations between Nigeria and Benin Republic. He said President Soglo, as ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] chairman, has displayed a high sense of responsibility in handling issues of unity and security in the West African subregion. President Soglo said Africans should always strive to settle their differences themselves. The Beninois leader, whose visit has to do with the economy of the subregion, the Liberian affair, and the Nigeria-Cameroon misunderstanding, advised Africans to unite in order to overcome the economic problems currently facing the continent. President Soglo and his team have since returned home.
