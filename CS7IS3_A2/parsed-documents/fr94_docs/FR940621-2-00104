SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. APPLICANT'S REPRESENTATIONS: 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On July 31, 1989, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act and filed a registration statement under section 8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective on October 2, 1989, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on October 3, 1989. 2. On June 21, 1993, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to transfer all or substantially all of its assets and liabilities to Gradison-McDonald U.S. Government Reserves Series (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a newly-created series of Gradison Cash Reserves Trust in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interest of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Acquiring Funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of one another solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 3. The directors of applicant concluded that the reorganization would benefit applicant's shareholders because the overall fees charged to the combined fund should result in lower fees than are currently being incurred by the applicant. 4. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 was filed with the SEC and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about August 15, 1993. At a special meeting held on September 13, 1993, holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the reorganization. 5. On September 24, 1993, applicant has aggregate net assets of $194,234,642 and a net asset value per share of $1.00. As of September 24, 1993, shares of the Acquiring Fund were distributed to applicant's shareholders. Each shareholder received the proportion of Acquiring Fund shares received by applicant that the number of applicant shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares. 6. Applicant bore expenses of approximately $44,137 in connection with the reorganization. Such expenses were for legal and accounting fees, and the cost of printing and mailing the proxy statements. 7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. 8. Applicants intends to file all documents required to terminate its existence as a Maryland corporation. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14982 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
