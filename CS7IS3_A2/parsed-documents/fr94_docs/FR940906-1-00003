FR940906-1-00003 FR940906-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 1 [Docket No. 27836] Use of Public Aircraft AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Interpretation; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On August 1, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published a notice of its intent to reconsider the definition and legal interpretation of the term ``commercial purposes'' as used in the definition of ``public aircraft'' (59 FR 39192). After receiving a number of requests from interested parties, the agency is extending the comment period on that notice to September 30, 1994. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this notice should be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27836, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591. Comments may be inspected at the above address in Room 915G weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Walsh, AGC&hyph;100, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 701 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Suite 925, Washington, DC 20004; telephone (202) 376&hyph;6406. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 1, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published a notice of its intent to reconsider the definition and legal interpretation of the term ``commercial purposes'' as used in the definition of ``public aircraft'' (59 FR 39192). The FAA has received numerous telephonic and written requests for an extension of the comment period. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the National Air Carrier Association, and the Helicopter Association International, request that the comment period be extended until September 15. The Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, General Services Administration, and the National Association of Police Chiefs request an extension until October 31. The National Association of State Foresters requests a 30-day extension because of the difficulty of communicating with all its members during this particular period of time when there are a number of serious forest wildfires in the West. The FAA has determined that the closing date for comments should be extended to September 30, 1994, to accommodate these requests. Those requesting a longer extension have not advanced compelling reasons why they cannot have their comments completed by September 30. The August 1 notice indicated that the reconsideration process should be completed within 90 days, i.e., by the target date of November 1, 1994. The FAA remains committed to an early resolution of the matter and expects that the reconsideration process will be completed by December 1, 1994. Interested persons are invited to submit any arguments, views, or information they consider relevant. All material received by September 30 will be considered in coming to a final conclusion. Later received material may be considered as time allows. All material submitted will be available for review and copying by interested persons in the FAA Rules Docket No. 27836 at the address given above. Issued in Washington, D.C. on August 31, 1994. John H. Cassady, Deputy Chief Counsel. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21883 Filed 8&hyph;31&hyph;94; 2:27 pm] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
