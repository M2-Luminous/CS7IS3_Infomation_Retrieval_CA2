Vybornov, candidate of military sciences] [Text] The Advanced Research Projects Agency [ARPA] was established in 1958 and bore that name right up until 1972, when it was renamed DARPA (the "D" added to the initial abbreviation signifies Defense) to emphasize the military direction of its work. Direction, coordination and financing of RDT&E having a high degree of technical risk on the one hand and promising a potentially very high return on the other hand became the mission of this Agency, which is independent within the framework of the Defense Department. The Agency, which is independent of the Armed Services, received the opportunity to work immediately under the direction of the highest echelons of the Defense Department on the most promising directions of science and technology, having as the primary objective the winning and holding of U.S. technological superiority in the military area and providing a timely warning of sudden military-technical breakthroughs on the part of the probable enemy. The previous name, ARPA, was returned to the Agency in March 1993. Despite the fact that the question of transfer to the civilian sector and commercialization of dual-purpose technologies has not yet been raised in the United States, this organization's powerful potential was identified very quickly specifically in the area of developing such science-intensive technologies. This was facilitated above all by the Agency's successes in developing such important directions of science as computer engineering, communications equipment and new materials. Many authoritative U.S. specialists believe that positive results the country achieved in the area of information technologies (in which the civilian sector presently has significantly outstripped the military sector in a number of areas) are chiefly to ARPA's credit. Agency investments in military RDT&E contributed to development of the following dual-purpose technologies: computer networks, artificial intelligence, supercomputers with parallel architecture and others. It also organized the first university laboratory in the United States for creating advanced materials, which led in particular to development of light, composite materials having the broadest spectrum of application in civilian and military areas. The Agency played a significant role in commercializing certain technologies for production of semiconductors and laser communication links. Western specialists note that the primary RDT&E task being conducted right up until recent times was to develop technologies needed for creating new arms. In addition, this RDT&E supported military-technical breakthroughs in such areas as phased-array radars, air defense systems, precision weapons, low-signature aircraft, technical reconnaissance equipment, and C[.sup]3[/] systems. In the opinion of the ARPA leadership, because of this Agency's organizational structure it functions in such a way that it has no analogues either in the Defense Department or in U.S. federal agencies. There is not a single research establishment in its makeup, and RDT&E is conducted under contracts with industrial firms, universities and state laboratories. The Agency's authorized strength level as of the beginning of 1993 was 185 persons, including 109 scientists. In contrast to heads of Armed Services programs, ARPA employees can finance RDT&E in advanced areas under a simplified scheme. Each Agency program head carries on work valued at $10-50 million, 80 percent of which is allocated for project development and 20 percent can be directed toward realizing advanced ideas in a particular area, and the right to make the final decision on beginning or ending work remains fully with the program head. As a rule, ARPA begins financing of RDT&E long before it becomes possible to determine its feasibility. Participation financing of RDT&E initiatives by industrial firms and universities is widely practiced. Within the framework of the new U.S. Defense Department weapons acquisition policy announced in January 1992, the director of defense RDT&E of this department received considerably broader powers to monitor the ARPA scientific-technical program. Moreover, in October 1992 the Deputy Secretary of Defense signed a memorandum according to which the above official has the right to monitor the progress and direction of the entire military scientific-technical program. In connection with this, many U.S. specialists express fears that such excessive centralization will have a negative effect on Defense Department capability to react quickly to achievements of S&T progress. ARPA has the following structure: directorate, chief adviser's section, special assistant's section, and ten offices devoted to a specific subject (basic defense research, advanced systems, computers, electronics, land systems, microelectronics, nuclear monitoring research, software and intelligent systems, naval engineering and special projects). This Agency presently oversees a rather large number of projects providing for creation of new technologies in producing integrated circuits which will involve fundamental changes in the semiconductor industry; large-powered computers (in particular, machines already have appeared with a capability of 10[.sup]11[/] operations per second); power sources with high density of stored energy having 100 times greater storage life than existing ones; and a number of others connected with development of dual-purpose technologies. In November 1992 ARPA formed a consortium which set about to create high-resolution displays. Together with twelve of the largest U.S. firms, the Agency plans to make considerable investments in developing a new generation of flat high-resolution displays for use in computers, high-definition television and advanced weapon systems. Despite the fact that this technology appeared for the first time in the United States, at present Japan dominates the world market of flat displays. (Sales volume was $3.5 billion in 1992 and supposedly will reach $7 billion by 1995). During development of the experimental X-31 fighter and a VTOL aircraft under ARPA direction and financing, unique technologies were created which are now being transferred for further development and subsequent use in the area of civilian aircraft construction. Despite the ongoing reduction in the U.S. military budget, ARPA appropriations have risen considerably of late (see Table 1). Table 1 - ARPA Budget in FY 1990-1993 (in $ millions) Item 1990 1991 1992 1993 Basic research 82.6 83.0 115.8 112.5 Exploratory 510.5 676.6 740.4 848.3 development Development of 589.5 633.5 667.6 1,239.6 advanced technologies Administration and 34.0 62.4 68.5 52.8 support Total 1,216.6 1,455.5 1,592.3 2,253.2 the whole, in the period from 1988 through 1993, U.S. Defense Department appropriations for RDT&E dropped by 13 percent in constant prices, while the ARPA budget rose almost threefold ($800 million in 1988). In FY 1993 Congress increased the ARPA budget by $959 million compared with what the administration requested. Approximately $581 million of that amount consists of supplementary appropriations for developing science-intensive dual-purpose technologies connected with realization of measures for conversion of the defense complex (Defense Conversion Initiative). The U.S. military-political leadership believes that this program will permit shifting from the transitional process of transferring technologies from the military into the civilian sector to full integration of the country's civilian and military scientific-technological bases. Data on basic programs being coordinated by ARPA as well as on development and financing of dual-purpose technologies are given in Table 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2 - ARPA Program for Financing Development of Dual-Purpose Technologies| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(in $ millions) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |FY 1993 Appropriations | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Programs |Requested |Appropriated | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Programs | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Joint development of dua-|0 |100 | |l-purpose "critical tech-| | | |nologies" | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Advanced materials |0 |30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Integration of defense a-|0 |50 | |nd civilian RDT&E | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Regional technology cent-|0 |100 | |ers | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Expansion of cooperation |0 |100 | |in developing dual-purpo-| | | |se technologies | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flexible automated produ-|0 |30 | |ction | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |RDT&E in area of pro-|0 |95 | |duction processes | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cooperation in area of d-|0 |24 | |eveloping advanced produ-| | | |ction processes | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Training in area of new |0 |28 | |production technologies | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Auxiliary production pro-|0 |24 | |cesses | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |0 |581 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Existing Programs | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |RDT&E being conducte-|80 |100 | |d by Semitex Consortium | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Large-powered computers |275 |275 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Advanced lithographic pr-|0 |75 | |ocesses | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multichip modules |44 |70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |High-resolution displays |10 |100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Opto-electronics |0 |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |409 |645 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grand Total |409 |1,226 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This data illustrates the pressure Congress puts on the U.S. Defense Department in the direction of expanding the practice of joint development of dual-purpose technologies together with industry, universities and other federal scientific research organizations, instead of implementing the traditional process of transferring technologies into the civilian sector for their commercialization. Initially, in 1986, Congress gave ARPA the right to organize joint programs with private business, conclude cooperation agreements and set up consortiums for conducting RDT&E in precontract stages in developing dual-purpose technologies. These rights were to have been used primarily in those cases where it was a question of work with a vague end result. Such relationships with private business, universities and nonprofit organizations differ from the usual practice of letting contracts with a greater guarantee of rights of intellectual property of the developers of technologies (under the usual procedure the state simply became the owner of the developed technology). The following is a typical example of an agreement on developing dual-purpose technologies concluded by ARPA with a private firm and of conditions set forth in it. ARPA allocated four million dollars to the Gazelle firm to develop high-speed transceivers and corresponding technologies of important military and civilian significance. The firm received full right to sell the product produced both to commercial organizations as well as to the state. An Agency representative became part of the firm's board of directors with the right of deliberative vote. Invested funds are returned by one of the following methods: Either by deducting 1-3 percent from the amount of a specific product's sale over 15 years, or by receiving a corresponding block of firm shares. If the firm should decide to sell technologies or rights to produce a product to a foreign company, ARPA retains the right to locate a domestic client. In case work stops for reason of the project's lack of prospect, the Agency gets back no less than the entire amount it invested. This agreement proved successful. The firm developed and sold a considerable number of transceivers both to ARPA clients as well as to other government agencies. It is believed this practice should be expanded. ARPA's work in developing dual-purpose technologies is evaluated as very effective. At the same time, U.S. specialists note that bureaucratic procedures adopted in the U.S. Defense Department largely interfere with fully realizing the rights Congress granted the Agency. The procedures for approval of agreements already concluded and sanctioned by Congress can last months. The Defense Department leadership recently transformed such agreements into the traditional form of contracts. The ARPA leadership in turn adheres to the viewpoint that the Federal Acquisition Regulation cannot be applied at all when it is a question of developing advanced technologies inasmuch as in this case it is very difficult to define the subject itself of acquisition. In recent years serious differences have arisen between the president's administration and Congress regarding ARPA's role in developing dual-purpose technologies. The administration constantly attempted to limit its role in developing dual and primarily civilian-purpose technologies, but Congress would restore or even increase the volume of financing of such programs. Thus, in the Defense Department budget law for fiscal year 1993 (PL102-484), Congress directly ordered ARPA to engage in developing dual-purpose technologies. This document notes that the following is required of the Agency: - support and stimulate development of a national technological base serving both military as well as civilian purposes through use of common technologies; - direct and carry out basic and applied research in those areas where S&T breakthroughs are possible and which are of great military significance, including advanced civilian technologies. The developers of this law believe that by remaining in the Defense Department structure and fulfilling its new tasks, ARPA should assist the country's military department to implement new state technological policy aimed at integrating the country's civilian and military scientific-technological bases. The question of organizing a civilian analogue of ARPA has been discussed widely in the United States in recent years. Proponents of creating such a department in the United States assert that it will be able to fully realize those properties which make the functioning of the Defense Department's ARPA so effective -- minimal bureaucratization and flexibility of organizational structure. It is presumed that the new department will be financed by government and private business on a parity (fifty-fifty) basis. Like the existing ARPA, it will have to rely on intellectual potential and other resources of industrial firms, universities and federal establishments, including state scientific research organizations, in its work of increasing the effectiveness of the innovation process in the area of developing and commercializing "critical technologies." Opponents of creating a civilian analogue of ARPA believe that the existing Agency has given a sufficiently good account of itself in solving the problem of development and transfer of dual-purpose technologies, and therefore it makes no sense to organize a new one. Some opponents point out that one of the very important factors of ARPA's success is its work with a stable and homogeneous client. A potential client in the private sector is very heterogeneous and has different and quickly changing interests and needs, which inevitably will contribute to reduced effectiveness of the proposed organization's work. The U.S. administration plans to remove developments of a number of key dual-purpose technologies from the purview of the Defense Department and ARPA, in particular, and transfer them (with corresponding appropriations) to civilian federal scientific research establishments. Critics of this decision believe that it will do considerable harm to ARPA's work and make it difficult for the Defense Department to use dual-purpose technologies developed in the private sector. Proponents of the proposed measures, to the contrary, point out that ARPA will not be able to effectively realize a portion of the programs within the scope of the Defense Conversion Initiative (see Table 2). ARPA employees also are troubled by the absence in the Agency of corresponding specialists of industry, who do not wish to go over to state establishments as a result of a substantial difference in pay in the private sector and government agencies. Presently only 20 percent of Agency employees have come from industry and 80 percent from state establishments. Another negative point, in the opinion of opponents of a change in ARPA's role, is the tendency which has become apparent toward reduced attention given by the Agency to the support of basic research. In FY 1993 only $112.5 million from an overall budget of $2,253.2 billion were allocated for such research. Such a concentration of efforts on applied research and development of dual-purpose technologies promising a quick commercial return did not allow ARPA to fully organize long-range basic work. The opposite viewpoint also exists, that an expansion in ARPA's role and inclusion of technologies primarily with a civilian orientation in its sphere of development allegedly will permit the Defense Department to acquire and master more easily what are as a rule less expensive and more reliable civilian technologies. Certain specialists of the National Academy of Sciences believe that the Defense Department is not a department capable of elevating the level of civilian (dual) technologies, and they propose to create a semigovernmental civilian technologies corporation for this purpose. As pointed out in a recent Defense Research Institute report, the greatest effect can be provided by using ARPA to build up scientific-technological potential and develop general-purpose technologies, not to develop specific technologies. This does not mean the Agency is incapable of performing the latter task but, in the opinion of authors of the report, Congress must restore the balance between high-risk advanced research and applied work.
