Mr. Fedorov said he intended to meet President Yeltsin early this week to make a final decision. Boris Fedorov advanced as a condition for his continued service for the government the resignation of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the agricultural sector, and the Chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. For Boris Fedorov, these two are a symbol of anti-reformist trends in the government.
