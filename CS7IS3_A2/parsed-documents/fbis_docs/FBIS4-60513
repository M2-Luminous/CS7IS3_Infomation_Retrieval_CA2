During the meeting, they discussed the Palestinian situation and the successive developments in the wake of the signing of the Cairo agreement. The Russian envoy indicated the importance of the terms of reference for negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli track, based on international legitimacy and its resolutions, in a way that secures the Palestinian people's right to establish an independent state and guarantee a just solution to the refugee issue. For his part, Hawatimah said the Cairo agreement fragmented the Arab negotiation front and opened the way for separate and partial solutions that cannot achieve comprehensive peace and stability in the region. He indicated this agreement carries the elements of its own failure. Hawatimah demanded the activation of the Russian role in the region in order to achieve the interests of the Arab and Russian peoples and bring about real peace.
