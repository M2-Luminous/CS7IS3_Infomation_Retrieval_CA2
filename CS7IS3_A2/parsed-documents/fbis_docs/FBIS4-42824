The opening session was held this morning. The foreign ministers of the 16 member countries are participating. At the opening session, speeches were delivered by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, honorary chairman British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, and acting NATO Secretary General Sergio Valencino. The first speech was delivered by Cetin who said that under the changing world conditions, like other international organizations, NATO saw itself insufficient. He pointed out that difficulties are being faced at times in positing the will that can bring about any changes. Within this framework, he said, the decisions reached during the NATO summit held in January were very appropriate. Assessing NATO's functions so far, Cetin stated that the alliance must be able to meet the needs of the political and strategic conditions in Europe. He stressed that first and foremost NATO must have credibility. I consider the alliance as a basic vehicle in establishing European stability, he said, adding that NATO should be able to play a more effective role in areas where stability has been upset. Cetin said: The developments of the past few years should teach us some lessons. One of them is that even though we are on the eve of the 21st century, certain communities do not refrain from resorting to barbaric methods to further their own interests. In such situations where all the values and principles we uphold are violated, it is impossible for the alliance to avert its eyes and hope that the conflict will go away. Foreign Minister Cetin stressed that when it has to act, NATO must do so in a timely fashion and with determination. That is the only way to prevent barbarism in crisis areas, he said. Cetin pointed out that the success of the alliance should be ignored, adding that its determined approach in Bosnia-Herzegovina prevented the conflict from spreading further and contributed to peace.
