The weekly also reported the possibility of an economic recovery in the country in 1994. In an editorial dedicated to what it calls "parliaments in the workplace" (general assemblies dedicated to discussing current economic difficulties and their eventual solutions), the official mouthpiece of the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions [CTC] notes that usually during debates workers note that it is necessary for each organization to adopt its own measures in the search for efficiency. The weekly adds: We have no other reasonable road but to reduce costs, to increase labor productivity, and to get as much as possible from the available resources. The weekly warns that a high degree of labor discipline is a matter of attitude, awareness of social duties, and patriotism. TRABAJADORES reports that economic policy proposals unleash real or imaginary conflicts of interests and contrary opinions. In illustrating this assertion, the weekly notes that suggestions for higher prices prompt concern for people who live on relatively low salaries. The weekly adds: If somebody speaks in favor of subsidizing low-income people but not the goods now being sold at prices below production costs, some people will point to how complex this kind of compensatory mechanism is. The weekly notes that one of the main concerns of the workers is crime, its relationship with the black market, and the effect this has on social and labor discipline. The weekly wonders about an eventual solution and then states that people at all levels demand that drastic and examplary measures be applied to resolve the problems of theft and the diversion of goods, which increases costs, demoralizes the community, and makes rich the so-called "macetas" (traffickers, speculators, etc.). The weekly links all this to the need for strict compliance with financial norms. It also mentions the need to modify the tax system, possibly expanding it. The weekly reports: Signs of economic recovery in some production sectors and activities are expected in 1994, and this includes rationalizing finances based on an lofty political consensus. TRABAJADORES reports that the Cuban people are moving onto a more offensive phase in key aspects of the struggle to safeguard the fatherland's sovereignty and the socialist nature of the revolution. The weekly admits that the complexity of the problems shows how naive it would be to expect magic-like measures. It goes on to discard "packages" that "smell too much like Third-World capitalism and neoliberal policies," which would prompt higher prices, unemployment, and the elimination of social services. We are in urgent need of improving our economic efficiency, but we must not run full speed ahead to secure technical objectives without first considering political effects, the weekly states. TRABAJADORES calls for not allowing the slightiest indication of ritualism or formalism in the parliaments in the workplace, and it states that it is essential that managers throughout the country clearly report the economic and financial outlook of each workplace.
