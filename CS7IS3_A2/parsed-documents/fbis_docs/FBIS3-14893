Yefimov, director of the Center for Regional Development of Crimea, by O. Kulakovskaya, under the "Economics: The Market and Reforms" rubric; place and date not given: "Shall We Begin From the Beginning?"] [Text] Slowly hurrying--this is probably how one would characterize the movement the current government of Crimea is constantly attempting to carry out in the fight to attain Crimean statehood. Have the main reference points changed? Will we not have to go back to the beginning in connection with our establishment of the institution of the presidency? These questions constitute the leading theme of conversation between our correspondent and S.A. Yefimov, director of the Center for Regional Development of Crimea. [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, a certain stage in the lives of Crimeans has been completed. We have "undergone" a presidential election and demonstrated a high level of civic self-consciousness. Exhibiting a "high-flown style," we have passed the examination for statehood. But our problems have not become fewer as a result of this. In fact, with regard to problems demanding immediate resolution.... [Yefimov] Indeed, construction of the Crimean state has entered its concluding phase. A president has been elected. In the next two or three months, now in accordance with the Constitution in effect, a government will be formed and for the first time elections to the Crimean Supreme Council will be held. As far as the activity of the Crimean president is concerned, here two paths are possible. The first is to begin everything on a clean slate, as they say, considering that nothing existed prior to this; the second--to provide a continuity with respect to whatever positive undertakings have already managed to be achieved. I must note that the president of Crimea did not permit himself to be lured away by the first path--extremely advantageous to official Kiev, but instead chose the second, a path firmly sanctioned in the practice of the world community. [Kulakovskaya] Well, since we are talking about continuity, one basic question in this regard is the matter of reconciling budget relations with the Ukrainian side. An agreement on this matter was signed in December between the Governments of Ukraine and Crimea. This evoked feelings approaching euphoria even as early as the days of the presidential campaign, as if to say--we have succeeded in resolving a key issue, now.... Well, what does happen now? [Yefimov] Well now, for the hundredth time we can assert that the Ukrainian leadership has never learned to fulfill its obligations. Mr. Zvyahilskyy signs an agreement with Crimea with one hand, and with the other--the draft Law on the Ukraine Budget for 1994, which automatically cancels the mutual agreements. Naturally, the Ukrainian Supreme Council is also acting as if no such agreement were concluded, and has secured this in the Law on the Ukraine Budget--this in spite of the fact that the agreement was concluded in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on demarcation of powers between Crimea and Ukraine. So what do we see as the result? The Government of Ukraine is not fulfilling the obligations it has assumed. It is violating its very own laws and instigating the parliament to do the same. We see a not very pretty picture. I believe the people of Crimea must be aware of this shameful practice on the part of Ukraine's upper echelons of power. The question of mutual budget relations is a key issue for Crimea, for without it virtually no transformations in the economic sphere can take place. It is precisely for this reason that this was a topic of discussion at the first meeting between the presidents of Crimea and Ukraine. As a fundamental issue, it will remain a topic of subsequent talks. The Government of Ukraine must immediately guarantee fulfillment of this agreement, and with the aim of ensuring an integral system of administration and financing, it must change the jurisdiction of the State Price Inspectorate, Tax Inspectorate, and Control and Auditing Directorate of the Ukraine Ministry of Finance for the Crimean Republic, so that these fall under the appropriate structures of the government of Crimea. [Kulakovskaya] Aside from budget relations, as of today we see that property relationships are not settled either.... [Yefimov] Quite right. This is a second key issue that requires immediate examination. We have to recognize that the problem of demarcation of property between Ukraine and the Crimean Republic remains an open one to this day partially because the Crimean Supreme Council made an unfortunate decision at one time. The necessary step was not to ask the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, but rather to draw up an appropriate document ourselves and then work on settling aspects in dispute. This was not done, unfortunately. For half a year now, the question has been in a state of suspension. The Ukrainian side is making every effort to "shake it up." [Kulakovskaya] Well, this is understandable--he who is stronger dictates the conditions.... [Yefimov] I believe that any relationship, especially one on the state level, must be built on the basis of mutual understandings. The entirety of world practical experience shows this. It is impossible to attain anything good when one ignores the interests of the other side. The results of the presidential election in Crimea is a clear example of this. You cannot show disdain for the will of the people. Even the most ultranationalistic forces of Ukraine are simply obliged to deal with it. [Kulakovskaya] Yes, but they are not accustomed to dealing with it.... [Yefimov] It does not matter--they must be trained. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is always attempting to "squash" the issue of demarcation of property when it examines lists of facilities. No, it is necessary here to look for common approaches, common principles, according to which we can act. One of these, which I proposed and which found support in the government of Crimea: that all facilities located in the territory of Crimea and subject to privatization in accordance with Ukrainian legislation in effect constitute property of the Republic of Crimea. Funds obtained from privatization must not be dissipated--they must serve to promote the welfare of the people of Crimea, being directed toward the implementation of one socioeconomic program or another. All facilities operating primarily in the interests of the region must also be placed within the category of property of the Crimean Republic. While for those facilities that do not fall under these categories, mutually agreed upon decisions must be taken. Here is where a facility-by-facility approach is possible. [Kulakovskaya] What if talks on these issues do not yield positive results? [Yefimov] In that event, the Supreme Council of Crimea must independently draw up a document respecting demarcation of state property. In doing so, it will confirm the zero-option decision adopted in 1991. We must be consistent in our actions. We have shown respect and proposed joint efforts, but if we see no movement in response, we have the right to take independent steps. [Kulakovskaya] But will these be acknowledged as constitutional? [Yefimov] Absolutely. This is purely a question of economics. Many in Kiev are finally finding it necessary to rid themselves of nationalistic narrowmindedness and avoid confusing separatism with bread. [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, do you think the presidential election, having convincingly secured the statehood of Crimea, gives us the right to be more persistent in looking after our interests? [Yefimov] Without a doubt. Crimea has today become a more active entity, deservedly acquiring this right. As far as to what extent it will be exercised--I will not be the judge. But the realm of prospective opportunities has broadened significantly.
