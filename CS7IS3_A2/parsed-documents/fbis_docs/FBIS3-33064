Fretes was the head of the Investigative Department during the previous government and according to the "Terror Archive," he was one of Pastor Coronel's [former investigative police chief accused of human right violations] trusted men during [Alfredo] Stroessner's dictatorship. Presidential Decree 2325 says that Publio Fretes replaces Superintendent Justino Ramon Bracho "who will receive another assignment." Surprised Dinar officials confirmed in the afternoon that the decree was released yesterday morning without them knowing that their director had been changed.
