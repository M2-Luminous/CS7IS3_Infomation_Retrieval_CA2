The Ministry of Information has announced that on the basis of this report and the ensuing discussion, the Federal Government will adopt special conclusions at one of its future sessions. [passage omitted] In a report dealing with requests by certain international bodies and organizations to send permanent missions or representatives to Kosovo-Metohija, the government noted a clear tendency to put forward such requests to replace the suspended CSCE mission. The government concluded that for reasons of principle the FRY cannot accept requests for a CERD [as received] mission and UNESCO representatives to be sent to Yugoslavia and to have a seat in Kosovo-Metohija because Yugoslavia as a state is not allowed to participate in the work of these bodies and organizations as an equal participant. As proof of good will, the Federal Government concluded that Yugoslavia still expresses full readiness for dialogue and more intensive cooperation on an equal basis with those bodies and organizations -- of which Yugoslavia is a signatory, initiator and founder -- which is in mutual interest and in the interest of peace, security and cooperation in Europe and the world.
