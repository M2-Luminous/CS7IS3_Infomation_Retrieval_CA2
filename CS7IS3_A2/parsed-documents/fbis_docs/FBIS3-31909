The defense minister is no exception. There are no other requirements other than to be a Venezuelan citizen, more than 30 years of age, and a lay person [seglar]. Therefore, in theory, a civilian, a retired military member, or an active military member could hold the post. There are no requirements of rank for the post of defense minister. When General Lopez Contreras became president, he appointed Colonel Isaias Medina Angarita as war and navy minister, as the position was called back then, despite the fact there were very important Armed Forces generals in active service, such as Gen. Manuel Moran, Gen. (Antonio Chalvo Cardona), and Gen. David Lopez Enriquez. In this case, I have decided to appoint a division general who has more than enough merits for the post and who currently is second in the Army's hierarchy. The Constitution empowers the president, as FAN commander in chief, to carry out this delicate task. This task is so important that it is one of the two posts the president, according to the Constitution, can directly appoint without the need to have the minister confirm the appointment. This is perfectly clear, simple, and is a tradition that dates back in our democracy. During each constitutional period, the president appointed the defense minister and the top military command. When President Romulo Betancourt handed over the Presidency to fellow party member Dr. Raul Leoni, Dr. Leoni did not confirm Gen. Antonio Briceno Linares, who was Betancourt's defense minister and who still had two years of service before retiring; instead, he appointed Gen. Ramon Florencio Gomez. When I took over as president after Dr. Leoni, I did not confirm Dr. Gomez, who still had a few more months of service before retiring. Instead, I appointed Gen. Martin Garcia Villazmil as defense minister. When my period in office ended and Mr. Carlos Andres Perez took office, he did not keep or confirm Gen. (Gustavo Pardo Davila), who still had some time before retirement; instead, he appointed Gen. Homero Leal Torres. This tradition was broken when President Luis Herrera Campins took office, who confirmed Gen. Paredes Bello to the ministry. Something similar happened in the following years; nevertheless, when President Perez again became president, he made his own military appointments. I want to refer to the statements by Vice Admiral Radamez Munoz Leon regarding my decision, statements that are improper for an active member of the military. I must reject the statement that I have humiliated the minister and members of the High Command. I do not know how this can be termed humiliation when I have invited them to my home, courteously telling them I had decided--after meditating the situation of the country and Armed Forces--to appoint a new defense minister and a new military High Command. I added that I wanted to give them my full recognition as a Venezuelan and as a participant in the electoral process for the services rendered to the country regarding this electoral process and in defense of the democratic institution. I have told them they were entitled to announce this decision to reporters if they felt they should, or if they preferred they could say they had gone to my house to tender their respective positions. This is what the defense minister termed as childish, a totally unjustified remark. I do not want to refer to the minister's other remarks, except one which I consider important. One cannot speak of a rift within the Armed Forces simply because seven generals--of whom five are retiring in four months because they have been in service for a long time, the two others, in one year and four months-- will request, as President Velasquez told me they had requested, their retirement. There is no rift within the Armed Forces. There simply is a decision, perfectly regular within the armed institutes. Furthermore, I am convinced the adopted decision strengthens the Armed Forces' unity. I have absolute confidence the Armed Forces are aware of their role within the Constitution and the laws, which is to abide by and firmly support the president's decisions when exercising the powers vested upon him by the Constitution.
