If efforts have failed or have not been made in this connection, the town of Layoune in Western Sahara has been a focus of attention in recent days. The Saudi interior minister is currently in Layoune, which was visited recently by his French counterpart. This has aroused the anger of the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro]. Our correspondent Mourad has the details: [Mourad] Polisario yesterday expressed its surprise and displeasure at the visit of Charles Pasqua to Layoune two days ago. In a communique the Front describes the French interior minister's visit to be blatantly at variance with the responsibility of France as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Nothing has filtered out about the Pasqua visit, which coincided with the presence of Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz in Layoune. The senior Saudi official has been in Layoune on a private visit since last Thursday, according to MAP. The situation in Western Sahara remains generally tense, as admitted by special UN representative Yaqub Khan, who has further said that he is making efforts to resolve the Saharan problem. The special UN representative made this statement after meeting President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya of Mauritania in Nouakchott yesterday. It should be mentioned that the UN peace plan for a referendum in Western Sahara is obstructed by a disagreement between Morocco and Polisario, the conflicting parties, over the number of voters.
