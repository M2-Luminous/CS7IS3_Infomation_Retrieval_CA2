The visit will add a new dimension to the favorable relations Turkey and Syria have recently established. Mentese will visit the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camp in the al-Biqa' Valley; the camp was closed some time ago. In a statement to HURRIYET, Agar said: "Syrian officials want us to visit the al-Biqa' Valley. We probably will. Our relations with Syria are very favorable. Of course, results cannot be achieved immediately. Nevertheless, all the closed doors have been opened." A Syrian delegation will visit Ankara in February after the Turkish delegation headed by Nahit Mentese visits Syria. A Turkish delegation headed by Kamil Tecirlioglu, deputy director general of police, returned to Ankara from Damascus with favorable impressions the night before last. Tecirlioglu discussed the revelations by Syrian citizens arrested in Turkey and asked the Syrian officials to clarify the situation. The Syrian officials were reluctant to give Tecirlioglu detailed information on PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's situation. The Turkish delegation's impression was that Syria is reluctant to return Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey. In a statement during the Turkish delegation's talks in Damascus, Major General Budayr al-Hasan, deputy under secretary of the Syrian Ministry of Internal Affairs Security Department, said his country has nothing to gain from activities that threaten Turkey's security and territorial integrity.
