He told TASS over the phone on Sunday these rumours were heavily aggravating the already tense situation in the North Caucasian republic, while petty political intrigues by various groups and groupings claiming to be Chechen opposition hampered the movement towards achieving national accord in society. 41-year-old Mamodayev is one of Dudayev's major political opponents, who was accused by the Chechen prosecutor's office of "high treason and attempted violent overthrow of the existing regime." But Mamodayev flatly rejects use of force in settling political issues. "To avoid self-extermination of the Chechen people, all its representatives, both those in power and those in opposition, should immediately agree to the only possible way of saving the republic: To step down simultaneously and call new democratic elections," the opposition leader proposed. The accord thus achieved might lay the foundation for building Chechnya's relations with Russia, he believes.
