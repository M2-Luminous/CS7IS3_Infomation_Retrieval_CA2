For months there has seemed no question of United Nations troops forcing aid past roadblocks. Although the arguments for this feeble approach have been more current among diplomats in London, Paris and New York than with the infantry grinding through the Bosnian slush, the result has been a timid interpretation of the UN mandate for the UN forces delivering aid. Amid demoralisation all round, soldiers barred from using "all available means," as the UN promised, have been reduced to persuading, or bribing, their way past gunmen, old women or freelance gangsters. With too much aid being looted, tension has mounted between the troops and the people they are there to help. In London and Paris the politicians, prepared to utter fierce threats at the UN and NATO but unwilling to implement them, have taken to muttering "a plague on all their houses" and hinted that they will bring their boys home. Now Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the new UN commander in Bosnia, has begun to inject some soldierly sense into the morass of political indecision and half-measures. Declaring his intention to break with the "inconsistent and sometimes faint-hearted" use of the UN's mandate, he has tried what a little muscle can do. Earlier this week, he informed all parties that he would be mounting a "hardline, hardnosed" drive to deliver relief. Yesterday, confronted by a Serb roadblock near Sarajevo, he sent British Warrior combat vehicles to back up negotiations and announced that they would force a way through if these failed. Within hours, all UN traffic was moving normally. The Serbs had been "persuaded" to honour the oft-repeated pledge by all sides not to block humanitarian operations. On Route Diamond, the lifeline to central Bosnia, a British armoured escort dispersed a civilian mob attempting to loot another convoy by firing two rounds in the air. This and other small but symbolically important successes must now be built on. The immediate task is to get through to the most vulnerable enclaves. NATO should declare Tuzla airport open and say that any Serb attacks will be met with the force, including air power, at the UN's disposal. The Mostar-Sarajevo road could, with determination, be secured. Such steps seem less politically impossible than they did a few weeks ago. Sir Michael has said he has no qualms about calling in air power to protect his troops. The UN secretary-general has at last agreed to delegate decisions on air power to local level, where they belong. France is now demanding an end to Western military and diplomatic paralysis. Douglas Hurd appears to have returned from the Bosnian front line a wiser man. British soldiers did not make mass complaints that humanitarian relief was prolonging the fighting. They pointed out what should have been obvious: first, that the military would always eat even when women and children starved; second, that the big losers would be the Bosnian government side, the victims of aggression. Unlike the Serbs and Croats, they were hemmed in, with no external supply lines. British officers told him that they were confident they could do a decent job of saving lives, if they were only permitted to set about it more "robustly." Sir Michael has made a good start in the field; the diplomats must do their part, starting on Monday when the European Union's [EU] foreign ministers meet. The UN has now officially confirmed what has been common knowledge for weeks: Croatia's deployment of regular forces in Bosnia. Britain and France must push Germany to come off the fence and agree immediately to end Croatia's trade concessions with the EU. Germany's main obsession, in an election year, is to stem the flow of Croatian refugees; but Croatia's escalation of the war will have just that effect, and deterrence is imperative. The UN Security Council must go further than the EU, imposing economic sanctions. This would make it far easier to persuade the Russians that Serbs as well as Croats must yield more territory. That is the way to end this war. There has been too much talk about the Bosnian government's intransigence in refusing to accept patchwork fragments of territory which nobody dares pretend can long be viable as a state. So long as the Bosnians have nothing to lose, it is absurd to expect them to lay down their arms.
