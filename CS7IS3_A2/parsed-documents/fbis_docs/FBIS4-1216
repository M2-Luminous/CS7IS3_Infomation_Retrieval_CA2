He told a crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos after elections. He did not elaborate. "We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no looting or interference in people's private property. We're developing creative programmes in which people are taking part. "Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family, black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity." The ANC president branded as "prophets of doom" those predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: "I appeal to whites in particular not to fear the future." The ANC recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had become "the most valuable asset in this country". Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving South Africa and made an "earnest appeal from a man who has spent 27 year in jail" for them to stay."All of you in this country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your country. This is our country. "We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment." A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he would take up these issues in discussions with State President F W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt elections. "We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous progress despite the attempts of criminals. "Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the security forces." The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal. "The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP [South African Police] have done nothing of these things except to run round in the streets." Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for current violence. "I want to state very clearly that those people involved in killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position they hold, will be dealt with according to the law," he told the cheering crowd. "They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay." Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government and amounted to stopping the ANC from "bettering the lives of all". The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told a media conference after the rally. "They are not bluffed by the National Party." He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural mix as one of the country's strongest assets. Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did not mean "black majority rule". "All of you must pledge to be part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a government of the minority and can never be a government of majority in this country. "I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in the future. Stay here and help us." Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South Africa, he replied: "I feel elated. At the same time, I feel sad," explaining that many people who had made freedom possible were not alive to see it happen.
