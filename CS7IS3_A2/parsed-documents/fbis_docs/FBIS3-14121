['Amarah] The term fundamentalism, as used in the Western sense, has a negative connotation. In the Islamic and Arabic sense, fundamentalists are groups that advocate jihad and revival and they are not, as is the case in the West, ungrateful, reactionary, and imitative. The aspects that all Islamic movements in the whole Islamic world have in common are that they have an Islamic source [al-marji'iyah al-islamiyah] and form an alternative to Western secularism and materialism. They seek to establish a totally Islamic society and a state committed to the Islamic shari'ah. However, they can be distinguished from one another and their programs vary according to their own national situations and the challenges confronting them. The Islamic movement in Egypt is not newly-formed, as is the case in Algeria. [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two movements? ['Amarah] The Muslim Brotherhood constitutes the major Islamic movement in Egypt. It is the mother movement of all Islamic movements worldwide. In Egypt there are a group of ulema, thinkers, and innovative and creative revivalists who are involved in the Islamic cultural plan. Egyptian society does not accept large-scale violence. In Algeria, the Islamic movement is new and is poor in cadres. The Algerian movement represents a grouping of trends and is a front in the real sense of the word. Also, the challenges of Westernization and the francophonists in Algeria are more intense in view of the influence of French colonization. [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between the two movements? ['Amarah] No. The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria is purely Algerian and emanated from Algeria. The Algerian group that is methodologically linked to the Muslim Brotherhood is "Hamas" [The Algerian Islamic Society Movement]. [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities' relationship with each group? ['Amarah] The present regime in Algeria derives from an illegal coup against the Algerian nation's choice. This is not the case in Egypt. Also, violence in Algeria is comprehensive and severe, whereas in Egypt a limited number commit acts of violence, although the information media exaggerate them. Violence in Egypt meets violence from a sector of the state, but not all the state supports violence and not all the Islamic movement supports violence. [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements in Egypt and Algeria? ['Amarah] The Islamic movement in Algeria will inevitably triumph because all the people support it and the Algerian regime is completely impotent. The situation in Egypt is different. The Egyptian regime's resources are much greater than those of the Algerian one. However, the red lines that the outside world draws against any change in favor of Islam in Egypt are much clearer in view of Egypt's role and influence. Moreover, the Islamic movement in Egypt is not facing a dilemma. The dilemma in Egypt lies in the absence of secular parties among the masses. My conviction is that the Islamic trend in Egypt is not in a hurry to take power; its present goal is to have an opportunity to act legally, and this would lessen the violence that is distorting the image of the Islamic trend. [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the ruling regime continue? ['Amarah] It will continue as long as the regime prevents the Islamic trend from exercising lawful and legal rights in accordance with the democratic rules and as long as it refuses to yield power, particularly if the masses elect the Islamic trend. If the regimes in Egypt and Algeria agree to honest elections and provide an opportunity for all diverse ideological trends, the confrontation will come to an end and violence will decline. [Al-Mughrabi) Do you really expect either of the movements to take power? ['Amarah] That the Islamic trend is fated to take power in all Islamic countries is inescapable. [Al-Mughrabi] What are the similarities between Egypt's and Algeria's Islamic fundamentalism? [Amin] These two phenomena have an identical socioeconomic background particularly in the obvious features of unemployment, housing shortages, slums, corruption, high cost of living, and inflation. Another similarity lies in the just demand of both Islamic streams to establish a government that will apply Islamic shari'ah. [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two movements? [Amin] There is a difference that results from Algeria's history and its bitter struggle against French colonialism. In that struggle Algeria had to raise the banner of Islam, not the banner of Algerian or pan-Arab nationalism, in order to secure the loyalty of the Berbers, who comprise more than 30 percent of the population. Consequently Algeria's Islamic appeal began before its Egyptian counterpart. Another difference is the topography of the land. Unlike Egypt, Algeria has hilly terrain that facilitates resistance and jihad operations, and subsequent escape. The third difference is that Algerians lack proficiency in the Arabic language because of French colonialism. As a result, an ordinary member of any Islamic group in Egypt knows more about Islam than the FIS leaders themselves. I realized this during a 3-hour meeting with Abbasi Madani. A third difference is the Algerians' hot temper, resulting no doubt from their long struggle against colonialism. This quality is evident in the FIS terrorists' actions against the government. [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between the two movements? [Amin] Certainly there are. When I was ambassador in Algeria I knew perfectly well that contacts were going on and that dozens of FIS members were constantly traveling to Egypt on commercial or educational pretexts. Members of Egypt's Islamic groups were doing the same thing, and the Egyptian intelligence services were aware of that. When I noticed that these contacts were going too far, I proposed restoration of visa requirements for travel between the two countries. [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities' relationship with each group? [Amin] Just as the two Islamic groups communicate and coordinate with each other, the Egyptian and Algerian Governments are also coordinating their stands. I believe that the two regimes are very wrong to handle this issue from the security angle alone. This method is fruitless, especially as these groups do not value life very highly and eagerly seek martyrdom in order to go to paradise. This is why I believe terrorist actions will continue. [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements in Egypt and Algeria? [Amin] Algeria has no Christian minority like Egypt. It does not have a problem similar to the Egyptian Christians' refusal to be governed according to shari'ah. The real dilemma in both countries is the existence of an intellectual class that rejects Islamic rule. If the Islamists take power, the intellectuals will emigrate. Algerian intellectuals began to leave the country after the Islamists won the local elections in 1990. [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the ruling regime continue? [Amin] It will continue until either the regime or the Islamic trend is defeated. [Al-Mughrabi] Do you really expect either of the two movements to take power? [Amin] This is more likely to happen in Algeria than in Egypt, particularly as [Algerian President Lamine] Zeroual has begun reconciliation moves. In Egypt the terror will last for many more years.
