FR940325-0-00088 FR940325-0-00016 Comment: Some commenters requested that trustee officials be required to provide a detailed analysis of the factors listed in §11.82(d). Response: The Department believes that a trustee official's analysis of the factors listed in §11.82(d), like all statements required under the regulations, should be detailed enough to provide PRPs, other trustee officials, the general public, any other interested parties, and ultimately the courts with an adequate opportunity to evaluate the analysis. The level of detail may vary depending on the alternatives involved. The Department does not believe that any revision of the rule is necessary. Comment: One commenter requested that proposed §11.82(d)(10), which addressed consideration of consistency with applicable Federal and State laws and policies, be amended to include reference to tribal laws and policies. Response: The Department agrees with the commenter and has revised the rule accordingly. As noted in the July 22, 1993, Federal Register notice, the Department has also decided that consideration of compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal laws should be distinguished from consideration of consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies. Therefore, the Department has revised the language of proposed §11.82(d)(10) to list these two factors separately. Comment: A few commenters suggested that the Department prohibit trustee officials from considering factors other than those listed. These commenters expressed concern that in the absence of such a prohibition, trustee officials might base their decisions on inappropriate considerations. Response: The Department believes that in some situations there may be appropriate considerations in addition to the factors listed in §11.82(d). Section 11.82(d) already provides that all factors considered must be relevant. The Department does not believe that any revision of the rule is necessary. Comment: Some commenters stated that the rule should clearly authorize trustee officials to choose a natural recovery alternative when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Some commenters thought that the Department should provide guidance on how trustee officials could maximize the opportunities for natural recovery. Response: The Department believes that the rule does clearly authorize trustee officials to select a natural recovery alternative when appropriate. In fact, §11.82(c)(2) explicitly requires trustee officials to consider a ``No Action-Natural Recovery'' alternative. Development of additional guidance is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Comment: Some commenters thought that the rule should not discriminate among the four components of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and acquisition of equivalent resources. Other commenters thought that the rule should not grant acquisition of land the same status as restoration, rehabilitation, or replacement. These commenters stated that CERCLA and Ohio v. Interior establish a clear preference for using restoration or replacement costs, as opposed to acquisition costs, as the measure of damages. The commenters noted that section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA does list restoration, replacement, and acquisition of equivalent resources as legitimate uses of collected damages but then provides that the measure of damages shall not be limited by restoration and replacement costs. According to the commenters, these statutory provisions indicate, and the court in Ohio v. Interior recognized, that amounts recovered must be spent first on feasible restoration or replacement actions and then any excess funds are to be spent on acquisition of equivalent resources. These commenters also stated that land acquisition does nothing to improve the condition of the injured natural resources.
