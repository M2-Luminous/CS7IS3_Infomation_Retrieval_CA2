The selective program, the previous sole source of finances for this and other agricultural activities, will definitely be abolished on March 31. The approved finances by the National Bank of Macedonia -- a total of 140 million denars -- are aimed only for financing the production of corn. The stabilization program restrictions even more limit the possibilities of any additional sources. Thus, changes will have to be introduced in the plans for sowing of 218,140 hectares with rice, sugar beet, sunflower, and other products.
