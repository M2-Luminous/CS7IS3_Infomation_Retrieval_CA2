According to the Ministry of the Power Industry, this figure is 24 percent of the planned annual target of 890 billion kwh. Of the total, 183.4 billion kwh were produced by thermal power plants and 27.5 billion kwh by hydroelectric power stations. An official from the ministry said eight power grids along the coast produced more electricity than the six others in the interior. Despite the increase, the power supply is still far short of demand. By the end of last year China's power generating capacity had reached 181 million kw and another 12 million kw will be added this year. China plans to add 16 million kw of generating capacity every year from 1995-2000 so as to bring the country's total generating capacity up to some 300 million kw by the turn of the century. The Ministry of Power Industry expects another ten percent increase in power production in the second quarter.
