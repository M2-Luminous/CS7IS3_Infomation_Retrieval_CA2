Speaking at a press conference at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo, Zhu added: "I hope the renminbi will be stable in the future, too." Currently, one dollar is exchanged for about 8.70 yuan on the Chinese inter-bank foreign exchange market. The new unification and controlled floating exchange-rate system, based on market supply and demand, was introduced on January 1. Zhu said China unified the system in an effort to pave the way for its re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). "So far the reform of foreign exchange rates has been successful and China would eventually make the renminbi a hard currency that is exchangeable internationally," Zhu added. The vice premier arrived in Japan Wednesday [23 February] for a nine-day official visit. He is expected to leave for western and southwestern Japan Saturday.
