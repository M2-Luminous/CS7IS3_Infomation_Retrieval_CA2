This will be the second time President De Leon Carpio participates in this regional summit. [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...all the presidents and heads of state who will attend this important meeting, especially those of us representing Central America. We will not present individual proposals from each country, but a proposal as a family, as we have called it. With this in mind, we will have a preparatory meeting in El Salvador to unify opinions and criteria, particularly on a proposal we already presented -- I had the honor of presenting it recently in Washington -- on a pilot project for Central America for ecological protection and an alliance for sustained development of the area. Our forests and natural parks -- which no longer belong to us, but to mankind -- must be protected with the assistance of Ibero-American countries. This will probably be one of the proposals we will present in a unified manner. In any event, Central American countries will present unified proposals with the hope that many of them will receive a positive reply for our nations and for the Central American people. [Unidentified reporter] When will this meeting take place? We understand that all the Central American presidents will arrive together. [De Leon] The preparatory meeting will be on 31 May in San Salvador, on the occasion of the presidential inauguration. We will take advantage of that opportunity to exchange views and unify criteria. In August, we will arrive together at the summit of the Ibero-American presidents and heads of state to show our solidarity as a bloc, and our integration, which is not only economic but political and extends to all areas. We will meet in San Jose, Costa Rica, and from there all the Central American presidents will travel together in one plane, to show our solidarity and maintain our unity which has always been so necessary in Central America, and which today is more urgent in facing the economic and political blocs. I believe we are definitely advancing toward true Central American integration. [end recording]
