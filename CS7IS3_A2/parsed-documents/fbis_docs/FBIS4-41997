Rybkin said this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent at Vnukovo-2 airport today on the parliamentarians' return to Moscow. Ivan Rybkin noted that a plan will be drawn up on the results of the trip to enable the deputies who were members of the chamber's delegation to start work on new laws needed by the regions visited. He stressed that some regions of Siberia and the Far East have drawn up draft laws dealing with problems most topical for them and have sent them to the Duma as a legislative initiative. In particular, Ivan Rybkin reported, in the very near future a draft law on the status of Maritime Kray may be submitted to the Duma. Ivan Rybkin also noted that the State Duma -- jointly with the Russian president and government and the regions of Siberia and the Far East -- will tackle the issue of railway and electric power tariffs. He stressed that now this is one of the most serious factors affecting the economic emergence of Russian territories. The Duma speaker said: "It is absolutely obvious that these issues need to be settled by the state."
