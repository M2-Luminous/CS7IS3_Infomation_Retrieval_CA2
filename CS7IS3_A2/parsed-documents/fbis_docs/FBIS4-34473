The economic future of the state depends on a political decision, one that can lead to the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs, increase tax revenues, and attract new investments. It is unfair that this state, which accounts for more than 60 percent of all the oil produced by Brazil, is forbidden by the Constitution from collecting a single cent of the ICMS [Goods and Services Distribution Tax] on operations to supply other states (this means Sao Paulo) with petroleum and petroleum-derived lubricants, liquid fuel, and gas. On the other hand, Sao Paulo is authorized to collect the ICMS on its industrial and agricultural products that are sold to other states. Sao Paulo State also collects ICMS on gas from the Campos Basin supplied through Comgas [Municipal Gas Company]. This represents a risk for Rio de Janeiro, which in 1990 consumed 25,138 kwh, only which just 8,267 kwh came from its own sources. The fact that 50 percent of the electric power consumed by the state is produced outside its territory explains why we have been begging in vain for large industries to settle in Rio de Janeiro. The lag between electric power production and consumption has made Rio de Janeiro extremely sensitive to decisions on investments in the electric power sector outside its own territory. The state is also vulnerable to operational contingencies in the electricity power grid. A break in the transmission lines from Itaipu [hydroelectric complex] can black out Rio de Janeiro, paralyzing its industries. This is how we arrived in a state of risk. This situation arose following systematic operational difficulties in one of Itaipu's transmission networks. The problem has not caused further damage only because of the remarkable drop in electrical power consumption following the economic crisis that began 12 years ago. It should be noted that the Angra-1 nuclear power station has also contributed [to place Rio de Janeiro on a state of risk], given that it accounts for 36 percent of the electric power generated in Rio de Janeiro. This merely emphasizes the decisive importance of expanding the use of nuclear energy as a power generation source in order to reduce the current dependence. Nuclear energy is essential for Rio de Janeiro: The vast majority of the Brazilian institutions that are linked to nuclear energy, not just in the industrial area but also those linked with training courses and professional associations, are located in this state. The concentration of these activities in Rio de Janeiro State makes it a real nuclear center that comprises the following institutions: 1. The National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), which controls and grants licenses to nuclear units and which coordinates nuclear technological research; 2. The Nuclear Energy and Radio Protection and Dosimetry Institutes [Institutos de Energia Nuclear e de Radioprotecao e Dosimetria]; 3. Nuclear Industries of Brazil, which is a holding [preceding word in English] of industries connected with the nuclear fuel cycle; 4. Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., which owns the Angra-1, 2, and 3 power plants (3 is still under construction); 5. The Fuel Elements Factory, the Separation Elements Plant, and the Isotopic Enrichment Plant in Resende. We must not overlook Nuclen [Nuclebras Engineering, Inc.], a nuclear plant engineering company; Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy Equipment, Inc.], which produces equipment for the primary circuit of these nuclear plants; Monazite Sands Primary Beneficiation Plant [Usina de Beneficiamento primario de areias monaziticas] in Campos; or the Brazilian Nuclear Quality Institute. These are research and training institutions which provide valuable technological assistance. We must insist: Once the Angra plants are totally operational they will considerably increase the power base of the Southeastern power grid. The Angra plants, which are located near the main consumer markets of the country (130 km from Rio, 220 km from Sao Paulo, and 350 km from Belo Horizonte) will reinforce the whole power system and guarantee a suitable power supply for the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. The assembly of Angra-2 is currently a top priority. It is at an advanced stage (67 percent built) and is being financed by Germany and by Furnas. Energy demand projections show an average 5 percent increase of consumption per year for the South/Southeast/Center-West grid. So there is no time to waste. The commissioning of Angra-2 will reduce Rio de Janeiro's dependency on energy from other states from the current 50 percent to 35 percent. Angra-2 will provide 350 civil construction jobs and 550 engineering jobs for 4 years; 350 administrative jobs for 5 years; and will create 1,400 new electro-mechanical assembly jobs for 5 years. Over the next 5 years, the related taxes collected will represent $100 million for the state and for the municipalities. This is apart from the improved social benefits for the region in the field of education, health, and infrastructure. The consolidation of a nuclear center will allow Brazil access to the international nuclear market, which handles billions of dollars per year in the supply of fuel elements, the manufacture of equipment, the training of operators, and the supply of engineering and quality control services. Then why this reluctance to assemble Angra-2? To compare it with Angra-1 is like comparing a Jumbo jet and an Electra. It follows the security concept of the German nuclear plants, the safest and with best performance in the world. In terms of transfer of technology the Angra-2 has been very successful: 108 of the 113 systems of the plant were designed by Nuclen. The reasons for postponing its construction based on the long economic recession have already been overcome. Environmental excuses do not hold water. The arguments used by organizations like Greenpeace can be summarized in three categories: 1. Nuclear energy is expensive and dangerous and it is declining in the rest of the world; 2. Nuclear plants are the fastest way to obtain a nuclear bomb; 3. Nuclear power involves technology that externally serves the interests of German industrial penetration, and internally consolidates a military class that longs to make Brazil a world power. The first lie is based on a superstition similar to that felt by those who fear flying. There is no point in proving to them that statistically more people die in traffic accidents (or of heart attacks) than in airplane accidents. There is no point in proving that the environmental damage caused by conventional power plants is greater than that caused by nuclear plants. The problem is not caused by modern nuclear plants but by backyard accidents like the one that took place in Goiania when medical equipment was scrapped [and a radioactive cesium capsule was stolen]. Hysterical tropical NGO's [Non Government Organizations] merely cover their ears to these arguments. They are totally controlled by reactionaries who swallowed the extreme concept of [18th century philosopher Jean Jacques] Rousseau of comparing the good savage with the [Brazilian] lion-monkey [mico-leao]. They do not take into consideration the fact that Chernobyl was a fifth-rate nuclear plant that did not meet minimum Western standards or that the accident in Three Mile Island was confined to the interior of the plant and did not harm the environment. They do not want to hear about sea platforms like Pampo, for example, which produces hydrogen sulfide gas and which is a volcano with a statistically greater chance of erupting than Angra-1. They selectively choose to ignore Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] and the tropical forest devastation because the NGO headquarters abroad know the Brazilian people are proud of their oil and are concerned about the Amazon region. They know that a phobia of nuclear plants gives them more notoriety. It is a lie that nuclear energy is declining in the rest of the world: Despite the 1970 world recession, when nuclear energy represented 1.6 percent of the world energy capacity, by 1990 it had risen to 17 percent, which is very close to hydroelectric energy, which represents 19 percent of the total world energy capacity. In France, 78 percent of the domestic power production comes from nuclear energy. There even are nuclear power plants located around Paris. Nuclear power plants in Belgium produce 59.9 percent of all requirements. The United States, France, Japan, the former USSR, Canada, and the old GDR produce 60 percent of all the nuclear power energy in the world. It is not surprising that these environmentalist groups, which favor the "zero growth" preached by the old Rome Club, come from the very countries that do not want to transfer modern energy and technology to other countries. It is known that the Carter administration did everything it could to stop Germany from transferring technology that should have remained in the First World. Former [Science and Technology] Minister Renato Archer has revealed that British Professor John Demos, who directs a nuclear power plant, told him the Americans do not want the largest energy industry in the world (theirs) becoming obsolete just because Brazil has radioactive minerals. This is why Archer defended, through Admiral Alvaro Alberto, the idea of only supplying radioactive minerals to the Americans in exchange for nuclear technology. But the world powers have always rejected the "industrial lever effect" associated with nuclear energy. That is, in nuclear plants like Angra, high-technology equipment account for 70 percent of the whole construction while civilian construction works account for 30 percent. These proportions are inverted in hydroelectric plants. A nuclear bomb? Why has Brazil just signed the Tlatelolco Treaty to denuclearize Latin America? Why should they imagine that Brazil will start just as the Cold War is over, the USSR has disappeared from the map, and California is in crisis as consequence of the dismantling of its war industry? If we give up launching rockets just because they could carry bombs, we should also give up carrying knives because they can be used to kill. Why should we give up the fantastic autonomous program of Aramar [Navy nuclear project]? A country with more than 7,000 km of coastal line cannot do without an atomic submarine. Let us speak like adults: The future is too serious to let ourselves be influenced by environmentalists who even torture animals in publicity films to prove that progress is taking us backwards.
