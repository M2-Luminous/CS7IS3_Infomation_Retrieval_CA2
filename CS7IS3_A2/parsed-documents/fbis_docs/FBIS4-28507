"Following their withdrawal from the neutral nations supervisory commission in Korea a while ago, the Czech Republic has recently closed down its embassy in Pyongyang for a reason not formally known," the source said. He said a Western firm is now negotiating with North Korea for the lease of the 14-room Czech Embassy building. It appears, the source said, that Czech had closed down its embassy in North Korea in the belief that it is not economically or diplomatically advantageous to keep their embassy there. Cuba, too, is said to have withdrawn its embassy from Pyongyang, but this has not been confirmed, the source added.
