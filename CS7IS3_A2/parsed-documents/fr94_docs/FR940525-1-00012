ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The FDIC, FRB, OCC, and OTS (the Agencies) are proposing revisions to their risk-based capital standards to address the regulatory capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that expose banks, bank holding companies, and thrifts to credit risk. The proposal is intended to correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and allow banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations) to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse transactions. The proposal would require higher amounts of risk-based capital to be maintained against certain direct credit substitutes, including, for banking organizations, purchased servicing rights that provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced and purchased subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets, and, for both banking organizations and thrifts, certain guarantee-type arrangements (such as standby letters of credit) provided for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets. The OTS is proposing to change only the capital requirements for the treatment of guarantee-type arrangements that absorb first dollar losses. In all other respects, the OTS treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes would continue to follow existing OTS capital regulations. The OTS regulations have been revised for clarity and now include language codifying agency regulatory guidance. In addition, the Agencies are publishing, in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), a preliminary proposal to use credit ratings to match the risk-based capital assessment more closely to an institution's relative risk of loss in certain asset securitizations. The Agencies are also requesting comment in the ANPR on the need for a similar system for unrated asset securitizations and on how such a system could be designed. The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and ANPR that result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply only to transactions that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules.
