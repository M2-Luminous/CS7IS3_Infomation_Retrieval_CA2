There is every indication that our economy is now poised to make positive strides towards a more competitive and successful era. But we must not sit back; it is vital to build a competitive economy not only for the 1990's but for the 21st century. As you all know we face tough competition in overseas markets - not just from our European neighbours, but from the Far East and the rapidly developing economies of the Pacific Rim. I want to highlight for you a number of initiatives which will help to build our economy where it counts, at the most local level. Integration of Government programmes at Regional and local level First our decision to combine the existing Regional Offices of the Departments of the Environment, Employment, Trade and Industry, and Transport. In the past there has been criticism of the inefficient way in which Government programmes and services can operate. They have been described as `a patchwork quilt of complexity and idiosyncracy'. I and my Government colleagues take these concerns seriously. Four years ago we announced the introduction of Training and Enterprise Councils [TEC] - the TECS organisations designed to make Government training and enterprise programmes more responsive and relevant to local business needs. Now we have gone much further with the announcement in November of Integrated Regional offices and the Single Regeneration Budget. This is an exciting opportunity to bring together programmes from different Government Departments into a more dynamic and cohesive package, at regional level. So from April this year a whole range of Government decisions about transport, housing, environmental improvement, support for business, training and skills will be taken in the Integrated Regional Offices. The Importance of Local Partnership But Government is, of course, not the only player in all this. Government can set a national framework for others to work within, but we look to others locally to identify needs and decide how to meet them. Just as Government has recognised the importance of bringing together its regional structures into a working partnership, so must other local players, including business, do the same. Partnership at local level will be critical to our future economic success. In particular this will be true when the Senior Directors of the new integrated offices are deciding priorities for the Single Regeneration Budget which will bring together twenty previously separate programmes worth 1.4 billion pounds. Government is convinced that if we are to make the most of this money it has to be spent on projects generated jointly among the local community. TECs will be key private sector partners for the Government's integrated regional offices, taking the lead alongside local authorities in formulating plans for local economic development and building the partnerships to achieve them. They must mobilise the wide range of local players who contribute to local regeneration and economic development. Where partnerships do not already exist, they can take steps to pull people together, to create a local vision and purpose. The Contribution of Training and Skills To a Competitive Economy My second theme is about my Department's central contribution to making the UK economy more competitive. Without the right skills our economic competitiveness will suffer; with them, we can all enjoy greater and longer lasting prosperity. Britain has moved a long way in last decade. Ten years ago it was said that UK employers were just not interested in training. It wasn't true then and it's not true today. Today around 1,200 top business and community leaders are involved in running Training and Enterprise Councils. 770 companies have their most senior Directors on TEC Boards. Many business people do now recognise training as a key investment in their competitive strategy. Over 570 organisations have now achieved Investors in People status, requiring them to demonstrate that they have taken full account of the development needs of every employee; and some 4,600 more are committed to achieving it. Firms enjoy business benefits such as improved business performance; enhanced financial results; and greater job satisfaction for their people. That job satisfaction comes from a better appreciation among individuals of the value of effective training and development. Each year the National Training Awards competition identifies winners who are living proof that training pays - that it increases competitiveness. You can't win unless you can show a direct link between the training you did and the impact on your business or your career. It is not uncommon to find savings or increased profits measured in the millions, or businesses completely turned round and saved from bankruptcy because they did the right training at the right time in the right way. I am very pleased to launch the 1994 National Training Awards [NTA] competition here today. I hope that the Institute of Directors will continue its support for the competition. Every part of the country has its NTA champions and they are ready to share with others how they achieved their success. Nothing is more effective in persuading others that a real life story: it says far more than Ministerial exhortations ever can. Prosperity Through Skills Recently I set out my vision for vocational education and training in a document called Prosperity through skills. This sets out a strategy for everybody who has an interest in increasing individual and national prosperity -- that means employers and individuals as well as training organisations. I hope you will all take the time to read it. I offer four priorities for action: - Employers, the self employed and individuals in the workforce must invest effectively in the skills needed for business and individual success. - People who are out of work or disadvantaged in the labour market must be able to acquire and maintain skills allowing them to compete better for work and contribute more effectively to the economy. - Young people must be motivated to gain the skills and qualifications needed for today's -- and tomorrow's jobs. - We must ensure that education and training meet the needs of business and individuals. For the economy to flourish every sector, every industry, and every business in the country must perform at its best. Effective investment in people is an essential ingredient of business success, helping to maximise the benefit of all other forms of investment. Modern Apprenticeships Finally, it gave me a lot of pleasure to announce recently my plans for Modern Apprenticeships which will produce a new route to recognised qualifications at `A' level equivalent, and jobs, for about 40,000 young people each year, compared with around 12,000 at present. Modern apprenticeships represent a step change in the government's approach to training. This is a supply-side revolution, led by industry, to give the country the skills it needs and improve our economic competitiveness. They will be for young people who leave school at 16 or 17 and want to train to higher level vocational skills. They will offer high quality training to technician and supervisor levels - NVQ Level 3 (or `A' level equivalent). Modern apprenticeships will instigate a real skills revolution by combining modern qualifications and learning methods with the best of our apprenticeship traditions. I want to see them in all sectors from information technology to engineering. I want employers in each sector to decide detailed arrangements. And I want to see employers and apprentices signing a pledge to agree the training to be provided and entering a mutual commitment to see it through. We shall run modern apprenticeships using the successful arrangements for Youth Credits. The Government recognises that high quality training is not cheap, and is quite willing to play and -- pay -- its part. We will invest 1.25 billion pounds in Youth Credits and modern apprenticeships over the next three years. But modern apprenticeships can only succeed if employers working with TECs and others respond and provide the necessary places. If they do we envisage there could be about 150,000 young apprentices training in England at any one time. We expect to run pilots in 1994, and TECs and Industry Training organisations will have a pivotal role in preparing a full range of modern apprenticeships for young people to start in 1995. Conclusion I have spoken about the importance of partnerships and the contribution of training to our economic success. The goal we seek is of immense value - it is no less than the future well-being of our nation. I ask you to support us in our efforts to meet that goal. Without you we cannot but fail.
