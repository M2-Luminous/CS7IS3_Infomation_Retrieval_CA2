FR940504-1-00066 FR940504-1-00018 Comment: A few commenters disagreed with the Department's statement that CV is the only method available for estimating lost nonuse values. These commenters thought that trustee officials should be allowed to estimate lost nonuse values through analysis of charitable donations, insurance premiums, and conservation expenditures. Response: Section 11.83(c)(3) of the March 25, 1994, final rule allows trustee officials to use any valuation methodology, regardless of whether it is explicitly listed, provided it measures the public's WTP and satisfies the criteria set forth in ยง11.83(a)(2). 59 FR 14286. The Department is currently unaware of any methodology available for the express purpose of estimating economically valued nonuse losses of specific injured resources, other than CV, that meets these specifications. Comment: Some commenters thought that if assessment of lost nonuse values is allowed, the Department should restrict such assessment to present and future values. Response: Where little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents' WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, as discussed above, the Department is soliciting comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in a technical information document. Comment: A few commenters requested that the Department clarify that even if a CV study of lost nonuse values met any conditions set forth in the natural resource damage assessment regulations, it would still have to meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence. Some commenters cited case law for the proposition that CV studies of lost nonuse values do not meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence. State of Idaho v. Southern Refrigerated Transport Inc. , No. 88&hyph;1279, slip op. (D. Idaho Jan. 24, 1991) ( Idaho v. Southern Refrigerated Transport ). Response: CERCLA and Ohio v. Interior mandate that the natural resource damage assessment regulations include the best available procedures for reliably calculating lost values of injured resources. Therefore, the Department believes that any CV study of lost nonuse values performed in accordance with these regulations should satisfy judicial standards for admissibility of evidence. The Department is unaware of any case that has held CV studies per se to be inadmissible in court. Idaho v. Southern Refrigerated Transport addressed the use of a particular CV study in a case where the natural resource damage assessment regulations were not followed. The study had been conducted not for the purposes of the specific case but rather to guide a utility council in making operational changes in a hydropower system. Slip op. at 20. The court did not rule that the study was inadmissible. However, the court did find that the study was not sufficiently persuasive to sustain the claim for lost nonuse values, noting that the survey questions were aimed at doubling fish runs from 2.5 million to 5 million whereas only 1,688 fish had actually been lost due to the specific release in question. Id. National Environmental Policy Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Executive Orders 12866, 12630, 12778, and 12612 The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no further analysis pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (43 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) has been prepared. The Department certifies that this rule will not have significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The rule provides technical procedural guidance for the assessment of damages to natural resources. It does not directly impose any additional cost. As the rule applies to natural resource trustees, it is not expected to have an effect on a substantial number of small entities. It has been determined that this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to constitute a significant regulatory action. However, because of the difficulty of evaluating the effects of alternatives to this rule, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget has waived preparation of the assessments described in sections 6(a)(3)(B) and 6(a)(3)(C) of Executive Order 12866 for the final rule. It has been determined that this rule does not have takings implications under Executive Order 12630. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. It has been determined that this rule does not have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612. Dated: April 28, 1994. Bonnie R. Cohen, Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management, and Budget.
