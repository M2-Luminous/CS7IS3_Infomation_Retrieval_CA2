This view was expressed by many Eduskunta deputies, particularly from the Center Party, when the legislation on the referendum was yesterday finally passed in its third reading in the Eduskunta. Markku Laukkanen (Center Party) said that he believes that a third of Eduskunta deputies will bring down the EU agreement if Sweden and Norway reject their agreements in their referenda. Hannu Kemppainen, his party colleague, claimed that the result of the referendum can only be binding on Eduskunta deputies if it can be interpreted as representing a permanent body of public opinion among the people. The result in Sweden could, however, reverse public opinion. We should not have arranged things like this, he said, blaming the situation on President Martti Ahtisaari, Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen, and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen (National Coalition Party). Mirja Ryynanen (Center Party) made her contribution by saying that if after the referendum important new information relating to the issue becomes available, the Eduskunta should naturally take it into consideration. Such new information could be the negative stances of the other Nordic countries. At its party congress last weekend the Center Party resolved that "the Center Party in Finland will respect any referendum result that arises in this way." By "this way" the congress meant that the national support package is approved before the referendum in a form that corresponds to the government's decision in principle. However, the congress resolution contained no mention of the Swedish and Norwegian referenda. Liberal People's Party chairman Tuulikki Ukkola reacted to the Center Party deputies' statements and claimed that these undermine the foundation for a referendum. Constitutional Committee chairman Sauli Niinisto (National Coalition Party) wondered why Finland's decision should be tied to Sweden's. According to this argument, if Sweden had been voting first there would be no need for a referendum in Finland. And if the referenda were to take place simultaneously only the Swedish result would be binding, he said. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Pertti Paasio (Social Democratic Party) interpreted those debaters who want to tie Finland's decision to Sweden's to be saying that they want Finland to follow Sweden's decision, but only on the condition that Sweden takes the same view as a minority in the Finnish Eduskunta. The debate was started by the Left Alliance's Esko Seppanen who had distributed an amendment to the effect that a new referendum should be arranged "if the other Nordic countries' referenda change to a significant extent the base for Finland's membership of the EU" -- in simple terms: if Sweden and Norway say no after a Finnish yes. However, Seppanen did not table the amendment officially. If it had been voted down now, it would be more difficult to arrange such a referendum if such a situation were to arise. Unusually the Eduskunta also debated the nature of the EU, whether the Union is developing in a federalist direction, and whether Finland should promote or slow down such a development. EU opponents in particular argued that the EU is developing into a federal state. This argument was rejected by National Coalition Party Eduskunta group chairman Ben Zyskowicz who stressed that the creation of a federal state presupposes agreement and that in particular the enlargement of the EU currently taking place means that its structure as an alliance of states -- the cooperation between national states -- will remain for a long time to come. This made Esko Seppanen assert that EU supporters are entering the referendum with contradictory views of the EU: Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) and now the National Coalition Party are leading us into an EU of nation-states, while Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen is leading us into the federal state of the EU. Lipponen was not in his place, but Pertti Paasio replied that Lipponen had meant that looser integration is not necessarily more advantageous for small member states as is more solid integration. Johannes Koskinen (Social Democratic Party) admitted that both in Europe and in Finland the Social Democrats have conflicting views on this issue. The legislation on the referendum was passed unanimously, because its content had already been settled in the votes during its second reading. [passage omitted]
