The terrorist group's seven-strong ruling Army Council was said to be divided 4-3 in favour of accepting the month-old joint Anglo-Irish initiative -- a majority not considered adequate to avoid the formation of a breakaway group backing continued violence, or to swing the hard-line republican movement as a whole behind peace. And doubts about the statement signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds were reported to be widespread among grassroots supporters of the IRA and their Sinn Fein political spokesmen. The Dublin sources said the general membership did not appear to have been given enough information by their leaders to make a decision. The last of a series of consultative meetings organised by Sinn Fein to sound out their followers is due later this month, one week ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin, the date now regarded as potentially vital by the Irish government. Members are understood to be pressing for details of the document produced last year after discussions between Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams, and John Hume, head of Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party, so that its contents could be compared with the Major-Reynolds declaration. There is also said to be concern among the republicans about the failure of the Downing Street statement to mention the possibility of an amnesty for jailed terrorists on both sides of the Irish border. IRA activists in several areas of Northern Ireland were reckoned to be blocking acceptance of the peace plan. Within the Dublin-based security services, concern persists about the destination of huge IRA arms caches thought to be hidden at a number of secret locations throughout the Irish Republic. Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds told the Dublin parliament today that he had no evidence to back up reports of divisions within the IRA. And he remained doggedly optimistic of eventual IRA and Sinn Fein agreement to the joint peace declaration.
