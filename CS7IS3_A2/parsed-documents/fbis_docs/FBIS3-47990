On 10 January, some foreign sources reported that Kang Chu-il, first deputy director of the Reunification Front Department of the Workers Party of Korea, had been appointed secretary in charge of policy on the South and that Kim Yong-sun came to take charge of policy on the United States. Prior to this, in the middle of November 1993, it was observed that "Kim Yong-sun had been ousted and had not yet been appointed to any position." In fact, Kim had not been engaged in any external activity until the time he met Australian nuclear expert Peter Heiz [as transliterated] in July 1993, thus making the observation convincing. In early December of last year, however, when the sixth session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea was held, it was confirmed that Kim had been eliminated from the list of candidate members of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee but still remained as secretary in charge of policy on the South. This enabled people to reach a conclusion on the various observations on Kim's status. However, a recent report by foreign sources that Kim has been appointed to the post in charge of U.S. policy has prompted various new observations. First, the ROK's Board of National Unification has denied the report that Kim quit the post in charge of policy on the South. An official concerned denied the report on Kang Chu-il's appointment as secretary in charge of South Korean policy, saying that "It is usual for a party secretary to be member of the party Central Committee. However, there has been no report that Kang has been appointed member or candidate member of the party Central Committee since 1980." Another official concerned pointed out, "North Korea has never appointed a director-level official to be secretary of the party." Accordingly, observers say that the rumor on Kim's dismissal from the post in charge of South Korean policy has been created because Kang practically exercises authority in making policies on South Korea although Kim maintains his title as secretary in charge. This is persuasive. They say that they have actually observed signs of Kim's declining power since 1992. According to a Board of National Unification official, a Japanese figure, who visited North Korea and met Kim at that time, told him that "Kim Yong-sun once promised me to arrange a meeting with Kim Chong-il and seemed very confident. In the recent meeting with me, however, he looked somewhat weak [daso himi ppajindutan]." Also related to this is the fact that he, as a candidate member of the Political Bureau, was downgraded from ranking No. 15 to No. 26 in the party hierarchy late last December. In view of the fact that North Korea considers the improvement of relations with the United States to be an urgent question, however, it is possible that North Korea created the new post in charge of U.S. policy so as to assign Kim, who had played the role of a conduit with the United States, to a certain duty. Judging from this and the fact that Hwang Chang-yop has recently sent an invitation to lawmakers of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, analysts say that Hwang Chang-yop, as secretary in charge of international relations, is completely in charge of policy on Japan, and Kim Yong-sun, an authority on U.S. affairs, takes complete charge of policy on the United States, while Kang Chu-il takes charge of practical business on the South.
