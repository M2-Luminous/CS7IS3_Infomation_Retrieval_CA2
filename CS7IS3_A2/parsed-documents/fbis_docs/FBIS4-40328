He argued that recruits are poorly prepared for military service. Military training in Moldova was suspended in 1990. Guritanu pointed out that the Defense Ministry has received letters from former teachers of military training proposing to resume these courses. He mentioned that the Defense Ministry has not yet begun to design projects on this matter. In his opinion, to adopt such a decision would mean large financial expenses not only for teachers' salaries but for restoring supplies which have lately drastically diminished. "Decisions on such matters are made at the Governmental level. As to the Defense Ministry, it would welcome the resumption of military training in schools, but it does not have the necessary financial resources for this," said Guritanu. Valeriu Senic, chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Education, stated to BASA that the concept of general education is being elaborated: therefore, it is too early to say if military training will be resumed in schools. "In my opinion, all problems connected to the preparation of recruits can be settled in the physical training classes. But I will not oppose the resumption of military training in schools, if it is legally introduced," said Senic.
