Earlier this week, Nagoya suburbs-based Kanare Beikoku created a stir in Japan's consumer front by opening without a license a gas station that sells gasoline at 10-15 yen less per liter than at other stations. "The move was in protest against the government's licensing policy," said an official at Kanare Beikoku. Analysts say the rice retailer challenged conventional gasoline distribution networks firmly protected under administrative guidance of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). MITI's local unit did not issue a business license to Kanare Beikoku, claiming it could not confirm the routes by which the retailer plans to obtain gasoline supplies. MITI says the rule, stipulated under the Gasoline Sales and Distribution Business Law, is intended to secure a stable supply of gasoline. Kanare Beikoku cuts middlemen and buys cheaper gasoline directly from trading houses, defying a usual practice among Japanese gas stations of securing product sources by belonging to one of the major oil wholesalers. It is widely believed that Kanare Beikoku did not clarify the supply routes, expecting a licensing application without forming an affiliation with major wholesalers would be rejected by MITI. "MITI's administrative rule effectively blocks new business entry by gasoline discounters," said Katsutoshi Kano, president of Kanare Beikoku. MITI has appeared baffled by an unexpectedly large media coverage of the case that said the rule in question keeps Japanese motorists paying four times what their American counterparts pay for gasoline. One editorial at a major newspaper has cast doubt even over the necessity of securing "stable" sources of gasoline. "Any gas stations having trouble in securing gasoline go under," the editorial said. That's a market mechanism. Consumers would not be affected." In an apparent softening of the ministry's previous stance, Vice MITI Minister Hideaki Kumano told a press conference that there is room to review the rule. A senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency admitted the regulation was originally crafted as a way to prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas stations. "But it may be timely to discuss the validity of maintaining the regulation," he said, apparently having in his mind the recent "price revolution" in all consumer fronts in Japan. The latest incident over gasoline sale may have embarrassed MITI because it took place just one day after the ministry announced a set of bills aimed at scrapping or easing government control on rules and regulations. MITI submitted nine bills to the current Diet sitting Friday [20 May] along with 31 other bills written by other ministries, in line with the government's deregulation policy. Among the nine bills, one calls for abolition of a rule that requires antidecay treatment of lumber for use in telegraph poles and railroad ties. "Nobody uses lumber for such purposes now," MITI explained. Earlier this week, MITI placed "letter boxes" at its local offices across the nation to receive complaints, requests and opinions from general consumers on its deregulation policy. In view of the recent national trend toward deregulation, Kanare Beikoku may have a fairly good chance of winning a fight against MITI, often labeled abroad as a faithful guardian of rigid administrative rules. The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata recently vowed to come up with powerful deregulative measures by the end of June as part of efforts to bolster domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite for imports. Relaxing economically restrictive government regulations is a mission of his administration, Hata said. During the previous administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman of the Economic Planning Agency was upgraded to ministerial level. Earlier this month, the Ombudsman proposed a set of deregulative measures in response to complaints from consumers. The proposal covers many aspects of people's livelihood, ranging from a simpler auto inspection system designed to cut inspection costs running over 100,000 yen to a reduction in a layer of procedures for obtaining import permission for cosmetics and perfume. The social trend appears difficult for MITI to reverse. Under the law, Kanare Beikoku faces fines of up to 300,000 yen. But the senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency, a MITI unit, said MITI does not plan to enforce the law immediately. "We will patiently ask the retailer to take a due procedure," the official said, hinting that the ministry wants to look the other way in order not to draw public attention on the issue. Imposing penalties against the gas station would only aggravate public sentiment against MITI. Kanare Beikoku's President Kano may be encouraged by strong support of consumers. The gas station proved an instant hit with motorists, with their cars lining up early in the morning to buy gasoline at 100 yen per liter.
