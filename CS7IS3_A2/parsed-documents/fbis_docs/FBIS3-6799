Chu Ton-sik, Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman said: "The government has established meticulous countermeasures that could deter in advance any North Korean provocation and is impeccably and fully prepared." Prior to the policy meeting with top military leaders, during a breakfast meeting with 21 Democratic Liberal Party postholders President Kim stressed that there is absolutely no problem in military countermeasures, saying: "Our equipment is far superior to North Korea's." He explained: "We are not only in close coordination with the United States, but also have sufficient surveillance and countermeasures with the UN Command." President Kim Yong-sam said: "We have notified the United States of the decision to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK and they will arrive within the shortest time possible since U.S. President Bill Clinton made an immediate order." It has been learned that a reinforced battalion of Patriot missiles will be deployed to the ROK with enough fire power to gain supremacy over North Korean Air Force capabilities. It will take more than one month to deploy them for actual combat purposes. President Kim said that "the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise has been agreed to in principle" and that the timing will be decided after his return from Japan and the PRC. President Kim implied that a perfect early warning system is in operation by saying: "North Korea's military moves can never be made in secret."
