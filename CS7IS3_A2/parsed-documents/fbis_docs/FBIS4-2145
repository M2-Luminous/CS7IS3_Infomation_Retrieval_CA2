He said that the macro environment is so tight, and reform is developing in such depth and width, that if the inflationary pressure at this moment continues to increase or if serious inflation takes place, then social stability will be affected. At a recent meeting of experts, Zhu Rongji warned against the bad situation that price increases in some mainland cities exceeded 40 percent and that grain prices were skyrocketing. Zhu Rongji said: Without stability, there is no point in talking about anything, and a small incident can disrupt the historical process, so we must not pursue speed only, our work must be solid. At the meeting, Zhu Rongji said citing Deng Xiaoping's words that an overheated economy can easily lead to mistakes, development speed must be moderate. When it is too fast and completely out of the question, we can do nothing but increase the price of goods, but the masses already have fears about prices and inflation, and in an economic environment which does not allow much room for maneuver, we must correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability, and the overall situation. Summing up the problems arising from the economic development of last year, Zhu Rongji stressed that the socialist market economy needs macroeconomic regulation and control, which is very important to the reform of the socialist market economy system which will be launched thoroughly this year, but the problem is, for a long time we viewed socialism as planned economy and capitalism as anarchy. In light of this, Zhu Rongji once again cited Deng Xiaoping's unpublished words that a market economy is not a sign distinguishing a country's social system. Last year, some problems emerged from the national economy and financial discipline was chaotic while the investment scale was too large, which requires us to keep exploring in future practice so as to clear a real road. Zhu Rongji also criticized some people's idea that a market economy is the special feature of capitalist economy which is difficult to link to socialism. He said: Up to now, many economists in the world unanimously think that the market economy on the mainland has been run very well. At the end of the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: From the stance of a socialist country, we think our own road is right.
