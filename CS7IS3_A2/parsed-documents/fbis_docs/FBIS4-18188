The idea is being fiercely resisted by developing countries, who see it as a protectionist measure by industrialized nations, and threatens to mar the April 12 opening at Marrakesh of a GATT conference scheduled to climax in the signing of the biggest trade liberalization package ever. Longuet, speaking to members of the French employers' organisation, said he had discussed the question with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor Wednesday. French government sources said they had agreed that Longuet would lobby European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittain and also Germany, which is particularly unenthusiastic, while Kantor would approach GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland, who supports the developing countries. Longuet said it was a matter of "making people realise that freeing up the world economy must be counterbalanced by the respect for the mimimum standards of the International Labour Organisation on child labour and forced labour by those benefitting from free trade." In addition, countries that have reached a certain level of development have an obligation to harmonise over the long term with developed nations on labour questions, he added. "Experience proves that when France and the United States share the same point of view, there is a chance not necessarily to settle the problem but at least open the door, or put a foot in it so that it can not be closed." In Geneva on Wednesday failure to agree on the question of a social clause led the United States to block the final draft of a Marrakesh ministerial declaration and a document on the mandate of a preparatory committee for a new World Trade Organization. European Union negotiators proposed a compromise wording referring to the possibility of raising "new issues" without mentioning the trade-workers' link, but Washington and Paris dismissed it as too weak.
