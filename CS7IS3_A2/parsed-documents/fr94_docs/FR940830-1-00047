FR940830-1-00047 FR940830-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MT6&hyph;1&hyph;5485b and MT20&hyph;1&hyph;6355b; FRL&hyph;5053&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Montana; State Implementation Plan for Libby PM 10 Nonattainment Area AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Libby. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by September 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Meredith A. Bond at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this proposed rule are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations.
