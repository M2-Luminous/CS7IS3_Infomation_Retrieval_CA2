"It is not the course I planned," the Chirac said. "I cannot see myself in that role," the Juppe said. If we add to this Edouard Balladur's variations on the theme, we quickly understand that the plan to attach no more than a European value to the June 1994 election, dissociating it from the presidential election, was pure otherworldliness, and that instead the calculations of strategy for the presidential election determined the motives for refusal or uncertainty by the various people. It is not the essential issue which is under debate: Everybody knows that the single RPR-UDF [Union for French Democracy] list is not only possible, but technically agreed, that the formal conditions laid down by Valery Giscard d'Estaing are scarcely in dispute, that there is a return to the commonsense thinking shown initially by the prime minister: How could people tasked with implementing the same policy in March 1993 put themselves forward on different lists one year later? Therefore the resolution to draw up a joint program, which could be drafted "in 15 minutes at the corner of a table," to cite Balladur, is merely a pretense: It enables, in the meantime, the clarification of what individuals symbolize, which is particularly important for what comes later. The Pros and Cons Why did Chirac, "approached" by his comrades, say no? What is interesting in his sudden reply is less the expected decision than his speed in ending the scenario. He could have allowed the pressure to mount, and maintain the suspense about his intentions. It is easy to imagine the debate between the pros and cons. Pro: The opportunity to return to the front of the stage, to end a tiresome wait, to bring his image into line with a heroic tradition of Gaullism, which brings him the unconditional support of the members. And also the opportunity to be seen as a unifying figure in the majority. Con: Becoming bogged down in bargaining among the parties and also the risk of failing in his demonstration of unity. It is important to remember that, of all the right-wing leaders, Jacques Chirac is the only one to have formulated a philosophical condemnation, and not just an empirical rejection, of Le Pen's policy. In a one-round election without responsibility, there would be a loss of votes from that side. By prematurely ruling out the hypothesis of his candidacy as head of the European list, Chirac simply wants to show that he is a candidate for a different position, in other words the presidency of the republic, in keeping with a logic predating the parliamentary elections, the one which led him to turn down the leadership of the government, which went by agreement to Edouard Balladur. On the candidate's part, this is consistent with availability and distance with which to draw up a plan for a seven-year term of office. Although disputed or jeopardized since by the prime minister's omnipotence, it has the merit of continuity. Mr. Juppe's refusal is more to do with the present situation. The suggestion and then rejection of his name by Mr. Balladur leads him naturally not to hurry into a role in which he would be seen as a puppet. His success in the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], his intellectual grasp of problems, his skill as a negotiator who attaches importance to a degree of Gaullist rigidity, although seen as a handicap initially, now constitutes one of his best investments in the future and makes him a more and more essential figure in political life. In short, Mr. Juppe is no longer negotiable. The Myth of Delegation Does the prime minister's change of attitude toward his foreign minister as regards the European elections take account of these facts? Can a man who is bound to be regarded as a candidate for the presidency of the republic afford to entrust a man like Mr. Juppe with the formidable springboard of heading the European campaign? Especially in view of the fact that the RPR secretary general, Jacques Chirac's favorite candidate, would then embody the myth of delegation, the lieutenantship of Gaullist legitimacy, which, as Mr. Balladur is in the best position to know, can be put to good use. Amid the obstacles to be overcome and the influences to be sought within the political world with a view to the presidential election, it is clear that the candidate Chirac and the candidate Balladur will not be subject to the same necessities. Where the RPR leader will have to give assurances to the UDF -- the reverse of Valery Giscard d'Estaing appointing a member of the UDR [Union of Democrats for the Republic] as prime minister in 1974 -- the prime minister, already a UDF herald, will have to win over the new barons of the Gaullist family. Did not the hasty statements of [Social Affairs Minister] Simone Veil and especially [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard in favor of Balladur standing as candidate have the effect of countering, by anticipation, the inevitable RPR obstacles in the prime minister's path? The Big Issue The big issue, currently the realm of the opinion polls, will, when it comes to taking action, be played out in the strange inner circle of these men who, in keeping with their custom, tear each other apart but hunt in packs. Will the pack maintain its unity? Hence the importance of [Interior Minister] Pasqua, who has not had his say. Of Mr. Seguin [National Assembly president], who is also capable of showing his wrath. And of Mr. Juppe, who is in control of his destiny. Chirac or Balladur? Whatever happens, there will always be a Gaullist to say: The other would have done better.
