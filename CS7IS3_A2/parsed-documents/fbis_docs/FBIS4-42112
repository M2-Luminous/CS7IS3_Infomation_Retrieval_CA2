Addressing a high-level conference on EU law which began this morning in Nicosia, the president said Cyprus is fully committed to its European orientation because it believes in the role, the mission, and the need for the EU. He added that Cyprus asks for nothing more than to be a republic that applies to the whole of Cyprus' territory, something that cannot happen now because of the de facto division imposed and maintained by the presence of Turkish troops and settlers. European personalities, distinguished judges of the EU court, senior officials, and academicians from EU member states are participating in the two-day conference.
