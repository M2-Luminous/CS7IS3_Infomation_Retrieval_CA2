"From now on the battle with Israel is open on all fronts," Hizballah spiritual leader, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, said in a statement. "It's the biggest challenge ever. Moslems, the mujahidin and the oppressed have decided there is no place for Israel among us. The forces of world oppression will no longer have a say in our region," Fadlallah said. "Israel and the forces of world oppression can win several rounds but satans big or small trying to devour us will not frighten us," he added. Fadlallah described the United States as a "wolf which devours man, peace and life." "We know that every shell and every Israeli warplane is in fact an American shell and an American warplane," he said.
