Ye Xuanping, the executive vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], urged local officials in the southern province to keep out of the row for economic reasons. He urged them to concentrate more on solidifying economic exchange and cooperation with neighbouring Hong Kong, according to Chinese sources. The central government has taken a hard line against the decision by Britain to unilaterally implement political reform in Hong Kong. It has vowed to dismantle the territory's three tiers of government in 1997 if the reforms proceed. The threat has created apprehension in neighbouring Guangdong over possible economic ramifications. This will intensify today as Hong Kong's Executive Council sanctions a decision by Governor Chris Patten to implement the remainder of his constitutional reforms. Later this week, Britain will also issue its account of the Sino-British negotiations reinforcing an end to cooperation on political reform. Tomorrow legislators are expected to pass the first stage of the constitutional reform package, to be followed by the gazetting of the remainder of the reforms on Friday [25 February]. By highlighting the importance of economic co-operation between the two neighbouring regions in his recent meetings with local officials, Mr Ye attempted to persuade local officials to side-step the Sino-British controversy over constitutional reform and airport financing. The former provincial governor said close commercial relations between the two neighbours were not only crucial for Guangdong's economic development but also contributed significantly in easing the transition of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. Mr Ye was concerned that the ongoing Sino-British quarrel would jeopardise economic ties between the two communities and urged local leaders not to join the chorus to fuel the row. The Sino-British dispute was a diplomatic affair between the sovereign governments of Beijing and London, and relations between Guangdong and Hong Kong was a commercial one between two local communities, Mr Ye was quoted as telling officials. Guangdong sources said Mr Ye was disappointed with some local officials' comments on the Sino-British row and was concerned about its effect on the development of the local economy, which was becoming intertwined with that of Hong Kong. Mr Ye was also apparently trying to prevent local officials passing resolutions or issuing public statements on the Sino-British dispute during the ongoing provincial legislative session, one Guangzhou-based analyst said.
