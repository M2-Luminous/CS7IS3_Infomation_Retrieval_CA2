Speaking at the ongoing ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) held here, Christopher said that "We face the most destructive conflict in Europe since the Second World War. We have seen violence in the Caucasus and in Central Asia." On the Bosnian conflict, Christopher said the U.S. believes that the steps agreed at the Geneva ministerial meeting last month offer the best chance for a resolution to that "horrible conflict." Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in February of 1992 when Moslems and Croats, about 80 percent of the 4.3 million population in the former Yugoslavia Republic, voted for independence from Belgrade. Thousands of people have been killed in the fighting. NATO foreign ministers threw their weight Thursday [9 June] behind an effort to impose a territorial solution on the Bosnian conflict and reaffirmed their readiness to send a peacekeeping force once the warring parties sign an accord. The 16 alliance members welcomed a one-month truce among the warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems, scheduled to take effect today, as a "positive first step." They urged that the cease-fire should be expanded to include the separation of the combatants, the use of United Nations Forces to ensure the truce and the withdrawal of all heavy weapons. The U.S. secretary of state said there were also potential conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially Ipdjina, Kosovo, and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. "They must be resolved to avoid a wider conflict in the region," said Christopher. He said that "in the former Soviet Union, the United States has worked with all the parties to keep disagreements from erupting into violence." "European stability depends on all countries' respecting of the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire," he noted. Christopher held talks today with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev on the U.S.-Russian relation and strengthening of the cooperation between NATO and Russia. In a joint press conference following the talks, Christopher said that U.S. welcomes Russia's signature of the Partnership for Peace in the near future. Forty-one foreign ministers from the NACC and former East Bloc countries are attending the meeting.
