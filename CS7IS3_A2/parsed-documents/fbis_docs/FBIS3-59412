Government sources, which we do not wish to reveal, declare that distrust and isolation play havoc among the members of the executive, who have reached the point of impossibility in making any decisions in task forces except when direct decisions come via prescribed channels. The anxiety that overwhelms the executive team is, however, a faint echo of the stress borne by the top of the establishment pyramid, that is the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the Presidency, which, instead of enjoying the time-out created by the signing of the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, must face a coalition, inconceivable a few months ago, among the opposition parties, trade unions, student leagues, and revolutionary associations. The dance of the motions unfolding in Parliament would remain a benign aerobic exercise if nearly all Romanian social forces had not been concentrated behind one of these motions. They decided to maintain unity around their only common and indisputable demand: the resignation of the current government and the formation of a governing coalition excluding the PSM [Socialist Labor Party] and the PRM [Greater Romanian Party]. In this context, the PSM motion appears as a slight diversion. It is "just a joke," as the chief executive recently declared at the National Confederation of Free Trade Unions, because no matter how much we could approximate the movement of the electorate to the left, thanks to the galloping impoverishment of the population, and consequently, the existence of the voters' interest forecast by Ilie Verdet [leader of the PSM] in view of the obvious alliance between the opposition and the trade unions, any hope for an official socialist restoration is ludicrous. The effecting of subversive ideas--according to which the large trade unions would be divided through a "betrayal" by the CNSLR-Fratia [National Conference of Free Trade Unions - Brotherhood] who allegedly entered into an alliance with the government for the pay of a few deputy ministerial positions--proved completely false. On the contrary, the strategy the CNSLR-Fratia used proved to be one of faultless sophistication. After the meeting in November offered a respite to the government in order for it to act upon the trade union demands that it had promised to satisfy, thus leaving the curtain raised in front of the trade union base and the domestic and international political forces, in order to see how the current government acquits itself in the responsible manner of the promises it made. Thus, no one will be able to accuse the trade unions of not having exhausted every peaceful negotiating formula with irrefutable arguments. The government, however, fulfilled nothing it had promised, and, moreover, it considered the wish of the trade unions to participate along with employers and the MMPS [Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare] in a tripartite administration of the unemployment compensation funds and social assistance as just an intrusion into the executive's prerogatives, and therefore the trade union's attempt to participate in the decisionmaking process was criticized. Proof of this is the fact that the CNSLR-Fratia declared that, together with Cartel Alfa, BNS [National Trade Union Bloc], the student league, and revolutionary associations, it would organize and participate in the trade union's struggle, which has already been launched. Thus, we learn that the trade unions are united and will organize jointly a large meeting in Timisoara on 16 December, after which they plan to stage strikes by federations and a general strike. The time for negotiations has ended exactly in these days of sensitive and deep remembrance of December 1989. The trade unions' consultations with the opposition parties are no longer a secret, and, as Victor Ciorbea, the president of CNSLR-Fratia says, "the motion brought by the opposition is an approach from the political point of view toward the government's performance, and it is complemented on a social level by the beginning of the trade unions' struggle." In other words, the sanction is applied to the Vacaroiu government as much by the opposition for the government's political policy as by the trade unions for the government's social policy. A government which shows itself to be politically and socially inept after one year should be replaced by another government from a broader coalition, from which, perhaps, the two parties which are considered extremist and restoration-communist are excluded. This is the point of view of the trade unions, whose great trump card is the alliance that has been made. In view of this situation, it is no longer possible for the government to avoid giving an answer, because negotiating a pact for social tranquility, which is so necessary, cannot start without getting rid of the existing team. These are difficult times for the PDSR, which sees its alliances and friends as seriously compromised and is placed in the situation of betraying someone in order to maintain a part of its power. It remains to be seen who....
