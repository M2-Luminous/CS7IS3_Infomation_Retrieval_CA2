The Ecological Situation in Russia: Another Perspective''] [Text] On Tuesday, 15 March, at the Russian-American press center there was a presentation of the book by Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Viktor Gorshkov, Yuriy Arskiy, and Kim Losev, ``The Environment Between the Past and Future: The World and Russia.'' In the words of the chief of the press service of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Aleksandr Shuvalov, the book marks a kind of stage in the understanding of ecological problems. One must assume that such a strong expression was used by no means because the current leader of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources was among the authors--a fact that is important in and of itself,. since it means that we have before us more than simply the opinion of a group of researchers. The book really does make a great impression, and this is certainly not achieved because it contains another round of apocalyptic predictions. Rather, on the contrary, attention is drawn to the absence of alarmism and, which is always curious, an attempt to reinterpret the current stereotypical ideas. The most persistent of them is the certainty that ecologically Russia is almost the worst place in the world. Upon checking, it turns out that this is not altogether true and in the majority of cases not even true at all. For example, indicators of degradation of the land in Russia, which has 8 percent of the land in the world, are close to average. The same thing can be said about degradation of forestry systems. And Russia has almost 45 percent of the nontropical forests and 27 percent of the world's supply of wood. The total discharges of atmospheric pollutants amount to 6-12 percent of the average world level. Our contribution to the production of chlorofluorocarbons which destroy the ozone layer was about 10 percent. In the meantime, the United States, Western Europe, and Japan together produce 73 percent of them. Moreover, Russia has preserved the largest area of land undisturbed by economic activity--scientists think that it could play approximately the same role as the entire Brazilian part of the Amazon region in stabilizing the environment. Paradoxical as it may sound now, all the credit for the fact that we have managed to preserve Russian nature to one degree or another belongs to the centralized controlled economy, which is usually reproached for chronic neglect of the environment. There is no contradiction here in the strict sense of the word, since nobody has yet managed to abolish that notorious unity and struggle of opposites. Economic ineffectiveness and the sluggishness of the centralized system plus the difficulty of access and the harsh climate of the expanses of the northern part of Siberia and the Far East have forced us to concentrate our attention on already assimilated territories and make significant capital investments in so-called national regions. As a result, the ecosystems of the latter have been practically completely deformed. As for the industrial revolution on the ``old land,'' the fact that 70 percent of the gross national product belongs to the defense complex is not the only result of this. In terms of the indicator of expenditure of resources and the quantity of pollutants per unit of gross national product, Russia has outstripped all developed countries. According to various estimates, losses because of damage to the environment in the former Union amounted to from 15 to 20 percent of the GNP annually. To this one should add the ``deferred'' damage, which has been caused, is being caused, and will be caused by wastes, mainly radioactive ones, that have been discharged in mass quantities into the environment because of the use of technologies that are imperfect but cheap and therefore attractive for the moment. Researchers single out three stages in the offensive against the environment: virgin land, the age of the Ministry of Water Management, which caused the Aral crisis, and large-scale activity for prospecting and extracting oil and gas in the northern part of Western Siberia. The first and last dealt a blow to Russia itself, and, while the consequences of plowing over the virgin land are known, one can only guess at the damage to the ecosystems of the North. In the meantime, the authors warn that a market economy, being a more effective mechanism than a centralized one, in principle is capable of causing more harm to the environment as well. Even now, both private and investment capital are being used for further development of resources and assimilation of new territories, whether it be in the petroleum and gas fields of the Barents Sea, on the Sakhalin Shelf, in Khanti-Mansia and Yamalia, or the felling of forests from Europe to the Far East. Of course, in such cases one comes to expect formulas, and the authors try to satisfy this expectation. This might be a purely subjective impression, but, unfortunately, the satisfaction is not forthcoming. The declaration of the need to take others' mistakes into account (they have in mind the syndrome of plundering nature, which practically all developed countries have experienced in the past) and the appeal to the country's leaders to invest capital in science-intensive energy- and resource-saving technologies--all these are nothing more than good wishes. And references to the scenario for the development of Japan and Germany in recent years and even the ``small dragons'' of Southeast Asia are not very convincing. Perhaps the social pessimism that has become a complex is to blame for this. It seems that the authors of the book invested their emotions (to the degree to which they can exist at all in a scientific study) in destroying this complex. In terms of impact on the environment, we descendants of a centrally controlled system are in no way worse (but not better, either) than societies developing according to the market scenario. Now, while cleaning up their local territories, they are ``consuming'' or prepared to ``consume'' the environment of the countries where it still remains. In essence this is a policy of ``sweeping the dirt under the rug.'' The mechanism for competition was not conceived by man but was used by the biota and served as a stabilizing factor for it. From all appearances, the biota has mechanisms adequate to crowd out species that threaten its existence. Mankind has a chance to test this--the life span of a species averages 10 million years, but Homo sapiens, having prepared everything for its own destruction, has existed for only several tens of thousands of years. As for Russians, they can only think globally and act locally, and even now try both to acquire capitalism and to protect the environment. Minister of the Environment Viktor Danilov-Danilyan will share his opinion on how to do this in practice in one of the next issues of SEGODNYA.
