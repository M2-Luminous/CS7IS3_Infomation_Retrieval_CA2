He expressed the view that the "Commonwealth of Independent States was used by some politicians as a screen behind which they could carry on their affairs". "I stand for the quickest possible economic integration of the republics of the former USSR, lack of which brings sufferings to all of them -- Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and all the rest," Karimov noted. He stressed that Uzbekistan backed the idea of setting up an economic union within the frameworks of the CIS. "This is why," the president said, "Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan concluded an agreement at the end of April on a single economic space covering the three. Karimov pointed out that the tripartite economic union was open for Russia and all the other republics of the former USSR. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was informed about this. "We presume that the single economic space, created by the three republics, is a prototype of the economic union that must be set up within the frameworks of the entire Commonwealth of Independent States," the president said. He denied as groundless all the press reports claiming that the Central Asian republics were shutting themselves off from the other republics. Karimov expressed great doubts about the feasibility of the idea of setting up a Euro-Asian union on the basis of the CIS republics. He urged to "fully implement the CIS idea through economic integration".
