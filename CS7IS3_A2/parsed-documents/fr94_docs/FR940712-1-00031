ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) in the lower 48 States, except Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where it is listed as threatened. The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act, and exists in small numbers in northern Mexico. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 States except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles in adjacent Mexico as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as threatened. The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation measures already in force to protect the species and its habitats. The Service seeks comments from the public on this proposed reclassification. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by October 11, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to Chief, Division of Endangered Species, Fish and Wildlife Service, 1 Federal Drive, Whipple Federal Building, Fort Snelling, Minnesota 55111&hyph;4056. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address.
