Borisevich: "Yesterday an Autonomous Body -- Today a State"] [Text] Republic of Komi -- In Syktyvkar Yuriy Spiridonov, who won the election of the head of the Republic of Komi, has assumed office. The day before a Supreme Council session adopted laws on the state emblem, the state flag, and the state anthem of the Republic of Komi. The Constitution was adopted slightly earlier. It thus has all the attributes of its own statehood. From slogans and declarations sovereignty has traveled the path to more real symbols. Yesterday autonomy -- today the state. In his greetings telegram Boris Yeltsin called the republic one of the most authoritative components of Russian statehood. The president put a lot into this admission: The authority of Yuriy Spiridonov, the republic's new head, the fact that the republic was one of the first to suggest its own version of the Federation Treaty, and the fact that it struggled to the end for its inclusion in the new Russian Constitution. Unfortunately, not everything is successful. Sovereignty is still considerably truncated. Both by the legislators and by life. Today in the national republic the people who gave it its name are in the minority. Komi's villages are dying because they are the provincial and national hinterland. In previous "allocation" years the republic was given at least something. Now it has been deprived even of those crumbs. Its own production does not feed it. It runs at a loss in the North. Consumer services are no longer subsidised. That means that the village dweller cannot get a haircut, get a television repaired, or get a dress sewn. But even that is not a misfortune. They trim each other's hair and continue to wear old dresses instead of new ones. The trouble lies elsewhere. Children from the hinterland no longer get into the institutes and it is not only studying in the city but even getting there that is a problem. Even professional schools have become unattainable. There is no longer the influx of young specialists to the hinterland. And without them there will soon be no one to give people medical treatment and teach children even in the national school. That means the mortality rate will rise and the educational standard will decline. And all this will affect primarily the indigenous inhabitants. So, for small peoples like the Komi their own statehood (even if it is simply declared) is nonetheless a blessing. Where apart from its own state will the Komi language receive the status of a state language? Where else would they have managed to develop and introduce at state level with financing from the budget programs for development of the Komi language and national culture, to open a Komi philology faculty, and publish books, journals, and newspapers in the Komi language? For an example I shall just cite part of the budget items for this year: The publication of national literature, expenditure on the production of the "Parma-Yel" newsreels, expenditure on the implementation of the law "On the State Languages of the Republic of Komi" and "The Conservation and Development of the Komi Language." But that is one side of the "state" coin. To build -- a house or a state -- you need money. Money is a yardstick of true autonomy, independence, and freedom. And a state is only a state when it controls money circulation, taxes, and the economy. But what can we talk of if, for instance, the republic does not even have the funds even to pay people their leave pay. For the social sphere alone 71 billion rubles are needed for the purpose, with 42 billion being needed for national education. That means they have to go cap in hand to the center and ask for a loan. That is where its own independence ends. However many serious entrepreneurs visit Komi not one of them has refrained from asking: Why, when it has stocks of oil, coal, gas, titanium ore, and timber, is the republic unable to secure a fitting life for its citizens? The answer to this question is on the surface. The bulk of revenue goes into the Federal Budget. So the national republic's economic autonomy is impossible in principle. Moreover, the republic's minister of finances and the tax chief get their wages in Moscow. And that says a lot. Here the center speaks the same taxation and investment language with all components of the Federation while the North is quite different from the South and that means the language should be different. Today a 700-gramme loaf of bread in Ust-Tsilma (a Komi rayon center) costs 1,354 rubles. Because everything, from grain to sugar, has to be imported. There are families where bread has become a treat and the main food is potatoes, which thankfully still grow in the North. In previous years they would at least sometimes issue child benefit. This year not a kopek has been received for this item from the Federal Budget. This financial and legislative dependence of the region on the center weakens not only the sovereign republic but also the center. Boris Yeltsin once signed a package of documents on the economic and social development of the Republic of Komi. They were the precursor to the Federation's civilized economic cooperation with one of its components. But they did not succeed. The documents are not working. The proposals of the components of the federation to move from the fiscal tax system to fixed payments into the Russian budget are being ignored. In this situation the territories have started to unite on regional lines, creating associations like the "Northwest," "Great Volga" and others. The election of their own presidents and republic heads in yesterday's autonomous bodies is from the same "series." As a result, Russia today outstrips Europe in terms of the number of presidents. The Republic of Komi is one of the most recent to take this step. This will undoubtedly strengthen its statehood. But Russian statehood?
