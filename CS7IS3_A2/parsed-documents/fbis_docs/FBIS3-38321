Demirel noted that the Economic Cooperation Organization, the developments in the Central Asian republics, and Turkey's relations with the European Union were discussed in detail at the Davos meeting. He stated that Turkey is a very important country in its region and continued: [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey, actually, is a singularly significant country as a result of its relations with Central Asia, Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Arabian peninsula following the positive results of the Middle East peace conference. Turkey, in other words, is a very significant bridge in a region extending from west to east, that is from Europe to China. I found the opportunity to explain this view. I hope that in the near future Turkey will become a significant energy terminal by transporting and selling the gas and oil reserves of Central Asia, namely Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, to the world. This is one of the most significant issues on the world's agenda. [end recording] Demirel stated that there is interest in Turkey's constructive role in the region as well as in the bilateral and multilateral relations it is cultivating. Demirel said that he will find the opportunity to discuss the Middle East peace process and possibilities for regional cooperation with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak who will be arriving on an official visit in Turkey tomorrow. Noting that the Bulgarian president will also be visiting Turkey in the coming months, Demirel said that steps to be taken to realize the East-West highway that will transit through Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Albania will be discussed during this visit.
