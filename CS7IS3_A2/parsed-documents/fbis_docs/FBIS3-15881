"There are no reasons for cancelling the election results or for recognizing them as null and void," he stressed. According to Turysov, observers from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), who criticized the election system and pointed to a number of violations in the course of voting, have not informed him of their conclusions officially, and therefore he finds it impossible to comment on "what he knows by hearsay." IF Note: The conclusion that Monday's elections were "undemocratic" was voiced at a news conference in Almaty by a spokesperson for the CSCE bureau for democratic institutions and human rights, Elizabeth Winship. She thinks this was largely because political parties, movements and candidates did not have enough time to organize the election campaign, and because the system of registering party candidates was confused. According to the CSCE spokesperson, during the elections some voters cast ballots for several people; some lists of voters were in duplicate; some ballots were substituted by commission members. CSCE experts also noted violations on the part of officials from the Central Electoral Commission, who revoked independent candidates under different pretexts, and pressure exerted on district commissions by local administration officials. Besides, CSCE experts believe that the list of candidates compiled by the president "ensured 20% of parliament seats for people from government structures from the outset". As the Central Electoral Commission chairman said, the so-called "presidential list" of candidates for parliamentary elections (64 persons), which was criticized by international observers, had been submitted in accordance with the electoral code. It included prominent writers, scientists and economists, "and very few representatives of government structures." Having conceded that abuses did take place in the course of elections -- a man cast ballots for his entire family, for instance -- Turysov pointed out that they cannot serve as grounds for cancelling the election results. Several commissions have been formed to inspect concrete statements concerning violations. The elections were attended by 125 observers from France, Germany, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries, Turysov stressed. They all evaluated the elections positively. When asked if Kazakhstan will invite CSCE observers to its next elections, Turysov said that the CSCE is an authoritative organization, and Almaty will undoubtedly send invitations to its observers.
