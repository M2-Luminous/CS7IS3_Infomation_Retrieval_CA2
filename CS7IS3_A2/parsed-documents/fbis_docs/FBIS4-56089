The assistant defense minister for the military industry, General Savo Pustinja, said ttat the Yugoslav military industry had oastered the technology for the production of more than 400 weapons systems, 30 percent of which had been exported before the United Nations clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) in 1992. The sanctions were imposed because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war raging in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina and their lifting is being made conditional on an end to the war. The Yugoslav Army will have changed the insignia on the uniforms by Army day, June 16, which will be observed for the first time this year.
