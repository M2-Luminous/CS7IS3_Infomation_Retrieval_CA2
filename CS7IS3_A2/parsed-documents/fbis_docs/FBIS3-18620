The committee has for long been the desire of the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party] leader, James Molyneaux, who believes it will further enmesh the North into the British state. Mr McGrady said it would run contrary to the inter-party talks process which was based on the "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" principle. The setting up of the committee would be "part of the Major/Molyneaux" deal -- a deal which Mr Molyneaux has denied even existed, said Mr McGrady. "The committee would not contribute to solving any of the political, economic or social problems facing the North. It would simply facilitate the continuing of a sterile political stalemate," he said. Nationalists now represent between 40 percent and 45 percent of the electorate and the proposal did not reflect proportionality or fairness, he said. His party wanted the inter-party talks to recommence to address all the relationships which exist between the islands of Britain and Ireland.
