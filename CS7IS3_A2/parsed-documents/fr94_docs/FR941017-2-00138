FR941017-2-00138 FR941017-2-00078 The QCOFI, published by the OTS, closely tracks the MMCOF. The QCOFI is published less frequently than the MMCOF. Thus, it would only be available to savings associations on a quarterly basis. The only distinction between the two indices is that the MMCOF is a median while the QCOFI is a mean (weighted average). However, as shown in Exhibit 3, the trend lines between the MMCOF and the QCOFI are quite close. Because the QCOFI is a weighted average, the addition of the OTS-regulated, BIF members to the reporting universe would have a larger impact on the QCOFI than on a median index such as the MMCOF. The QCOFI would have declined if BIF-insured institutions had been included in the calculation (see Exhibit 4). Such a decrease would lower the yield on mortgages tied to the national index. In addition, indices calculated for states and/or regions that contain BIF institutions could be affected. One possible alternative would be for OTS to calculate and publish a Quarterly Median Cost of Funds index. IV. Request for Comment OTS invites comment on all aspects of the proposed modifications to, or elimination of publication of, the MMCOF. Comments should focus on the impact of the proposal on lending institutions in adjusting the interest rate on their ARMs. Specific comments should address any difficulties savings associations encounter in preparing the monthly submission of data to the OTS; any potential benefits of continuing publication of the MMCOF index with modifications; and the suitability of the two substitute indices proposed by the OTS. Comments from savings associations might also address the potential savings resulting from the proposed reduction in the reporting burden. Dated: October 11, 1994.
