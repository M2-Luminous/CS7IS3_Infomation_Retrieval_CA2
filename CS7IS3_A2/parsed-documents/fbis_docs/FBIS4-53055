The Ministry of Trade and Industry said the continued expansion in the U.S. economy and the strong growth in developing countries will have a favorable effect on Singapore's trade. The ministry made its optimistic forecast in its latest quarterly economic survey. The survey showed that the economy expanded by a higher than expected 11 percent in the first quarter of this year, exceeding earlier forecasts of between 9 and 10 percent. It forecast the 10.7 percent growth in the first quarter of last year and the 9.9 percent recorded for the whole of 1993. Growth was mainly fueled by the exceptionally strong performance in the manufacturing sector and the financial and business and services sectors. Manufacturing output expanded 11.9 percent in the first quarter over the same period in 1993, boosted by a strong external demand. The electronic, machinery, and transport equipment industries also experienced strong growth. The financial and business sector expanded by 14 percent, while the construction sector by a strong 10.8 percent. The commerce sector expanded by 9.1 percent, and the transport and communication sector grew just under 10 percent. Total volume of trade continued to expand in the first quarter, growing by 14 percent. Exports grew by 12 percent, while imports increased by 9.6 percent. Non-oil domestic exports rose by 13 percent, nearly doubling the growth in the first quarter of last year. The number of jobs created in the first quarter, however, was lower than that in the previous quarter. Labor productivity grew some 6 percent, unchanged from the previous sector. Inflation rose 3.2 percent compared to the same quarter last year.
