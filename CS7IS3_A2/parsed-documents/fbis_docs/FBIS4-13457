Addressing the opening session, Vice President Mr. Ramadan said the United States and its allies which trade with the slogans of human rights maintain strong animosity and hatred to the human. They had employed against this human the most brutal means of annihiliation, starvation, disease, and death represented in the 30-state aggression on Iraq and destroying the basic prerequisites of the Iraqi human including schools, hospitals, electric, and water systems, and even civilian shelters. Mr. Ramadan also referred to the perpetuation of the unjustified embargo on Iraq and the U.S.-led invasion of Somalia and the crimes being carried out against the Palestinian people by the Zionist occupiers. Mr. Ramadan expressed confidence that the symposium would reach positive results contributing to realizing aspirations and rights of the human, the world over and in the manner of facing the challenges of the current critical international situation. Mr. Ramadan said that conditions facing women and children in Iraq from the U.S. Administration and its allies represent a flagrant breaching to the human rights and that that is regrettably being done in the name of the United Nations, which should boost and protect human rights. He said the symposium should focus discussion on this issue and work out urgent treatment to this inhumane grave phenomenon. Mr. Ramadan further said that since the imposition of sanctions on Iraq in August, 1990, the woman and family in Iraq suffered from dangerous conditions that had led to the increase of mortality among infants and women because of the severe shortages of food and medicines. This embargo has intensified the burdens of women in Iraq in addition to her basic tasks of the care extended to the family, he pointed out. Mr. Ramadan said the symposium should discuss the social, economic, and political challenges facing the woman exercising of her rights and reaching practical results so that the woman could play her role in defending human rights and not only those of woman.
