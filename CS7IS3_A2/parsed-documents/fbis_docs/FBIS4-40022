This is the opinion of Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma Committee on International Affairs, which he expounded at a briefing for journalists. It is not hard to predict that, in the event of the DPRK's joining the nuclear club, South Korea will acquire its own "deterrent force." The United States, which is interested in preserving the military balance, may see to this. As a result, there will be the increased likelihood of a nuclear altercation in direct proximity to Russia's borders -- which would make the Chernobyl tragedy pale in comparison. One consequence could be the "nuclearization" of the whole region, when even Japan, which experienced the horror of "a blast brighter than 1,000 suns," will overcome its allergy to the military atom. Even if these apocalyptic forecasts do not materialize, the standoff on the Korean Peninsula, wherein the Cold War is threatening to escalate into a "hot" one, directly affects the interests of Russia's national security, and so an "ideological approach" to this developing crisis is totally unacceptable, Vladimir Lukin declared. It is not a question of "whether or not we like Kim Il-song." In the opinion of the committee chairman, nobody can now confidently state whether the DPRK leaders are really seeking to get their hands on a tool of nuclear blackmail and deterrence or whether this is a clever bluff on their part. If we take the second option on trust, Pyongyang's motives could boil down to securing international guarantees of noninterference in its internal political affairs -- in exchange for access to its nuclear installations. In this case we should pick the "lesser evil," i.e. provide Russian guarantees and persuade our partners to take an analogous step, Lukin believes. "I criticize the U.S. policy only for the sequence of moves," Lukin emphasized. After pointing out that, in their approach to Pyongyang, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the United States are united in maintaining and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the former Russian ambassador to Washington proposed resorting to tough pressure methods only after the guarantees offered to the DPRK have elucidated its true aspirations. At the same time he described as a mistake Moscow's statement about a kind of "freezing" of the friendship treaty with North Korea, which expires in two years' time. This deprives Russian diplomacy of almost its last "lever of influence" over its very close ally of yesterday.
