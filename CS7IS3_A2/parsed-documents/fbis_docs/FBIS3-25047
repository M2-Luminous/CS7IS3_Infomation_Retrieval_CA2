This followed earlier incidents at roadblocks in the small section of Bophuthatswana around Thaba'nchu in the Orange Free State. The roadblocks seemed to be set up to prevent Mr Mandela and a large ANC and press contingent from laying a wreath on the grave a former ANC president, Dr James Moroka, whose family still farm in the Thaba'nchu District. ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member and the organisation's Orange Free State presidential candidate, Patrick "Terror" Lekota left his vehicle as Bophuthatswana defence force soldiers ordered the 20 to 25 car caravan to stop. "We were told we would not be allowed through -- but went anyway," Mr Lekota told SAPA after the wreath laying ceremony. Mr Mandela told more than 30,000 cheering supporters at Botshabelo, about 50km from Bloemfontein: "As we entered Thaba'nchu we came across a roadblock set out up by Mangope. They were lucky they did not prevent us. I made it clear to my men here, whether they liked it or not, we would go through. Mangope on several occasions has said why does the president of the ANC single me out from other homeland leaders. The question is answered by him throwing up roadblocks preventing people carrying on free political activity. This makes us loathe him from the bottom of our hearts." Wearing a blue and grey blanket and Basotho hat Mr Mandela added: "We don't need permission from Mangope to move around our country. You must understand that Mangope and his police force are cowards. As we approached them his police were fiddling with their guns. I was sure if I left the car and walked towards him he would drop the gun and run away. In spite of all this, if Mangope wants to settle we are prepared, for the good of our country and the good of our people, to listen to what he has to say to us." Mr Mandela is believed to have a meeting with Mr Mangope on Monday morning before the Bophuthatswana leader goes into talks with the government on the Freedom Alliance's [FA] participation in the election. Speaking about former FA members, Mr Mandela mentioned Transkei and Ciskei leaders who had left the alliance. "Now (Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo), who was part of the Freedom Alliance, has deserted them and come into the democratic movement. We have accepted Brig Gqozo into the Transitional Executive Council and some of his men are being trained as part of the National Peacekeeping Force. These leaders from the homelands have shown more vision than Mangope or Gqozo. And in spite of all the unspeakable crimes he (Mangope) has committed we are prepared to sit down and find a solution with him," Mr Mandela said to deafening applause and drumbeats. Mr Mandela then addressed the issues of the upcoming election and told his audience that many of them had been driven away from the farms. "Many of you are without jobs, houses and security. Your problems are due to the fact that the National Party [NP] government does not consider that your problems, suffering and hardships are part of their responsibility. They are interested in serving the needs of the white minority. The majority of the farmers support the NP and that is why they do not care for you. That is why you have low wages. That is why they don't care." He then went on to tell the crowd their votes were secret and no one would know who they voted for. On a lighter note he suggested when an employer offered a worker money and transport to the polling station to vote for the NP, "you should take his R[rand]10, let him take you to the voting station and then cast your vote for the ANC. Speaking about NP claims the ANC did not have the resources to implement its proposals, Mr Mandela pointed to large scale government corruption and the selling off of state enterprises that, he said, "were only set up to benefit whites". "And then they say we have no resources to carry out our reform programmes." "Now that there is a possibility of a black government taking over they have decided to get rid of those state enterprises and privatise them. The effect of privatisation is that wealth will remain in the hands of whites in this country. The conspiracy between the government and the mining houses by which the mining houses own the mineral resources under the ground is another way of taking money away from a new government. Up to two years ago the minerals were the property of the state, and the mining houses only had permission to remove them. Now as a black government is to take over they have changed the rules." "Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank stated that in one year R10-billion had left this country. That money has left the country because of the actions of the present government," Mr Mandela said. "The NP now argues after the corruption, privatisation and its covert operations, we should not have a programme which will ensure a better life for our people. What hypocrisy. We are dealing with hypocrites, people with no vision, who are now panicking." "The number of people who have turned up during my election campaign shows very clearly that the NP is detested by our people like leprosy. And lepers they indeed are." He also called on the top levels of the civil service to start thinking about programmes for a new government and to stop behaving as custodians of apartheid. "The public service continues to behave as if apartheid was alive and well. The sad truth is that the public service still behaves as if they are servants of the National Party. It is time for the public service to demonstrate its allegiance to South Africa. There is no one in South Africa who does not know the ANC is going to be the next government. President de Klerk still behaves as if the public service is his, and the SADF [South African Defense Force] is his private army."
