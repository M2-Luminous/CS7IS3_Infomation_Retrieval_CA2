Do you think that this will have some negative impact on approval of the fiscal 1994 budget? Also, do you think you can count on cooperation from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which seceded from the coalition government? [Fujii] At the least, we worked together to form the budget. We had ministerial level discussions with former cabinet members of the SDPJ. I believe that they share the same views with us. Therefore, I will talk to them and do my best to ask for their cooperation. [Kawabata] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono said that passage of the budget modification should be carried out when necessary. What do you think about his statement? [Fujii] The LDP is the largest opposition party, so, we should listen carefully to his comments. At the same time, we will explain the rationale behind the budget in more detail to increase their understanding. [Kawbata] The provisional budget will expire next week. What do you think about the supplementary budget? [Fujii] As of today, we want to have budget discussions in the Diet as soon as possible. However, in practice, I know we need to think about a supplementary budget because funds are needed immediately. In fact, the mechanism for a supplementary budget ends with the provisional budget. However, I am not in a position to announce the decision. We will see how the discussions will proceed before we make the final decision. [Kawabata] Another major task for the administration is tax reform. Now that the SDPJ has gone, I wonder how the finance minister will cope with the issue. Have you changed your policies since the split with the SDPJ? [Fujii] The basic policy remains unchanged from the previous cabinet. I think that the Tax System Research Council's recommendations are also unchanged. We need to think how we can financially support our future welfare society. Now we have a progressive tax system, which has already reached its limit when compared to other countries. At the moment, taxation is concentrated on income tax and salaried workers, in particular, shoulder the burden. Now, we need to have broader taxation of lower percentages. For instance, more consumption tax to increase revenues to support welfare. I believe this will benefit both tax payers and those who receive social services. [Kawabata] Howe do you foster good public understanding on such matters? [Fujii] Of course, such matters require the consensus of the people and agreement in parliament. This is the most important point. Therefore, we need to publicize and promote the concept at the same time. When I was deputy finance minister 13 years ago, we launched a nationwide treasury campaign. We need to talk to financial business people as well as to explain the concept to the public. [Kawabata] What about the review of the consumption tax? [Fujii] This issue has been taken up in the Tax System Research Council for discussions. Many people are discussing the possibility of reviewing the system. A simplified tax system, duty free shops, tax exemption limits, and other matters need to be reviewed. The final decision should be made based on that review. Anyway, discussions ought to take place. [Kawabata] Do you think it will be possible for the tax reform bills to be passed during the current Diet session? [Fujii] The government's tax reform platform says that the reform should be implemented by the end of this year. The governing coalition agreed to make the final decision in June. That schedule has not been changed. The cabinet decided to carry out tax reform this year. I cannot say about ongoing discussions among the political parties. But, I understand that they have a schedule in their minds as well. [Kawabata] You think it is essential for the tax reform bills to pass parliament in June. But, is this possible? [Fujii] The coalition continues its discussions to meet that timeframe. The Finance Ministry is also doing all it can to conform to the schedule.
