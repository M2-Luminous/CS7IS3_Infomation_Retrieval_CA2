FR941025-1-00018 FR941025-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;10&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander Series and BN2A Mk III Trislander Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A Mk III Trislander series airplanes that are equipped with a nose wheel steering disconnect system with either a Modification NB/M/503 or Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring for cracks, and replacing any cracked drive ring. A report of the rudder pedals jamming in the central position during a takeoff on one of the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the nose wheel steering system because of a cracked drive ring, which could result in the inability to move the rudder pedals. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;10&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from Pilatus Britten-Norman Ltd, Bembridge, Isle of Wight, United Kingdom, PO35 5PR. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Delano D.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;10&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A Mk III Trislander series airplanes that are equipped with a nose wheel steering disconnect system with either a Modification NB/M/503 or Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit. The CAA advises that the rudder pedals jammed in the central position during a takeoff run on a BN2B Islander series airplane. Initial investigation revealed that the nose wheel steering drive ring had fractured and the broken portion of the ring became snagged in the cut-away section of frame 19 where the steering cables pass through. This caused the inability to move the rudder pedals. Further investigation showed that the drive ring had cracked from the small radius of the left front lug across the ring and also through the grease nipple hole at the rear left side of the ring. Pilatus Britten-Norman has issued Service Bulletin No. BN&hyph;2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993, which specifies procedures for inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring. In order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom, the CAA listed the actions specified in this service bulletin in the Mandatory Aircraft Modifications and Inspections Summary, Issue 8, dated March 1994, as UK CAA AD 005&hyph;09&hyph;93. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
