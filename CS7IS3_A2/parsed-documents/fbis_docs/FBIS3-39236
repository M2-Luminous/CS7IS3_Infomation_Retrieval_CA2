These old rituals are not the right answers to high German unemployment. Despite the 3 million jobs that were created in the old laender in the course of the 1980's, all of Germany is now some 5 million competitive jobs short, the chancellor admitted at the beginning of a two-day forum on Germany as economic center in Petersberg near Bonn. In his address to eminent business and trade union representatives, who are participating in the forum that has been sponsored by the Economics Ministry, Kohl demanded that, in their negotiations, both sides of industry are focusing more strongly on the objective of jobs than in the past. The conclusion of the agreement in the chemical industry is a right signal, Kohl said. Flexible corridors for working hours and special initial wages were taking the differing effectiveness of enterprises and employees into account. This would make the new employment of people easier, the chancellor noted. This example should be copied by other industries. The forum on Germany as industrial center was basically intended to deal with securing Germany's future, particularly the people's readiness to change their way of thinking, and also to facilitate the transformation process in the new laender. Kohl called for "general inventory of our society." The recession has bottomed out. It is not least the machine construction industry that signals the beginning of an upswing that is sustained by exports. Kohl strongly appealed to the members of the mediating committee to reach an acceptable solution for nursing care insurance now. Even now, there are as many as 1.8 million acute cases of people that need nursing, which emphasizes the increasing urgency of such an insurance. Despite all differences of opinion regarding the details of the insurance, the Federal Government continues to reject any increase of the burden for the enterprises. The forum is to continue on the basis of working groups, with special emphasis being placed on the reduction of bureaucracy and privatization, labor and social affairs, finances and taxes, and research and education. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], intends to present the results of the closed meeting at a news conference on Wednesday.
