FBIS4-56915 "drlat091_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 8 May 1994 El Salvador FRS Denies Death Threats Against FMLN Members FRS Denies Death Threats Against FMLN Members PA1005234994 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1918 GMT 8 May 94 PA1005234994 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] San Salvador, 8 May (NOTIMEX) -- The clandestine Salvadoran Revolutionary Front (FRS), a group formed by former rebels, today denied that they had made death threats against several former rebel commanders and has blamed the "death squads" for them. In a communique addressed to NOTIMEX, the FRS said that "at no time has the FRS issued a communique with death threats against Joaquin Villalobos, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Eduardo Sancho, and others." The communique adds: "We hold the death squads, financed by big capital and led by Armando Calderon Sol (president-elect), responsible for any attack against members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)." Washington linked Calderon Sol, winner of the runoff elections held on 24 April, to the "death squads" in documents that were disclosed in November 1993, even though the politician has rejected this. Another communique, allegedly issued by the FRS on Thursday, threatened applying the "death penalty" to Villalobos, Martinez, Sancho, "and other traitors" for the support that Martinez and Sancho gave to the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) during the first session of the parliament held on 1 May. During the session, Martinez and Sancho, members of the Peoples Revitalizing Expression (ERP) and the National Resistance (RN), respectively, and five other deputies, also members of those organizations, voted in favor of Gloria Salguero Gross for the Legislative Assembly Presidency. In exchange, the 39 ARENA deputies supported the nomination of Martinez and Sancho to the offices of vice president and secretary, respectively. In 1981, the two organizations, together with the Farabundo Marti Peoples Liberation Front (FPL), the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC), and the Communist Party of El Salvador, formed the FMLN, now an opposition political party. The communique received by NOTIMEX has the FRS logo, whereas the first communique received does not. The FRS logo is a star under which read the slogans "Farabundo Marti lives in the struggles of the people" and "The weapons shall not be silent while injustices prevail in our country." The communique accuses rightist ideologue Kirio Waldo Salgado of using the acronym of the clandestine group, which was formed in January 1993, and "taking advantage of the ideological differences within the FRS." The communique reiterates: "We warn the extreme right to refrain from using our acronym. Otherwise, we will take measures and begin to sabotage the economy." The communique adds: "We wish to state to the ERP and RN comrades that the FRS is a disciplined political and military front and only obeys the orders of its general command." NOTIMEX received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who said: "The day we do this (make threats or carry out attacks) we will make it very clear." Asked about the communique in which the threats are made, the unidentified woman said that it was drafted by the "extreme right." When Villalobos and Sancho learned of the death threats made against them by the FRS last week, they said that there was a possibility this was a maneuver by the extreme right. The FRS is made up of former FMLN rebels who disagreed with the signing of the peace agreements with the government in 1992. NOTIMEX learned recently that armed groups operate in the northern area of El Salvador, as well as in the eastern sector of the country.
