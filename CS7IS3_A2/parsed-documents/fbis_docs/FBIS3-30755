Andrzej Lepper, the leader of the Samoobrona [militant farmers organization], suggested a state farm at Montowo in Torun Province as the venue for talks. The committee demands, among other things, the increase of funds for agriculture by 8 trillion zlotys by raising the budget deficit, and that priority be given to workers' companies in leasing former state farms. It also demands cheap credits for the purchase of turnover assets and for running production, and that those guilty of destroying Polish agriculture be called to account.
