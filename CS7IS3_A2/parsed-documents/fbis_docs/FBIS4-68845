He was killed on the evening of 26 April near the entrance to his apartment building by a shot from a pump-action rifle. The investigation is working on many possibilities; KOMMERSANT has learned of nine of them. A Quarrel With the Mayor At the Khimki procuracy, which has opened a criminal case on the murder, our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told that the investigation is working on all possible versions, first among which is the so-called "political" one. It is possible that the victim was selected from an alphabetical list of deputies, where Aizderdzis is near the top. The second version takes into consideration the enmity between the deputy and the mayor of Khimki, of which the entire town was aware. According to MDK General Director Aleksey Ponomarev, "Andrey Daynisovich did not have any enemies except Mayor Yuriy Korablin and his inner circle." One of the causes of the conflict had been Mr. Korablin's refusal to issue a certificate of ownership for the mansion in Old Khimki which houses the International Business Corporation and MDK-Bank. They had bought the decrepit structure from the consumer services administration, and after reconstruction it became one of the most beautiful mansions in town. It turned out later, however, that such a deal was illegal, since state property cannot be alienated without a bid or an auction. Therefore, at the mayor's initiative, it was annulled in the arbitration court. The mutual dislike between the head of the town administration and the bank management increased after the beating of Sergey Chernykh, director of Khimki cable television, who is considered the "mayor's man." On the day of elections to the State Duma, bodily injury was inflicted on Mr. Chernykh for refusing to air a video film on Andrey Aizderdzis' meetings with famous people--Nikolay Ryzhkov and Nikita Mikhalkov. According to Mr. Chernykh, he was roughed up by two MDK guards at Aizderdzis' order. He was not able to prove this allegation to the investigation, however, and the criminal case initiated against the State Duma deputy was closed. The management of MDK-Bank called the beating "a provocation, and not the first one, on the part of the mayor." In the bankers' opinion, it was the mayoralty that had initiated the audit of MDK-Bank and the corporation, conducted by the city's tax inspectorate and tax police. The bank was told to pay into the budget 100 million rubles [R], the corporation--R1.2 billion. The bank paid up, but the MDK called the inspectors' actions "lawlessness," withdrew the money from its account, and de facto ceased to exist. Soon after the audit Andrey Aizderdzis sent a letter to Russia's Tax Police Department. In it the banker reported that the chief of the Khimki tax police, Dmitriy Karasev, had "blackmailed" him, demanding that he voluntarily transfer to the budget R250 million and threatening to otherwise slap the MDK and the bank with R4 billion in sanctions. This conversation with Mr. Karasev was recorded on tape. Aizderdzis also said in his letter that in the spring of 1993 MDK handed over to Aleksandr Gayderov, deputy head of the city administration, R3 million to purchase a car for Mr. Karasev, who was also paid R100,000-150,000 monthly as a "bonus to supplement his salary." In his letter the banker said that he was prepared to "produce witnesses" for the Tax Police Department to support this information. Mayoralty Inclined To Believe "Gangster" Version All staff members of the local administration with whom the KOMMERSANT correspondent had a chance to talk believe that it is to MDK-Bank's benefit to lead the investigation away from the true causes of the murder. Which are allegedly to be found in its commercial activities, as well as in its former connection with the Zelenograd-Khimki organized crime group led by Viktor Burlachko (until his arrest for extortion in the summer of 1992). According to unofficial data, the Burlachko group for while served as MDK's "cover," but after the arrest of its leader, Andrey Aizderdzis "did not find common language" with "Burlak's" successor Dmitriy Romanov. In 1993 the banker allegedly even helped to "hand over" to the militia Romanov, who was on the wanted list. According to information from the same source, the murder was "revenge for Romanov." MDK-Bank Chairman of the Board Anatoliy Vasilyev (a former procurator) said that as early as December 1993 two unknown persons had threatened him and demanded that he immediately resign his position. Aizderdzis could have chosen to dismiss Vasilyev, but had not done so because he valued the latter as a competent jurist. Then on 25 December, when the banker stepped out of his house to shake out a carpet, two burly men who "looked like gangsters" approached him. One of them grabbed Vasilyev by the ear and said: "You make waves, and even bodyguards will not help your kid and your family." The banker turned to the oblast procuracy and told them that the threats were directed not so much against him as aimed at getting at Aizderdzis. "My prophesy came true," Mr. Vasilyev told a KOMMERSANT correspondent a few days ago. According to him, what made the tragedy possible was that the investigators who were in charge of the criminal case on the subject of the threats against him had led the case into a dead end. The version of gangster revenge was refuted by MDK General Director Aleksey Ponomarev. According to him, in 1991 Burlachko did indeed visit MDK, but currently the corporation would hardly be of interest to criminal structures, since it does not have "either retail kiosks or cash." Aizderdzis' Newspaper Insulted Crime Bosses One more version of the investigation is also connected with the criminal world. The victim was not only a politician and a banker but also a publisher. He published a newspaper of a patriotic orientation, "Who Is Who," whose editor in chief was well-known literary figure Stanislav Rybas. In this year's seventh issue the newspaper published a list of 266 leaders of the criminal world, with names (mostly of Caucasian origin), nicknames, and a crime record of the crime bosses. Someone on this list may "hold a grudge" against the publisher, since these "authorities" have a tremendous dislike for having their "lay" name linked with their criminal world nicknames. Actually, in the militia's opinion, this list is incomplete and imprecise, besides which it had already been published in a self-published brochure (which, on the other hand, may not have been known to the crime bosses). So it would have been more logical to settle the score not with Aizderdzis but with the editor, who, according to MDK-Bank staff, had not coordinated this publication with Aizderdzis. Conflict With Partner The day after the murder Anatoliy Kuznetsov, the founder of MDK and former chairman of the board of MDK-Bank, was summoned to the Khimki UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]. As Mr. Kuznetsov told the KOMMERSANT correspondent, he and Aizderdzis had been friends and partners but parted ways in 1992. Now Kuznetsov calls his former partner a "pathologically dishonest man," whose traits included "aggressiveness, looking for enemies, and creating an environment loyal to him personally." Kuznetsov, however, has his own corporation now, and, in his own words, long ago dropped all financial claims against Aizderdzis. Kuznetsov believes that the cause of the tragedy were the "new commercial wheeling-dealings" of his former friend. "Commercial" Versions of the Murder According to MDK General Director Ponomarev, the deceased lately was not engaged in commerce altogether. Investigators have their doubts about this. Among others, a version is being checked out that the banker was done in by a debtor pushed into a corner by persistent demands for payment. And, according to MDK-Bank's management, there are quite a few people who owe it money (more than R500 million in unrepaid loans). Neither does the investigation preclude the possibility that one of the companies that had been part of MDK itself got into debt. A company mentioned in particular in this connection is Telecon, which is part of the corporation and which had promised for half a year already to repay R0.5 billion to the Roskontrakt company. The investigators are also checking whether Aizderdzis' demise is linked in any way with the murder of entrepreneur Tayvo Laos. On 18 April 1994 the latter was stabbed five time with a knife by unknown assailants in the Ukraine hotel. According to unofficial data, Mr. Laos worked in an Estonian law firm and in addition did some trading in nonferrous metals (exporting them from Russia to the Baltics). It is possible that Aizderdzis and Laos knew one another, since the MDK also engaged in metal trading--only ferrous and only inside Russia, however, according to Mr. Ponomarev. Yesterday operatives received information that five pump-action Winchester rifles (the type of a weapon used by the murderer) had been brought in from abroad by a friend of the victim. Aizderdzis gave four of them as a gift to partners and friends (including the aforementioned Aleksey Ponomarev, Aleksandr Gayderov, and Anatoliy Kuznetsov), and kept one for himself. The investigation is trying to find out where the fifth rifle is and whether it was the one used by the criminal to kill the deputy. [begin box] Andrey Daynisovich Aizderdzis, born 1958.

Through this foundation MDK-Bank financed the city newspaper VPERED. He did not carry a weapon. During the election campaign Mr. Aizderdzis was accompanied by members of the MDK security service; after the elections he refused to have bodyguards.
