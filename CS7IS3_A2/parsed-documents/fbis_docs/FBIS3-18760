Unless, of course, the money that is now ready to flow from "every sort of amenity" that has been made available could be called "coming between" them. What a windfall -- "50 billion lira coming between them" for going on the hajj before the first step is even taken! If they can double the hajj quota, Saudi Arabia's contribution to the Prosperity Party [RP] will then rise to "100 billion lira." Saudi Arabia was "very generous to the Prosperity Party" before the local elections in Turkey. The Saudis think of their "Turkish brother in religion" first and foremost. To think of their Turkish brothers in religion means to think first of the Prosperity Party. Indeed, when we are heading into regular elections, at a time when all the world needs money, why should Saudi King Fahd not think of his "religious brother" Necmettin Erbakan, his religion, and his entire party, Prosperity? CUMHURIYET published a report yesterday, a report about "hajj memo given to Saudis." I know there are other dimensions to it because I have been following it closely for several days. Those dimensions give certain clues to the "RP's sources of income," a topic often discussed and wondered about. It is necessary to follow these clues closely to avoid getting tangled when the threads all come together to make a ball! The incident is actually also an international scandal. Saudi Arabia gives Turkey a quota each year for the hajj, as it does every Muslim country. Right now this quota is 60,000 a year. There is an official protocol between the two countries that governs this. "Special" Quota for RP! For the past 3 years, 39,000 of the 60,000 have gone on the hajj through Department of Religious Affairs channels, and the remaining 21,000 have been sponsored by private business. Each hajj candidate pays $1,700 for cost of travel, food, and accommodations. If full accommodations for two weeks, the difference if it is a five-star hotel, and communications costs are added to this, it can reach $4,920 per pilgrim. Moreover, money must be allocated for sacrifice and other expenses, which may vary between $500 and $1,000. All of this money for expenses and visas is handled "through official channels." Now comes the "Prosperity Party-Saudi Arabia connection" right in the middle of all this. In addition to the 60,000-pilgrim quota that Saudi Arabia assigns to Turkey, "an additional quota of 5,000 people is being assigned to the Prosperity Party" -- as opposed to the protocol between the countries. Although it was officially reported earlier that Turkey wanted to increase its pilgrim quota, Riyadh denied this request. Nevertheless, a 5,000-person quota is granted to Prosperity... plus a promise "to raise this figure to 10,000 later." What does this mean? It means "the significance of the 5,000-person quota is 50 billion lira, and the significance of the 10,000-person quota is 100 billion lira." According to Department of Religious Affairs figures, a source of 50 billion lira has been created for the Prosperity Party for the visa and other expenses of 5,000 people. That is, Saudi Arabia is saving the RP from the trouble of finding money for elections! Note to Arabia Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri is looking into the matter. He held meeting after meeting during the past several days at the Department of Religious Affairs. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin entered the picture later. And two days ago, Riyadh's charge d'affaires in Ankara was called to the Foreign Ministry and given a note. It stresses that the "matter is governed by protocol between the two countries, and contrary behavior violates the diplomatic rules." It adds that the quota assigned the RP is "invalid." But it is not this simple or easily dismissed. One country is clearly "indirectly increasing the resources" of a political party of another country! While most parties are certainly struggling for "money" during elections, the RP is solving this problem through Saudi Arabia! There is no intrinsic difference between ILKSAN [Primary School Teachers Health and Social Assistance Fund], ISKI [Istanbul Water and Sewer Authority], or the hajj quota. There was corruption in the first two, and the truth came out only later. Now there is awareness of the matter beforehand and it is being prevented. The ILKSAN and ISKI incidents are, in the term so beloved by Erbakan and the Prosperity Party, "national" in nature. This, however, in other terms they are equally fond of, is "antinational, foreign." If the RP were to come to power, it is now clear "how it would protect our national and moral values, how and with whom it would establish the order of justice." "National view" is now clearer! Prosperity's mask has slipped.
