FBIS4-50014 "drchi093_e_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Southeast Asia & Pacific Malaysian Paper: Foreign Standards To Hurt Economy Malaysian Paper: Foreign Standards To Hurt Economy OW1305070594 Beijing XINHUA in English 0611 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305070594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (XINHUA) -- "Let the Chinese decide for themselves what is best for their country", "do not impose foreign standards and criteria on them" -- this is what a Malaysian newspaper said today. Malaysia's sole financial newspaper BUSINESS TIMES said, "just as one man's meat is another man's poison, what works for one country and community may not be at all applicable in another." In an editorial entitled "The China Express", the English daily said, "a concerted push by some developed economies for China to accept and implement policies that are alien to it and not acceptable to the 1.2 billion Chinese citizens...would only result in driving China into isolation -- and this would certainly not benefit anyone." "On the other hand, the region and indeed the world will stand to benefit from a wealthy and strong China." "In the final analysis, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said, its leaders and intelligentsia themselves must pick and choose from the methods of other countries which could possibly fit in with the conditions in China," the paper said. Mahathir, who ends his three-day working visit to China today, said on Wednesday that "Southeast Asia should welcome a wealthy China as it "will become the engine of growth firstly for east Asia including Southeast Asia."
