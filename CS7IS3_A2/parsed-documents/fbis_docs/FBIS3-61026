But as the presidents deal with their parliaments, it seems that "third forces" have joined the struggle for the Black Sea Fleet. The two presidents' agreements on the Black Sea Fleet have a strange quality: It has become clear with time that each side has its own understanding of the accord that was reached. After the September meeting at Massandra, where "appropriate documents" were signed, it was said, Boris Yeltsin hastened to declare that Ukraine was turning its part of the Black Sea Fleet over to Russia as payment for accumulated debts. However, Leonid Kravchuk unexpectedly declared that he had signed no documents on the Black Sea Fleet and considered any bargaining to be inappropriate altogether. Such clashes on the political stage do not arise by accident. When the main actors, waving goodbye to the agreed-upon scenario, begin to improvise, it is not hard to guess that each is trying to please his own "audience." And if the situation starts to become awkward, it is best to leave the game for a time. Interests The problems associated with the Black Sea Fleet have now been taken up by state delegations. Their mandates and responsibilities are unclear, since the presidents never agreed on explicit criteria for dividing the Fleet. Nevertheless, certain progress has been made in efforts to solve the problem. On 29-30 September in Moscow, the Russian side insisted on drafting an agreement under which the entire Black Sea Fleet would be used by Russia. At the same time, Russia expects to acquire the part of the Fleet that, under the previous accords, was supposed to pass to Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation proposed its own solution: Russia would lease individual Fleet installations, pay compensation to Ukraine for environmental damages caused by the Black Sea Fleet's activities, and foot the bill for developing the social and economic infrastructure. In addition, Ukraine would like to maintain joint command of the Black Sea Fleet, while Russia would bear virtually the entire burden of financing and supplying the Fleet. The latest round of talks was held on 13 October in Kiev. Russia did not alter its terms. Ukraine made concessions: It agreed to set up working groups that would devise an agreement under which Russia would use the entire Black Sea Fleet. This could be a mere tactical move designed to allow the Ukrainian side to gain time. In any case, this is the view of several experts, who point out that as the political delegations debate, the military and intelligence services are beginning to step up their activities. Behind the Scenes Strictly speaking, the Ukrainian Security Service and Ministry of Defense have never been passive observers in the debate over the Black Sea Fleet. According to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's information, the Ukrainian Security Service has repeatedly informed Kravchuk of possible "provocations" in Sevastopol being organized by Russian intelligence services. In response, Lubyanka has been forced to issue a denial to the Ukrainian president and to assure him that it is not interfering in the Crimean conflict. In order to avoid unnecessary complications, the Russian Ministry of Security has even agreed that in the Black Sea Fleet military units under Russian jurisdiction, the special departments (military counterintelligence) could be Ukrainian; in other words, that could belong to the other state. This is unprecedented, since counterintelligence officers control classified information, attend all official conferences, have their own informers in subunits, and so forth. Until recently, military counterintelligence in the Ukrainian Security Service was headed by General Aleksandr Skipalskiy, a notorious figure in chekist circles. In 1982-1984, while serving as deputy chief of the military counterintelligence department of the Pacific Border District, he become so preoccupied with "informal activity" that Japanese smugglers began to classify him as a "window-bureaucrat"--their name for officials through whom they could smuggle contraband. His Moscow patrons were able to protect him from major unpleasantries by sending him to serve in the Transbaykal region. The exile ended in 1987, and Skipalskiy was "redeployed" to Ukraine as deputy chief of the army military counterintelligence department. He befriended Vasiliy Durdinets, chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party, and soon became his deputy. When Durdinets was elected first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, he installed Skipalskiy as chief of the Ukrainian Security Service's military counterintelligence division. Working hard to justify his high appointment, Skipalskiy actively exposed "subversive activities" by Russian intelligence services in Ukraine. In 1992, through Durdinets, Leonid Kravchuk received Skipalskiy's first report to the effect that the Russian Chief Intelligence Administration was "preparing measures to activate intelligence groups in the Black Sea Fleet and special reserve intelligence agents and reactivating secret caches of weapons and radio equipment in the Crimea for actions against Ukraine." Under this pretext, the Ukrainian Security Service dispatched sizable forces and equipment to the region "to step up counterintelligence." Skipalskiy was soon promoted to general. Documents To assume that Russian intelligence services are as innocent as a child would be to question their professionalism. But the Ukrainian Security Service wasn't born yesterday either. Documents in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's possession indicate that Ukrainian intelligence is devoting considerable attention to the Crimea. A closed collegium meeting was held in the state administration building in Sevastopol on 27 July. It was attended by Kuntsevskiy, the Ukrainian Security Service's chief for the Crimea and Sevastopol; Rear Admiral Obishchenko, chief of the military counterintelligence administration; and Cherniy, chief of the counterintelligence administration. They approved a plan of measures that merits detailed quotation. It calls for: "1. The establishment in the city of Sevastopol of a coordinating council for work in pro-Russian structures, to include officials of the military and territorial counterintelligence administrations. Major-General Cherniy and Yermakov (the president's representative) will be charged with immediate supervision of the council. The council's activities will be overseen by Mr. Marchuk (chief of the Ukrainian Security Service--A. Zh.), who will report on the council's work to the Ukrainian president. "2. In order to exert active pressure on pro-Russian structures in Sevastopol and to encourage the initiative of Ukrainian patriotic forces in the Crimea, to hold a general plenary meeting of Ukrainian structures by 15 August; to begin forming resistance columns. Groups of Ukrainians displaying national symbols are to put up resistance to demonstrations by the Russian population of Sevastopol, in order to create the impression of a struggle against an `occupation regime.' The responsible officials are Mr. Obishchenko and Mr. Kuntsevskiy. The operation will be overseen by Mr. Cherniy. "3. In carrying out day-to-day efforts to discredit Russian structures in Sevastopol and in the Crimea as a whole, especially during rallies and demonstrations, fighting groups consisting of UNSO-UPA [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense] members are to be set up in the resistance columns; their mission will be to end a state of calm at such demonstrations and meetings. It is especially advisable to carry out actions with respect to specific individuals (activists), and to assign responsibility for possible consequences on Moscow forces. In order to carry out this decision, a group of 150 reliable UNSO-UPA fighters are to be sent from Kiev prior to 1 September. Mr. Obishchenko will be charged with framing the mission and providing accommodations for and working with the UNSO-UPA fighters. "4. To direct the mass media to organize a systematic effort to discredit Russian policy in the Crimea and in the nearby foreign countries. This work will be organized by Yermakov and Generak Cherniy. 5. To set up close surveillance of leaders of pro-Russian structures and members of the Black Sea Fleet Military Council." Motives Who needs such questionable actions, and why? "Ukraine's political and military leaders know that if they unable to obtain a sizable sum for the Black Sea Fleet from Russia and at the same time maintain joint command as a formal sign of Ukrainian ownership of part of the Fleet, they will have to get rid of the latter at any price. The current financial and material-technical state of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense allows it to maintain, to at least some extent, a maximum of 25 percent of the republic's total armed forces. Things are so bad in our republic that the collapsing Army is simply starting to pose a danger to society," an officer of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense central staff told a MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent. In his opinion, if efforts to bargain for as much as possible from Russia fail, there will be just one alternative: To create a situation in the Crimea such that the presence of Russian sailors there will become impossible in both political and moral-psychological terms. Then the "humiliated and insulted" crews of Russian ships, raising the Andreyevskiy flags, will go home on their own. Intrigues The actions of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry fit into this scenario quite well. Former Defense Minister Konstantin Morozov issued a number of orders aimed at seizing individual units and installations of the Black Sea Fleet. As a result, a major conflict was provoked when ship commanders raised the Andreyevskiy flags and were prepared to issue an ultimatum to officials of both countries. After the presidents' Massandra meeting, a new scandal broke out in Sevastopol. Rumors swept the city that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and Navy were planning a provocation aimed at "torpedoing the latest agreements on the Black Sea Fleet." According to confidential information from the central staff of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, the plan was as follows. A "political-criminal incident" would be provoked in the Sevastopol garrison--with casualties, if possible. This would create a compelling pretext to impose a state of emergency in Sevastopol. The sailors' response would be clear: The Andreyevskiy flag would be raised on Black Sea Fleet warships. Then Ukraine would accuse Russia of scuttling the accords and demand the immediate withdrawal of the "mutinous" ships of a foreign power from its territory. Unlike the Security Service's "plan of measures," this project was not put down on paper. It exists only in recordings of telephone conversations between high-ranking military officials. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense denies these reports. However, the facts lead one suspect that rumors of impending provocations are not groundless. The attacks on Russian units by Ukrainian naval infantrymen, the arrival of additional Ukrainian "Berkut" special units in Sevastopol, the sending of armored equipment and weapons to the city, including flame-throwers, which are designed for combat operations in residential quarters, not at sea, and so on--this chain of events can hardly be seen as a string of random events. And the hasty removal of Defense Ministry Konstantin Morozov and Ukrainian Naval Commander Boris Kozhin from their posts and the transfer of Ukrainian Security Service counterintelligence chief Aleksandr Skipalskiy to a new post tend to support this view. The official explanations for the resignations are different, needless to say. However, observers think that in reality the personnel shuffles stem from the fact that the "Morozov-Kozhin-Skipalskiy" triumvirate had tried to play an independent role in the Crimean region. In addition, experts call attention to General Morozov's desire to establish close ties with Ukrainian nationalist forces behind the president's back and to assume the role of "savior of the republic's sovereignty and national interests." Outlook The personnel of the Black Sea Fleet are tired of constant scandals, provocations, and uncertainty. Speaking at a session of the Military Council, the Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin, said bitterly that young officers are leaving military service. Twenty-two lieutenants who graduated from schools have refused to serve in the Fleet this year alone. According to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's information, officers who have five or six more years before retirement do not intend to leave. But they are also unwilling to remain hostage to political ambitions. The question of whether to issue a stern ultimatum to Yeltsin and Kravchuk and to force the two countries' leaders to finally solve the problem of the Fleet is being discussed once more. This is a dangerous symptom, because the Black Sea Fleet has enough military power to draw the presidents' attention. On the other hand, Yeltsin and Kravchuk have utterly exhausted the sailors' confidence, and this is greatly fueling aggressive sentiments among the latter. If another "ship mutiny" occurs, Eduard Baltin will hardly be able to neutralize it the way he did the last time. The commander, who has himself become a hostage to the political game, will have no more arguments. The protracted Black Sea performance changes genres from one act to the next: From a comedy, to a drama--to a tragedy? * * * MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier: As of October 15, 1993, the Black Sea Fleet had received a total of 89,277.7 million karbovantsy in credits, including 67,410.7 million karbovantsy from the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense (75.5 percent of the total), and 21,867.0 million karbovantsy from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (24.5 percent). The provision of credits to the Fleet by Ukraine has declined in recent months. The Ukraine's share of Black Sea Fleet financing stood at 8.7 percent in August, 6.8 percent in September, and 0 in October. The Black Sea Fleet is incurring considerable expenses in maintaining Ukrainian military units. In the first nine months of this year, 26 Ukrainian military units were given free food products valued at 2,668.0 million karbovantsy. The pay for compulsory-duty servicemen conscripted from Ukrainian territory and serving in the Black Sea Fleet under oath to Ukraine totals almost 500.0 million karbovantsy each month. The Black Sea Fleet has appropriated 12,169.7 million karbovantsy for construction of housing and social, cultural, and consumer-service facilities (including fuel provided to the construction administration), while the Ukrainian Navy has appropriated 5,965.0 million karbovantsy. The cost of maintaining the Fleet is increased by amounts levied by the Ukrainian tax and customs inspectorates. The land tax, including an upcoming payment for the second half of the year, will amount to almost 13,000.0 million karbovantsy. Customs duties on equipment and supplies imported for the Fleet amounted to 39,053.6 thousand karbovantsy, including 9,941 thousand karbovantsy for food, 5,000.0 thousand karbovantsy for various supplies, 23,289.3 thousand karbovantsy for fuel, and 823.3 thousand karbovantsy for motor vehicles. The quarantine inspectorate has charged 3,740.0 thousand karbovantsy to inspect imported food products. Officers and naval warrant officers arriving from Russia are charged 300.0 thousand karbovantsy for customs inspection of each container of belongings. The Fleet has paid 13,900.0 thousand karbovantsy in various road fees, and 6,300.0 thousand karbovantsy for railroad services. The naval engineering service has spent 9,900.0 thousand and 4,500.0 thousand karbovantsy to maintain Ukrainian motor roads and railways, respectively. A $10 fee (or an equivalent sum in karbovantsy at the bank exchange rate) is charged for each flight by airplanes from Russian territory to the Black Sea Fleet. Five dollars are charged for each customs officer who comes to inspect an airplane, and that amount is doubled on weekends and holidays. In addition, there are a number of other, smaller duties and payments that are impossible to tally. (From a report by the chief of the Black Sea Fleet financial service.)
