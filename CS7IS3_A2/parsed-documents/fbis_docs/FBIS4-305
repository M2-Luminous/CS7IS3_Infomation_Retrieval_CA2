Lieutenant General David Mark, a former aide to previous military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, told the weekly Lagos magazine TELL that he and 16 other officers had been retired "because we supported democracy and we were totally opposed to another extended period of military intervention." "Abacha's regime qualifies for a space in the Guiness Book of Records as the greatest betrayal of the century," Mark said, in the first public comment by any of the soldiers retired after the defence minister took power. Mark, a former state governor and subsequently a communications minister, described the army-backed government as a "betrayal of the people, betrayal of hope and aspirations for all Nigerians and a coup against democracy." He and a group of other officers had supported a planned transition to democracy under Babangida, Mark said, denying that the group had requested that the former head of state should annul the presidential election held last June 12. Babangida plunged Nigeria into political chaos when he annulled the poll, which Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the now defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) claimed to have won. Abacha, who was the military strongman in the Babangida regime, was the "main beneficiary" of that annulment, which threatened to bring civil war or disintegration of the Nigerian federation before the military staged a comeback, Mark said. An interim civilian administration which took over from Babangida when he stepped down last August 26 lasted for less than three months before Abacha took power and scrapped all elected political institutions, with the SDP and the rival National Republican Convention. The new regime claimed nevertheless that its tenure would be brief. Mark said that when it became obvious that the interim government could not manage the affairs of the nation, a group of military officers, including Abacha, his deputy, General Oladipo Diya, and himself "reluctantly decided to intervene." The three possible options considered were to give the government military backing to enable it to conduct a new presidential election, or go for a six-month "full military regime" during which the poll would be organised, or install a "diluted military regime" for not more than one year, at the end of which a vote would take place. Though most members of the group favoured the first option, the present regime chose to adopt the last option, but plans to stay in power for five years, Mark charged. The army authorities have recently placed restrictions on the 17 officers, including seven generals, retired after Abacha seized power. Most of them had participated in the bloodless palace coup that brought Babangida to office in August 1985.
