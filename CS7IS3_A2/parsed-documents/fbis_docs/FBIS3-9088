The decision was passed by the country's Presidency on the proposal of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and, in my opinion, it is politically conflicting. Rasim Kadic warned that this means that parliamentary parties that had a smaller number of voters will be thrown out of war presidencies, while representatives that had not even participated in the elections would remain in these executive bodies. This is a paradox. Moreover, a part of the text of the draft constitution for the federal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina is also considered undemocratic. The part in question foresees a limit of 5 percent for entering the parliament. According to Kadic, this is the introduction of a single-party system. He also said that in the majority of European countries this limit was set at 2 percent, and that the Liberal Party would demand at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly that this provision is changed, because it limits the development of democracy in these areas.
