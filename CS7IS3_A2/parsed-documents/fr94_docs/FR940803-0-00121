FR940803-0-00121 FR940803-0-00040 (2) [Reserved] Subpart B_[Amended] 12. A new §600.101&hyph;93 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §600.101&hyph;93 General applicability. The provisions of this subpart are applicable to 1993 and later model year gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, alcohol dual fuel, and natural gas dual fuel automobiles. 13. A new §600.107&hyph;93 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §600.107&hyph;93 Fuel specifications. (a) The test fuel specifications for gasoline-fueled automobiles are given in §86.113(a) (1) and (2) of this chapter. (b) The test fuel specifications for diesel-fueled automobiles are given in §86.113(b) (1) through (3) of this chapter. (c) The test fuel specifications for methanol fuel used in Otto-cycle automobiles are given in §86.113(a) (3) and (4) of this chapter. (d) The test fuel specifications for methanol fuel used in diesel cycle automobiles are given in §86.113(b) (4) through (6) of this chapter. (e) The test fuel specifications for mixtures of petroleum and methanol fuels for methanol dual fuel vehicles are given in §86.113(d) of this chapter. (f) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.090&hyph;21(b)(3) of this chapter. 14. A new §600.111&hyph;93 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §600.111&hyph;93 Test procedures. (a) The test procedures to be followed for generation of the city fuel economy data are those prescribed in §§86.127 through 86.138 of this chapter, as applicable, except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section. (The evaporative loss portion of the test procedure may be omitted unless specifically required by the Administrator.) (b) The test procedures to be followed for generation of the highway fuel economy data are those specified in paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section. (1) The Highway Fuel Economy Dynamometer Procedure consists of preconditioning highway driving sequence and a measured highway driving sequence. (2) The highway fuel economy test is designated to simulate non-metropolitan driving with an average speed of 48.6 mph and a maximum speed of 60 mph. The cycle is 10.2 miles long with 0.2 stop per mile and consists of warmed-up vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving cycle. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust emission is collected continuously for subsequent analysis of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler. Diesel dilute exhaust is continuously analyzed for hydrocarbons using a heated sample line and analyzer. Methanol and formaldehyde samples are collected and individually analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (measurement of methanol and formaldehyde may be omitted for 1993 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID calibrated on methanol is used for measuring HC plus methanol). (3) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor vehicle must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. The Administrator may authorize maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure. (c) Transmission. The provisions of §86.128 of this chapter apply for vehicle transmission operation during highway fuel economy testing under this subpart. (d) Road load power and test weight determination. Section 86.129 of this chapter applies for determination of road load power and test weight for highway fuel economy testing. The test weight for the testing of a certification vehicle will be that test weight specified by the Administrator under the provisions of part 86 of this chapter. The test weight for a fuel economy data vehicle will be that test weight specified by the Administrator from the test weights covered by that vehicle configuration. The Administrator will base his selection of a test weight on the relative projected sales volumes of the various test weights within the vehicle configuration. (e) Vehicle preconditioning . The Highway Fuel Economy Dynamometer Procedure is designed to be performed immediately following the Federal Emission Test Procedure, §§86.127 through 86.138 of this chapter. When conditions allow, the tests should be scheduled in this sequence. In the event the tests cannot be scheduled within three hours of the Federal Emission Test Procedure (including one hour hot soak evaporative loss test, if applicable) the vehicle should be preconditioned as in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. (1) If the vehicle has experienced more than three hours of soak (68 ○F&hyph;86 ○F) since the completion of the Federal Emission Test Procedure, or has experienced periods of storage outdoors, or in environments where soak temperature is not controlled to 68 ○F&hyph;86 ○F, the vehicle must be preconditioned by operation on a dynamometer through one cycle of the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, §86.115 of this chapter. (2) In unusual circumstances where additional preconditioning is desired by the manufacturer, the provisions of §86.132(a)(3) of this chapter apply. (f) Highway fuel economy dynamometer procedure. (1) The dynamometer procedure consists of two cycles of the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (§600.109(b)) separated by 15 seconds of idle. The first cycle of the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule is driven to precondition the test vehicle and the second is driven for the fuel economy measurement. (2) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of §86.135 Dynamometer procedure of this chapter, apply for highway fuel economy testing. (3) Only one exhaust sample and one background sample are collected and analyzed for hydrocarbons (except diesel hydrocarbons which are analyzed continuously), carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Methanol and formaldehyde samples (exhaust and dilution air) are collected and analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (measurement of methanol and formaldehyde may be omitted for 1993 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID calibrated on methanol is used for measuring HC plus methanol). (4) The fuel economy measurement cycle of the test includes two seconds of idle indexed at the beginning of the second cycle and two seconds of idle indexed at the end of the second cycle.
