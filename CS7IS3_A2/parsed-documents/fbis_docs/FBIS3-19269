He said -- and we quote: "There is no question of tearing up any map or territory, as might be deduced from the alarmism that some People's Party leaders wish to transmit to the public." Saavedra advocated the path of "calm, tranquillity, and mutual respect" in order to achieve the impetus to autonomy to which Felipe Gonzalez committed himself in his investiture speech and which will enable the autonomous communities to achieve the maximum level of powers recognized by the Constitution and their respective autonomy statutes. The minister asserted that the government will not negotiate Aznar's autonomy proposal in its current form and that it will continue to implement its own policy. As will be recalled, Saavedra has described as "simplistic" and "underdeveloped" the autonomy proposal that the People's Party presented in Barcelona and asserted that an issue as complex as building the state of the autonomous communities cannot be reduced to a proposal that seeks the standardization of powers of all the communities within two legislative terms and that recognizes only a few distinctive features. In this connection, Saavedra clearly distanced himself from the People's Party strategy of finalizing the autonomy framework by stating that the state of the autonomous communities is always being built, "like it or not." But Saavedra's line hardened even further when he added that "if this (approach) is shared by the other political forces, I am delighted for everybody; if not, let everybody implement the autonomy policy that he deems most opportune." In his opinion, it is clear that the People's Party does not have a serious and well-developed autonomy proposal on which to sit down and negotiate, since its document does not specify the distinctive features or define points as important as the matters that are nontransferable and those that can be transferred to the autonomous communities. Nevertheless, he especially emphasized the government's desire to reach agreement with the People's Party on the so-called democratic impetus and the "local pact." According to the minister, the latter agreement will bring about a real decentralization of the state's public expenditure, which will make our country one of the most decentralized in the world. In this connection, he agreed with [Catalan president] Jordi Pujol that the distribution of expenditure must be in keeping with the level of powers assumed by each of the state's administrations. Last, the minister would not assess the Federation of Municipalities' new demands for powers and played down its threat to curb the turnabout in autonomy unless there is previously a municipal pact.
