Actually, the audience was far bigger because his speech was transmitted on the radio communication system. According to our information what particularly pleased the intelligence agents was the specific nature of the president's speech and his extensive acquaintance with a whole series of the foreign intelligence service's specific problems. What was the thrust of the speech? Unemployment obviously does not threaten the foreign intelligence service staffers. As the president said, "under conditions where military budgets are being reduced, intelligence becomes a very important guarantee of security and that means that the role of the intelligence service must and will grow." "The supreme function of the foreign intelligence service," the Russian leader stressed, "is to serve Russia's national and state interests." The president admitted that the foreign intelligence service has a high reputation in the system of Russian state power. "I believe that your operational information, analytical conclusions, and recommendations will receive only high assessments," he noted. The guest stressed that Russia will strengthen the intelligence service -- that is the authorities' intention and, which is even more interesting, the president's personal understanding of this issue. So is Yeltsin's visit to the foreign intelligence service an attempt to improve our intelligence agents' morale or an attempt to render them their due for their work? Most likely both. And it is irrelevant whether Ames was a Russian special services agent. Probably now even if you are not a specialist in the affairs of the foreign intelligence services you can imagine that the situation over Bosnia and the trouble spots in the former USSR republics require close attention and strenuous work from the intelligence service. Concluding his speech the Russian president had a one on one meeting with the leader of the foreign intelligence service. It is not out of the question that meetings like yesterday's will become traditional. To spite our enemies?!
