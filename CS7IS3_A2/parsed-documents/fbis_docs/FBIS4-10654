This was confirmed by Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, who offered details of the Uruguayan officers' situation. Garcia said that all military officers are free to leave the area, which is considered a high-risk area. The commander then explained: [Begin Garcia recording] Our personnel, who are deployed in the country's north and south and in the interior, have been evacuated almost completely. They are in neighboring countries where they are being cared for. We obtained promises of help there. What concerns us is the situation of the personnel in Kigali. We have two officers at the local airport and nine at UN general headquarters, located in a soccer field in Kigali. The field is surrounded by a UN security battalion, which is surrounded by a battalion of government forces who will soon be attacked by the [word indistinct] forces. We will be in a very dangerous position if the two groups begin fighting there. Even if the fighting is not directed against us, our men may suffer the consequences. We hope, however, that the situation will improve because despite the days of killing and given the problems there, we have not noted any attacks against our own people. Except for the hostility against the Belgian forces, there have not been any problems with the other forces. [end recording]
