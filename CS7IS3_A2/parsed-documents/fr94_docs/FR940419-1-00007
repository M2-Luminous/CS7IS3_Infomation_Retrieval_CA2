Re-examining the System Although the new regulations have resulted in greater independence of corporate credit unions, the leagues and trade associations still wield considerable influence in some institutions. A number of factors have led the Board to consider whether additional steps should be taken to ensure that boards of directors and management of corporate credit unions operate independently of credit union trade associations and represent the interests of the corporate's member credit unions. One important factor is the dramatic increase in the scrutiny of financial institutions by the public, the press, and Congress as a result of the savings and loan disaster. A primary example of this scrutiny is the exhaustive General Accounting Office study of credit unions. This 371-page report was the longest and most detailed of any financial institution sector and was done at a time when the credit union movement was recording record growth, record health, and was experiencing no identifiable problems. This atmosphere of intense scrutiny, while fully understandable, means that measures must be taken to ensure that safety and soundness, and the perception of safety and soundness, are maintained at the highest possible level. Public confidence in the financial system is based, after all, more on public perception than on an intimate knowledge of the workings of the system. The crash of the savings and loan industry and temporary problems at the FDIC have increased public scrutiny and mistrust of the financial services industry. In this atmosphere, it is essential that credit union members and the public be assured that corporate credit union decision makers act only with the interests of the corporate credit union's members in mind. The second factor is a function of credit union growth. The asset level of corporate credit unions is almost as high as that of the entire credit union movement when the CLF was created. The magnitude of the asset growth within the corporate system attracts outside attention and warrants continuous re-examination for possible weaknesses and/or areas of improvement. Third, as previously mentioned, the interrelationships between corporate credit unions and state trade associations have in some cases led to the misuse of corporate credit unions' resources to address budgetary or financial constraints in the trade associations. The NCUA Board is concerned that such conflicts, or even the appearance of conflicts in these areas, may threaten the survival of a strong and independent credit union system. Finally, the recent publicity concerning U.S. Central's foreign investments has focused considerable attention to the corporate credit union system. The Board is concerned that if the system is perceived as having areas of potential conflict, Congress will introduce legislative proposals to address them. As mentioned earlier, the Board has undertaken a study of the corporate credit union system which should allay these concerns if they are unfounded. If changes are needed, however, the Board believes it is preferable to address them by regulation, rather than await Congressional action over which NCUA and credit unions may have little or no control.
