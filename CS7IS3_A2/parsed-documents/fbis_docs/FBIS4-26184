The security forces responded to the 25-year-old former student leader's protest by stepping up their surveillance and further restricting his already limited freedom of movement. Throughout the hunger strike, six plain-clothes and uniformed officers were stationed at the gatehouse of Mr Wang's residential block in Beijing, preventing unauthorised persons from entering and stopping him from leaving. Even after his hunger strike finished at 9 pm on Friday, the police remained in position yesterday to ensure foreign reporters could not get to see Mr Wang. Speaking by telephone, Mr Wang admitted his protest had achieved no positive result and he was at a loss to know what to do next. "I have no plans at the moment. I will have to think about what I can do now," he said. Unless he takes the drastic step of renouncing his commitment to the democracy movement in China and refrains from all political comment there is little chance the security forces will leave him alone. Since his release from nearly four years in jail in February last year, Mr Wang has been under routine police surveillance and forced to leave Beijing on several sensitive political dates and during the visits of high-ranking Western government officials. The strain and the pressure of continual police harassment is beginning to tell. Mr Wang cannot get a job because of his political record and every time he writes a commentary or talks to the foreign media, he is questioned by the police. With the long-running battle over China's Most Favoured Nation trading status now over Mr Wang can no longer count on pressure from the West to help his situation. Just about the only way out would be for Mr Wang to leave China altogether and study abroad but then he runs the risk of not being let back into China. The prospect of becoming a political exile like Han Dongfang or Wang Juntao does not appeal to the young democracy activist who is dedicated to improving human rights in China. Meanwhile, the wife of a man who tried to organise a non- government labour organisation said he had been missing for three weeks and was feared arrested. Police refused to confirm or deny they detained Liu Nianchun, said his wife, Chu Hailan. She said police only told her to "go home and wait for news". Three other men who joined Mr Liu in trying to organise a National Alliance to Protect Labourers' Rights were known to have been arrested. They are Beijing University law professor Yuan Hongbing, Wang Zhongqiu and Zhang Lin. Mr Wang was a student of Professor Yuan, while Mr Zhang was a former student activist during the 1989 democracy movement and later organised workers and peasants in Anhui Province in central China.
