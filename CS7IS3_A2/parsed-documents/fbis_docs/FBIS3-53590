Security Council during talks in Baghdad last week between Jordan's energy and natural resources minister and Iraqi officials, informed sources said. They said Minister Walid 'Asfur held a series of talks starting with Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad and other ministers as well as Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khuddayir. Dr. 'Asfur also met with presidential adviser Ja'far Dhiya' Ja'far, reports from Baghdad said. "During the talks, Iraq agreed to renew the annual agreement on oil supplies to Jordan and the accord could be formalised soon," said one source. No details of the agreement were immediately available; nor was it known whether it differed much from the 1993 accord. Under a tacit exemption granted by the U.N. Security Council, which imposed a sweeping international embargo against Iraq following Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iraq is allowed to export oil to Jordan. Jordan gets an average of 50,000 barrels of crude oil and 20,000 barrels of fuel oil from Iraq trucked overland daily to the Kingdom's refinery in al-Zarqa'. No cash is changing hands in the deal since the oil is supplied partly free and partly in settlement of Iraqi debts to Jordan. The sources said the main purpose of Mr. 'Asfur's visit to Baghdad, where he arrived Wednesday, was to renew the oil agreeent and that he also held general discussions on Jordanian-Iraqi ties and prospects of cooperation after the expected lifting of sanctions. "The (Iraqi) government is highly hopeful that the sanctions could be lifted before April, although U.N. officials have said that it could not be done before June," said a diplomatic source. According to the source, the Iraqi government, which accepted long-term monitoring of its weapons programme late last year after a protracted stand-off with the U.N., was focusing on the work of U.N. inspectors in Iraq with a view to getting a clean certificate from them before March. "Iraqi officials have been holding extensive discussions with representatives of major international oil companies on post-sanctions cooperation," said a highly-informed diplomat. "These included American as well European, particularly French and Italian firms." Also expected to be raised during Dr. 'Asfur's visit to Baghdad was Jordanian concern over the impact of the reopening of Iraq's Umm Qasr Port on the flow of Iraq-bound cargo through al-'Aqabah. In talks in Amman in late November, Iraqi officials assured Jordan that the flow of Iraqi imports, which has dwindled to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels, would continue and that Umm Qasr, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf, would be used to accommodate small freighters with cargo from the far east. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to maintain the international embargo against Iraq. The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported late Saturday that Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement in which they agreed to cooperate in 'all key oil industries, including excavating and digging." The agreement covers bilateral cooperation in all the sectors of the oil industry, including drilling and exploration, along with Iraqi technical assistance for the Jordanian oil industry and training for Jordanian oil workers, INA said.
