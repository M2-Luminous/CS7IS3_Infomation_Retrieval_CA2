FR940826-2-00085 FR940826-2-00055 1. Misuse of Nonpublic Information Section V.A seeks to prevent the potential for harm to competition that might arise as a result of (1) AT&T gaining access to nonpublic information of a competitor that is a supplier to McCaw or (2) McCaw gaining access to nonpublic information of a competitor that is a customer of AT&T. The details of procedures adopted by AT&T and McCaw to implement the provisions of Section V.A will be set forth in Nonpublic Information and Structural Separation implementation plans to be filed for approval by the United States pursuant to Section VII.A. of the judgment. As one safeguard against improper disclosure of confidential information, Section V.A.4.a requires AT&T to establish separate Marketing Account Teams to serve (1) McCaw and other AT&T affiliates and (2) unaffiliated wireless infrastructure equipment customers. These Marketing Account Teams, as specified in Section II.R, will be responsible for selling and related services in connection with selling telecommunications equipment, including customer relationship management, sales, pricing, presentation of bids, basic technical and engineering advice, order processing and management, and project management. The United States understands that most of the interaction the AT&T Network Wireless Infrastructure Equipment Unit will have with customers will be by the Marketing Account Teams. The responsibilities of Marketing Account Teams will be specified in the Structural Separation implementation plan. In order to assure effective separation, that plan will provide procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic information in the event that members of Marketing Account Teams serving Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure Equipment Customers (defined in Section II.AC as customers that are neither affiliates of AT&T or McCaw nor McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems) are assigned to any AT&T or McCaw business that either provides telecommunications equipment to AT&T, McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, or that provides or plans for any AT&T or McCaw wireless service. Section V.A.4.b takes steps to assure that nonpublic information of Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure equipment customers is not misused by AT&T as a result of any proprietary development work it performs for equipment customers. Section II.Y defines Proprietary Development as the development of products, features or functions for cellular infrastructure equipment that is not intended to be made available to more than one customer or its affiliates. Section V.A.4.b contemplates the formation of Development Teams to conduct Proprietary Development, and requires AT&T develop procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic information in the event that members of Development Teams that do such Proprietary Development for unaffiliated customers perform Proprietary Development for McCaw or for any AT&T telecommunications service. The principal goal of this provision is to assure that AT&T Development Teams that obtain nonpublic information about the business, plans or technology of an unaffiliated equipment customer in the course of performing Proprietary Development work for that customer do not use that information to the benefit of the telecommunications businesses of AT&T or McCaw. The provisions of Section V.A are intended to prevent the inappropriate disclosure and use of Nonpublic Information obtained by AT&T or McCaw from unaffiliated equipment customers or suppliers. Section II.X contains a definition of Nonpublic Information. That definition identifies or includes various categories of information which, if inappropriately disclosed or used, could cause competitive harm. The most sensitive categories of such information are specified in Section II.X.2(a). Information enumerated in that subsection may not be disclosed even with the consent of the supplier of the information. 10 An unaffiliated customer or supplier may designate in writing as proprietary other documentary information (or, in the case of oral, visual or other information, contemporaneously with the disclosure), and such information will be treated as Nonpublic Information. Information that was provided to AT&T or McCaw prior to entry of the proposed Final Judgment may be designated as such by the supplier of the information within 180 days after entry of the judgment, in which case it will be subject to the same protections as other Nonpublic Information. The definition of Nonpublic Information in Section II.X excludes various categories of information obtained by AT&T by means other than a breach of duty to its customers, as well as information that is over six years old. In addition, an unaffiliated customer or supplier may waive any or all of the protections against the disclosure of Nonpublic Information, except for the categories specified in Section II.X.2(a). This exception is intended to guard against the use of such information for coordination among competitors. 10 This includes information containing costs, profits, or profit margins; plans for development of new products, services or technologies; customer names; pricing policies, prices, price schedules, or terms; number of subscribers, sales, churn rates, or other output measures; capacity measures; features and capabilities; technology plans or status of implementation; marketing plans; costs of or prices paid for infrastructure equipment or other inputs including price credits, or adjustments for a cellular carrier's used equipment; plans for expansion; amounts of capital investment; or quantities and types of equipment used by a wireless carrier or sold by a wireless infrastructure equipment supplier. Section V.A.1.a provides that AT&T shall not allow Nonpublic Information of its Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure Equipment Customers to be disclosed for any reason to (i) McCaw or any of its directors, officers or employees; (ii) any McCaw Minority Owned Wireless System (except for information relating specifically to such a system); (iii) any person engaged in marketing any McCaw service or any AT&T telecommunications service; (iv) any person employed by a Marketing Account Team responsible for marketing to AT&T, McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System; or (v) any person performing Proprietary Development for AT&T, McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems. Likewise, AT&T is barred by Section V.A.1.b from disclosing any Nonpublic Information relating to the provision of any wireless service by McCaw or AT&T that it obtains by reason of being an equipment supplier to McCaw to any unaffiliated equipment customer. Under Section V.A.1.c, if certain senior officers of AT&T obtain any such Nonpublic Information, they may not disclose it to other persons identified in Section V.A.1.a.
