FR940728-0-00053 FR940728-0-00019 F. Recovered Oil and Recovered Oil Systems Today's rule deals primarily with the status under RCRA Subtitle C of recovered oil which is returned to the petroleum refining process. ``Recovered oil'' is a generic term that applies to secondary materials consisting primarily of oil such as oil separator skimmings from plant wastewaters, slop oil and emulsions, oil skimmed from ballast water tanks, and oil from refinery process units ( e.g., off-specification process streams). As explained in detail below, today's rule excludes from the definition of solid waste recovered oil from petroleum exploration and production, petroleum refining, and transportation incident to either of these activities, when the recovered oil is reinserted into a petroleum refining process. The exclusion does not apply to recovered oil generated from petroleum operations downstream of refining such as marketing or retail sales_because this oil is already excluded for the most part, as discussed below _, or from non-petroleum industry operations. This rule also does not exclude hazardous sludges (such as wastes K048, K051, or F037) or other similar wastes from regulation. Distinguishing between these wastes and recovered oil is sometimes difficult. Factors EPA will consider in making this distinction include water content, solids content, and potentially, metals content. See generally 50 FR at 49170 n. 16 (Nov. 29, 1985). EPA repeats, however, that the salient characteristic of recovered oil is the obvious one: that it consist primarily of oil. Used oil also is not a type of recovered oil, and hence remains subject to the applicable regulations for used oil. See generally 59 FR 10550 (March 4, 1994). The only exception is when de minimis quantities of used oil are incidentally captured by refinery wastewater treatment systems. This could occur, for example, when small leaks, spills, or drippings of used oil from machinery, pumps, or other refinery equipment during normal operations are lost to the wastewater treatment system. In these instances, the used oil present in de minimis quantities in wastewater is not subject to the used oil standards. See generally 57 FR at 41566 (Sept. 10, 1992). The objective of a recovered oil system is to gather and recycle oil generated throughout the refinery, or (to a lesser extent) generated from off-site sources. 4 Recovered oil operations almost always occur in tanks, usually a series of tanks that successively purify the oil to the point where it is sufficiently clean and dewatered to be inserted into the petroleum refining process. 53 FR at 525. Some oil is collected directly from process units and sent by means of pipes or vacuum trucks to the refinery's dedicated oil tanks. Occasionally this recovered oil is of sufficient purity that it can be inserted directly into the refining process with little or no treatment in the recovered oil system. 4 See RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;87&hyph;SWRP&hyph;FFFFF, submission by the American Petroleum Institute on ``Recovered Refinery Oil System'', April 16, 1993. Recovered oil from plant wastewater operations is most often a water-in-oil emulsion, which is sent first to tanks where gravity separates much of it into oil, emulsion, and water layers. The intermediate layer of emulsions then may be sent to other tanks where it will undergo further emulsion-breaking treatment ( e.g., mechanical centrifuging, heating, or chemical additives). At the end of each stage, the separated water is returned to the refinery oil/water separators, while the oil is either further treated or, if sufficiently dewatered, is returned to one or more refinery process units. These may include crude oil distillation or catalytic cracking units. 5 5 Id. G. Status of Wastewater Streams, Wastewater Treatment Units, Recovered Oil, and Recovered Oil Systems Under Current RCRA Rules Under present RCRA regulations, petroleum refinery wastewaters upstream of a wastewater discharge that is subject to regulation under Sections 307(b) or 402 of the Clean Water Act, are solid wastes. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(1) and (2). Such petroleum refinery wastewaters are hazardous if they exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, or are listed hazardous wastes (although there are presently no specific hazardous waste listings for petroleum refining industry wastewaters). Petroleum refining wastewater storage and treatment operations generate a number of listed hazardous wastes. In particular, sludges from primary treatment operations are listed under the generic F037 and F038 listings. Sludges from Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) wastewater treatment units and API separators (particular types of primary wastewater treatment devices) are listed as wastes K048 and K051, respectively. Slop oil systems generate listed wastes as well: slop oil emulsion solids are listed as K049. Also, EPA is studying additional petroleum refining wastes as part of a listing determination required by RCRA 3001 (e)(2). In addition, petroleum refineries typically generate large volumes of wastes that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics. Individual wastewater streams upstream of wastewater treatment may exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic, particularly for chromium, lead and benzene (see 40 CFR 261.24), or the characteristics of corrosivity or ignitability (40 CFR 261.21 and 261.22, respectively). These wastewaters may also contain other hazardous constituents that are not part of the Toxicity Characteristic. See Tables in Section V, Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category. Sludges generated from secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment also may exhibit one or more hazardous waste characteristics. Tanks storing listed wastes which engage in primary wastewater treatment operations are presently exempt from federal Subtitle C regulation because they are wastewater treatment units ( i.e. tanks). 40 CFR 264.1 (g)(6) and 265.1 (c)(10). Hazardous wastes removed from those units are subject to regulation upon exiting the tanks. However, recovered oil is exempt from Subtitle C regulation, as is any fuel produced from such oil, under the current exemptions at ยง261.6 (a)(3)(iv)&hyph;(vii). The units engaged in recovered oil operations would also be exempt under current regulations, to the extent that these units are managing materials exempt under ยง261.6 (a)(3)(iv)&hyph;(vi).
