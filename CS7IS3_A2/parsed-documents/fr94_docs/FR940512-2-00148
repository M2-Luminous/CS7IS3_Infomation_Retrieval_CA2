FR940512-2-00148 FR940512-2-00069 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34019; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;49] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Bond Listing Standards May 5, 1994. I. Introduction On December 22, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to revise its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities. On April 1, 1994, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify its interpretation of certain provisions of the original filing. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33531 (January 27, 1994), 59 FR 4960 (February 2, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis. II. Description of the Proposal Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual set forth the current standards for listing debt securities of domestic and foreign issuers, respectively, on that Exchange. Under either paragraph, the NYSE uses the following minimum criteria to determine whether a debt security is eligible to be listed: The bond issue must have an aggregate market value or principal amount of $5 million; the anticipated distribution must be ``sufficient for trading on the Exchange''; and the company must be in a position to cover interest charges on all debts issued by it for a subsidiary. In this regard, the NYSE deems interest coverage to be inadequate if the interest charges on all debt issued by the company, its parent or a subsidiary exceed earnings, before or after taxes, as reported in a filing to the Commission. 3 Finally, Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 allow the Exchange to list convertible debt only if the underlying common stock also is listed on the NYSE. 3 See Paragraph 802.00 of the Listed Company Manual. The delisting standards for debt securities are set forth in paragraphs 801.00 and 802.00 of the Listed Company Manual. The NYSE normally gives consideration to delisting a bond issue if the aggregate market value or principal amount falls below $1 million, or if the company's interest coverage is deemed to be inadequate. 4 The NYSE also can review the continued listing of a debt security pursuant to certain other criteria in paragraph 802.00 ( e.g., ``authoritative advice received that security is without value,'' ``inability to meet current debt obligations or to adequately finance operations''). In terms of convertible bonds, paragraph 801.00 states that it is the NYSE's customary policy to delist a convertible security if the related common stock is delisted. 4 See supra, note 4 and accompanying text. The NYSE proposes to simplify and relax its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities, in order to make the Exchange's trading and disclosure systems more accessible to bond issuers. Specifically, the proposed amendments to paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 will eliminate the requirement that the Exchange evaluate the anticipated distribution of a bond issue, 5 and will replace the current definition of adequate interest coverage with a new standard based on issuer or bond rating status. 6 In addition, the NYSE proposal will permit the Exchange to list convertible debt whenever the underlying equity security is subject to real-time sale reporting in the United States. 7 Only the requirement that the bond issues have an aggregate market value or principal amount of no less than $5 million will remain unchanged. 5 The proposed rule change also will delete a reference to the distribution requirement from paragraph 703.06 of the Listed Company Manual, which governs the procedures an issuer must follow to list its debt securities on the NYSE. 6 See infra, notes 9&hyph;13 and accompanying text. 7 Amendment No. 1, supra note 3, clarifies that, for both domestic and foreign issuers, the underlying equity security must be subject to real-time reporting in the United States.
