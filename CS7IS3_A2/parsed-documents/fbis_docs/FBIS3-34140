Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that an uproar broke out when Eytan attacked the members of one of the Tzomet branches and the news correspondents at the convention. Eytan wanted to present documents proving that there had been irregularities at Tzomet's Bat Yam branch. The news correspondents rushed to interview the Bat Yam branch members, and Eytan remarked: Look at them pouncing on the corpses. Eytan told the Bat Yam branch members that this was what they would look like tomorrow.
