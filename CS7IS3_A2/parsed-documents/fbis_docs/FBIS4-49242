Chinese sources said the executive vice-premier ordered regional officials to be personally accountable for price control. Failure to rein in the runaway inflation will weaken the political position of Mr. Zhu, who is betting his political fate on dealing with the boom-bust economy, analysts say. At a recent emergency national telecommunication conference, Mr. Zhu warned provincial party chiefs and government heads to spare no effort to combat inflation, saying they were gambling with their future. "The inflation rate should be contained to below 12 per cent in the second quarter of the year, and under no circumstance is it allowed to rise to 15 per cent in that period," he was quoted as saying. In the first quarter of the year, China reported an inflation rate of 20 per cent. Mr. Zhu, who was acting premier at the conference, warned that if inflation was not immediately checked in the first half of the year, the national goal to rein in annual inflation at under 10 per cent would fail. The government has set a 9 per cent growth rate while containing inflation at 10 per cent in a bid to cool down the overheating economy. "I would step down if the economic problems cannot be solved," Mr. Zhu said recently. Chinese economists and analysts said the political future of the fast-rising star was tied with his ability to deal with the boom-bust economy. "Inflation should fall to around 10 per cent this year and 6 per cent next year," Mr. Zhu said in March. To bring the annual rate below 10 per cent, the Chinese government must keep the combined figure of the coming three quarters at a quarterly percentage of not more than 6.67 per cent. Chinese economic sources said Mr. Zhu blamed the runaway inflation on local officials who were scrambling for more investment in an apparent defiance of Beijing's repeated warnings. In an unprecedented move "to kill one to warn a hundred", Mr. Zhu last month fired a provincial party chief for failing to toe Beijing's line on economics. In his six-day tour to the northeastern province of Heilongjiang two weeks ago, Mr. Zhu announced a central order to strip Sun Weiben, the party secretary of the provincial Communist Party committee and head of local legislature, of all official positions. In the meeting, Mr. Zhu said regional top officials should give the price control top priority in their agenda. Meanwhile, Mr. Zhu has called for stricter control of grain prices and urged the booming coastal regions not to neglect agriculture, according to press reports. In a speech carried on the front page of major Chinese newspapers, he observed that rationalisation of grain prices was essential to the establishment of a stable grain purchasing and selling mechanism.
