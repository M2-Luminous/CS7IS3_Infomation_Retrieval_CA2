He reported that "issues of economic cooperation were also in the focus of attention at today's talks in Bonn". Under conditions of a complicated transition period Russia is presently going trough, it is difficult to avoid certain decline in economic ties. "Moreover, most far-sighted economic partners do not scale down their activity despite the temporary difficulties confronting Russia. I am confident that we will manage to overcome them", the president stressed. "During the talks, we agreed to pay most attention to such fields of cooperation as power engineering, machine-building, conversion, support of small and medium-sized business, especially in the production sphere. We suggested using such effective instrument of economic relations as non-interest bearing commercial credit, or the so-called `swing'", Yeltsin said, adding that "the discussion of trade and economic relations between Russia and Germany will be continued on the second day of his visit".
