In an interview with AL-AHRAM that will be published tomorrow, Friday, Dr. Sidqi affirmed that the president is keen to observe the strategic factor in the development of Sinai. He noted that, over the next few days, the president will meet with the executive leadership to discuss the possible impact of the GATT agreement on the Egyptian economy. The prime minister affirmed that the government will intensify its administrative reform efforts in the coming years. He explained that this reform means that negligent persons and those who cause a drop in production will be deprived of incentives. Sidqi said that the state will make an effort to decide annual wage increases to cope with inflation, although its rates dropped to 9.4 percent last December. He explained that wage increases will be stipulated in a law that will be issued in mid- or late June, when the state budget is prepared. Sidqi affirmed that opening the economy makes it easier to exchange products. He said that imports are necessary to export the surplus in Egyptian products. He explained that the customs tariffs were decreased to be in line with world policies. The prime minister affirmed that the state does not overlook corruption. Every single case of corruption is reported and followed up, regardless of the status of those involved in it, he stressed. Touching on the issue of unemployment, the prime minister said that the only solution is to expand production to provide job opportunities. He noted that the private sector offers increasing job opportunities for youth. Responding to a question on government extravagance, Sidqi told AL-AHRAM that spending is conducted within the limits of the ministries' tasks and functions and the heavy burden the state shoulders in the services sector. Commenting on the terrorism phenomenon, Sidqi said that the government is serious about its quest to obliterate this phenomenon and that it has allocated large funds for the development of shanty towns. Irrefutable evidence recently proved that the terrorists have connections with foreign elements, he said. He emphasized that dialogue does not work against terrorism committed by persons with criminal inclinations who are incited by local or foreign elements. I have to protect society against anyone who carries a machine gun or a pistol, he said.
