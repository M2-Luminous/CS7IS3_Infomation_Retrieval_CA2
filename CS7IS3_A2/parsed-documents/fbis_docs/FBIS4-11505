FBIS4-11505 "drlat082_s_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Uruguay FA Leader Quits, To Form `Independent' Movement FA Leader Quits, To Form `Independent' Movement PY2704034294 Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 21 Apr 94 p 6 PY2704034294 Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO Spanish BFN [Text] Senator Danilo Astori has placed his position as provisional head of the Broad Front (FA) at the disposal of his FA executive board colleagues because it is his understanding that this post must be occupied by a consensus FA candidate. Mariano Arana, Montevideo mayoral candidate, will occupy Astori's post. Astori himself told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that on 19 May he would launch an "independent" movement that would not involve a restoration of Communist Party factions. The senator explained that his decision was based on "two reasons" closely linked to his decision to head an independent politico-electoral alternative within the FA. Astori emphasized: "I am no longer a consensus candidate." He added that in his opinion "consensus candidates must be included in the coalition's executive board during the current (electoral) stage." Participants in yesterday's FA provisional executive board meeting told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that Astori expressed his willingness to continue working on common FA tasks for the November elections. The other 11 FA executive board members "lauded the political tactfulness" of the former FA vice presidential candidate, and pointed out that they would contact their sectors to formally come to a decision on Astori's proposal. Astori announced that he would launch on 19 May at the El Galpon theater an "independent FA" group, which he will head. During the launching ceremony he will present an initial "proposals document" that "will explain the characteristics of this political project." The legislator explained: "It is not a restoration of Communist Party factions. It is not a coming together of groups, nor is it meant as a way to exclude people. It is much more than that. It is a long-term and absolutely pluralistic and open project for the FA independents, regardless of their origin."
