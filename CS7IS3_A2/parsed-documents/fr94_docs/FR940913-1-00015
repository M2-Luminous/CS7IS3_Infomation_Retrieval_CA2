FR940913-1-00015 FR940913-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of a certain main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil level and, if necessary, replacement of the clutch assembly. The current AD also requires replacement of the clutch assembly at certain time-in-service intervals. This action would require the same inspections and replacements as required by the current AD, but would provide an additional approved replacement part number and provide a reference to three additional manufacturer service documents. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Comments must be received by October 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation, Twin County Airport, P.O. Box 490, Menominee, Michigan 49858. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas.

The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Discussion On January 23, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989), to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain main rotor transmission clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, and improper oil levels. AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 also requires replacement of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) when unairworthy, and establishes a 1,200 hours time-in-service retirement life on the clutch assembly. That action was prompted by several failures of the clutch assembly. Based on an analysis of the clutch assembly failure data, the FAA, in conjunction with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation and Formsprag, the clutch assembly manufacturer, determined that the clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through &hyph;7), could not be safely overhauled and returned to service. The FAA has determined that premature failure of the clutch assembly due to a loss of lubricant creates an unsafe condition. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved the use of clutch assembly, part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), in addition to the earlier clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) as replacement clutch assemblies. Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0069, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990, that contains an overhaul time interval for clutch assemblies, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) and P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10). Also, AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 referenced neither Enstrom Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978, pertaining to checking the run-out of the main rotor pinion shaft nor Enstrom SDB No. 0068, dated May 8, 1986, subsequently reissued July 9, 1990, pertaining to the retirement life of the clutch assembly. Finally, a note contained in AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 incorrectly referenced SIL ``0038A''; the reference should have been SIL ``No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980.''
