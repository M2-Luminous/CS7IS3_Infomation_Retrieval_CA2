Afanasyev under the rubric "Topical Theme": "Would Be Glad To Serve..."] [Text] The experience of domestic and foreign military reforms shows that when they are implemented, the central issue was and remains the professional training of military cadres. The current military reform, in the course of which the foundations are being laid and the prospects defined for the development of the new Russian armed forces, is no exception. A study of the readiness of officers who are graduates of military academies for professional activity is of particular interest in this regard. This interest is explained by the fact that tomorrow, serving in official positions, they will largely determine the state of the army, its image and the level of training. The changes in all spheres of the life of society are having an objective influence on the consciousness of citizens, including officers. The nature and results of this influence were of interest to a group of research sociologists of the Academy of Humanities, who conducted a poll of the enrolled personnel in the final-year courses at the VVA [Military Aviation Academy] imeni Yu.A. Gagarin and the VVIA [Military Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy in 1992. Some 211 people were selected under a quantitively regulated sample to provide sufficient representativeness. The results of the poll established that most of the respondents were guided in the choice of the profession of officer first and foremost by socially significant motives (Fig. 1). Some 81.8 percent of those polled, in evaluating the usefulness of the labor of an officer compared with other types of activity, noted its high or very high significance. These data provide grounds to suppose that the greater portion of the respondents were guided in their choice of profession by moral incentives, and the prestige of the profession of officer in society played a substantial role in the formation of the professional-military thrust of their choice. Fig. 1. Reasons for the choice of the profession of Most of the graduates have a high regard for their labor as before. The difficult processes in the life of society, however, are more and more adjusting the social portrait of the graduate of the military academy. Significant changes in the system of value orientations are being observed in the environment of the servicemen as well. These polls show that more than half of the officer graduates today place tranquil service conditions, low tension, high earnings and sufficient time for relaxation in first place when evaluating their service activity (Fig. 2). A tendency for the displacement of values orientations from socially to personally significant is clearly pronounced. It became clearly in the polling that most of the respondents consider the receipt of high earnings to be the most important thing for themselves. The officer--the representative and expressor of state and social interests--thus has personal rather than social values in the forefront. Fig. 2. Choice of values in service activity The process of further cutbacks in the size of the army and the uncertainty of the future is having a negative effect on the mood of academy graduates. Some 80.41 percent of the respondents have a pessimistic assessment of their prospects, and only 18.92 percent are optimistic about the opportunities to continue their service. The problem of the drop in prestige of officer service in society also cannot pass unmentioned. The opinions of the graduates are quite well-founded, and reflect that picture (87.4 percent had a negative answer to the question of the prestige of the service). A dilemma faces the graduates of military academies, and many officers in general--to continue to serve or to resign into the reserves? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Your attitude toward the |number of replies |percentage | |alternatives--continue t-| | | |o serve or be discharged:| | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I intend to be discharge-|12 |5.6 | |d in the near future | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |the desire to be dischar-|34 |16.1 | |ged arises only once in | | | |a while | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I would be discharged, b-|14 |6.5 | |ut I am afraid of not fi-| | | |nding work | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I would be discharged, b-|27 |12.7 | |ut I do not have enough | | | |time served for a pension| | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I will be discharged as |35 |16.6 | |soon as I obtain suitabl-| | | |e housing | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I do not yet intend to b-|81 |38.8 | |e discharged | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I do not even permit mys-|6 |2.8 | |elf to think about being | | | |discharged | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |other variations |2 |0.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TOTAL |211 |100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows the attitude of Air Forces academy officer graduates toward this problem. Just 2.8 percent expressed a firm desire to serve. Uncertainty in the responses was typical--54.9 percent of those polled had a difficult time giving a clear-cut answer, which is most likely explained by the lack of clear prospects and the situation in the country. The vividly pronounced readiness of most of the attendees to be discharged from the army cannot help but cause alarm. Many (35.8 percent) are being held back from that step only for reasons of a socio-economic nature--the lack of housing, not enough time served, the fear of not finding work. This fact cannot help but make one wonder about the qualitative composition of the future command personnel of the Air Forces. One can hardly hope that an officer who is inwardly ready for early discharge, and wishes for it, will perform the duties entrusted to him by the state and society in a creative manner and with good return. The desire of graduates to be discharged into the reserves was verified during the questioning with the aid of a control poll. Data were obtained in that that make it possible to conclude that more than 40 percent of them do not wish to serve. The main reason determining the desire to be discharged is the lack of social protections and dissatisfaction with material status--38.8 of those polled. Another 33.6 percent explain their decision by the decline in prestige of military service, 11.21 percent by its lack of prospects, and 7.76 percent by negative phenomena in the army and society. Study of the readiness of graduates of Air Forces academies for service has confirmed that one of the main components of this concept, complex in composition, is the military-professional thrust of the officer. It is expressed in the high significance of military affairs for him and the military specialty he has selected, as well as in the level and pattern of his official aspirations. All changes in this thrust most naturally have an effect on the state of professional readiness. The data cited make it possible to conclude that a reduction in military-professional thrust is being observed in some of the graduates of Air Forces academies. The negative consequences of this process are obvious. The principal contradictions, among those affecting the formulation of the professional readiness of the officer, are manifested between the constantly increasing demands on the officer corps and the not clearly expressed desire to conform to them; the need to protect the Fatherland and the low social status of the officer in society and lack of social protections; and, the desire to improve knowledge and skills and the presence of various types of regimentation. Sociological analysis makes it possible to determine the areas of work that will be able to provide for the resolution of these discrepancies in the future, and to formulate some recommendations. It seems expedient, then, to alter the system of selection both for all types of military-training institutions (including the military academies) and for assignment to positions. The principal criteria should become the level of military-professional thrust, the individual capabilities and features, the overall development of the intellect and the level of specialization attained. This would make it possible, with the scientifically substantiated organization of selection, to avoid subjectivism in the resolution of personnel issues and to eliminate protectionism. We do not yet have at our disposal reliable, comprehensive techniques that would make it possible to accomplish these tasks. But they do not exist only because they have not yet been in demand. The combined efforts of various specialists, with the corresponding social demand, will provide an opportunity to develop the necessary techniques in a relatively short time. It would be expedient, on an organizational plane, to individualize the process of professional training for the officer, with the aim of making fuller use of individual capabilities, abilities and characteristics. The content of training should be as close as possible to the practices of military activity; this requires, on the one hand, an optimization of existing forms and methods of training and, on the other, substantial changes in the theoretical and practical training of instructors. A modern physical plant and the development of a system of incentives, along with changes in the methodological support for the teaching process, deserve particular attention. The solution of the problems of social and legal protections for officers (and all servicemen!) and their provision with acceptable material conditions seems very important. If the state needs today's military professionals, it should provide full-fledged solutions to these problems. Otherwise, the outflow of more than the worst personnel from the army in the very near future will lead objectively to a clear reduction in the level of professional readiness of the officers, which could call into question not only the practice of military reform, but even the very idea of it. It seems obvious that the comprehensive realization of the above recommendations is an essential condition of their utilization for the attainment of positive results. That is because incomplete work or omissions in any of the three areas noted will make it impossible to achieve the desired effectiveness in the training of cadres for the new Russian Army. From the Editors. The sociological research whose data have been employed by the author was conducted in the summer of 1992. The economic situation and the problems connected with it have scarcely become less acute since that time. Military reform, however, is proceeding. Thanks to the adoption of a series of legislation, and first and foremost the Law on the Status of Servicemen and the Law on Pension Support for Servicemen, the situation has obviously changed. We will acquaint the readers in coming features with how the mood of Air Forces cadres is changing in the course of military reform, and how the greater social and legal certainty of the status of the officer in society is affecting them.
