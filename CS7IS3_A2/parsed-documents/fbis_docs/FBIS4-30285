Korean Authorities Must Not Interfere in Third- Round DPRK-U.S. Talks, DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today answered a question put by KCNA about the outcries of Japan and the South Korean authorities that the question of the "special inspection" of DPRK's military sites must be resolved at the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks. He said: As has been reported, the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks will be held in Geneva in the first week of July. It is expected that the outstanding questions between the DPRK and the United States including the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the relations between the two countries will be solved in this round of talks in a package deal. Japan and the South Korean authorities, however, are trying to force a "special inspection" on military sites of the DPRK, claiming that the "nuclear suspicion" against it must be clarified at the talks and it must "accept a full inspection." A sinister aim is lurking behind this fuss impudently raised by Japan and the South Korean authorities that are not parties to the talks. Japan and the South Korean authorities, that did not want a progress at the DPRK-USA talks and a fair solution to the "nuclear issue" from the beginning, are now hurriedly running about to put a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-USA talks, unable to conceal their perplexity and irritation, as it has become certain that the talks will be resumed. Judging from this, it is clear that the ulterior intention of Japan and the South Korean authorities in trying to impose inspection of military sites on the DPRK under the pretext of its "nuclear suspicion" is to lay hurdles in the way of the hard-won third round of DPRK-USA talks and the settlement of the "nuclear issue" and find an excuse for promoting and justifying their own nuclear armament. Japan and the South Korean authorities are alleging that the DPRK is keeping something in concealment. But we have no nuclear weapon and feel no need to manufacture them. As for the "suspected nuclear program" of the DPRK over which some forces are making much ado, it is a problem that will naturally be resolved when DPRK-USA talks proceed successfully and confidence is built between the DPRK and the USA. Therefore, there is no need for Japan and the South Korean authorities to trouble themselves about this. If some forces, urged by a sinister intention, try to impose inspection of military sites, which means an infringement on the sovereignty of the DPRK, it will not be beneficial to them, either, and will produce grave consequences.
