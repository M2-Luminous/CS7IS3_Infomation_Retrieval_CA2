"Any advice and instruction might result in grave consequences. Ukraine, according to its Constitution, is an integral state, and we hope that it will resolve the problems, which have cropped up through peaceful negotiations. We are not indifferent to how the situation develops in our neighbouring state with whom we maintain cordial relations," the Moldavian head of state said. According to Mircea Snegur, the events in Ukraine belong to the category of those which are caused by seperatism. Seperatist tendencies should be condemned, since they do not lead to anything good. Conflicting situations in the former Soviet Union and in the whole world testify to this fact. I condemn seperatism as a phenomenon," the Moldavian leader emphasised. The Moldavian president expressed the hope that forces capable of regulating problems in the Crimea would be found. According to him, these problems "are a result of the populistic activities of certain politicians, who are unwarrantedly claiming too much."
