FR941110-0-00177 FR941110-0-00016 Commenters further suggested that the directed plans of correction must be developed by qualified health care professionals in consultation with the State survey agency. Response: We are rejecting this suggestion for several reasons. Mandating a directed PoC for certain deficiencies would limit HCFA or the State's choice of remedies and would run counter to the thrust of the Act which encourages the flexible application of enforcement options. Also, requiring a remedy for specific deficiencies would be inconsistent with the requirements associated with other remedies. We also do not want to prescribe in regulations which staff people must develop the directed PoC, but opt to give HCFA or State the flexibility to decide who will carry out this function. We expect that the State survey agency would develop the directed PoC, but the State would be responsible for officially notifying the facility of the remedy. However, in manual instructions, we will provide guidance in this regard by including examples of deficiency situations and corresponding directed PoCs which are appropriate in terms of content and the staff person responsible for development. Comment: One commenter urged HCFA to require that directed PoCs include specific corrective action to protect individual residents who suffered harm when those residents are clearly identifiable. Another commenter wanted the rule amended to provide that all PoCs are to make an injured resident or residents ``whole,'' whenever possible, and that the facility be required to take specific steps to ensure future compliance. The commenters offered, as an example, a facility which improperly denies a resident his or her bed hold rights. The commenters believed that in this example the directed PoC must require that the facility honor the resident's statutory right to return to the next available bed. Commenters feared that without such a requirement, the directed PoC will be nothing more than a facility's promise not to do it again. Response: Requiring in regulation that a facility make a resident whole whenever a resident has been injured or has been deprived of his or her rights would be virtually impossible. In many instances where irreparable harm has occurred this would be an unattainable goal. Although HCFA and the State survey agency consider the unique circumstances of a facility and the results on residents when developing a directed PoC, any PoC is based on prospective compliance. The principle behind a PoC is to ensure that the underlying cause of cited deficiencies does not recur. The purpose of the PoC is not, however, a checklist of past violations which must retroactively be corrected. In the example cited, if a facility denied a resident a bed through improper application of a bed hold policy, the resident would probably have to be admitted to another facility. Prescribing in the directed PoC that the resident would be eligible to be readmitted to the facility when the next bed became available would be pointless since he or she, being unable to wait, would probably already be placed in another home. We have not accepted this comment to mandate that the directed PoC include resident specific reparations. Comment: One commenter recommended the use of a directed PoC for substandard quality of care findings with a scope of 3 or 4 and for repeat substandard quality of care findings at a scope of 1 or 2 and for all other repeated violations. Response: We are not accepting this suggestion. Based on numerous public comments, we have reconfigured the scope and severity grid without numerical values, and are offering it in this preamble as one example of how a State could determine what remedies to impose in noncompliant facilities. Additionally, we have developed recommended categories of remedies for ranges of deficiencies. The directed PoC is a remedy which can be used for any deficiency and may be the only remedy used for lower level deficiencies. We do not intend to require a directed PoC for substandard quality of care findings but rather leave that option to the enforcing entity. Nor do we mandate the use of directed PoCs for repeat deficiencies. The law provides for denial of payment, State monitoring, and increased civil money penalties in certain cases of repeated noncompliance and those are the only enforcement actions related to repeat deficiencies that we have required in these regulations. Section 488.425‚ê£Directed In-Service Training On the basis of our review of issues raised by commenters and our reevaluation of our statutory authority, we are including in the final rule a provision for the imposition of a directed inservice training program. After several years of experience with implementing the OBRA '87 provisions, we have come to a greater realization that some compliance problems are a result of imperfect knowledge on the part of the health services staff relative to state-of-art practices and resident outcome expectations. For example, we know that incontinence and decubitus ulcers are not an inevitable result of old age and immobility. The incidence and/or prevalence of these conditions in a particular long-term care facility may be the result of general lack of knowledge about the prevention and treatment of these conditions, and a lasting change may be produced in that facility by a directed inservice training program. We also believe that a directed inservice training program may be particularly effective in reducing reliance on chemical restraints. Two studies have been instructional on this point. The first, entitled ``A Randomized Trial of a Program to Reduce the Use of Psychoactive Drugs in Nursing Homes'' by Dr. Jerry Avorn and colleagues ( New England Journal of Medicine; Vol. 327 No. 3; July 16, 1992, pages 168&hyph;173), demonstrates that a fairly intensive training program for the medical, as well as, all three shifts of the nursing staff (including aides) can bring a dramatic reduction in the use of psychoactive drugs without adversely affecting the overall behavior and level of functioning of the residents. Another study was entitled, ``Reducing Antipsychotic Drug Use in Nursing Homes: A Controlled Trial of Provider Education,'' by Dr. Wayne Ray and colleagues at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine published in the Archives of Internal Medicine; Vol. 153; March 22, 1993, pages 713&hyph;721. This study applied a formalized training program to teach nursing personnel how to manage the most prevalent behavioral symptoms experienced by aged individuals in nursing homes. Common behavioral symptoms such as catastrophic reaction, yelling and screaming, fighting, wandering, etc. are addressed in this study, and non-drug interventions are described. The training program led to a 59 percent reduction in the use of antipsychotic drugs over the control facility, and a 31 percent reduction in physical restraints over the control facility.
