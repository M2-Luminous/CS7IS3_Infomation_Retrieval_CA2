He said in an interview with an MBC correspondent in Florida, 'Aziz Fahmi, that the United States is continuing its contacts with him. He said the war constitutes a real danger for Yemeni unity. [Al-'Attas] The declaration of war was clearly an act harming unity and breaking every bond between the sons of the Yemeni people. We did not expect our brothers in Sanaa to resort to such methods. This is why, as I have already said, they have portrayed the situation as an annexation of the south to the north. Their behavior shows that they are secessionists. With regard to the war, which totally contradicts unity, there can be no unity with war. Whatever the situation and whichever side's forces occupy the land of the other party, it cannot be seen as a victory. [Fahmi] What is the constitutional stance on the presidential measures to dismiss you and all the southern officials? [Al-'Attas] Undoubtedly, the measures are not constitutional. It is the right of the House of Representatives under normal circumstances to withdraw confidence from the government or from any minister. But the Presidential Council has no right to dismiss a minister or the prime minister. So this decision is not constitutional, even under normal circumstances, never mind in the circumstances in Yemen now, which are not normal. [Fahmi] What is the U.S. Administration's stance on events in Yemen and has it accepted your dismissal as prime minister? [Al-'Attas] We maintain dealings with the U.S. Administration and are still in contact with the U.S. State Department. In my meetings with State Department officials, since the start of the crisis they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the military course of the political crisis in the country. [end recording] Later tonight, a U.S. State Department spokesman clarified to MBC that his country has adopted no stance on the position of al-'Attas, dismissed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The U.S. official, who asked to remain anonymous, said that Washington is focusing on stopping the acts of aggression between the Yemenis and on finding ways for negotiations to be held between the north and the south to reach a peaceful solution.
