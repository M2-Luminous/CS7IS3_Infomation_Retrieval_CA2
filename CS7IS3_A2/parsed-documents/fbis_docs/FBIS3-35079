Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports from the broadcast van at the Labor Party building: [Begin recording] [Tal] The Labor Party Bureau is today addressing many issues. Among other things, Prime Minister Rabin was asked about the katyusha attack in the north. Rabin said this attack was contrary to all the understandings attained in the wake of Operation Accountability. He noted, however, that there was no basic change in the situation: [Rabin] Our understandings with Syria regarding Hizballah remain in effect. Today we know the katyusha was launched by a splinter Palestinian group that seceded from Fatah due to its opposition to the Declaration of Principles in particular and to the peace process in general. We will operate as we deem necessary. This organization calls itself the Black 13 September Organization -- this does not refer to the 13th of September 1970, but rather to 1993. I believe that this is a marginal organization that does not even approximate the magnitude of threat posed by Hizballah. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will find the appropriate way to deal with this issue. [Tal] Referring to Syria, Rabin said the ball is now in its court. Progress depends not only on Israel, but on Syria as well. [Rabin] Why is there no progress? Because Syria poses demands we cannot accept. We must adhere to our positions, and if Syria wants peace it must adjust to our demands and meet us halfway. [end recording]
