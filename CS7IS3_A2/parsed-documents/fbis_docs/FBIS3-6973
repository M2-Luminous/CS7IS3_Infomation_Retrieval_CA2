After the mid-1980's, North Korea began to build export clothes plants independent of plants for domestic consumption to earn foreign currency. There are an estimated 40 such plants, 20 of which are joint ventures or jointly managed, mainly with companies owned by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, Chongnyon. The export clothes companies import basic materials and export the finished products to Japan and Western countries. Those with outstanding export records are Moranbong joint-venture company, Nakwon Songhwa clothes company, and Chindallae joint-venture company (women's clothes). Moranbong joint-venture company, North Korea's largest export clothes company, exported approximately 280,000 men's suits and jackets in 1990. There are reports, however, that North Korea's ambitious plans to expand clothes exports are partly snagged. Chongnyon businessmen are refraining from investing in North Korea due to the North Korean regime's excessive control and closed policy, which run counter to the changes in the international political situation. It has been learned that since the beginning of the nineties, consecutive Chongnyon companies have gone bankrupt or stopped operations due to the North Korean authority's opportunistic and stubborn attitude and now only 20 plants are in operation. As a result, the North Korean authorities are actively seeking joint-venture businesses with Western countries in the clothes processing sector. In the meantime, it is also expected that North Korea will show increased interest in expanding processing trade with the ROK, despite the blocked North-South relations. However, ROK's processing trade is not expected to be activated until the North Korean nuclear issue reaches a stage of resolution.
