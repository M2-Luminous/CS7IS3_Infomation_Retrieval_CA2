At the upcoming Seoul-Tokyo summit, Japan is expected to explain its efforts to settle past issues between the two nations, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, told the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee Wednesday. He strongly hinted that the matter of arranging repatriation of Koreans on the Russian island would top the summit's agenda, along with the North Korean nuclear problem. Tokyo mobilized around 150,000 Koreans for forced labor on Sakhalin in the 1940s when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule. About 42,000 first-generation Koreans and their descendants still live on the island, with an estimated 13,000 saying they want to spend the rest of their lives in Korea. Seoul holds Japan legally responsible for their repatriation and insists that it should bear the cost of their return and settlement and living expenses. Repatriation of Koreans on Sakhalin could symbolize Seoul-Tokyo attempts to finally put their past behind them, and the two governments have already made such diplomatic efforts as sending a joint study team in January, Yu said.
