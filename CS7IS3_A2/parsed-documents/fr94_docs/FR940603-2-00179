FR940603-2-00179 FR940603-2-00095 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;201&hyph;806] Steel Wire Rope From Mexico; Correction to Affirmative Preliminary Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order AGENCY: Import Administration/International Trade Administration/Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Yacura or Thomas Prosser at (202) 482&hyph;5253, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. CORRECTION: In the notice of affirmative preliminary determination of circumvention of the antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the Department of Commerce (the Department) incorrectly stated under the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section that: The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or bond posted thereof in the amount of 111.68 percent. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i), in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination under section 353.29, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to require a cash deposit. There is no provision for the posting of bonds. Therefore, the sentence should not have included the phrase ``or bond posted thereof.'' The correct sentence should read as follows: The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cash deposit in the amount of 111.68 percent. This notice is published pursuant to section 781(a) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.29(e). Dated: May 27, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
