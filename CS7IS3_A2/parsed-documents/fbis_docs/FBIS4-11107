In a communique, the Honduran Foreign Ministry announced U.S. Ambassador to Tegucigalpa William Pryce expressed Washington's support for Honduras. The United States "has the pleasure to support Honduras' candidacy and hopes to work with its representative at the Security Council that will be installed in 1995," the U.S. envoy said, according to the text of the communique. Pryce remarked it will be "a pleasure and honor to give them our support," while Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar explained that the White House decision is valued "highly," according to the document. U.S. support of this nation's hopes to become a nonpermanent member of the Security Council "represents a good piece of news, a specific demonstration of the excellent relations between Honduras and the United States," Paz Aguilar emphasized. Honduras has become the sole candidate of the group of nations from Latin America and the Caribbean for the election that will take place during the 49th session of the UN General Assembly, scheduled for next autumn. The UN Security Council has five permanent members -- China, the United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia -- and 10 nonpermanent members, whose membership changes every two years.
