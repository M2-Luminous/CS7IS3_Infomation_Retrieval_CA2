Milosevic said that the party had acted from patriotic motives, rising above petty party interests. Milosevic was speaking with the party's representatives whom he received on the occasion of 100 days in office of the Serbian government. He had first received Prime Minister Marjanovic and his cabinet. After the meeting, New Democracy president Dusan Mihajlovic told reporters the party had no reason to be dissatisfied with the decision to join the cabinet. Mihajlovic said the party had accepted the offer to join the Marjanovic cabinet because of the latter's promise to work actively for peace, the lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), its reintegration in the international economic and political community and the implementation of the country's economic recovery programme.
