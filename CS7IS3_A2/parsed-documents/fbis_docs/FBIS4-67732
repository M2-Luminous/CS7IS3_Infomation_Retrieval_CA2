Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos has said that the leading guidelines for the transformation are basically the following principles: -- The state, as such, has decided to no longer engage in the production of power, on the grounds that it is not a strategic activity. -- Within this context, the privatization of the sector as a whole (electric, gas, and oil areas) has basically sought to reorient the entrepreneurial role. This topic has been the focus of the reorganization that has been implemented over the past four years. The first attempts to privatize the nuclear area caused distrust in the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), which, according to what Bastos told LA NACION, has now disappeared, giving rise to a stage of mutual cooperation. The Rules of the Game The CNEA, Bastos said, must adapt itself to the new rules of the game. One of the main obstacles that specialists mention in referring to the search for risk capital for the nuclear sector has to do with the appropriate insurance and policies for operations, and the economic provisions for the future dismantling of those power centrals. Specialized technicians note that a plant like Embalse might produce 8,000 tons of highly contaminated residue that should be dumped in a grave or appropriate deposit. The total cost of the deactivation operation may not be less than $200 million. In the opinion of Bastos, this might not be a serious problem. The state has never accumulated reserve funds for this purpose, for example by increasing part of the cost of that power, simply because it has always been expected that, whenever necessary, the Treasury would provide the funds. The CNEA, Bastos went on, should reorganize itself into an enterprise ruled by private commercial regulations, which does not mean that in the future the Treasury will not provide funds for pure and applied research in the nuclear area, or for the completion of the third plant (Atucha-2), construction of which should have ended in 1987 according to the original project timetable. The Next Steps Concerning the reformulation of the CNEA role, Bastos mentioned that work is being done to restructure the laws that will regulate the participation and role of private capital. To this end it will be necessary to create a new organization with the same CNEA people, who will be in charge of regulating the sector. This is to some extent what is happening to Calin (Advisory Council for Licensing Nuclear Facilities) with respect to CNEA, although in this case there will be more autonomy. In sum, there will be a power generation enterprise with security legislation for its operation. Furthermore, attached entrepreneurial activities, like the extraction of uranium, will be reorganized into one or more enterprises whose shares will be, in principle, owned by the state.
