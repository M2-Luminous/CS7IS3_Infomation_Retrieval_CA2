Noting that China and the ROK are close neighbors and their peoples' contacts can be traced back to ancient times, Hu said the two countries had not long established diplomatic ties, but bilateral ties have developed rapidly and their exchanges and cooperation covered a wide range. He added that the friendly contacts between the two parties have also been expanding. Mun praised China for its stability and rapid economic development, adding that it is his hope that the visit will help increase his understanding of China's reform, opening to the outside world and modernization and promote the growth of the ties between the two parties and the two countries. Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting. This evening, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, hosted a banquet in honor of the visitors. The ten-member delegation, including six members of the national assembly, arrived here earlier this afternoon. Tomorrow morning Li Shuzheng is expected to hold working talks with Mun and his party on relations between the two parties. After their visit to Beijing, the delegation will also pay goodwill visits to Xian and Shanghai.
