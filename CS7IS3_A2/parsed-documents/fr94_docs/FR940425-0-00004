FR940425-0-00004 FR940425-0-00002 9 CFR Part 113 [Docket No. 92&hyph;153&hyph;2] Viruses, Serums, Toxins, and Analogous Products; Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the regulations for the Standard Requirement for Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate, by increasing from 14 to 16 the minimum number of vaccinated birds out of 20 that must survive infection with virulent Pasteurella multocida for an adequate demonstration of vaccine efficacy. This amendment is necessary to provide greater assurance that a licensed Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate, meets the efficacy standard consumers have come to expect for this type of product. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. David A. Espeseth, Deputy Director, Veterinary Biologics, BBEP, APHIS, USDA, room 838, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In accordance with the regulations contained in 9 CFR part 113, Standard Requirements are prescribed for the preparation of veterinary biological products. The Standard Requirement for Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate, in §113.70 states that a minimum of 14 of 20 vaccinates must survive exposure to live bacteria for a successful demonstration of efficacy. On July 13, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 37670&hyph;37671, Docket No. 92&hyph;153&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by revising §113.70 to indicate that the minimum number of vaccinated birds out of 20 that must survive exposure to live bacteria for a successful demonstration of vaccine efficacy is 16. This action was taken to provide greater assurance that a licensed Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine meets the efficacy standard consumers have come to expect for this type of product. We solicited comments on our proposal for a 60-day period ending September 13, 1993. We received one comment by that date. The comment fully supported the proposed action. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12886. This amendment should not have a significant economic impact on manufacturers since the revised efficacy standard is one that has been readily achieved by all such vaccine licensed in recent years. The change from 14 of 20 to 16 of 20 vaccinated birds surviving exposure to live organisms in order to demonstrate satisfactory protection against disease will help ensure that consumers receive a highly efficacious vaccine without adding undue cost to the manufacturer. The revised efficacy standard assures that fewer birds will experience disease when vaccinated with a product that can still be manufactured at a reasonable cost to the producer. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative proceedings which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the regulations under the rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the category of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113 Animal biologics, Exports, Imports, and Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, we are amending 9 CFR part 113 as follows: PART 113_STANDARD REQUIREMENTS 1.
