Special research conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs shows that there are now approximately 400,000 users of narcotics in the state. Over the past year staffers of the West Ukrainian Internal Affairs Transport Administration alone, who serve the Lvov Railroad, have exposed 874 cases of the acquisition, keeping, and transportation of narcotics and have instituted criminal proceedings against 656 people and administrative proceedings against 160. Of the 7.5 tonnes of raw drugs confiscated on Ukraine's railroads, the Lvov main line has accounted for almost three tonnes. Operational workers have established 30 sources of drug sales. More than one tonne of poppy straw has already been confiscated in 1994, and many possessors of raw drugs have been exposed and arrested. "Carpathian poppies" are brought mainly into Ukraine's Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Lugansk Oblasts and also into the Caucasus. Great anxiety is occasioned by the fact that drug dealers have started working according to the "team method." More than 70 such groups have already been arrested. The arrestees--mainly unemployed young people under the age of 35--include over 100 with previous convictions and also 92 who are citizens of other states.
