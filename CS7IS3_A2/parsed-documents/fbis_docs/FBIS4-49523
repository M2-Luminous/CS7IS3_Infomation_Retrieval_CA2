He told Riyadh Sami al-Qaysi, special envoy of the Iraqi Government, during their meeting that China maintains that the problems should be settled through dialogue and discussion by the parties concerned in order to recover peace and stability in the Middle East region. Qian said that China was sympathetic to the difficult situation of the Iraqi people, and advocated that the international community should objectively comment on Iraq's implementation of the U.N. resolution. The sanctions against Iraq should be gradually reduced in accordance with the changes in the situation, and out of humanitarian considerations, to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people, Qian said. He also expressed his hope that the Iraqi side would continue its co-operation and dialogue with the United Nations in an effort to properly solve the differences between the two sides in carrying out the U.N. Security Council resolution. The Chinese vice-premier said that Iraq's clear recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity is very important for resuming their bilateral good-neighborly ties, and for ending the sanctions against Iraq at an early date. During the meeting Riyadh, also Iraqi deputy foreign minister, introduced Iraq's implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution, and its stand on issues such as the long-term weapons supervisory plan and sanctions.
