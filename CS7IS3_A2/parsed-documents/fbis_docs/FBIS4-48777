In a letter to the United Nations dated 20 May 1994, the political parties said that the role of the UN force to Rwanda is expected to be exclusively humanitarian. The force should not be used to protect criminals responsible for the genocide in Rwanda. These should be tried in an international tribunal. [passage omitted] The political parties want the deployment of the extra UN forces to Rwanda to coincide with the setting up of an international commission of inquiry to investigate the genocide that has been committed in Rwanda. The political parties MDR, PSD, PL and PDC, commonly known as the Democratic Forces of Change, believe that the cease-fire should be negotiated between the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan Government forces because the government in Rwanda is illegitimate and has been responsible for the massacres in the country.
