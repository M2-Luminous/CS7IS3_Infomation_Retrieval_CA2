The soldiers on Thursday would move into Rwanda's southwestern Cyangugu district to help some 8,000 Tutsis at three or four sites, the military sources said. The French humanitarian mission to prevent further slaughter in Rwanda's ethnic bloodbath would also involve intervention on Friday or Saturday in the Gisenyi region of northwestern Rwanda, they said. Gisenyi, north of Lake Kivu, is across the border from Goma, one of two Zairean towns with Bukavu, where up to 2,000 French troops will eventually be based for a UN-mandated, two-month humanitarian operation. [passage omitted] General Raymond Germanos, operations chief in the general staff, said the mission will include a medical rapid intervention force of some 60 men, located between Bukavu and the Rwandan border. The team would include medical, surgical and dental units, he said. A military field hospital to care for Rwandan civilians will also be installed between Goma and the Rwandan border, he said. French medical staff will also cross into Rwanda with troops to assess needs. French chief of general staff Admiral Jacques Lanxade stated that a total of up to 600 troops should muster in Goma and Bukavu Thursday.
