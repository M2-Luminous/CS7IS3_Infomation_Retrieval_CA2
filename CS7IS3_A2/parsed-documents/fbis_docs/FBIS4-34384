Government sources only said that Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer's ruling has removed an obstacle in the impasse between the Carabineros director and the executive branch. Politicians and relatives of the three beheaded professionals have reacted against the judge's ruling. Gen. Stange arrived at 0830 this morning at the Carabineros building. He said he was happy with Judge Pfeiffer's ruling, which definitely acquits him of charges of serious disregard of military duties. [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] General, many people insist that this is more an ethical than a legal problem. What do you think? [Stange] I believe testifying before a court is ethical, and that is what I did. I cannot comment on the court ruling. I only want the administration of justice in a situation in which I had been involved in a case and pre-judged. I only want my name and honor to be cleared. [Reporter] Will you assume your duties in a normal manner? [Stange] The normal duties I have always had because I have never left my command. [end recording] Concerning Judge Pfeiffer's ruling, there has been no reaction from La Moneda Palace. The Defense Ministry released a brief communique which states that following the acquittal of the Carabineros director, an important obstacle has been removed in finding a solution to the impasse created between Gen. Stange and the government. No other statements have been made, although it was learned that, notwithstanding the ruling, the government maintains its position that Gen. Stange should leave the Carabineros. [passage omitted]
