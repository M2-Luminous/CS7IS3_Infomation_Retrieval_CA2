The topic of violence is being handled with the highest of priorities, the first results of which are now being observed. We are going to continue making progress with the necessary strength until we are able to neutralize its effects. As for the institutionality of the country, it is completely strengthened, and, despite ill-intentioned rumors, the Guatemalan Army supports the democratic process and the current government that I head. It has given irrefutable proof of that support. There are important topics in the socioeconomic field, however, that cannot be postponed. The government's agenda for 1994-1995 clearly establishes our political strategy and our actions. Such policies have been determined, and it is advisable for us to repeat that. There will be no turns or deviations in its drafting and implementation. In accordance with these policies I am presenting to you the overall picture of the government's finances, which has been dramatic since I assumed the presidency of the Republic with a fiscal deficit of 960 million quetzals and a debt to suppliers of 1.2 billion quetzals. Debts were owed to suppliers for school and hospital products, among other things. We had planned to reduce the fiscal deficit to 360 million quetzals in 1994. Due to the Constitutional Court's ruling and the decrease in tax revenue by 160 million quetzals during the first quarter of the year, the deficit could increase to 1.72 billion quetzals if administrative and legal measures are not adopted now. Since 1993 we have been observing a weakening of the tax structure, which we believe will continue to weaken in 1994. We attribute such a situation to the weakness of the tax laws and to the difficulties involved in achieving its implementation. In view of the budget situation, we must adopt measures, otherwise the fundamental duties of the state could experience serious adverse effects. The government could fail to comply with demands for investment projects in the poorest sectors of the country, which would worsen even more the already poor services provided to the majority of the population. If the fiscal problem is not corrected, we could lose ground in the stability achieved up to now because the inflation goal for 1994 may go unfulfilled. We must not forget that the most harmful tax for the people is inflation. Despite the improvement in the government's revenues in 1991 and 1992, by mid-1993 when I assumed the presidency of the Republic, we already saw a critical situation that has been worsening mainly because the reforms that were introduced to allow the government to effectively fight tax evasion were not reinforced. As a result of this lack of instruments for the application of the law, value-added-tax [VAT] evasion was nearly 40 percent. That means, people of Guatemala, that, for every 100 persons who consume something and pay the VAT, 40 stores collect the tax, but illegally and improperly do not report it to the government. Regarding income tax, evasion is close to 50 percent. As for import taxes, they do not reflect the movement of merchandise owing to dishonest import practices. This is a problem that demands an urgent solution, and we have started taking the first actions. We must keep in mind that the objective of lowering the inflation rate and strengthening public finances is not and should not be an end in and of itself. It is merely a necessary condition to reinforcing democracy and achieving social equality and sustained economic growth. Handling a coherent and consistent social policy, within which fiscal policy plays a key role, would foster a climate favorable to raising public savings, lowering the inflation rate, decreasing uncertainty, and making investment possible. It also fosters fewer changes in prices, generates jobs, and maintains the real value of wages. The adoption of fiscal measures will enable the government to avoid the inflation rate's negative distributive effect. It will also allow it to fulfill the unpostponable task of fighting poverty and merging economic progress with social equality. There are contradictory situations, since we are simultaneously seeing a drop in tax revenues and predicting a significant growth of 5 percent in economic activity compared to the 2 percent figure of many countries. Within the framework of fiscal and monetary policy, the fiscal initiatives seek to achieve the following objectives: 1. (?Stabilize) prices, avoid an inflationary process with the subsequent economic and social consequences, and eliminate excessive indebtedness that limits the expectations of progress. 2. Allow greater availability of resources to spend them on social development and fighting poverty, considering the life expectancy in Guatemala is the lowest in Central America and the illiteracy rate is the highest. In addition, the infant mortality rate is one of the highest in Latin America, partly because the Guatemalan tax burden is the smallest in Central America and Latin America. Only Haiti's tax burden is smaller. 3. Correct some inconsistencies in the current fiscal laws to achieve a sustained increase in revenues that is in step with economic growth, allowing the strengthening of public finances. In that respect, we have submitted law initiatives that while not creating new taxes seek to improve a tax system that, together with measures of administrative control, avoid frequent changes in the tax laws and allow us to meet priority investment expenditures. These initiatives are complemented by specific actions that seek a restructuring of the administration to make tax-paying easier and to modernize the tax system. The changes apply to income tax laws, the VAT, which remains at 7 percent, and the airport tax on passengers traveling abroad, as well as changes to the tax code. The changes made to the income tax code in 1992 led to a reduction of personal income and corporate taxes. Its reduction was clearly noticeable during the first quarter of 1994 because a total of 41 million quetzals less than what was estimated were collected. These changes are aimed at partially restoring the revenues that were lost due to the impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on account payments and retentions. The changes are also aimed at strengthening the taxation system by avoiding tax evasion. The collection of the VAT dropped by 85 million quetzals during the first quarter of 1994. Evasion takes place when store owners do not issue receipts or proofs of purchase. It is, therefore, important to adopt measures to prevent this type of tax evasion. Moreover, with the purpose of solving the problems with the VAT that have accumulated to date the treasury intends to increase the airport exit tax to 100 quetzals, much closer to Central American levels. The tax on those leaving the country by land remains unchanged. Finally, as for the tax code, it will be strengthened with the purpose of getting an effective regimen for stronger punishments. The application of punishments will be proposed, and, for repeated offenders, the proper criminal court judge may temporarily shut down the business. The treasury must contribute all the elements needed by the courts to issue the proper punishment. In addition, the deadlines for filing documents are reduced. All changes are difficult, but not making them would lead to stagnation, inflation, and state inefficiency. History has proven that macroeconomic disorders and instability provide no solutions for social problems. In the 1980's the failure to adopt timely measures brought about a reduction of real wages. By the end of the decade 75 percent of the population was poor, and 50 percent was extremely poor. All changes are difficult, I said before, but not making them would lead us to stagnation. It is important to build an authentic and solid social reform on the foundations of the economic reforms. The fight against poverty is another face of economic reform. It is necessary to include social sectors that were never included before. It is necessary to include modern economic sectors to allow them to participate in productive activities. We must strengthen the activities of small enterprises that can generate jobs for thousands of citizens. These changes are not automatic, and they cannot appear spontaneously. Effort and participation by the state and society as a whole are necessary. A great effort to achieve economic stability in the country is necessary so we can lay the groundwork for a sustained growth that can guarantee greater opportunities through the allocation of more resources for investment in the social arena. For this to continue, it must not be done by incurring greater debts. We are aware of the challenges we are facing and the many things that remain to be done. The principal challenge is to strengthen the social aspects of development, and the spirit of the fiscal changes is precisely to achieve this objective. The price of the imbalance is too high -- hence the urgent need to take measures. We are sure that we are on the right track. There will be no changes in the policy we have outlined. The situation forces us to take speedy action. The progress of the peace process commands our attention beyond a cessation of armed confrontation. It means attention to social development demands. We must understand clearly that there is no true economic prosperity without greater social justice. It is also true that economic growth is possible in freedom. Our government has pledged to the Guatemalan people to govern in a different style, where national interests prevails above all others with honesty and prioritization of expenses for social benefits. We trust we will be able to forge ahead despite problems. We have confidence in our principles and are sure of our policies. We do need, however, the support and positive spirit of all Guatemalans, because we can overcome any difficulties if we are united. The biggest challenge is to construct the country we desire for our children, a Guatemala that lives in peace, prosperity, and solidarity. People of Guatemala: In view of the government's financial crisis, I have made decisions that help resolve it from an administrative, institutional, and fiscal viewpoint. I fully trust that the Congress will study and eventually approve the proposals that have been presented. I trust all taxpayers will conscientiously perform their legal duties. The government has pledged to invest taxes in security, health, education, etc. That is our duty. If taxpayers fail to pay their taxes, the law will be strictly enforced. If, for any reason, the proposals are not passed, I would be forced to take other measures that would temporarily solve the problem but could harm all Guatemalans through inflation and the subsequent economic cost that the population would have to bear. The Congress and the people will have to say the final word. So will the government, regarding the part that concerns it; the Congress, by supporting the proposals; the taxpayers, by paying their taxes; and the government, by spending honestly the Guatemalan people's resources. Thank you for your attention. Good night.
