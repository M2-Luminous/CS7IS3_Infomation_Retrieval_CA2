An unexpected shock for world observers was the March indicator of the inflation rate for the karbovanets. This figure amounted to 5.6 percent, whereas at the start of the year it had been higher by several orders of magnitude. The very tough monetary policy introduced by Zvyahilskyy, after several months of hand-wringing, has only now begun to lose its funereal colors. Only now--in the observers's opinion--have the presidential edicts and the decrees adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers as well as the National Bank taken on a quality of logic and purposiveness. Of course, this could not fail to have a marked effect on Ukraine's foreign relations with the most influential circles in the West. It's most likely that the West has ceased to blink in astonishment after each new item of information from Ukraine. To be sure, investors who have already invested their U.S. dollars, German marks, and other such hard currency here are still grasping their heads, but they are no longer spitting in all directions and cursing the day when their money crossed our border. The packet of privileges for investors which was proclaimed by the president of Ukraine prior to 1 April has not yet attained the status of an April Fools joke; and under our conditions even this can be considered an achievement. In commenting upon the course of economic reforms during the spring period, certain analysts have expressed the opinion that the liberalization of the economy is directly linked to the elections. But--on the other hand--if nobody is worse off because of this, then what is the difference as to when the reforms were conducted--during the elections, before them, or after them? In essence, the West began to take a new attitude toward Ukraine after Kravchuk's visit to the White House in Washington. The granting of assistance to Ukraine by the United States in the amount of 700 million U.S. dollars (which exceeded the previously allocated total several times over) served as a unique guarantee not only for the governments of other countries, but also for potential investors. And although right now the situation in Ukraine is far from being what such investors would have wanted, they have all--nevertheless--reached the conclusion that we are not to be deserted. And if tens of millions more must be poured into our country today, then tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will begin to yield some profits. And just where are we headed now? According to data provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics, as of 1 April 1994, the growth of investments in Ukraine's economy during the period from January through March of this year reached the figure of 66.7 million U.S. dollars. At the beginning of 1994 the total amount of investments in Ukraine had reached the level of 1.2-1.5 billion U.S. dollars. However, according to data provided by the Cabinet of Ministers, we need to employ four times that total in order to carry out our top-priority tasks in the immediate future. The legal foundation for investors in Ukraine is still the Decree passed by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers dated 20 May 1993, "On the System of Foreign Investment." In line with this Decree, the Law "On a State Program for Encouraging Foreign Investments" was passed in December 1993; it designated 11 high-priority sectors for investing in our economy. Furthermore, Ukraine has just recently introduced several more legislative acts aimed at encouraging foreign investments here. To sum up, the West will continue to have a sentimental attitude toward us until such time as we ourselves cease to have a sentimental attitude toward the West. But, meanwhile, this spring the world's financial institutions have significantly stepped up their scrutiny of the conditions for granting credits to Ukraine. On 19 May the mission of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] completed its work, the goal of which was to standardize the conditions under which Ukraine could be granted the so-called STF (Standard Transformation Facilities)--credits amounting to 700 million U.S. dollars, keyed to a period of 15 years at interest rates of 6 or 7 percent percent per annum. As a rule, the IMF grants STF to countries with a transitional type of economy for the purpose of amortizing the deficits in their budget payments. Of course, it would have been best if--during this visit--the Ukrainian government had prepared a letter to the IMF, in which a method of putting such credits to advantageous use could have been set forth, although even this cannot be regarded as a panacea. In the words of Lorenzo de Milnera, the IMF's permanent representative in Ukraine, one of the mandatory conditions for granting STF to Ukraine is political stability in our country; this would manifest itself--first and foremost--in the existence of "solid persons" in positions of authority. And, therefore, it can be safely predicted that--in any case--the IMF is waiting for the election results. A discussion of the global initiatives with regard to granting assistance to Ukraine--initiatives which were set forth several weeks ago by the Commission of the European Union--recently took place in Brussels at the level of the ambassadors from the 12 member-states of the EU [European Union]. The specific total figure for such assistance was not revealed, but Great Britain's ambassador noted the importance of the proposals set forth by the Commission, and the EU Commission's official representative--Peter Gilford--hinted that the problem of assisting Ukraine Ukraine would not remain in the corridors of power at Brussels. In contrast to the United States, Canada, and other trans-oceanic investors, the EU is more disturbed by Ukraine's nuclear problem and--in particular--by the question of the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power station]. Specifically because of this, Western Europe is still dancing about in its interrelations with Ukraine. This matter is to be discussed during the course of the meetings between the leaders of the "Big Seven" states in June 1994; and Ukraine will be practically the first country to feel the results of these discussions. Quite a good result of the final accord among Ukrainian politicians reached on 17 May was a "first" in the history of the relations between Washington and Kiev. This was the signing by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov of an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of converting military-type production. An agreement to create the Ukrainian-American Westron JV [joint venture] was signed at the highest level. It is the first substantive proof that Ukraine's relations with the United States have entered upon an entirely new stage of development. All this gives us occasion to consider that--in the very near future--Ukraine can anticipate the first wave in our memory of ardent, assiduous attention from the world's financial giants. But on one condition: that we stop spitting into our own well.
