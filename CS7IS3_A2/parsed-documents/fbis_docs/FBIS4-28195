However, Khin Nyunt is not the most powerful person in control of the political path of the country. In reality, Khin Nyunt himself, along with all the other members of the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council], are mere puppets being manipulated from behind the scenes. The body behind them is called the state's steering committee, led by Bo Ne Win or the 21-Member Committee. This body was not formed in a hurry. The 21-member Committee is a new name of Our (?Red Army) Group, which was formed during the four eights [August 1988] democratic uprising to stage counterstrikes and to quash the demonstrations. Members of this body were hardcore BSPP [Burma Socialist Program Party] members, who supported the BSPP until its last days. They did not even join the NUP [National Unity Party] which is the BSPP under a new name formed without much ceremony to prolong its life. Among them were Sein Lwin -- known as the butcher of Rangoon -- Dr. Maung Maung, Aye Ko, Kyaw Htin, and Thura Tun Tin, and last executives of the BSPP. The purpose of this body is to continue holding on to national sovereignty to protect their lives and property. That is why they advocate the participation of Defense Services in the leading role in the future politics and making the Defense Services a government within the government while they try to remain as a government outside the government. However, unfortunately for them, there are two factions within the body. One faction is led by the butcher Sein Lwin with Khin Nyunt and Myo Nyunt as members. This faction does not carry out political reforms at all and upholds the total (?obliteration policy). Another faction is led by Thura Tun Tin with Kyaw Htin and Dr. Maung Maung as members. This group is willing to have political reforms that do not affect their standing. (?Like killing two birds with one stone), they want to gently change the situation in Burma while trying to create their exit. The antagonism between the two factions was evident in the matter over the appointment of the deputy commander in chief of the Defense Services. It took one year to appoint the deputy commander in chief of the Defense Services while the two factions argued over who should be selected. In the end, Maung Aye, who is neutral, does not belong to either faction, and gets along with both factions, was appointed as the deputy commander in chief with the consent of both factions. There is antagonism between the two factions and internal strife within each faction. Although the like-minded Sein Lwin and Khin Nyunt belong to the same faction, they once had differences over the so-called SLORC Ruby, which was smuggled out of the country by Sein Lwin and Naypyidaw Than Htut. Sein Lwin will never be able to forgive Khin Nyunt for exposing the smuggling of the SLORC Ruby. Sein Lwin took this incident as an extreme insult to him by Khin Nyunt, who is very much junior to him. Meanwhile, Khin Nyunt is holding this criminal act of gem smuggling as Sein Lwin's weak point. Both of them are selfish, arrogant, cruel, and cowardly. That is why it is impossible for two lions to share the same cave. It is the nature of cowards to strike first if they think they will be attacked. That is why their cooperation will be temporary and based on their interests. Moreover, Khin Nyunt's display of influence is an annoying sight to others. The worst is that Khin Nyunt is acting like an officious person everywhere because he is being favored by Bo Ne Win. He is also copying Bo Ne Win's style by frequently presenting his wife at state functions. Nowadays, Khin Nyunt's wife, Dr. Khin Win Swe, appears quite often in the newspapers. Now Khin Nyunt is presenting his wife the way Bo Ne Win used to present Daw Khin May Than [Madame Ne Win]. This shows Khin Nyunt is aiming for Bo Ne Win's dictator post. Because Bo Ne Win is still around, the antagonism between the two factions and internal strife within each faction are kept quiet. If Bo Ne Win dies then there will be no way to control the antagonism between the factions, and there will be a big explosion. It is certain that Ne Win is the most powerful person in this body. Ne Win's visit to Singapore for medical treatment in the last week of January clearly shows his influence is still maintained in this committee and in the Defense Services like before. While meeting with Japanese journalists on 17 January, before Ne Win's visit to Singapore, Khin Nyunt said Bo Ne Win's health is good good with the exception of general complaints and that he has been staying peacefully with his family since his retirement from politics. Soon after Khin Nyunt's remarks, Bo Ne Win left for Singapore for eye and dental treatments. It shows Bo Ne Win still has an influence on Burma. Another point is a growing internal conflict in the Defense Services due to dissatisfaction in the Defense Services concerning Khun Nyunt's behavior. Nowadays there are many cases of insubordination, desertion, and conflicts among the regimental commanders in the SLORC's Defense Services. Bo Ne Win, who still has an influence on the Defense Services, controlled the situation without saying a word by presenting himself in such a way as to show that he is still alive and in good health, and to demonstrate that these things should not happen in the Defense Services. Bo Ne Win did the same thing in 1989 when he attended the Resistance Day dinner party in his capacity as a patron of war veterans to control the Defense Services, which were then marked by a power struggle and jockeying of positions between the democratic-leaning commanders and commanders like Khin Nyunt, who are reckless and self-seeking. It is certain that there are cracks appearing in their steering committee, and the situation of the Defense Services is also not so good. Moreover, their steering committee now looks like a damaged boat rolling from side to side and tossing on the waves without any control. It seems their broken boat will not be able to continue the journey. In accordance with its name, the steering committee, the committee members will have to show the noose to the public that will be placed around their necks for unjustly killing thousands of people and for the crimes they have committed.
