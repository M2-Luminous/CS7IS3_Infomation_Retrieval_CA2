In the building's Great Assembly Hall, dances, songs and acrobatics with characteristics of Chinese nationalities won waves of applause from the 10,000-strong audience. Puppet plays in the central hall on the ground floor fascinated thousands of children. "It is really funny," cried seven-year-old Yangyang to her parents.
