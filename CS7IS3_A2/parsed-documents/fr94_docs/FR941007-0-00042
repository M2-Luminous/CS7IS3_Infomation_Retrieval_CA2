FR941007-0-00042 FR941007-0-00011 Indiana has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(q)(1)), an offset ratio of 1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(5)(A)), and a modification significance level of 40 tpy (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(x)). 7. Lead The statutory permit requirements for lead nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation plan. For lead nonattainment areas, States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. Indiana has established a major source threshold of 25 tpy (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(q)(4)), an offset ratio of 1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(5)(A)), and a modification significance level of 0.6 tpy (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(x)). 8. Permit Exemption Emission Levels The Indiana nonattainment rules have exemption levels listed in 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(2). 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(2) states that a new source or a modification to an existing source with emissions above these exemption levels and below potential emissions of 25 tons per year for any regulated pollutant shall be registered according to 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;2. Also, 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(1) establishes exemption levels for requiring new sources or modifications to existing sources obtain a construction permit under 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;3. The exemption levels are available to sources for registration applicability purposes. These levels are applied before any netting calculations. Sources cannot net emissions increases and decreases and then use net emissions in the exemption test. These do not affect the provisions for special modifications. 9. Definition of Federally Enforceable The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, should be interpreted in accordance with the Federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA, therefore, interprets `federally enforceable' as used in the Indiana rules to be defined according to the Federal definition. 10. Recodification of SIP Approved Regulations The previous regulations approved into the Indiana SIP establishing a new source review program were contained in APC&hyph;19 and codified at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). These regulations provided for a new source review program pursuant to 40 CFR part 51 subpart I, including both minor and major new source review. USEPA is approving Indiana's SIP revisions not only to adopt the changes referenced elsewhere in this notice but also to recodify the previously approved new source review rules, formerly in APC&hyph;19 and currently in 326 IAC 2, based on a review of the entire submission, USEPA has determined that the new source review regulations contained in 326 IAC 2 submitted by the state, including both the rule changes and the recodification, meet the requirements of part D of title I of the Act. In addition, these rules are being approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51 Subpart I, for both major and non-major new source review except not for PSD requirements in 40 CFR 51.166. 11. Plantwide Source Definition On October 14, 1981, the USEPA revised the new source review regulations in 40 CFR Part 51 to give states the option of adopting the ``plantwide'' definition of stationary source which provides that only physical or operational changes that result in a net increase in emissions at the entire plant require a NSR permit. For example, if a plant decreased emissions by the same amount at another piece of process equipment, then there would be no net increase in emissions at the plant and therefore, no ``modification'' to the ``source.'' The plantwide definition is in contrast to the so-called ``dual'' definition [or definition of structure like that in the 1979 offset ruling (44 FR 3274), which has much the same effect as the dual definition]. Under the dual definition, the emissions from each physical or operational change are gauged without regard to reductions elsewhere at the plant. In the October 1981 rule, USEPA set forth its rationale for allowing use of the plantwide definition (46 FR 50766&hyph;69). In its view, allowing use of the plantwide definition was a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting goals of part D of title I of the Act. The Act provided for reasonable further progress (RFP) and timely attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), while also allowing for maximum state flexibility and economic growth. The USEPA recognized that the plantwide definition would bring fewer plant modifications into the nonattainment permitting process, but emphasized that this generally would not interfere with RFP and timely attainment primarily because the states under the demands of Part D eventually would have adequate SIPs in place. For instance, USEPA stated: Since demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS continues to be required, deletion of the dual definition increases State flexibility without interfering with timely attainment of the ambient standards and so is consistent with Part D [46 FR 50767]. USEPA also indicated that under the plantwide definition, new equipment would still be subjected to any applicable new source performance standard and that wholly new plants, as well as any modifications that resulted in a significant net emissions increase, would still be subject to NSR. Thus, EPA saw no significant disadvantage in the plantwide definition from the environmental standpoint, but the advantages from the standpoints of state flexibility and economic growth. It regarded the plantwide definition as presenting, at the very worst, environmental risks that were manageable because of the independent impetus to create adequate Part D plans. As a result, EPA ruled that a state wishing to adopt a plantwide definition generally has complete discretion to do so, and it set only one restriction on that discretion. If a state had specifically projected emission reductions from its NSR program as a result of a dual or similar definition and had relied on those reductions in an attainment strategy that USEPA later approved, then the state needed to revise its attainment strategy as necessary to accommodate reduced NSR permitting under the plantwide definition (46 FR 50767 and 50769). In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld USEPA's action as a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting purposes of Part D of Title I of the Act, and hence, well within USEPA's broad discretion. Chevron, U.S.A. v. NRDC , 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984). Specifically, the Court agreed that the plantwide definition is fully consistent with the Act's goal of maximizing state flexibility and allowing reasonable economic growth. Likewise, the Court recognized that USEPA had advanced a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the plantwide definition serves the Act's environmental objectives as well (see 104 S.Ct. at 2792). In this rule USEPA generally reaffirms the rationales stated in the 1981 rulemaking. Those rationales were left undisturbed by the Supreme Court decision.
