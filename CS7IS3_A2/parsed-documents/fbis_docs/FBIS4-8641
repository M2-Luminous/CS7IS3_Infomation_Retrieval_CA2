The Serbian president and the Geneva conference cochairmen exchanged views on the latest situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and other important issues related to a political resolution of the crisis. They particularly focused on initiatives and ideas linked to ending the armed confrontations and creating conditions to restore the negotiating process. The Serbian president believes that an end to all hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina should be achieved, which means, first of all, that the Muslim forces should give up any further military provocation. The responsibility for their behavior rests to the greatest extent with the international community, which has not only tolerated but--by undertaking air attacks against the Serbs--also openly encouraged the Bosnian Muslim leadership to continue the war. The success of the peace process depends directly on abandoning discriminatory practices and on returning to the international community's principles of impartiality and objectivity, Milosevic stressed in his talks with Stoltenberg and Owen.
