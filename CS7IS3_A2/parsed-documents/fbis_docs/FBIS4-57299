FBIS4-57299 "drlat096_t_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 Venezuela Police Sources Confirm New Student Protests Police Sources Confirm New Student Protests PA1805041294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2316 GMT 17 May 94 PA1805041294 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Caracas, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- New student demonstrations and some incidents were reported today in Caracas and three cities in the interior of the country protesting an increase in public transportation fares, according to police sources. Metropolitan Police Chief Jose Hernandez said that the Interior Ministry and student federations agreed at a meeting that demonstrations must be peaceful. Despite verbal agreements between students and the government, the conflict has not been resolved, as the authorities have been unable to force bus owners to charge students preferential fares, and therefore protests are expected to continue. Students are demanding that private bus owners comply with the law establishing that students--more than 2 million throughout the country--only have to pay half of the regular fares. High school students who took to the streets to hurl stones and bottles to disrupt traffic near a housing complex in the "23 January" neighborhood were convinced by police to break up the demonstration. After talking to a group of students who were protesting at a school in the "Gran Colombia" education center, the metropolitan police managed to discourage them from continuing their protests. Students from two schools located at the Fuerzas Armadas Street in downtown Caracas tried to hold up a truck transporting mineral water, but National Guard members who are discreetly patrolling the streets prevented them from setting the vehicle on fire. The police also prevented students from holding up a truck transporting paint, which was intercepted by the demonstrators. Today authorities arrested 20 students in the city of Los Teques in western Venezuela. On 16 May there were incidents between riot police and demonstrators in three cities in the interior of the country, during which one vehicle was set on fire. Meanwhile, teachers in Caracas marched peacefully through the main streets downtown demanding payment of wage increases granted in January which have not been honored by the government of President Rafael Caldera. In addition, hundreds of journalists demonstrated in front of Congress defending their association rights and demanding the prompt approval by Congress of amendments to the journalism law. At the demonstration called by the National Association of Journalists (CNP) the participants protested a campaign promoted by the Press Association (which groups the media owners) against the journalism law.
