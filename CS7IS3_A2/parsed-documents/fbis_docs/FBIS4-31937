On 15 June, a news conference was held at Paks Town Hall on the results of the public opinion poll preceding the decision and the conditions of the agreement. As we have already reported, the construction of a storage place was made necessary by the fact that Russia accepted the heating elements in the past and is now showing reluctance to accepting further deliveries of radiating waste. Mayor Imre Bor said that the local government wanted to represent the population's interests all along; this is the reason they carried out a public opinion poll before making the final decision. This demonstrated that, with adequate guarantees, 56 percent of the town's population accept the construction of the storage place; only 39 percent oppose it. This removed the last obstacle to reaching an agreement between the power station and the local government. In addition to the guarantees, the agreement also provides 130 million forints to the local government which can, among other things, be used for individual electric power allowances, based on need. The storage facility will be built in the vicinity of the power station.
