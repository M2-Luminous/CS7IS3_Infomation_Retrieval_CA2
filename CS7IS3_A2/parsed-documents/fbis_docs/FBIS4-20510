[Krueger] I doubt that we are on a descent. But we have problems with the economic climate which have a negative effect on the research climate in Germany. The economic setting and the state of the market are influencing the tempo of converting research results into successful products. We aren't weak at all in basic research. In gene technology or microelectronics, for example, we still have a high international standing. -- Then perhaps you are thinking of the fact that we are falling behind the U.S. and Japan, with virtually no chance of catching up? [Krueger] No, the pinch only comes in converting knowledge into products and markets. That has to happen more rapidly. And a sometimes near-hysterical reaction to technical developments in this country is a stumbling block. -- Can you give examples? [Krueger] Plenty of them. The high temperature reactor, where we were world leaders, was done in by a lack of political acceptance. Or take the example of gene technology, where young researchers see no opportunities because of the long wait for approval and emigrate. Many things set the wrong mood, for instance when scientists working in health research are subjected to threats because they have to carry out experiments on animals in order to help human beings. -- But popular initiatives can't bear the whole blame for the crisis. Even in uncontroversial technologies the dynamics of innovation are weakening in this country. [Krueger] That varies a great deal from one industry to another. Engineering, for example, is still innovative. In some ways even too innovative, almost too perfect. That drives up costs and weakens our competitiveness. Innovation at all costs is not good. We often make complicated things, but the Japanese usually make what is more saleable. -- How can that be changed? [Krueger] What is needed is a closer link between basic research and industry. Maybe it would also be more efficient if more basic research were conducted within industry itself. Often the two sides no longer understand one another. In the last few years a real language barrier has arisen and it has to be overcome. -- You took over the idea of a strategic circle from your predecessor--a mini-MIDI or round of talks? [Krueger] Neither one. I want to initiate a strategic dialog between research, industry and politics on two levels with differing goals. On the upper level is the strategic circle, where the concerns are research processes and across-the-board problems like acceptance, legal requirements, training the next generation, the tempo of innovation and the like. -- And the second level? [Krueger] That is made up of several dialog circles in which the nature of future research and development trends will be discussed. They should come up with answers, for example to the question of what technologies and products are of basic significance for the future development of our society. These circles will be made up of new experts in each case. Only the basic structure will remain unchanged. Representatives of the economy, science and politics will share their experiences, enhanced by external studies and reports. -- Which research areas do you think most significant? [Krueger] Germany cannot afford to neglect any key area. For example, we need to catch up in biotechnology and in almost all application areas of microelectronics. In information technology we have lost a lot of ground. I will pay particular attention to software development, where we can draw on our knowledge of systems. -- And you hope to achieve this with antiquated support mechanisms and structures? [Krueger] We are already thinking of innovations. For one thing, we have already developed concrete ideas about tax incentives for research and development. We are discussing this with the finance minister at the moment. In the new Federal Laender we have set up a broad spectrum of programs which provide a basis for the existence of innovative mid- level companies.
