The minister said, however, that those problems are not reason enough to stage an aggression such as the one that occurred in Encarnacion in the afternoon of 2 June. During the incident a crowd threatened an Argentine official working for the Yacyreta Binational Entity [EBY] and then pushed his car into the river. Ramirez Boettner met Raul Enrique Justo, minister adviser to the Argentine Embassy in Paraguay, at 13:25 on 3 June. Justo is temporarily heading the Argentine mission for Ambassador Raul Eduardo Carignano, who traveled to Santa Fe Province the day of the incident. Justo conveyed to Ramirez Boettner the Argentine "concern" over the 2 June incident. The foreign minister said he shares Argentina's concern and promised to do his utmost to solve the social situation that is at a boiling point in the Encarnacion area. The foreign minister on 3 June received a "top secret" [preceding two words in English] report from EBY's Paraguayan director, Antonio Adam Nill, about the incident staged by settlers. Ramirez Boettner did not want to elaborate on the document's contents, but said it was a report on what happened on 2 June. "We will study it in order to solve the problem," he added. The foreign minister called on settlers to review their decision to prevent the entry of all Argentine and Paraguayan officials to the area until a solution is found because their position closes the possibilities of a dialogue. Technical sources warned that Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and World Bank technicians have expressed a very lukewarm position regarding the social problems of those affected by the dam's filling, adding that they even lean toward the Argentine position, which seeks to fill the dam at any cost. Workers and Relocations The foreign minister conveyed to the Argentine Foreign Ministry, through Raul Enrique Justo, its concern about the situation of workers and the relocation of settlers living on Parana River islands because they also must be relocated and provided with basic services. Regarding this point the Argentine foreign official said: "I don't have all the information at hand, but I will transmit the concern to my government and we will continue working to resolve these problems." The two countries' Foreign Ministries promised to be in permanent contact to seek a quick solution to the problem raised by settlers and the lack of compensation pay. On 3 June, Ramirez Boettner traveled to Belem do Para to participate in the 24th OAS ordinary session that will meet from 6 to 11 June.
