FR940127-1-00022 FR940127-1-00008 All exceedances of the PM&hyph;10 standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance. Changes in the air quality program to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed. Any other EPA requirements for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary. 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act). The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section 3, ``RACM (including RACT).'' The Columbia Falls air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by FCHD. Any person who violates any provision or rule, with the exception of the voluntary solid-fuel burning device rule, or order under this program shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500.00. The Flathead County Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES, if the FCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) in accordance with section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Code Annotated and effectuated by a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 through 75&hyph;2&hyph;429, Montana Code Annotated. The emission limits for Plum Creek are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit # 2667&hyph;M with a final modification date of January 24, 1992. Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 of the Montana Code Annotated allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day. If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii) of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so. The Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Code Annotated, as amended (1991). On November 15, 1991, the MBHES issued a board order approving the local program and regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and the local authorities was signed November 15, 1991. The regulations, board order, and stipulation were submitted to EPA as a revision to the Montana SIP. The State also submitted a state Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to enforce any state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES issues a board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be taken. The Flathead County rules are in effect now, as are the State's permit modification for Plum Creek. The State of Montana has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP are adequately enforced. EPA believes that the State's and Columbia Falls' existing air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this proposed action contains further information on enforceability requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.
