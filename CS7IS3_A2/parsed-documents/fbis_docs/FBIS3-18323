As the OeTV headquarters in Stuttgart announced on Tuesday, more than 180,000 OeTV members in western and eastern Germany participated in the actions on Monday and Tuesday and "opposed the wage break planned by the employers." On Tuesday alone, 120,000 OeTV members all over Germany were on strike. An OeTV spokesman said in Stuttgart that OeTV sees the warning strikes as a "clear signal" addressed to the employers to "finally start moving" in the fourth round of negotiations on 9-10 March. The employers have so far not made any offer in response to the OeTV's 4-percent demand, but insisted on a "wage break" and presented their own "list of cancellations." Local traffic companies in Berlin, Hannover, Dresden, Kassel, and Munich on Tuesday were, among others, included in the warning strikes. In Berlin alone, 50,000 OeTV members reportedly participated in the strikes. In another 25 cities in western and eastern Germany, traffic came to a temporary standstill. Employees of kindergartens and hospitals also held warning strikes on Tuesday, OeTV said.
