This subpart sets forth the regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Federal Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) (the Act), in conformity with the standards jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105. The Act: (1) Requires the Secretary or his designee to attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property arising out of the activities of the Department; and (2) Authorizes the Secretary or his designee to compromise claims that have not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action where the claim does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest, or to suspend or terminate collection action where it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective financial ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of collecting the claim is likely to exceed the amount of recovery. * * * * * 3.

(a) A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract shall be considered as a single claim in determining whether the claim is one not exceeding $100,000 exclusive of interest for the purpose of compromise or termination of collection action. Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the Act. (b) Joining of two or more single claims in a demand upon a particular debtor for payment totaling more than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or termination of collection action with respect to any one of such claims that does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest. 4.

When initial attempts at collection by the office having responsibility for such claims have not been fully successful, the claim file shall be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Administration for further administrative collection procedures. Claims shall be referred to the Assistant Secretary for Administration well within the applicable statute of limitations (28 U.S.C. 2415 and 2416), but in no event more than 2 years after the claims accrued. * * * * * 5.
