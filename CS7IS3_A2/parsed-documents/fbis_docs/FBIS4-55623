Austrian (and Czech) environmentalists, supported by political parties, have been strongly protesting against Temelin's completion. The Soviet-type plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety technology, is located about 100km from the Austrian border. "I have known this position of Busek for several weeks. It was reiterated during our working breakfast on Friday morning [13 May]," Dlouhy said. Busek, who has attended the Prague international conference Europe and Us, told the APA after the talks with Premier Vaclav Klaus that he understood that the energy situation of the Czech Republic did not give the country any option but to complete the Temelin plant. Dlouhy said that the Czech Republic was refusing the Austrian proposals to convert the Temelin plant to the use of gas "simply because it would be too expensive." He pointed to the fact that Austria, too, had refused on economic grounds to rebuild the finished Zwentendorf nuclear plant to gas fuel. He expressed the doubts that the "atomic" law, which was being prepared, could delay the Temelin completion. "Quite the reverse. The government bill makes it possible to continue in the construction works, planned in Temelin for 1994- 1995," Dlouhy said. The government is trying to finish the law before the Temelin plan is commissioned. The parliament could approve the "atomic law" during 1995, he added.
