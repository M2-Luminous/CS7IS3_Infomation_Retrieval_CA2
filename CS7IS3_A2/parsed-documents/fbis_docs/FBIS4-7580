"No one will be certain about whether this 'nationalization' will not be repeated in the future," Lexa, former state secretary at the Privatization Ministry, said after a session of Meciar's "shadow" cabinet. "This is an international precedent. Valid agreements and resolutions have been abolished without a legal document. No investor will be certain as to whether the next government will not cancel the decisions of the previous one," Lexa said. Citing legal and factual shortcomings the new government of Jozef Moravcik on Tuesday [29 March] canceled 13 privatization projects out of a total of 45 approved by Meciar's cabinet at a time when his remaining in power was uncertain. Current Privatization Minister Milan Janicina even mentioned the possibility of launching criminal proceedings in several cases. This, however, aroused doubts even in the Slovak press, as the ex-Premier's aides and their relatives participated in this privatization. At a press conference, Lexa described the cancellation of the 13 projects as an "act of socialization and nationalization." He said it was a politically-motivated decision aimed at "heaping as much dirt as possible on Meciar."
