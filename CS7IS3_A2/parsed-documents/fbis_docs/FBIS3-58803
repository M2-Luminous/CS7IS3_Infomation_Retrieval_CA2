"If everybody accepts that the 15 percent band is a normal band, the only important question is: Is your currency close to the central rate?," he told journalists outside a meeting of the European Parliament. At the beginning of August, in the face of massive speculation against currencies in the European monetary system (EMS) and particularly against the French franc, EC finance ministers widened the permitted range of fluctuation of most of the currencies within the ERM from 2.25 percent to 15 percent. Christophersen said that the re-imposition of narrow bands might lead to a resumption of speculation against ERM currencies. Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, the Community is to begin stage three of economic and monetary union between the end of 1997 and the end of 1999 at the latest. Under stage three the Community is to adopt a single currency, and Christophersen declined to rule out the possibility that the currency might be adopted in 1997. However, he said that it would be "very, very difficult." A senior EC official has said that six members of the Community might be ready quickly to meet the conditions for use of a single currency. He named them as Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and France.
