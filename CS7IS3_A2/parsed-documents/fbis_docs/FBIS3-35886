At a press conference Monday [31 January], Brazauskas described relations with Russia as normal, which sometimes improve and sometimes get worse. He said Lithuania's statement on intentions to join NATO "left a certain shade" in bilateral relations. But when Lithuania signed Partnership for Peace, no comments followed from the Russian side, he said. "I think this is not such a bad sign." Brazauskas said he raised the problem of Russian military transit through Lithuanian territory during his meetings at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. The president said he asked foreign experts to present their recommendations on the problem. Brazauskas said he emphasized to representatives of NATO nations that Lithuania does not question the Kaliningrad region's subordination to Russia, which is a legal successor of the former Soviet Union. The president said Lithuania will continue talks with Russia and will carefully listen to the opinion of others. Commenting on Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to Lithuania, Brazauskas denied suppositions that Lithuania might create a separate military alliance with Ukraine. "I don't think that having signed the Partnership for Peace program we can participate in any other alliance." The Lithuanian president said Lithuania and Ukraine should primarily discuss a number of economic issues.
