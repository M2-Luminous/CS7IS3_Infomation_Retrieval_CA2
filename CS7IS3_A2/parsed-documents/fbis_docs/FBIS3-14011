In response a sense of urgency about resisting Pakistani designs appears to have cut across party lines in India. The unanimous resolution passed in both houses of Parliament condemning Islamabad's role in the valley takes India's Kashmir policy into high gear. The resolution provides bipartisan support for a stronger and more credible response by New Delhi to Islamabad's strategy of keeping up pressure in the international media. Irrespective of the outcome of Islamabad's attempts to make the United Nations human rights sub-commission accept a resolution on Kashmir, New Delhi's political reactions will inevitably gain momentum. But India's response requires an understanding of Pakistan's motives and tactics. As Sun Tzu, the Chinese military strategist wrote, "Know your enemy, know yourself, hundred battles, hundred victories." With partition two mutually exclusive stereotypes have symbiotically grown together on either side of the border. Pakistan's ruling classes have fostered a feeling among their people that Indians are not reconciled to partition. That India would do anything to undo the deed and subject Muslims to Hindu rule. The constant example given as proof is the case of Kashmir, a state in which a Muslim majority population is kept hostage for exploitation. In time Islamabad has been able to merge Pakistan's creation with the Kashmir problem. It has evolved into a general theoretical exposition that without Kashmir the concept of Pakistan remains incomplete. In India the accession of Kashmir to the Union has been upheld as valid and final. Pakistan is seen as an eternal spoiler who will not rest till Kashmir has been wrenched from India, by force if necessary. New Delhi has been highlighting Islamabad's attempts to quietly hide a disconcerting fact. Mohammad Ali Jinnah rejected outright the idea of a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947, a year before the first UN security council resolution. The memoirs of Louis Mountbatten have noted that when the viceroy suggested a plebiscite to Jinnah, the latter reacted by saying "it was redundant and undesirable to have a plebiscite when it was quite clear that states should go according to their majority population." These two stereotype images have over time become self-evident truths. They have automated the reactions of the two neighbours to each others equally predictable actions. New Delhi's perception has evolved as a result of its experience of handling Pakistan during the period 1947-71. Pakistan's military strategy was to launch a lightning offensive preceded by a relatively smaller infiltration period which they thought would be backed by the Muslim populace to decouple Kashmir from India. After 1971 Islamabad's strategy underwent a subtle yet significant change. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began using dual methods to deal with his enemies. On the one hand Bhutto acknowledged that India was the pre-eminent power in south Asia. On the other he began an improved version of the Kashmir strategy. He placed an emphasis on time and mass indoctrination inside Kashmir. The main objective of Bhutto's policy was to disrupt, discredit and paralyse the Indian administration before committing Pakistani troops. He had by then realised mere sympathy for the cause did not have enough strength to win him Kashmir. What was required was a radicalisation of the population through religion. It is interesting that while Bhutto abhorred the role of the fundamentalist parties in domestic politics, he was not averse to seeking their support for his destabilising of Kashmir and Afghanistan. In Kashmir, Bhutto used the organisational strength of fundamentalist parties with cross border affiliations to spread Islamic ideas as an antidote to the secular forces being projected by New Delhi. It began by focussing upon Islamic education. The Jamaat e Islami was useful because of its sway in the madrassas that rapidly spread throughout the rural areas of Kashmir valley. The spread of Islamic ideals was the first element of the strategy of radicalising the Kashmiri Muslims. The second was the creation of an elaborate information ring within the Kashmiri government. The political crises of the period 1982 to 1987 allowed pro-Pakistani fundamentalist parties to exploit the alienation of the common Kashmiri. Through the maulvis Islamabad was able to communicate with the common Kashmiri for the first time. It set up a fledgling organisation within Kashmir for greater use in future. Ms. Bhutto's overthrow did not mean the end of the Kashmir gambit. Instead the policy was streamlined, and the military's direct involvement increased. It also received more funding because of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamicisation policies. The principle beneficiaries of the Islamic taxes zakat and ushr were the ulema. They in turn used it to consolidate their position on both sides of the border. Suddenly the maulvi became an economically important person, prepared to accept the radical programme that his handlers from Islamabad sold him. Most importantly, the policy of Islamicisation through education at the grassroots became an effective counter to the relatively successful philosophy propagated by New Delhi that Kashmiriyat was built on secularism. New Delhi ignored the quiet revolution taking place inside Kashmir. It did not take advantage of the Afghan imbroglio to counter Islamabad's Kashmir operations. Instead New Delhi preferred to accept at face value the peace overtures made by the Zia regime in respect of Kashmir. The greatest failure on the part of New Delhi was its inability to comprehend the changed Pakistani strategy and undertake counter measures. The prevalent thinking in New Delhi was that Islamabad would repeat its 1948 and 1965 strategies. With Zia, the radicalisation of Kashmiri society proceeded at a feverish pace. The Inter-service Intelligence created a network of informers and sympathisers who penetrated every state government department. Infiltration and exfiltration routes were identified. Slowly weapons training along with ideological brainwashing began to be imparted in camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. By 1988 the trickle had become a flood. All that was required of Ms. Bhutto was to give the underground movement a green light with her azadi speech. Between Ms. Bhutto's first and second terms, Islamabad was unable to push its Kashmir strategy because political stability returned to New Delhi. Further, militancy in the valley had come dangerously close to despondency as New Delhi remained unperturbed by terrorist attacks that included bombing police headquarters and numerous kidnappings. Increased international attention had started bringing about a change in the perception of the human rights organisations. They began looking upon militant groups as violators. Amnesty International, the United States state department and Asia Watch began taking notice. Towards the end of the presidency of Mr. George Bush, the threat of being labelled a state sponsor of terrorism loomed large. In a bid to wiggle out of this unhappy turn of events Islamabad began "privatising" the terror drive, bringing in fundamentalist parties as intermediaries to provide money, material and boost the morale of the militants. This transition was taking place at a time when a power struggle between the president and prime minister diverted Islamabad from the Kashmir effort. In Ms. Bhutto's second term Islamabad's options had narrowed considerably. Militancy by itself was not capable of wrenching the state out of the Union. The militants were becoming demoralised. New recruits were becoming difficult to find. As a result, Islamabad had to relocate unemployed Afghan mercenaries into the valley in greater numbers to keep the pressure going. Continuation of the existing strategy allowed Mr. Sharif to get an upper hand in the domestic political tussle. There was no other option for Ms. Bhutto other than to internationalise the dispute. She had to do something radically different to gain the high ground and boost the militants. In this effort she was fortunate to find unexpected help from Ms. Robin Raphel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state in charge of the newly created south Asia bureau. Ms. Raphel had sought to reopen old controversies by disputing the legality of the Instrument of Accession, equating civil war in Afghanistan with insurgency in Kashmir. The strategy adopted by the Benazir government has been to get as much exposure for its new stance. It tries to highlight the human rights facet of the Kashmir issue. By pushing this angle, Islamabad has hoped to capitalise upon international concern for human rights. It was therefore logical she would pursue a multi-pronged strategy. She sought the Organisation of Islamic Conference's help, on grounds that Muslims were being "martyred" in the valley. In the larger and non-religious fora, like the UN General Assembly and the human rights commission, she sought to place Islamabad's charges on a secular plane. By attempting to turn up international pressure through the passage of a resolution in Geneva next week, Islamabad hopes to justify the other element of its strategy--the accession of the state of Pakistan. In the coming days Islamabad's strategy will be to continue keeping Kashmir in the international spotlight, create hysteria in the West so that it could emerge as the fount of a nuclear conflagration and seek to give the Kashmiri secessionists the legitimacy of a national liberation movement. The task before the Indian polity is one of monumental proportions. A combined effort must be made to send out an equivocal message of the inherent strength and determination of the nation to rise to any occasion. This could deter the building up of further pressure. But the most suitable rebuff to Islamabad's campaign would be the initiation of a political dialogue in the valley. *
