[Bukowska] Does the fact that the leaders of the Moscow August [as heard] coup have been set free change in any way our relations with Russia? Can this be seen as a threat to the partnership and to our relations in general? [Olechowski] It can constitute a threat to everyone because it seems the situation in Russia is once again becoming tense. Again there is conflict between the president and parliament. There is no way one can tell how things will develop, whether they will move toward some sort of national accord--although it is not known what the basis for such accord would be--or whether the situation will develop toward confrontation. I am afraid that news developments will keep us in suspense. However, fundamental and neighbourly relations cannot be ruined of course. They will be influenced by the fact that we cannot afford to--how to put it--be completely open in this situation with regard to Russia, which we could be today in different circumstances; provided we were internally convinced and without any doubt that we have sorted out our own problems with regard to relations with the West, that we knew were we were going and what our place was. [Bukowska] You talk about openness. Isn't it that Russia is constantly trying to exert pressure on us and on European policy in general. Isn't it the case that Russia wants a situation where nothing can happen without it. Is our concept of foreign policy toward Russia perhaps too soft? One reads these commentaries that you are simply too soft as far as Russia is concerned... [Olechowski] No, it is not like this. As I said, we know where we want to be, that we want to be part of the European Community, NATO, and western European institutions. The fact that Russia does not like it, that Russia does not generally like these institutions is understandable. Russia is a great country and a superpower. It has a different perception of the world and, of course, would like to have an impact on everything. It is understandable. A great country thinks in a different way than a small country. This does not mean that we have to change our way of thinking because our big neighbour thinks this way. No, and that is why we have no hesitations here. We are not faltering here. We are walking toward the West firmly and at a steady pace each day, and we do not have to talk about this with Russia because we are not moving in the direction of Russia. [Bukowska] Thank you very much for the interview.
