Nikola Sainovic said on Friday that the F.R.Y. basic policy of peace, security and economic revival was being administered despite hardships, sanctions and war encirclement. In a talk with managers of the biggest enterprises in Pristina, centre of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija, Sainovic emphasized that the Yugoslav economic program differed from those in other countries which have similar economic problems because it enables strong resistance to sanctions and economic pressures and essentially defends the country's economic independence. Basically, said Sainovic, this model program means reliance upon one's own potential, and this holds good for the country as a whole and for the level of enterprises. The exit from the crisis, said he, is the same for the big business systems as well as small-sized enterprises. The two-year-old U.N.-imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia cannot be an excuse for any one within the economy any longer, because adequate solutions to such problems should have been found in the meantime, said Sainovic. The program of reinvigoration of the Yugoslav economy, enforced early January, relies upon a restrictive monetary policy, a reform of the taxation system, amd the elimination of huge budgetary deficits. Sainovic said it was necessary to change an old habit of giving "special discounts" to the less developed regions and to certain public enterprises. There are no such discounts any longer, but what has to be done is to work together and to jointly seek solutions to the problems, through assistance extended by other enterprises, said Sainovic in stressing that his present talks in Pristina entirely differed from the way talks were held in the past when this province had only been demanding aid from the federal budget. Kosovo and Metohija, a region with abundant natural resources, in the former Yugoslavia had been heavily subsidised (as the least developed region with the highest unemployment rate) from the special fund for the country's less developed regions.
