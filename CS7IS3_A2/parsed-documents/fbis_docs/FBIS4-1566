Through the media here, the members of the panel answered some questions which have aroused suspicions among public servants in Hong Kong. The panel noted that according to Article 100 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, public servants in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the police department, working before July 1, 1997, can continue their work in the Government of the Hong Kong SAR. The panel noted that today's achievements in Hong Kong are the results of high-quality public service and an effective system governing public servants in Hong Kong. The members of the panel sincerely expect public servants now working in all of Hong Kong's departments to continue their service for the SAR Government and the people in Hong Kong. The panel noted that according to Article 101, foreigners can be employed as public servants, but not chief officials, in Hong Kong Government departments after 1997. However, foreign employees must hold permanent identity cards of the region or be working in public service in Hong Kong before 1997. According to the Basic Law, foreigners cannot become heads or deputy heads of major departments of the government after 1997. The chief secretary, the commissioner of police, director of the Customs Office, chief judges of the Court of Final Appeal and Supreme Court in Hong Kong must be Chinese after 1997. On the question of pay, allowances and benefits, the panel noted that according to the Basic Law, public servants serving in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the police department, before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, may all remain in employment and retain their seniority with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of service no less favorable than before. The Government of the Hong Kong SAR shall pay to public servants who retire or who leave the service in compliance with regulations before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, or to their dependants, all pensions, gratuities, allowances and benefits due to them no less favorable than before. On the question of the "Plan of the Right of Abode in Britain," the panel noted that the Chinese Government's solemn stance against "The Plan of the Right of Abode in Britain" is not to the individuals who have gained the right, but to the British Government's practice and political attempt which violated the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. It noted that the public servants who have gained the right can continue to work in the government of the Hong Kong SAR after 1997, but their so-called "identity of British citizens" will not be recognized by the Chinese Government and they cannot enjoy the British counsel protection in the Hong Kong SAR and other areas in China. The panel said that such people cannot serve as chief officials in the government of the Hong Kong SAR. The panel also said that the saying of Chinese armed police to be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997 is groundless. [sentence as received] According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR Government will take charge of public security in the Hong Kong SAR. The Chinese armed police will not be sent to Hong Kong after 1997.
