The military claim that this is the victory won by deterrence. Positive screening test results dropped from 18.1 percent in 1989 to 5.8 percent in 1993. A "conquest": a euphoric atmosphere prevails at the Army's Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. The personnel exhibit the declining figures on drug consumption as if a method for recovery from drug addiction with proven success had been found. "Soon, we'll reach three percent, and without coercive action." Major Mario Pragosa, chief of the Clinical Pathology Service at the Principal Military Hospital, where the laboratory analyzing the urine collected in the barracks is installed, emphasizes this to DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS]. The annual trends in positive samples revealing drug consumption indicate an enormous reduction since 1989, when the Army, simultaneously with the Air Force, implemented the program to prevent and combat drugs and alcoholism in the Portuguese Armed Forces, years after the Navy had initiated its own tests. In 1989, the first year of the testing, 18 percent of the 1,462 individuals analyzed revealed drug consumption. Since then, the percentage has not stopped falling: 11.4 percent positive among 4,445 members of the military in 1990; 10.7 percent among 4,920 individuals in 1991; 9.1 percent among 4,568 tested in 1992; and 5.8 percent among the 7,465 analyzed last year. Deterring Tests This indicator of a reduction in drug consumption is all the more surprising when one realizes that it has not stopped rising among the civilian society. According to Mario Pragosa, however, the deterring power of the tests is what is mainly responsible for this decline occurring among youths aged between 18 and 21 years. "The results have a great psychological effect, and no one wants the stigma of being a drug addict. The same thing is happening in the United States. Within 10 years, they managed to reduce the figure from 46 to 3.5 percent," he argues. Other factors could be associated with it: "There is more information, prevention, and carefulness in detecting drugs in the barracks." The prevention begins in the units, through officers trained in courses on preventing and deterring consumption given at the Armed Forces' School of Health, and created to supplement the surveillance program. This program defines the dangers involved in the use of toxic substances in the Armed Forces: "The promotion of drug use among members of the military institution, as a deliberate act, or for trafficking purposes, can have very serious consequences, specifically, for military security, as well as negative effects on the Armed Forces' discipline and operativeness." It maintains: "The soldier taking drugs or overdoing alcohol consumption jeopardizes the security of personnel, materiel, installations, and intelligence, as well as the organization's overall health. This entails grave consequences for the performance of missions, and for the Armed Forces' prestige." In 1993, the drugs most consumed and detected by the tests were still in the cannabinoids group (76 percent), followed by cannabinoids combined with opiates (13.5 percent), opiates (7.8 percent), and various other combinations (2.7 percent). According to the official in charge of the tests, the trends in the drugs most used indicate that the cannabinoids are being used less (in 1991, they accounted for 83.6 percent of the total consumption). However, the combination of cannabinoids and opiates (which was 8.2 percent in that same year) is rising. Most of the urine tests are made on youths who have been recruited, as well as among volunteers and those requesting a deferment of their period of stay in the Armed Forces. However, soldiers in the regular military ranks do not escape this checking, which is random and without a set day or date. Nevertheless, Mario Pragosa claims: "I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of cases of drug addiction" among career troops: equivalent to 0.05 percent. [passage omitted] [Box, p 20] - The cannabinoids remain the drugs most consumed among the youths performing their compulsory military service. - Consumption is prevented on the unit level through officers who have taken specialized courses at the Armed Forces School of Health. - The military want to reduce the consumption rate to 3 percent. And they are gratified by the fact that these results will be accrued without coercive measures. - The number of soldiers subjected to tests has gradually increased since 1989. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug Consumption in the Army | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The cannabinoids remain the drug most consumed by recruits in compulsory mil-| |itary service. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |18.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |11.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |10.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |9.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |5.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Army Analytical Toxicology Laboratory | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
