It is already clear today that this most prominent political personality of the first years of post-November Slovakia has influenced the developmental direction of our country at least until the end of the millennium in a decisive manner, irrespective of the future fate of V. Meciar, as well as the Slovak Republic. In contrast to ourselves, who are Meciar's contemporaries, the historians of future decades will have an easier task because they will already have the results of his political activities to benefit (or to the detriment of) Slovakia and its inhabitants before them, and, moreover, in contrast to ourselves, they will be able to approach the evaluation of V. Meciar's activities more objectively and with less partiality than is the case today. That is because we, the contemporaries of Meciar, can be divided either into his unreserved friends, allies, or followers or into crystal-clear opponents or even enemies. The fact that today it is difficult to find people in Slovakia who take a different, say, neutral, position with respect to this politician, is symptomatic. The "Meciar phenomenon" has brought about a situation in which a (diminishing) part of the population feels that he is the personification of everything that is good, positive, whereas the other portion of the population, on the contrary, tends to view him as the personification of everything evil, negative, which is a phenomenon that can be connected with the personality of the politician. Foreign political scientists and publicists virtually consider V. Meciar to be one of the charismatic, authoritarian politicians who have emerged in the postcommunist countries of Europe during the first years following the demise of the totalitarian regimes and who will, after a time, be replaced by a different type of politician (in the event these countries undergo democratic development), representing other methods of engaging in politics and governing in the country. The necessity for the departure of such politicians from the political life is justified on the basis of their inability to secure political stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in the countries that they govern, or rather that they previously governed. However, foreign political scientists point out that such politicians are generally not willing to recognize their failures and depart on their own on that basis, which generally still further complicates the situation in their countries and which, as shown by the Georgian experiences, for example, can even lead to a catastrophe. I hope that Slovakia is not threatened with such a development, but the fact that many foreign observers already categorize Slovakia among the internally unstabilized East European countries with hard-to-predict developments is an alarming fact. At the same time, however, it is also the logical culmination of our development thus far, mostly of the fact that Slovakia has hitherto not proven able to come to terms with the consequences of its previous "historical traumatizations," irrespective of whether these included the Magyarization, Czechoslovakism, populism, or Stalinist socialism. Even for that reason we must deal with the "Meciar phenomenon" today.
