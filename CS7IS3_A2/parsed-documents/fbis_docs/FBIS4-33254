As had been expected even by the representatives of the government's privatization commission, the two auctions failed for lack of interest. Commission President Andre Montoro Filho has announced that the process of privatizing those two firms will be reevaluated next Monday. He will wait for the conclusion of negotiations between employees of the mining company and the Arbi Group's Caraiba Metals firm, the largest buyer of copper from the mining company. "Depending on the results of those talks, we may schedule another auction within 30 or 40 days," he says. The Caraiba Mining Company, whose head office is in Bahia, was being offered at a minimum price of $5.2 million, with the purchaser also being required to pay a fine of $3 million if he decided to shut down the company mine in less than five years. Cobra -- The commission will also examine a few alternatives with the Bank of Brazil for privatizing Cobra Computers, which has now been put up for auction at the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange for the second time without attracting a buyer. The minimum price was set at $12 million. The firm owes the Bank of Brazil $10 million in addition to its $11.2 million in labor debts. Montoro Filho has said that the government-owned firm will be liquidated only as a last resort and that before that happens, the possibility of incorporating it into the Bank of Brazil itself will be examined. Braz Magno da Silva, who represents the employees, has announced that he has obtained approval from the institution itself to negotiate the purchase of the firm.

Debts Prevent Sale The past 40 days alone have seen the postponement of auctions for the privatization of three government-owned firms: Brazilian Lloyd--for which there were no buyers on 30 March--Cobra Computers, which has been put on sale twice without success, and Caraiba Mining, which also attracted no bids at yesterday's auction. One of the difficulties in selling those firms is their high level of indebtedness. To take control of Lloyd, for example, a buyer will have to cope with a debt exceeding $100 million. Another auction to try to sell Lloyd is scheduled for 11 May. The firms in question are viewed by the financial market as the program's real wallflowers. According to some analysts, what future buyers really want is the ability to earn a return on their investment -- that is, firms that will show a profit in the future. What happens in the case of firms with little to commend them is that the government often prefers to give them one last chance before liquidating them, since liquidation entails social problems. But the thing that is behind these successive failures is the sluggishness of the privatization process. Consultants and executives in the financial market complain that since taking office in October 1992, President Itamar Franco has not added any names to the list of government-owned firms to be sold. All the privatizations taking place in recent months have involved government-owned firms whose sale was already scheduled by the Collor administration. Delay -- The director of the Trevisan and Associates consulting firm, Joao Antonio Lopes, recalls that since the PQU (Union Petrochemicals) was sold in January of this year, there have been no more auctions of important firms. The market also suspects that the sale of Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] on the 20th of this month may be postponed. "There is a very big delay in establishing the direction the program will take. Moreover, there is no interest in buying firms that are in debt or technologically backward," says Joao Antonio. Luiz Chrysostomo de Oliveira, former superintendent of privatization at the BNDES [National Economic and Social Development Bank], feels, however, that the failure of the last two auctions has not jeopardized the privatization program. What may stall the process is the administration's lack of a clear political will to sell government-owned firms. Chrysostomo also observed that another factor is Congress' retreat from voting on economic topics in connection with constitutional revision. "Failure to approve the law on the concession of public utilities, the greater flexibility of the telecommunications and petroleum monopolies, and the electric power industry may harm the privatizations," Chrysostomo said. Ricardo Fernandez, director of the BFC [expansion not given] Bank, says the market is worried about the continuity of the privatization process. "The government recently managed to sell Arafertil. The reason it was unable to auction off the two firms yesterday was that they really do not interest anyone. Cobra, for example, lags far behind in technology, and Lloyd has a lot of debts. The firms constituting the `filet mignon' of the privatization process are yet to come," says Fernandez. Program Losing Speed The privatization program, which began under the Sarney administration and picked up speed during the Collor era, was established to reduce the state's presence in the economy and provide an opportunity for more investment in the fields of health, education, and infrastructure. Many of the firms had been privately owned at one time but were later absorbed by the government through the BNDES to prevent their liquidation. The bank was a sort of first-aid clinic for the firms. That was the case with Caraiba Metals and Mafersa, for example. During the Sarney era, the man in charge of many of those privatizations was engineer Marcio Fortes. In the Collor era, it was the turn of economist Eduardo Modiano, another former president of the BNDES. The privatization of such firms as Usiminas (1991) and the CSN (1993) was marked by court injunctions and protests in the streets by workers. Those protests were seen abroad in pictures of street riots carried by the world's principal TV networks. Then came a decline. Since President Itamar took office, only 14 government-owned firms have been sold: three were fertilizer manufacturers, three were steel companies, and the others were in the petrochemical industry. But all of them were already included in the PND (National Privatization Program) inherited from the Collor era. Itamar has not added any new firms to the list. The criticism most frequently heard from businessmen, consultants, and bankers is that the process is moving ahead much more slowly under the Itamar administration. There are those on the economic team itself who claim that the resistance is coming much more from Planalto Palace than from the left-wing parties. One of the "stars" on that team recently went so far as to say that the "Juiz de Fora gang" was not committed to moving ahead with the program. The problem is that to improve the government's cash situation, it is reportedly essential to have the money from the sale of government-owned firms, which can contribute to investments and, chiefly, help pay off the national debt.
