Speaking before the Labor's dovish Mashov circle, Beilin said that the move should begin at the Histadrut labor federation by merging Hayim Ramon's list with Labor and should extend to all the other activities by the parties. "We would have an 80-percent majority in the Histadrut and 56 Knesset seats, which would make us as dominant as the Labor Movement was at its peak," Beilin said. According to him, past differences between Meretz and Labor no longer exist. He added that a merger now would allow Ramon to implement all the reforms he has planned as Histadrut secretary general, with Labor assisting him. [passage omitted] Knesset Member Ya'el Dayan rejected Beilin's idea, saying that a merger is possible only between Meretz and the Labor doves. Any other combination would only cause a rift, she said. She believes there is room for such a merger in the Histadrut, but talk of a merger on the parliamentary level is premature.

She said it is still early to determine if such a union is plausible. Yosi Sarid said the Meretz parties should unite first, before considering a union with Labor." The report adds that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin criticized Beilin for the remark, saying his timing, following the Histadrut elections, could not have been worse. Rabin said a joint Labor-Meretz party would alienate middle-of-the-road voters. Without the support of those voters, he said, the new Israeli democratic party would be destined for the opposition."]
