FBIS4-1125 "drafr078_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA PAC Leader: `No Chance' of Alliance With ANC PAC Leader: `No Chance' of Alliance With ANC MB2204072094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0120 GMT 22 Apr 94 MB2204072094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by C Govender] [Text] Durban April 21 SAPA -- An upbeat Clarence Makwetu took the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] election trail to Durban on Thursday [21 April] night, promising free housing and land to the deprived masses. Addressing Indian businessmen in Shallcross, south of Durban, Mr Makwetu urged business to support his organisation in the interests of democracy "unless you want to see a one-party state emerge". He said there was no chance of an alliance between the African National Congress and the PAC as there were elements in the ANC that were not committed to democracy. "We urge an attitude of change. We hope to gain material support from you." On perceptions that the PAC was a racist political organisation, Mr Makwetu said his party was not against whites but against white domination. Membership of the PAC "is and has always been open to all human beings. To say it is open to (black) Africans only is nonsense". "One's skin colour will not buy leadership in our organisation." He reiterated that the PAC stood for the redistribution of land from privileged landowners to the rural masses. "The problem stems from deprivation of land and from concentration of land. Those who control the land control the people." He said a programme of restitution had to involve land ownership in order to aid suitable rural development, but he cautioned that no land reform programme was possible without government co-operation. PAC strategy was to utilise land to its optimum. Mr Makwetu warned that any other approach would unleash a "torrential force the likes of which none of us has seen". Clarifying the PAC's stance on "Africans" Mr Makwetu said anyone who owed allegiance to the land and believed in the PAC's principles could be regarded as African. "We believe there is only one race -- the human race." The slogan "one settler, one bullet" was not PAC policy but merely a slogan of the armed struggle which the PAC had abandoned. It would take some time for the slogan to disappear. He suggested that "settler" was not a PAC word but one derived from whites themselves. "In Grahamstown there is the 1820 settlers monument. The road to Cape Town's airport is called Settlers Way and a small town outside Pretoria is called Settlers."
