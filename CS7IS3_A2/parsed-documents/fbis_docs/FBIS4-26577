"Sharp rises in international oil and commodity prices in recent weeks have inflicted increasing inflationary pressure on Taiwan," said K.C. Li, a department director at the Council for Economic Planning and Development. Chinese Petroleum Corp., a state monopoly, is considering raising prices for its products by an average of 3 percent in July because its crude oil import cost has risen to US$16 per barrel, exceeding its original estimate of US$14.50. Li said the proposed oil price hike may trigger a wave of adjustments of prices for many other products and services. In addition, the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar against the U.S. greenback over the past few months has added up to domestic inflationary pressure, Li noted. The consumer price index grew at an annual rate of 4.33 percent in May, far exceeding the government-set 3.5 percent ceiling, and the import price index grew 5.07 percent -- a three-year high. If the trend continues, Li said, the domestic inflation rate will far surpass the 3.5 percent ceiling for the year. The oil and commodity price surges, coupled with the weakening of the U.S. dollar, have triggered panic selling in major world stock markets in recent days as stock dealers react to the fear that mounting inflation may hinder the global economic recovery. In reaction to the bearish mood of international bourses, the Taiwan stock exchange's weighted price index, the market's key barometer, has fallen below the psychologically important 6.000- point barrier. Panic selling has also been seen in the local bond market, pushing up government bond yields drastically in the past few days. Against this background, Li said, the central bank must decide whether to continue its current easy credit policy to maintain moderate economic growth or to tighten its monetary policy to maintain domestic price stability. The central bank adopted an easy credit policy last July with a view to stimulating private investment and boosting economic growth. CBC officials said they are keeping close watch on recent trends in major world financial markets. "We won't lightly adjust our credit policy before making a careful, comprehensive review of economic situations at home and abroad," said a CBC official, who requested anonymity. CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said recently that the bank's top consideration in formulating monetary policy is to maintain price stability.
