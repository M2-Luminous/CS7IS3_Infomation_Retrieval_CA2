FR940620-0-00058 FR940620-0-00021 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 953 Rules of Practice in Proceedings Relative to Mailability AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises the procedures for appealing non-mailability determinations, to update, clarify, amplify, and otherwise improve them. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donna Aspell, (202) 268&hyph;5438. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A recent review of the procedural rules in 39 CFR part 953 has revealed several references that require updating and several provisions that require some rewording for further clarity. Moreover, the review has revealed that the rules could be improved by expressing heretofore implicit requirements (e.g., in §953.17, the requirement to give the Postal Service's General Counsel notice and the opportunity to respond when the appellant seeks return of matter found to be nonmailable); by amplifying requirements that were incompletely expressed (e.g., in §953.4, specifying the steps required for effecting service of notice when the appellant's address is outside the United States; and in §953.16, specifying ways in which the hearing process may be expedited); and by expressly authorizing summary judgment to dispose of cases presenting no genuine and material issues of fact. Most of the sections in part 953 have been changed or modified. Section 953.5, concerning the reply to be made by the General Counsel, is moved to §953.4; the sections following the expanded §953.4 are consequently renumbered. The text of §953.1, concerning authority for the rules, §953.14, concerning appeal from an initial decision, and §953.18, concerning ex parte communications, is carried forward unchanged in the revised rules.
