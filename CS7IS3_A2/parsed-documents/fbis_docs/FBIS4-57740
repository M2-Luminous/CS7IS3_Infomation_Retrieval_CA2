As Ortega exerted control over the party and was reelected to another three-year term as FSLN secretary general, he was able to convince his delegates to purge the leader of the Sandinist bloc, writer Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who heads a reorganizational current that identifies itself with "a Sandinist party that is returning to the majority." The "overwhelming number" of delegates loyal to Ortega also purged Commander of the Revolution Jaime Wheelock Roman, who is currently attending Harvard University in the United States. Ramirez, as well as Wheelock, were members of the FSLN National Directorate. The purge also affected the highest decisionmaking organization within the FSLN (the Sandinist Assembly), which previously had 120 members, 57 of whom (48 percent) were purged from their posts within the assembly. Some 15 new posts were created for members closely connected to the orthodox group, whose improved position in the body will have a negative effect on eight deputies, a minister in Violeta Chamorro's administration, and Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) President Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren. Some 78 percent of the highest FSLN organization are now members associated with Daniel Ortega's orthodox current. Meanwhile, the reorganizational sector only garnered 22 percent of the posts in the elections held at the Sandinist session, whereby the statutes and internal regulations of the party were reformed. The FSLN National Directorate, which previously had nine members, was enlarged to 15 members during the Congress. Tomas Borge, former interior minister during the Sandinist regime; Daniel Ortega; Bayardo Arce; Rene Nunez; Henry Ruiz; Victor Tirado Lopez; and Luis Carrion were reelected as National Directorate members. Meanwhile, Monica Baltodano, Lumberto Campbell, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Rene Vivas, and Dorotea Wilson, all from the orthodox current, as well as peasant Benigna Mendiola, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, and Mirna Cunningham, all from the reorganizational sector defeated by the conservative current headed by Daniel Ortega, were elected as new members of the Sandinist Directorate. After Sandinist bloc leader Sergio Ramirez was purged by the orthodox group, he reported hegemonic practices were carried out at the Congress, and, in turn, he informed journalists that the party is already divided, which will prompt yet another crisis within the FSLN bloc in Congress. Because of reforms to the FSLN statutes, Daniel Ortega was granted maximum authority that could even help him occupy Ramirez's seat in the Parliament, thereby replacing his main ideological enemy. This situation could trigger the division of the FSLN bloc. Only five of the 39 FSLN deputies are loyal to Daniel Ortega, which indicates that should the reelected secretary general want to install himself as chief of the FSLN legislators by ignoring the regulations established by the deputies to reelect their leader, the Sandinist bloc could join other legislative blocs that make up the Political Bloc Council, thereby leaving deputies loyal to Ortega in a minority bloc. The FSLN Special Congress also will prompt purges in the mouthpieces of the party, especially in BARRICADA, run by Carlos Fernando Chamorro Barrios (President Violeta Chamorro's son), who belongs to the reorganizational current of the FSLN. As she hinted that Ortega will appoint himself or another FSLN deputy as leader of the Sandinist bloc, Monica Baltodano, new member of the Sandinist Directorate and representative of the orthodox current, said the editorial line of the aforementioned newspaper will be revised. Only 487 of 566 national delegates attended the Sandinist Congress. Daniel Ortega is controlling most of them. Sandinist sources reported that nothing focusing on the unification of the party was discussed at the Congress, although in speeches by orthodox members, including the closing speech by Daniel Ortega himself, Ortega was depicted as an advocate of party renewal. As he talked about those purged within his party, he pointed out that these people personify the bitter results that must be accepted under Sandinist democracy. The Sandinist session, which took place at a convention center in Managua, and which was guarded by nearly 100 plainclothes and armed police officers, cost the party $350,000.
