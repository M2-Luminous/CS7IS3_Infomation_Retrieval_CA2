FR940412-1-00021 FR940412-1-00006 Table VII currently includes a footnote indicating entitlement to special monthly compensation when the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation are met. Entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 CFR 3.350(a) (38 U.S.C. 1114(k)) for total deafness is only one of many instances in which hearing loss is a factor in establishing special monthly compensation. Because the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation contained in 38 CFR 3.350 are extremely complex, we propose to delete the footnote in favor of a note following §4.85 directing rating specialists to refer to §3.350 when evaluating any claim for impaired hearing to determine whether the veteran is entitled to special monthly compensation. We believe that this will be more effective than the footnote in ensuring complete review for special monthly compensation. Sections 4.86, 4.86a, and 4.87 currently deal with tests to evaluate hearing loss, evidence of hearing loss other than puretone and controlled speech audiometry, and the definition of impaired auditory acuity. All three of these provisions are closely related to the evaluation of hearing loss and should be included in one section. We propose to state that the evaluations are designed to measure best uncorrected hearing, reflecting the accepted testing method of measuring hearing without hearing aids in place. We therefore propose to reorganize this material so that it is contained in a single section, §4.86, and to delete §4.86a. Section 4.87a has been redesignated as §4.87. Suppurative otitis media is currently classified under diagnostic code 6200, and mastoiditis under diagnostic code 6206. Since mastoiditis is often a complication of suppurative otitis media, we propose to include mastoiditis under diagnostic code 6200 and delete diagnostic code 6206. Cholesteatoma is another condition associated with suppurative otitis media, and we propose to include it under diagnostic code 6200 as well. The diagnosis of ``otitis interna,'' (diagnostic code 6203), is archaic and the medical advice we received indicates it is no longer a recognized category of disability. For this reason, we propose to delete diagnostic code 6203 from the schedule and to rate the symptoms attributed to this condition under peripheral vestibular disorders, code 6204. We propose to amend the NOTE which currently follows diagnostic code 6204 to state that objective findings supporting the diagnosis of disequilibrium are required prior to the assignment of any compensable evaluation. This requirement will preclude the use of purely subjective symptoms as the exclusive basis for payment of compensation. The words ``severe,'' ``moderate'' or ``mild'' now precede the evaluation criteria for compensable evaluations under diagnostic codes 6204 and 6205. These descriptions do not materially help to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria they precede. For that reason, we propose to delete these labels. The evaluation criteria under the diagnostic code for Meniere's disease (6205) currently require ``frequent episodes'' for an evaluation of 100 percent. We propose to clarify this ambiguous requirement by specifying that such attacks must occur more than once weekly for this level of disability since, in our judgment, such frequency would most reasonably constitute total disablement. We also propose to include the criteria of deafness to the 60 percent evaluation, since this is a common symptom of the disease. The current evaluation criteria for loss of auricle, code 6207, are unclear because they do not specify the extent of loss required to qualify for the various evaluation levels. We propose to revise the criteria to indicate that the 30 percent evaluation requires complete loss of one auricle and that the 50 percent evaluation requires complete loss of both. This is consistent with the current instructions for the 10 percent evaluation which require a quantifiable loss of one-third or more of one auricle. Because of the likelihood of serious disablement and the severe side effects which chemotherapy and radiation treatment produce in the average person, we propose to assign a 100 percent evaluation under the diagnostic code for malignancies (6208), with the total evaluation continuing after the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic or other theraputic procedure. We propose to continue the total evaluation under this code indefinitely after treatment is discontinued, and to examine the veteran six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant a reduction in evaluation, the reduction would be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). This method has the advantage of offering the veteran timely notice of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), the opportunity to present evidence showing that the action should not be taken. This is consistent with evaluation of malignancies which we have proposed in other parts of the Schedule. The evaluation for benign neoplasms of the ear (diagnostic code 6209) currently instructs the rater to evaluate the condition based on impairment of function, with a minimum evaluation of 10 percent. Likewise, there is an instruction to add 10 percent to the evaluation for residuals of malignant new growths. We propose to delete these minimum evaluations. Advances in reconstructive surgery have reduced the disability associated with this condition and loss of function is the most accurate way of evaluating the residuals of this condition. Since any disability sufficient to warrant a compensable evaluation would be noted on VA examination, a minimum evaluation is no longer appropriate. The evaluation for tinnitus (diagnostic code 6260) currently requires that the condition be ``persistent'' in order to qualify for a 10 percent evaluation. Tinnitus is a subjective sensation which, under certain circumstances, comes and goes. The word ``persistent'' suggests a meaning of constant, and we propose to replace it with ``recurrent,'' meaning that the tinnitus might not always be present, but that it does return at regular intervals. Requiring that tinnitus be ``recurrent'' will allow a realistic evaluation of the typical disablement from this condition.
