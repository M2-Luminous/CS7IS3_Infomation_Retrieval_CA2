[Kovac] We discussed this matter with each other and reached the same conclusion: that it was necessary to make it easier for the president to make a decision about our dismissal from the cabinet, because if we do not make it easier for him, the confrontation between the castle and the cabinet might grow more serious. We do not see any sense in this. Both of us entered political life with the intention of seeking a consensus and a certain moderate attitude. If we continue to insist on our original stance, we think we would be betraying these principles. [Tvarozek] Does this mean that you are also submitting your resignation? [Kovac] Yes, I am. I am going to see the president tomorrow to submit my resignation. [Tvarozek] A short while ago, you said--it was in this room-- that it would mean that you had admitted your own mistakes if you resigned. [Kovac] I insist that I have not made any mistakes great enough for me to leave the government because of them. This means that I insist that I have performed my work according to my abilities, and I am not convinced that I have performed badly. Despite this, I think that this step is necessary in the interests of calming down the situation in Slovakia. There is no point in increasing tension. [Tvarozek] Is this not, for example, caused by the situation in the government being such that a new political entity--if we may call it that--would obstruct the government line and the program that the government has planned? [Kovac] I am not altogether convinced that it is because of this. I truly think that a government in which the prime minister cannot cooperate with his deputy prime minister because the former proposed that the latter resign--thereby, in effect, demonstrating that he cannot cooperate--I would find it very difficult to work in such a government if I stayed in my post. If a political entity comes into being, it will be a political entity that is based on the program principles that were declared by the Movement [for a Democratic Slovakia], but which could not be fulfilled. [Tvarozek] Are your further ambitions of a political or a professional nature? [Kovac] It is very difficult to give up responsibility for political development. I did not enter into top-level politics but into trade union politics and then transferred to so-called top-level politics. Because I entered political life, I had the duty to represent the views of a certain group of people, the people who elected me, the citizens who believed me. This was expressed in very beautiful letters, for which I thank the people who have morally supported me in this situation. I think that it would be irresponsible toward them to leave the political scene completely. [Tvarozek] Let us decipher this: Do you plan to establish a new political entity? [Kovac] I am considering this possibility.
