Before leaving Moscow the Russian foreign minister stressed there could be no question of partnership between senior and junior; partners must move toward the same goals. There cannot be more freedom for one to the detriment of the other. In any case, it must be a bilateral approach, Kozyrev noted. He rejected suppositions that relations have begun to cool between the United States and Russia. There can be differences of interests within the partnership sphere, the minister noted.
