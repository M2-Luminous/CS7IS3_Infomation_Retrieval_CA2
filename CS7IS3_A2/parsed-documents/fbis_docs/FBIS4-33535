FBIS4-33535 "drlat110bb_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS Uruguayan Minister on Chile Joining Mercosur Uruguayan Minister on Chile Joining Mercosur PY0706135394 Montevideo Radio Carve in Spanish 0000 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0706135394 Montevideo Radio Carve Spanish BFN [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told Radio Carve that Uruguay favors including Chile in Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The minister participated in the meeting Mercosur-member country representatives held a few hours ago with the Chilean foreign minister. Abreu is participating in the OAS meeting being held in Belem, Brazil. [Begin recording] [Abreu] Well, the meeting that was proposed by the Chilean foreign minister presupposes the political intention of strengthening trade ties and relations with Mercosur. This is contemplated in the Treaty of Asuncion, in other words, that any country can become an associate as long as it does not belong to a subregional agreement, and this is the case with Chile. But Chile's proposal presupposes the beginning of negotiations at the technical and political levels that can lead us step by step to an incorporation that will give credibility, strength, and projection to Mercosur in that the four countries comply with all its obligations and, of course, are accepted by the partners that wish to join it afterward. [Unidentified reporter] The other case is Haiti, which has caused concern in both the region and the entire world. [Abreu] Well, within the political sphere we all know about the international repercussions that the violation of human rights by the military government has had in Haiti and especially the actions that go against the compliance with obligations that have been assumed for the restoring of a democratic system. We are discussing this subject and there are proposals from some of the countries, but Uruguay is maintaining a solid position regarding the need for restoring democracy, but fundamentally based on an unrestricted respect for the principle of nonintervention, which is one of the legal bases of the inter-American system, and which also happens to be one of Uruguay's purest traditions in the matter of international law.
