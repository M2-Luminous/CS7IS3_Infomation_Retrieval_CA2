Concurrently, there are ever larger discrepancies in statistical data between China and the world's major trading partners which create more trade friction. Towards this end, the author explores the causes of and methods for resolving statistical discrepancies produced in country-to-country trade from the perspective of international trade statistical theory and methods. In awaiting a correct conclusion, this publication welcomes manuscripts from many statistical experts and scholars in hopes of further discussion and research on the issue. Following rapid development of China's foreign trade in recent years, there have been ever larger disparities in statistical data between China and the world's major trading partners. The trend is increasing. The issue of bilateral statistical figure disparities is common worldwide in inter-country trade, for example, between the United States and Japan, Japan and Germany, Germany and the United States, or France and Canada. Many reasons account for the disparities, such as different trade statistic principles, the scope of trade statistics, trade record systems, ad valorem standards, currency conversion standards or different statistical time periods. Trade statistic principles are the fundamental cause of bilateral trade statistic disparities. I. Trade Statistic Disparities Created by Using Producer-Consumer Country Statistical Accounting Principles At present most countries and regions in the world use the country of origin as the import statistical accounting principle and the end-user (destination) country as the export statistical accounting principle (abbreviated as producer-consumer country). China's import and export statistics published overseas also are like this. A. Implications of producer-consumer country statistical principle. Country of origin generally refers to the producing country of agricultural products, the country extracting mineral products (entirely or partially), or the manufacturer of manufactured products. For example, with partial manufacture it usually is understood that country of origin refers to the country responsible for the final stage of the manufacturing operation before a commodity takes final form. Consumer country refers to the ultimate consuming, using or further processing country of a said commodity at the time of transport, including commercial transactions which occur in intermediary countries. B. Advantages and disadvantages of producer-consumer statistical principle 1. According to country of origin statistical analysis of imports, it is advantageous to indicate the direct relationship between the producing and importing countries. Such material is essential for managing import quotas and implementing differential duties. The basis for determining country of origin comes from the regulation of place of origin. Countries which use place of origin regulations both must determine exported commodities from their own country and also utilize place of origin regulations to determine the place of origin of imported commodities. The role of country of origin statistics is more prominent under current conditions of emphasizing fair trade and stronger trade protectionism. Place of origin regulations themselves are a type of trade policy or means of trade management. They are preferential treatment given by one country to another or standards for determining quantity restrictions on imported commodities (such as textile quotas and other commodity quotas). As for some developed countries, they also restrict foreign investment enterprises which produce, process or assemble products from using its status in the country to seize its markets. For example, the EC strictly regulates Japanese processing and assembly enterprises (which are called "screwdriver factories") on its territory; certain products are only considered EC products when more than 50 percent of added value is done in the EC. The United States has established automobile parts enterprises in Canada and Canada has stipulated that products must have a relatively high proportion of added value before they can be considered to be Canadian products. The aim of such practices is to reduce situations where the country itself has no foreign exchange income but wants to assume a trade surplus. To a certain extent such practices naturally restrict the inflow of foreign investment. Used for export statistics, the concept of "consumer country" mainly is to understand the relationship between producer country and importing country. 2. The main disadvantage of the producer-consumer country principle. Considered from the aspect of country of origin, country of origin regulation standards differ in stipulations because various countries have different degrees of industrialization and different trade policies. There is still no binding international pact. For example, regarding country of origin, besides tallying with the definition of country of origin stated by the United Nations, the major developed countries, in particular with regard to determination of country of origin for countries partially manufacturing finished products, stipulate that processed products should have a rather high proportion of added value (varying 40 to 60 percent). That is to say, country of origin must at the same time possess two conditions: responsibility for the final stage of manufacturing and added value proportion (actual proportions of various countries differ). Some countries take the country responsible for a commodity's final stage of manufacture just prior to its ultimate form as the major determinant. A commodity's added value proportion (generally speaking, the added value proportion is comparatively low, at around 25 to 30 percent) is the determinant only when it is impossible to determine the final manufacturing country. Ordinarily, country of origin determination for an imported commodity is based on the customs declaration form filled out by the importer. The importing country uses its own country of origin regulations to determine only when questionable. Obviously, although use of country of origin principle statistics for imports accords with international custom, it actually has created difficulties in comparing statistics between countries. Considering the consumer country's perspective, a country often cannot determine a commodity's ultimate consuming country because it is extremely difficult to record accurately, particularly when goods are not directly shipped to the importing country from the producing country. A country often cannot determine a commodity's ultimate consumer country. It is also difficult to make determinations from statistical origin evidence (customs declaration forms). Furthermore, one country's statistical boundaries may not extend to other countries and regions. Therefore, material on consumer country statistics on exports actually are very incomplete and inaccurate. 3. The serious insufficiency of adopting the consumer country principle for statistics also lies in that if goods are not imported directly from the producing country, there is no way for the exporting and importing countries to have corresponding statistics for the same goods. Thus it is harmful to comparing statistics among partnering countries. Analyses of trade conditions with such statistical information, in particular analyses of international income and expenditure situations, will play a harmful role. An example of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade statistics: According to Chinese statistics , if it is known that the consumer country of a batch of goods is the United States at the time of export, it is listed as U.S. export statistics. If a batch of goods is known to be headed for Hong Kong at the time of export, it can only be listed as Hong Kong export statistics. As for this batch of products later being transshipped from Hong Kong to the United States without China's knowledge, then naturally there is no way to list it statistically as exports for the United States. According to U.S. statistics, if a good is produced in China, regardless of whether it is directly imported from China or via Hong Kong, country of origin import statistics uniformly list it as an import from China. Thus, U.S. export figures greatly exceed Chinese statistics to the United States. Likewise this applies to goods flowing in the opposite direction. Obviously the more Chinese commodities in entrepot trade through Hong Kong, the greater the disparity in figures with countries concerned. 2. Comparatively large added value of Chinese commodities in entrepot trade through Hong Kong expands trade statistic disparities with countries concerned. Chinese commodities have comparatively large added value after entrepot trade through Hong Kong; information indicates that added value rates are higher than 50 percent. Because entrepot trade belongs to the category of third-country (region) trade activity, it does not cause "an increases or decreases in the quantity of material resources" of the exporting country (the UN definition of trade). Thus the added value portion is not entered into the trade statistics of the exporting country. However according to the importing country's origin standards, they are still considered to be commodities of China. Thus they actually are considered imports from China in importing country statistics, producing figure discrepancies. Chinese commodities transshipped via Hong Kong mainly are headed for the United States, Germany and Italy. It clearly is irrational that entrepot commodity added value artificially enlarges trade surplusses with these countries. 3. Suggestions for resolving the matter Of the above two major causes for discrepancies in trade statistics between China and countries concerned, the producer-consumer country statistical accounting principle is the fundamental cause. The issue of bilateral trade statistic discrepancies presently complicates bilateral trade negotiations. It is imperative to resolve the issue. I believe that the following are considerations. 1. Reappraise standards for belonging to trade partnerships and select more scientific and rational statistical principles differing by country. Regarding trade partner countries, the United Nations book, Concepts of International Trade Statistics, notes that one can select country of origin, dispatch country, or country purchased from for imports, and consumer country, destination country or purchasing country for exports. For imports and exports together there are nine types of trade partnership country combinations in all. Except for "country purchased from/purchasing country," which is denied by the United Nations, all the other combinations are recommended by the United Nations. At present relatively many countries in theory use the "country of origin/country of consumption" principle because of economic system and trade management needs, ease of statistical accounting, or tradition. From the analysis above, it is evident that although the "country of origin/country of consumption" principle is convenient for trade management, it is harmful to international comparability of trade statistics. Moreover, 70 years have passed since proposal of this principle; it is unsuited to the contemporary ever-increasing growth of international entrepot trade. For export statistics of "country of consumption" in particular, since it is difficult to track and determine the country of consumption, actually some countries gradually have begun to use the "destination country" concept. That is, for imports they use country of origin and for exports, "destination country." However, this principle is unable to eliminate the matter of poor international comparability. Besides recording a country's international import and export situation, an important role of international trade statistics is in making international comparisons. At present the issue of international incomparability weakens the role of trade statistics. Thus it is necessary to reappraise and select criteria for belonging to trade partnerships. Use of "dispatch country/destination country" criteria can eliminate the incomparability of international trade statistics. In the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the first refers to the country which sends goods to an importing country under conditions where there is no intermediate commercial transaction whatsoever. Destination country refers to the ultimate destination of goods destined for export under conditions where there is no intermediate commercial transaction whatsoever. Arranging trade statistics by this principle accords with the United Nations' definition of international trade: namely, bringing about the movement of an increase or decrease of the stores of goods of a country (or region). According to the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the importing and exporting countries of goods both can record the same transaction of goods. If an importing country resells the goods to a third country thereafter, the importing country and the third country both have a record. The third country's statistical information can reflect the entire course of the goods. In this way, both the import and export transactions of the goods can be accurately recorded, allowing rational comparability between the trade statistics of the exporting and importing countries. 3. The "dispatch country/destination country" statistical accounting principle should be used as soon as possible. After analysing and comparing several criteria for belonging to trade partnerships, I believe that this principle is most suited to international trade statistic comparisons. Use of the producer-consumer country principle to reflect trade surplus conditions between countries is unacceptable, incorrect and irrational. Use of the "dispatch country/destination country" principle can accurately reflect the international income and expenditure situation of a country or region. Basing trade statistics on it also is beneficial to bilateral trade negotiations. For example, if Chinese commodities are sent to Hong Kong, then China considers them Hong Kong export statistics. Hong Kong statistics will reflect if Hong Kong transports them to any country at any additional value. For example, if a Chinese commodity is sent on to the United States via Hong Kong, at 50 percent added value, Hong Kong uses the "dispatch country/destination country" statistical accounting principle as an export to the United States, tallying with that of the United States' imports from Hong Kong. Therefore, use of this principle should be established as soon as possible. It is beneficial to managing international trade affairs. Of course, simple use of the principle cannot meet the needs of managing imports. Thus, while using it as a basis for comparisons between countires, country of origin records also have to be kept as the basis for ways to manage implementation of trade. 4. Establish bilateral or multilateral trade statistic coordinating organizations. At present the trade statistic discrepancy issue exists worldwide. Most countries use the producer-consumer principle which lacks comparability. Each country steadfastly believes that its own statistical figures are correct and it is difficult to resolve the matter of different figures. Towards this end, some countries have established bilateral trade statistic coordinating organizations. For example, the United States and Canada, Japan, and the ROK. In particular the United States-Canadian coordinating organization is arranged very well; it has a nearly two decade operation and improvement. Bilateral or multilateral trade statistic coordinating organizations could be established to resolve the matter of discrepancies in trade statistics between China and relevant countries. Specific analyses and comparisons of these differences allow both sides to attain a common understanding.
