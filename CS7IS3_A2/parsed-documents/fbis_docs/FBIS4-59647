[Mubarak] To mediate for peace means to prevent bloodshed and to contribute to raising the living standard of the peoples. This is particularly difficult if the relations between an occupied people and its occupiers are at issue -- the Palestinian problem, which has been waiting for a solution for 47 years. [DER SPIEGEL] The peace mediator is in danger of suffering Sisyphus' fate. [Mubarak] To live means to hope. If the sincere will to peace exists and the partners in the negotiations really make efforts, there must be a positive result. [DER SPIEGEL] For decades, there has been a state of war between Arabs and Israelis. Is better insight supposed to get the upper hand overnight? [Mubarak] Israel has lived in an atmosphere of war and unrest for a long time. I cannot imagine that the Israelis would be prepared to continue to carry such a burden. Today the whole world has realized that problems cannot be solved by war. [DER SPIEGEL] Here you are hardly speaking for all Arab leaders. [Mubarak] Those who are still talking about war today are impostors. Even Israel is building on negotiations and sits down at the negotiating table together with Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians. [DER SPIEGEL] And the results of the negotiations are disputed up to the very last minute, as was demonstrated during the spoiled ceremony in Cairo when PLO Chairman 'Arafat did not want to initial the maps of the autonomous region of Jericho. This must have rather bugged you as the patron and mediator? [Mubarak] One has to expect such things. A trifle can cause such an incident. Although the persons present looked concerned, I was sure that we would overcome the difficulty because the previous evening we had agreed on the points that caused confusion in the congress center. [DER SPIEGEL] What caused the whole turmoil? What went wrong? [Mubarak] It was the old story: The Palestinians do not trust the Israelis and the Israelis have their doubts about the Palestinians' sincerity. [DER SPIEGEL] What was the matter with the maps that 'Arafat did not accept? [Mubarak] The maps were the last topic with which we dealt the night before the signing of the agreement. Referring to security problems, the Israelis did not want to grant the Palestinians the area for Jericho that they demanded. And in the autonomous region of Gaza a 47-km long coastal strip was at issue. [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, there was no agreement on these questions? [Mubarak] Yes, a compromise was found. The Palestinians got a large coastal strip and the Israelis several kilometers of water for their security zone. But the main point was the agreement that the detailed negotiations on the area of the autonomous territories in Gaza and Jericho would be continued after the signing of the accord. [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, 'Arafat's appearance was more of a theatrical coup for the Palestinians' use? [Mubarak] The Palestinians did not have any confidence. They believed that the putting off of the matter until further negotiations was only "Sahlaa," eyewash, particularly since no such thing had indeed been recorded in the documents. [DER SPIEGEL] And how did you team the two sides up again behind the scenes? [Mubarak] Well, it took me only two minutes. I reminded Rabin and Peres of the nightly agreements. We decided that Israel would draft a letter that would be signed by Americans and Russians, the two cosponsors of the agreement, and confirm that further negotiations would be held on the area of Jericho and Gaza -- after the agreement. Thus, the problem was solved.... [DER SPIEGEL] ... and your mediation mission was also solved. [Mubarak] The negotiations that lasted for half a night were indeed strenuous. When the coastal waters of Gaza were discussed, 'Arafat shouted all the time "This is my sea." This really made me laugh. [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin was probably right when he claimed that now the world is only perceiving "the tip of the iceberg of the problems" that the Palestinians and Israelis have to overcome. [Mubarak] This is largely true. [DER SPIEGEL] Why is 'Arafat now taking his time in the implementation of the autonomy agreement? [Mubarak] What is in store for 'Arafat is tremendous. For 46 years, it was not granted to the Palestinians to take over government tasks. Now they suddenly have to deal with such unfamiliar things as agriculture, infrastructure, services, food supply, and civil servants' salaries. [DER SPIEGEL] But the PLO really had enough time to prepare itself for it. [Mubarak] I advised the Palestinians at an early stage to develop a plan on an administrative structure. But they would have come into difficulties anyway. Egypt and the other countries of the region must help the Palestinians to cope with their initial difficulties. If we hesitate here, there will be a setback. I would rather not imagine the consequences. [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps widely travelled guerrilla leader Yasir 'Arafat finds it hard to put up with the role of a better sort of provincial governor who mainly has to deal with housing and sewage problems. [Mubarak] The abrupt change from the PLO chairman to the head of government at home in Palestine is more difficult than to wage a war. Such a process takes time. [DER SPIEGEL] And 'Arafat also has to overcome the resistance of those Palestinians who think that he is Israel's Quisling. [Mubarak] I want to tell you one thing: When President al-Sadat signed the Camp David peace agreement with Israel for Egypt in 1978, all Palestinians, including 'Arafat, called him a "traitor." By Allah, this was a terrible campaign, almost a war. And what was the result? Now they call him a hero and lament: "If we had only listened to al-Sadat." A late insight. At that time, the Palestinians were only dealing with 48 smaller Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, today there are 180. 'Arafat showed courage. His decision to go to the occupied territories deserves deep respect. He knows that he has to face opposition, although part of them are people who are paid for the obstruction of peace by foreign countries. [DER SPIEGEL] Of whom do you think, of Iran and Iraq? [Mubarak] I would rather not give any names. At any rate, 'Arafat's courageous decision to negotiate a peace agreement with Israel mostly falls on fertile ground. The people are yearning for a solution of their problems. [DER SPIEGEL] In those days, for his peace agreement, al-Sadat got all his territories that were occupied by Israel. 'Arafat is still far from it. [Mubarak] Yes, yes -- but we did not get it at one go either. Al-Sadat's historic peace trip to Jerusalem took place in 1977, and only in 1982 did Israel withdraw its last troops from Sinai. We had to wait for five years. If the Palestinians had initiated the negotiation process earlier, they would have become the master of their own land long ago. [DER SPIEGEL] If we were members of militant Hamas, we would remonstrate with 'Arafat because he gets now his own stamps for the two autonomous regions, but not real Palestinian sovereignty. [Mubarak] Do you seriously expect the Palestinians to get everything at the same time? What took us Egyptians five years will also only happen in stages in the case of the Palestinians. [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be advisable to accelerate the negotiations for the final solution of the Palestinian problem? The massacre at Hebron showed the disruptive potential of extremists. [Mubarak] If the autonomy experiment is satisfactory in the next two years, the Israelis will also realize that an acceleration of the final negotiations will serve their security needs best. [DER SPIEGEL] And what will happen if the autonomy model fails? [Mubarak] This process is irrevocable, the wheel of history cannot be turned back at will. I cannot imagine that Israel will ever reintroduce occupation law in the territories that it vacated. [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Jewish settlements and the problem of East Jerusalem are still blocking the road to permanent peace. [Mubarak] Nobody can predict what will happen in the next two years. With a certain degree of mutual confidence, however, most of the problems can be settled. Palestinians and Israelis cannot afford to live in a state of war for another 50 years. We are living in a new era, the population figures are doubling, and the problems of mankind are increasing. [DER SPIEGEL] Has Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also understood the signs of the new era? [Mubarak] Yes, Hafiz al-Asad wants peace, I am convinced of it. Here the problem is also mutual distrust. [DER SPIEGEL] How can it be reduced? [Mubarak] Israel must credibly prove that it will return the whole of the Golans. In return, Syria should convince the Israelis of its preparedness for real, comprehensive peace. Apparently, after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's last visit to Damascus, things were set in motion. I hope very much that the Syrians and Israelis will come to terms before the end of the year. [DER SPIEGEL] Things might also develop in a completely different way. If Rabin and 'Arafat fail, Hamas and Likud might dominate the scene. [Mubarak] With what alternatives? I do not see any other way than negotiations. I hope and pray that 'Arafat and Rabin will continue to be able to negotiate. Both have experience of many years and know all dimensions of the problem. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also believe yourself capable of playing the role of mediator in the newly erupted conflict in Yemen? [Mubarak] Before the outbreak of the hostilities, it would have been possible to help bridge the differences of opinion between North and South Yemen. I also tried to do this. But the distrust on both sides was too great. What is happening now is an inner-Yemeni affair. I do not want to interfere. [DER SPIEGEL] Then this would be another example of the Arabs' inability to solve their conflicts themselves? [Mubarak] What answer am I supposed to give you? The Arabs were also unable to solve the problem between Iraq and Kuwait. [DER SPIEGEL] What is going to happen in Yemen? Will the fighting go on until one of the opponents is vanquished? [Mubarak] The fighting might take years -- topography permits this. Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih from the north were to conquer Aden, this would by no means be the end of the war. Only negotiations with the help of a third country are a way out. However, I do not rule out that certain pressure groups might try to add fuel to the flames. [DER SPIEGEL] According to various reports, Saudi Arabia is said to have sent tanks to South Yemen. [Mubarak] They would be seen. These are unconfirmed rumors. [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be better if North and South Yemen were to part again instead of forming a coercive unit? [Mubarak] The war seems to confirm this. The north wants to preserve the unity of the state at all costs, while the south has other ideas -- I do not want to be an arbiter here. The Yemeni people have to decide on it themselves. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, the ceremony on the occasion of the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreement before 2,500 guests from all over the world was a success for you. And you were probably relieved that there were no incidents, although Islamic terrorists are giving you trouble. [Mubarak] I reject the term "Islamic." All of them are criminals. Most of them are not versed in Islam at all... [DER SPIEGEL, interrupting] ... but that is what they call themselves... [Mubarak, interrupting] ... they have nothing to do with Islam, they violate all Islamic rules. They murder innocent people, steal, and do things that are not permitted by any religion in the world. The motive of these terrorist gangs is not Islam, but simply money. They are financed from abroad, we can prove this. [DER SPIEGEL] The money probably comes from Iran? [Mubarak] Well, from Iran, too. In addition, however, there are several well-to-do private persons who make large sums available to these criminals, for example, via a bank in Italy. I had better not enter into details, the investigations are in progress. [DER SPIEGEL] Do police measures suffice to cope with religiously embellished terror or should one not also deal politically with the militant Islamists? [Mubarak] I know very well what it means to mix religion with politics. The Islamists are interested in power, influence, and money. As long as I am the president, religion and the state will be separated. We have been familiar with the dealings of the Islamic politicians since 1928. [DER SPIEGEL] Since the founding of the militant "Muslim Brotherhood." Is it still so dangerous? [Mubarak] This is an illegal organization that is behind most of the activities of the religious troublemakers. Have a look at what happened in Algeria. I advised the former president not to permit any religious parties. He flung my advice to the winds. Now Algeria is in trouble. [DER SPIEGEL] How do you want to cope with the phenomenon of Islamic terrorists? [Mubarak] There is terrorism everywhere -- in the United States, England, Turkey, and formerly also in Germany. The world is full of terrorism. Why are the media concentrating just on Egypt, where these terrorists have done relatively little damage, as compared to other countries? Egypt is still one of the safest countries in the world. [DER SPIEGEL] After all, these terrorists have hit Egypt's tourism hard and caused your country great financial damage. [Mubarak] Travel around in the country, tourism is beginning to be revived everywhere. No, I am not alarmed and I am banking on it that there will soon be real peace in our region, the peoples' living standard will be raised, and there will no longer be any conspiracies. [DER SPIEGEL] This seems to be an Arab fairy tale. [Mubarak] This is not a dream, but my deeply felt wish. But I also know what the Koran says: "The soul is inclined toward evil -- unless My Lord has mercy on it." [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, thank you for this interview.
