[Tahir] You know well that this all-out war in our country started, in effect, on 27 April 1994 with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's famous speech in which he declared war. Less than two hours after that speech, the 3d Armored Brigade, one of the brigades we moved to the northern governorates immediately after unity, was attacked. A few days later, the Ba Suhayb Brigade came under a treacherous attack in Dhamar. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih then pushed his troops on various fronts, including Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, Kirsh, al-Bayda', Mukayris, and Hurayb-Bayhan, and Bab el-Mandeb-Kharaz; that is, on the borders between the former North and South Yemens. Battles continue now for the fourth consecutive week. This war, which started in effect on 27 April, was prepared and planned in advance and many rehearsals were made. On the eve of signing the "Pledge and Accord Document" in Amman on 21 February, units from the al-'Amaliqah Brigade attacked our units in Abyan. We, however, exercised self-restraint and did not retaliate. The same thing happened again when the 1st Armored Division of the Republican Guard attacked the 5th Infantry Brigade in Sufyan area in the Sanaa suburbs. That brigade was destroyed completely and its soldiers who survived were displaced. The final rehearsal was the attack against the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Amran on the same day (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared war. It thus became apparent to us that the northern president wants to exterminate not only his political opponents, but also every officer and soldier from the southern governorates. This was confirmed practically by the all-out war he launched on the various fronts and in which he made the villages, towns, and civilian installations a target for barbaric and random artillery, rocket, and air attacks. [Shihab] How able are the southern forces to stand fast in the face of the northern troops, despite the other side's superiority in number and military equipment? [Tahir] It is sufficient to say that (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to settle the matter within hours, and at maximum in one or two days. This was frequently stated either by their president or his advisers, such as (Dr.) Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, (Dr.) 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, and (Foreign Minister) Basindwah. This was an illusion and a fantasy. The war has entered its second month now and our troops are still standing fast against the invading and aggressive forces that (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has thrown in. He has taken advantage of the numerical superiority, not only of his regular troops but also of the thousands of citizens from the central areas. He used these citizens for two purposes: To serve as human shields in his aggressive war on the one hand, and on the other, to get these citizens killed and, consequently, to weaken these areas so that they will not pose any threat against him in the future. Despite their smaller number, our Armed Forces have managed not only to confront and stand fast, but also to deal fatal blows to the aggressive troops and force them to retreat in more than one battle and on more than one front. This has actually happened on the Kharaz front, where three reinforced brigades -- the 1st 'Urubah Brigade, the 4th 'Urubah Brigade, and Khalid Barracks -- were defeated in a battle against one of our brigades. I can confirm that our Armed Forces are capable of defense and can stand fast. [Shihab] As a former defense minister in united Yemen, how do you view the northern forces' capability of continuing the war? [Tahir] I believe that the combat capabilities of the regular forces, dominated by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's family, have been exhausted. Thousands of civilians mobilized by tribal men ran away from the battles, were killed, or surrendered after they discovered the falseness of the slogans raised by al-Ahmar's clan -- slogans claiming that unity and legitimacy are being defended and that the south and the central regions are secessionists. [Shihab] Battles are now raging in the southern regions, and your role is defensive. Will you launch an attack to expel the northern forces from your territories? [Tahir] It is quite natural that battles are raging in southern regions as you have described them, because 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces have been preparing for this comprehensive war against the sons of the southern governorates by massing and mobilizing all forces and means, at a time when we dealt with the unity in an emotional and innocent manner as if it were an irrevocable issue. Therefore, our combat operations are defensive. In other words, we are defending the sons of the southern and eastern governorates. At the same time, our forces dealt crushing blows to the hostile forces, inflicted on them huge losses in life and equipment, and forced them to retreat and withdraw on several fronts. [Shihab] Do you have any idea of when the battle will be decided? [Tahir] Our cause is just because we did not attack anybody. We are defending our people, who will support us regardless of circumstances or the duration of the war. [Shihab] Aden seems to be besieged on three sides. Are there any plans to break the siege and link Aden again with other governorates in the near future? [Tahir] Aden, as well as the southern and eastern governorates, suffered from the central government in Sanaa, which tried to impose the system of the Republic of Yemen. Aden also has suffered from the presence of the Sanaa regime's forces in Abyan and Lahij in the north and the east since the establishment of the unity. State institutions in Aden, along with its honest and cooperative citizens, enabled Aden to rise again to carry out its duties as a capital of our young republic and even as a capital of all Yemen. It is the one that hosted the National Political Forces Dialogue and it was a venue for the national conference. We are not only defending Aden, but also all the territories of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. All the sons of the northern governorates are taking part in this effort, especially the sons of the central regions who are impatiently waiting for the day of salvation from the domination of al-Ahmar's clan. [Shihab] Some circles talk about northern penetrations in southern ranks, and some others say that commanders of some units were executed in the battlefield. Is this true? [Tahir] It is quite natural that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will find supporters within our units because we believed we had one state and one army. But the northern president and his supporters behaved in a conspiratorial and opportunist way. I can assure you that these elements are very few and do not affect at all our forces' defensive position. [Shihab] In your opinion, was this breakthrough the cause of the northern Yemeni forces' success in penetrating deep into the southern territory? [Tahir] The so-called northern forces' success in penetrating deep in the southern territory was first caused by the element of surprise in war; that is, the method of treachery followed by the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in addition to the numerical superiority and the mobilization of thousands of tribal men. In view of all this, our forces had to absorb the surprise attacks, deal crushing blows to the attacking forces, and reorganize. [Shihab] It was observed recently that your forces possessed new weapons and equipment. Did you obtain new weapons from abroad? [Tahir] We have not obtained any weapons or equipment from abroad. The most important weapon we have is the well-trained Yemeni individual who is aware of the just cause he is adhering to; namely, the cause of defending his land and honor. [Shihab] Southern military communiques say that your forces fired surface-to-air missiles that intercepted northern missiles and destroyed them over Aden. Does this mean that your forces possess enough of these missiles to ward off any heavy missile attacks on Aden? [Tahir] The firing of surface-to-surface missiles by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces against homes of innocents citizens is a sign of bankruptcy in this losing war. These forces believed that they would be able to decide the course of this war within one or two days. Indeed, or defense units shot down a number of these missiles. [Shihab] You have been quoted as saying that the northern forces employed chemical weapons in the Shabwah Governorate. Do you intend to retaliate by employing similar weapons? Do you have proof of your accusations? [Tahir] What we have said were justifiable suspicions. Those who began this destructive war against an entire people and used savage shelling by all means of heavy weapons, including missiles, will not hesitate to employ whatever they lay their hand on. Our suspicions are strengthened by the relationship between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who is known for his longstanding hostility to our people. Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid's description of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih as a "little Saddam" is not without significance.
