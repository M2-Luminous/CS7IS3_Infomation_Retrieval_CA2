With their sitting blockade they unsuccessfully tried until noon to force permission to enter the country. A press spokesman of the Federal Border Police in Kleve stated that the Kurds, who had come from the neighboring countries in busses, do "not have any right" to enter. The Kurds obviously wanted to go to Mannheim to participate in the mourning march for the two young women who had burned themselves last week out of protest against the oppression of their people in Turkey.
