Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-26Jan94-Russia Moscow's Rescheduling of Elections Meets Varied Responses SUMMARY The 6 January Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announcement scheduling repeat elections to fill vacant Federal Assembly seats has prompted varied responses from the affected localities. The Chechen republic continues to balk, denouncing the announcement, and again refusing, as in December, to hold elections. Moscow and Tatarstan appear to be making progress toward signing a treaty on bilateral relations, a Tatar prerequisite for holding elections, suggesting that voting may proceed on schedule in that region. END SUMMARY In an effort to fill vacant upper- and lower-house seats in the new Russian parliament, the Russian Federation CEC announced "repeat elect ions" have been scheduled in regions where they were boycotted or not held on 12 December, namely the republics of Tatarstan and Chechnya, and the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrug (Interfax, 6 January; ITAR-TASS, 6 January). The CEC scheduled elections in Tatarstan and Chechnya, the only republics not to have held elections on 12 December, for 13 March and in Yamalo- Nenets for 6 March. The CEC announcement indicated that the elections would be organized by local election commissions with the "same members" as for the failed 12 December elections. The Chechen republic refused to take part in the 12 December Federal Assembly elections (ITAR-TASS, 13 October 1993). While Tatarstan did not openly refuse to hold elections, local authorities effectively sabotaged them by using their control of local media and by bureaucratic maneuvering, according to an article in the 29 December Rossiya. As a result of the local opposition, the elections had to be cancelled because of an insufficient number of registered candidates (Kommersant-Daily, 7 December 1993). Only one Federation Council deputy was elected for the Yamalo-Nenets two-mandate district (Interfax, 20 December 1993). (See Note) (Note) Ballots for the December elections allowed the voter to vote against all candidates. Federation Council seats were awarded to the two candidates receiving the largest number of votes, unless the number of votes in the box against all candidates exceeded the total of either of the top two. It can therefore be assumed that only one candidate in the Yamalo-Nenets district exceeded the "against all candidates" vote. Chechnya Remains Adament Chechen electoral officials reacted with hostility to the CEC announcement of a new election date for the republic. The CEC announcement on Chechnya's elections--termed a "final appeal" by Ostankino television's "Novosti" newscast-- asked the "people and leadership" of Chechnya to "examine and make a positive decision" on the question of the republic's participation in Federal Assembly elections (Ostankino TV, 5 January; ITAR-TASS, 6 January). Nevertheless, the Chechen republic electoral commission vehemently decried the CEC announcement as demonstrating Russia's "unwillingness to abandon the gendarme approach," "threats," and "intimidation," and it called the announcement a "fresh ultimatum" that will "complicate relations" between Chechnya and Russia (Interfax, 6 January; Russian TV, 7 January). Tatarstan Negotiates In contrast to Chechnya's outright opposition, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev has reportedly offered a compromise, agreeing to hold new elections in Tatarstan if Moscow and the republic first conclude a bilateral treaty defining Tatarstan's sovereignty (Kuranty, 12 January; Interfax, 11 January). Although this "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of Authority and Terms of Reference" has yet to be signed, it is cited in the Tatarstan Constitution as the "basis" on which Tatarstan will associate with the Russian Federation (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13 December 1992). In a possible attempt to pressure Moscow toward concluding the treaty with the republic, during a break in the first session of the Federation Council--which Shaymiyev and Tatarstan Parliament Chairman Farid Mukhamedshin attended as guests" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 11 January; Interfax, 11 January)- -Shaymiyev was quoted as saying that repeat elections will "depend on whether relations [with the Russian Federation] are straightened out" and whether the treaty is signed (Kuranty, 12 January). The two sides appear to be making progress toward signing the treaty. Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported from "well-informed sources" that "full-scale" negotiations will take place between Russia and Tatarstan at the end of January and that the Russian Government has reportedly been tasked with preparing "within a week draft intergovernmental agreements on defense, foreign economic activity, banking activity, and budget interrelations between Moscow and Kazan" (19 January). Suggesting that Kazan is anticipating a successful outcome of the end-of-January negotiations, officials at the Tatarstan republic CEC reportedly announced that "operating procedures" will commence as of 1 February (Segodnya, 22 January). This conciliatory stand appears consistent with Kazan's efforts to garner a greater "say" in policy affecting its territory while avoiding explicit advocacy of separatism. Assessing Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 11 January address to the Federation Council, Shaymiyev was quoted as expressing "great satisfaction" with Yeltsin's "thesis" that "strong regions are the condition of Russia's prosperity" (Interfax, 11 January; Radio Rossii, 11 January). Shaymiyev previously has claimed that, while "sovereignty" is important for the republic, "full independence in the usual sense of the word does not suit" Tatarstan, owing to "the republic's geographical location," "visible and invisible ties," and the "large degree of economic integration." This stand has left him open to criticism by Tatar nationalist opponents for trying to "reform the Russian Federation rather than leave it" (Ostankino TV, 10 August 1993). Tatarstan officials also appear to have adopted a new tactic in their efforts to achieve greater autonomy within the Russian Federation--organizing a republic political party. According to a report in Kommersant-Daily, government officials and Shaymiyev supporters recently founded the Republican Party of Tatarstan "Unity and Progress," with presidential adviser Rafil Khakimov serving as co-chairman of the organizing committee. Khakimov reportedly expects that the party will "soon emerge on the federal political arena and make Moscow reckon with it" (Kommersant-Daily, 18 December). The newspaper cited Khakimov as saying that the party's goals include the "development and consolidation of Tatarstan's statehood," and fighting "not only for Tatarstan's rights but also assist[ing] the other Russian republics in this struggle" (Kommersant Daily, 21 December). Implications A successful conclusion to treaty negotiations should assure the holding of elections in Tatarstan and, in turn, the republic's full representation and participation in the Federal Assembly, although disputes over the republic's sovereignty and interpretation of the treaty will probably continue. In contrast, there seems to be little prospect for agreement between Chechnya and Moscow on ending the republic's boycott of federal institutions. (AUTHOR: NERO.
