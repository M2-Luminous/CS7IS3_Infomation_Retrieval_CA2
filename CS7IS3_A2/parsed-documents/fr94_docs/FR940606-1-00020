Primer and Topcoat Application Operations The proposed standards for primer and topcoat application operations would be the same for all new and existing affected sources. Standards are being proposed to limit organic and inorganic HAP emissions from these operations. a. Organic HAP and VOC emissions. The standards being proposed would limit the organic HAP emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 350 grams of organic HAP per liter (2.9 pounds per gallon (lb/gal)) of primer (less water) as applied, and from topcoat application operations to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 420 grams of organic HAP per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water) as applied. In addition to the organic HAP limits, the proposed standards would limit VOC emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent VOC content level of 350 grams of VOC per liter (2.9 lb/gal) of primer (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, and from topcoat application operations to an equivalent VOC content level of 420 grams of VOC per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water and exempt solvents) as applied. Equivalent organic HAP and VOC content level means the calculated organic HAP (or VOC) content of coatings that when multiplied by the usage of the coatings yields the amount of organic HAP (or VOC) actually emitted to the atmosphere by the use of the coatings. Exempt solvents are those organic compounds that have been determined by the EPA to have negligible photochemical reactivity. The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for topcoats do not represent demonstrated technology for exterior commercial topcoats. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial topcoats with HAP and VOC content levels higher than the proposed levels for topcoats. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit, including why currently available commercial topcoats cannot be used by all sources. Sources would be allowed to comply with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels by one or both of the following means: (1) Use coatings that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC levels or (2) use any combination of uncontrolled coatings such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents of these coatings comply with the organic HAP and VOC levels for that category (averaging of primers and topcoats together is prohibited). Averaging between uncontrolled coatings and controlled coatings is prohibited under the proposed rule. Instead of complying with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels through compliant coatings or averaging, the proposed standards allow the use of control devices provided each control device used for the control of organic HAP or VOC emissions from primer or topcoat application operations has an overall control efficiency, taking into account capture and removal efficiency, of greater than or equal to 81 percent. In addition, except for incidental emissions that may escape from the capture system, the control device cannot be used to control only a portion of emissions from a coating operation.
