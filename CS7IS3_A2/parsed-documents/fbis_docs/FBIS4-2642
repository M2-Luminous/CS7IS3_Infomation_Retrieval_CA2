The territory has become a focal point for Italy's corruption investigators as they zero in on public figures who switched bribes from Rome to numerous company accounts in Hong Kong. The man heading the inquiry, Judge Antonio Di Pietro, has asked the Legal Department for permission to expose the graft to a "blowtorch of scrutiny", a source told the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. Judge Di Pietro, who requires a constant security cordon because of his prominence and success as Italy's numero uno in the "Clean Hands" inquiry, needs the green light from the Hong Kong Government before he can press ahead. "A Hong Kong judge will hold a hearing in chambers soon to decide whether to grant the request to investigate company accounts and question their directors in the territory," the legal source said. "We understand that Judge Di Pietro will be visiting Hong Kong and he will attend the hearing in chambers. Lawyers in Hong Kong will have been instructed by the Court of Milan to proceed with it," the source said. Providing the proper procedure is followed and supporting documents from the Court of Milan are all in order, the Hong Kong judge would usually grant the request under the terms of an international mutual legal assistance treaty. A massive web of corruption spanning a generation of Italians and embroiling hundreds of elite figures including five former prime ministers has been steadily undone since "Clean Hands" was launched two years ago. The cost of exposing the graft tainting Italy's judiciary, police force, parliament and private sector has been severe, with mob retaliations including the murder of Mafia-busting Judge Paolo Borsellino and five bodyguards. Judge Di Pietro told an Australian Institute of Criminology conference on Thursday that his investigations were particularly concentrated in the territory where about 20 companies had been operating on behalf of Italian politicians. He said Hong Kong was favoured by politicians for holding and laundering funds, much of which was switched to the Bahamas and Liechtenstein. Singapore and the Cook Islands have also come under Judge Di Pietro's focus as transit points for tainted cash. "We have found a common denominator in these kinds of inquiries. The utilisation of funds which were offshore or in countries with legislation that was open to this kind of exploitation," he said. He said the front companies involved were not only Italian, but also multi-nationals and other foreign ventures. A diplomat in the Italian Consulate in Hong Kong, Davide Lacecilia, said he had no knowledge of the inquiry in the territory. Judge Di Pietro worked independently of Italy's consulates, he said.
