Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa showed a preference for the tax cut and tax hike to be dealt with together, saying Monday he did not understand what Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura meant when he said the two issues should be considered separately. [passage omitted[ But two other influential figures, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, the biggest party in the coalition government, and Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito, sided with Takemura. "I think it's a good idea," Ozawa said. Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general, also indicated approval for making the income tax cut ahead of the tax hike, describing Takemura as being "brave" in making such a comment. An official of Hosokawa's Japan New Party said Takemura's comments " do not necessarily reflect the government's policy." The issue will be discussed later Monday at a joint economic forum of government officials and ruling party leaders to be presided over by Tsutomu Hata, deputy premier and foreign minister. The joint meeting is to start at 5 PM. The issue of income tax cuts is the core of the cabinet's pump-priming package to salvage the ailing economy, to be finalized Thursday, according to Finance Minister Fujii.
