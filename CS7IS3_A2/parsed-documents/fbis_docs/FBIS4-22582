FBIS4-22582 "jpusr040___94013" FBIS-USR-94-040 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 April 1994 UKRAINE POLITICAL AFFAIRS Parties Uninfluential in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Parties Uninfluential in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast 944K1066A Lviv POST-INFORM in Ukrainian 7 Apr 94 pp 1-2 944K1066A Lviv POST-INFORM Ukrainian CSO [Unattributed report: "Parties Lack Great Influence in the Sub-Carpathian Region"] [Text] Analysis of the percentages of voters who took part in the first round of the parliamentary elections and who cast their ballots for the nominees of this or that party in the various districts leads us to conclude that in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (in contrast to Lviv and Ternopil oblasts) most parties do not enjoy substantial influence. The only party which does have such influence in some places is the KUN [expansion not given]. Its local leader, Roman Krutsyk, garnered 58.4 percent of the votes in the Rogatynskyy Election District. Two KUN members received 45 percent together in the Rozhnyativskyy Election District (of the two, Orest Dychkovskyy obtained 30.2 percent). In four other districts the KUN candidates received from 5.3 to 6.6 percent. The KUN demonstrated a great deal of authority and discipline when--upon the demand or request of the regional leadership--five candidates of this party (among them was the first deputy minister of culture and former chairman of the oblast council, Mykola Yakovyna) a few days before the elections withdrew their candidacies in order to benefit the other KUN people (only one person refused to do so). Ranking second in the percentages of votes received was the Communist-Socialist Bloc. As predicted at the beginning of March by the observer of the communist newspaper, PRYKARPATSKA PRAVDA, specifically in the Central Election District of the oblast center, which is inhabited by a large number of Russian-speaking people--as well as by military-service personnel and army veterans--the candidate of the left-wing forces (the editor of this very same newspaper, Bohdan Fedkiv) received the highest percentage of votes in the oblast--a total amounting to 20 percent (the only readon that he did not make it to the second round was because of the clear victory of his opponent--Volodymyr Pylypchuk--who won the election). In the Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast the left-wing candidates (the private entrepreneur Dmytro Shlemko and the worker Volodymyr Baranyshyn) garnered a total of 10.1 percent of the votes. In the four other districts left-wingers obtained totals ranging from 1 to 9.8 percent (the former first secretary of the KPU [Ukrainian Communist Party] Obkom, Zynoviy Kuravskyy, whose victory in the Snyatynskyy Election District the communists were counting upon, received only 8 percent). The chairman of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] Kiev Committee, Serhiy Hrinchuk, garnered 17.3 percent of the votes in the Dolynskyy Election District, while two other UNA candidates in Kolomiya and Kosova received 2.6 and 2.8 percent respectively. The head of the so-called "National Movement of Ukraine)," Borys Holodyuk, received 14.6 percent of the votes in the Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, while his comrades-in-arms in the Central and Nadvirnyanskyy election districts garnered 0.5 and 1.5 percent respectively. The head of the regional organization of the NRU [People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)] (the Chornovol-led group), Ivan Shovkovyy, received 7 percent of the votes in the Kolomyyskyy Election District, while 6 other NRU candidates obtained from 0.9 to 3.8 percent (most of them are employed within the state administrative system). The leaders of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party (UCDP), which functions de fact only in this oblast--the Sichkos, father and son--received 1.9 and 2.1 percent respectively. Deputies of the previous convocation of the VRU [Ukrainian Supreme Council] obtained the following percentages of votes in this oblast: the chairman of the oblast council, Stepan Volkovetskyy--61.2 percent; Pavlo Movchan--57.9 percent; Volodymyr Pylypchuk--57.6 percent; Dmytro Zakharuk--3.1 percent; Vasyot Kostytskyy--27 percent (first round); Petro Osadchuk--30.2 percent; Lyubomyr Pyrih--21.2 percent; Volodymyr Shlemko--7.7 percent; Zynoviy Duma--5.68 percent; and Bohdan Rebryk--1.1 percent. The hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks, Major-General Volodymyr Mulyava, garnered 63.48 percent of the votes; the head of the Union of Repressed Ukrainians, Yevgen Propyuk, received 52.1 percent; the minister of the economy, Roman Shpek received 34.1 percent; the former commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice-Admiral Borysk Kozhyn, obtained 22.3 percent; and the deputy minister of energy and electrification, Zynoviy Butso, obtained 12.3 percent.
