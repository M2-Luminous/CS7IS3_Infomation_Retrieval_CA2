Disputing that interpretation made by exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison, Dee, head of the government panel negotiating with leftist rebels, said, "We merely stated that given our objective to attain peace everywhere in the country, and the reality of the serious rift within the CPP/NPA/NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army/National Democratic Front], then peace talks with Messrs. Sison and (Luis) Jalandoni alone would no longer be adequate." Although implying that the government would be willing to talk with groups that broke away from the CPP, Dee yesterday reiterated that such groups must first stop their terroristic activities. "We categorically state that the GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] Peace Panel had no intention of entering into peace talks with any group, including the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB], under threat of violence and coercion."
