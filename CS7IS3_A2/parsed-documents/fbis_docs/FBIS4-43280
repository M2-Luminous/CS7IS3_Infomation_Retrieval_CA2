He was speaking at the parliamentarian general council meeting where the issue concerning its extension for another six months as of June 30 is being discussed. He said it is not a force that has been set up against Turkey's will, reminding it was set up initially upon Turkey's request in 1991, in conformity with Article 192 of the Turkish Constitution. `The terrorist PKK organization is the one who is the most against the force. Because if it is dismantled they will have an extraordinary freedom of movement in a troubled region. If it is lifted Turkey will also lose its support for the fight against terrorism in the southeast,' he said. He said the problems in that region do not stem from the force but from the embargo imposed on northern Iraq. `Even if the force goes, as long as the embargo is on, problems will continue,' he said adding that Iraq's territorial integrity is of a great importance to Turkey.
