FR940811-0-00048 FR940811-0-00017 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;76; RM&hyph;8196] Radio Broadcasting Services; Chateaugay, NY AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, at the request of Vector Broadcasting, Inc., substitutes Channel 234C2 for Channel 234A at Chateaugay, New York, and modifies Station WYUL's construction permit to specify the higher class channel. See 58 FR 19396, April 14, 1993. Channel 234C2 can be allotted to Chateaugay in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements, with respect to domestic allotments, at the transmitter site specified in Station WYUL's construction permit, which is 13.5 kilometers (8.4 miles) southeast, at coordinates North Latitude 44&hyph;49&hyph;41 and West Longitude 73&hyph;58&hyph;43. The allotment is short-spaced at Stations CIMF&hyph;FM, Channel 235C1, Hull, Quebec, CHWY, Channel 236B, Montreal, Quebec, and unoccupied Channel 234C1, Trois Rivieres, Quebec. Concurrence in the allotment by the Canadian government, as a specially negotiated allotment, has been received since Chateaugay is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border. With this action, this proceeding is terminated. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leslie K. Shapiro, Mass Media Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;6530.
