"We are gravely concerned and strongly oppose the move by the U.S. side to interfere in China's internal affairs," a foreign ministry spokesman said, adding that the latest sales violated a 1982 Sino-U.S. communique that called for the gradual reduction of U.S. arms sales to Nationalist Taiwan. "We demand that the U.S. Government strictly abide by the communique and immediately stop transferring advanced weapons or other military equipment in any form to Taiwan," the spokesman said. The high-tech military electronic systems -- including radar and electronic countermeasure systems -- will be used to equip six La Fayette frigates Taiwan has ordered from France. Announcement of the latest deal came after the U.S. Congress on Thursday voted to give President Bill Clinton the authority to boost arms sales to Taiwan, effectively relaxing the restrictions contained in the 1982 communique. U.S. firms had applied for permission to sell high-tech military equipment to Taiwan almost two years ago, but were turned down. The spokesman said the United States had repeatedly violated the 1982 accord in recent years and accused Washington of seeking "to destroy the peaceful reunification" of Taiwan and the mainland. Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war on the mainland to the Chinese communists in 1949. Beijing views the island as a renegade province.
