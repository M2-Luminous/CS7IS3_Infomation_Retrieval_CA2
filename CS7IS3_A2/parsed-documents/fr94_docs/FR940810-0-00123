FR940810-0-00123 FR940810-0-00021 Requiring comprehensive building and facility inspections like EPA does under AHERA was recommended by participants presenting labor interests (e.g., AFSCME Ex. 162&hyph;11; SEIU, 162&hyph;28; AFL-CIO, Ex. 162&hyph;36; BCTD, Ex. 162&hyph;42): by engineering, management and asbestos abatement firms, (e.g., Abatement Systems, Inc. Ex. 162&hyph;8, California Association of Asbestos Professionals, Ex. 162&hyph;27); and by representatives of state health agencies (e.g., North Carolina Department of Health and Natural Resources, Ex. 162&hyph;46; N.Y.C. Department of Environmental Protection, Ex. 162&hyph;47). Although there was substantial support for a comprehensive inspection requirement, OSHA believes that the regulatory approach in these final standards will achieve equivalent or superior protection to exposed workers at much reduced cost. The reasons are as follows. A comprehensive wall-to-wall inspection requirement is found to be unnecessary to protect employees against risks of exposure from asbestos-containing building material of which they are unaware. Such an inspection requirement would be very costly, may be overly broad, the results may not be correct or timely, would not necessarily focus on potential sources of asbestos exposure which present significant risks to employees, and its great expense may divert resources from active protection of workers who actually disturb asbestos. First, OSHA does not believe that protecting employees in buildings from significant asbestos exposure requires that all suspect materials in buildings first be identified. Although all asbestos-containing materials may release fibers when their matrices are disturbed, certain materials are known to be more easily damaged or to suffer more deterioration, and thus cause higher airborne fiber levels than others. As discussed in the November 1992 notice, OSHA determined that thermal system insulation (TSI) and sprayed on and troweled on surfacing materials are such materials. They are potentially more friable, are much more prevalent, are more accessible and are the subject of more maintenance and repair activities than are other asbestos containing materials. They are widely prevalent. A 1984 EPA study limited to residential, commercial and public buildings nationally, found about three quarters of such buildings had asbestos-containing TSI, and over one quarter of the buildings contained sprayed-on or troweled-on asbestos containing surfacing material (see also studies cited in the HEI Report, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;6 to 4&hyph;10). The materials are usually accessible. Surfacing material was applied for decorative and acoustical purposes early on, and was later applied as insulation coating to protect structural steel during fires. The HEI Report in summarizing studies conducted in New York, California, and Philadelphia stated that ``(i)mportant findings from these studies include the frequent use of friable surfacing in multi-storied buildings and the high proportion of damage to thermal systems insulation, most of which is accessible only to maintenance personnel (HEI Report, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;8 to 10). The accessibility of thermal system insulation is not limited to employees who directly disturb it to repair or replace the piping and infrastructure it covers. As noted by a participant: in industrial settings there are many sources of fiber release including vibration (people often walk on pipes), exposure to the elements, fans and processes, leaks, process leaks, and releases through joints in metal cladding (Ex. 12&hyph;7, Respirable Fibers Management Consultancy, Inc.). The data submitted to OSHA indicate that these two materials have high exposure potential. For example, the potential of surfacing material to become friable and result in sizable exposures was shown by the Yale Architecture School data, which involved exposure to a ``fully exposed acoustical material,'' a ``Spanish moss type material'' of low density and high friability (Tr. 2168). Dr. Sawyer, whose study showed very high exposures to custodial employees from exposure to dust and debris from this material, noted that its use in the building was unrepresentative, and that the material usually is ``used primarily as a fireproofing material on structural steel that was concealed.'' (Id). Work in ceiling spaces containing sprayed asbestos show elevated exposure levels (see e.g., studies discussed in HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;74). Data showing high exposure levels from TSI are ample and are discussed in detail in the preamble discussion on methods of compliance. The data in this record showing exposures to other kinds of asbestos containing material such as gaskets, wallboard, roofing and siding materials show that generally, exposures to these products under comparable controls are lower than those released by the materials designated by OSHA as ``high hazard'' and for which the presumption applies. The ``high-hazard'' materials are much more prevalent in buildings and facilities, disturbances of them are more common. Therefore OSHA believes that a targeted approach to presuming the presence of high hazard previously installed asbestos containing materials in buildings which are likely to contain them will provide equivalent protection to potentially exposed employees than a requirement to inspect all buildings and facilities for all asbestos containing materials. Some building owners will continue to conduct comprehensive surveys, others, when cost is an issue, will rely on presumptions to protect employees from potential exposure to high-risk ACM, TSI and surfacing materials.
