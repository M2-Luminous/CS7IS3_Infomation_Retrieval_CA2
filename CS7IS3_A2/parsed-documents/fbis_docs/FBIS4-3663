During her visit to the United States, Minister Wu Yi attended the Eighth Conference of the Chinese-U.S. Commercial and Trade Joint Committee, during which both sides profoundly discussed the question of strengthening economic and trade cooperation. Their discussions were frank and pragmatic and yielded constructive results. The Chinese-U.S. Trade and Investment Symposiums in New York and Los Angeles also concluded satisfactorily, during which various U.S. corporations signed all kinds of agreements with Chinese central and local authorities as well as enterprises, involving a total amount of $10 billion. This has once again proved that there is huge potential for Chinese-U.S. economic exchanges and that such business talks are greatly beneficial to both sides. The problem now is that, at a time when Chinese-U.S. economic and trade relations are developing vigorously, an irrelevant factor to economic and trade relations is casting a shadow over the two countries' entrepreneurs. That is, what policy will the United States adopt on the question of renewing China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status? In April and May every year, U.S. exporters to China frown because the White House stand and practice on this issue are quite unfavorable to them. The Chinese side is concerned about this and Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen who have built factories on the mainland are seriously worried about it. Last year the Clinton administration decided to renew China's MFN status for a year, with the caveat that "China must make a significant improvement on the human rights issue" before it can obtain renewal this year. In other words, this is a conditional MFN status. When meeting U.S. Secretary of State Christopher last month, the Chinese side explicitly clarified its position on this issue: China cannot accept a conditional MFN status. China's human rights concept is different from the U.S. one but this does not prevent the two countries from having a dialogue on this question. However, China absolutely does not allow others to interfere in its internal affairs on the pretext of human rights. China's position is clear and its attitude is reasonable. China needs MFN status because it affords both sides equal treatment and mutual conditions in trade and also because the United States is China's biggest export market. Similarly, the United States needs China: It needs to import large amounts of cheap but good quality industrial products from China and it also needs China because it is a big market. While in the United States, Minister Wu Yi said that, in future, China will import commodities worth $1,000 billion from the United States. For U.S. corporations, Chinese markets are absolutely necessary. As Wu Yi said, should the United States withdraw China's MFN status, a trade war could break out between China and the United States in which there would be no victor. The Clinton administration is unlikely to withdraw China's MFN status rashly because this could hit U.S. entrepreneurs heavily; more seriously, Chinese-U.S. economic and trade relations would break off and this would affect Chinese-U.S. political relations and even the global strategic pattern. China is a large country which plays a decisive role in the Asia-Pacific region, is the pillar for economic growth and stability in this region, and is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Should the United States prefer a confrontation with China, U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region will be affected. The U.S. economy is just starting to recover and the Clinton administration is facing difficulties which are proving hard to cope with in the diplomatic field, such as the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. If the United States prefers confrontation against China, it will, as Minister Wu Yi said, commit a strategic mistake. Recently the Clinton administration held discussions with Democratic congressmen about China's MFN status. Reports said that the U.S. side may possibly propose a so-called partial MFN status. That is, it may possibly cancel preferential treatment for products imported to the United States by Chinese state-owned enterprises. This act of discrimination against Chinese state-owned enterprises will not work. Let us put aside this question of "conditional MFN," which is technically hard to execute; imposing sanctions against Chinese state-owned enterprises could damage the Chinese people's feelings and the Chinese Government will not accept it. There is only one action for the U.S. Government to take: It must separate the human rights issues from trade and grant China permanent MFN status. This will be the best conclusion for the United States and China and both sides will be the victors.
