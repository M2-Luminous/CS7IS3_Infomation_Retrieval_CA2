Belgium, it is being said in diplomatic circles, is giving priority to not supplying ammunition to the ultranationalist opposition to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin himself has already expressed his opposition to any eastward expansion of NATO. The countries of Central Europe cannot expect much more from the declaration to be made by the NATO summit than a general statement to the effect that NATO may be extended at a later date. That will come as a disappointment to the so-called Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia), which are pressing for a clearer commitment. According to senior Belgian diplomats, NATO must do everything within its power to prevent any heightening of Russian feelings of inferiority and isolation. To this end, a clear decision made now on any expansion of NATO would be counterproductive. Like the United States, Belgian diplomats find that "drawing new dividing lines" would do nothing to consolidate stability in East Europe. According to diplomatic sources, the main problem facing the countries in Central and East Europe is not one of military insecurity, but one of internal social stability. Awarding them NATO membership, they say, would do nothing to change this. The diplomats believe that the "logical and harmonious" road ahead for the countries of Central and East Europe consists of first gaining membership for the European Union, then also for the Western European Union (WEU) and thus for the European pillar of NATO. Senior U.S. officials reiterated yesterday that the door to NATO would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Strobe Talbott, Bill Clinton's special adviser on Russian affairs, admitted that U.S. reticence was prompted by the concern not to stir up "ultranationalist sentiments in Russia." U.S. President Bill Clinton, who will start off his first visit to Europe with a two-day stay in Brussels for the NATO summit, will then move on to Prague to convince the Visegrad countries of the sympathy and appreciation of the United States and NATO. In this connection, Belgian diplomats are saying that diplomatic efforts will be required to reassure these countries of the fact that NATO is not subjecting them to a "veto" imposed by Moscow.
