"They would rather have a thief in the presidency than an honest individual," said Lula, before departing on a six-day visit to the Republic of South Africa and to Germany. Lula believes that the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP) represents the most backward of Brazilian businessmen, especially if one is to believe "the foolish things said by former FIESP President Mario Amato in 1989." On that occasion, Amato said that if Lula had won the elections, 800,000 businessmen would leave Brazil. Lula said he does not expect to receive support from the "FIESP people," and that he will not make any effort to convince the businessmen to vote for him, as he considers FIESP a backward organization. "It is a fiefdom that works in an outdated manner," Lula said. He recalled that when he was a labor union leader he refused to negotiate with the FIESP. "It is the most backward institution. Good businessmen do their negotiations apart," he said. The PT candidate said he is sorry for these businessmen who have never evolved, while the rest of society is giving unmistakable signals of doing so. "Those businesses think only of themselves, and never think of a society of 155 million inhabitants," he said. "I will win the elections, and they will realize how bad it was for Brazil that I did not win the 1989 elections," Lula added. The PT campaign strategy will not change over the criticisms made by businessmen. "In 1989, I did not have businessmen's committees supporting me. Nowadays I have them in several states, which means that on this particular point there has been some progress," he said, after which he recalled that since the beginning of the campaign he had already participated in more than 80 meetings with businessmen from all sectors. Lula criticized Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel Brizola when he said that the former governor could relate only with the workers of the fifties. Brizola considered Lula's declaration of assets before the Superior Electoral Court strange. "Brizola comes from a time when workers ate from a wooden plate, wore old slippers, and were poorly dressed, which were the times of populism," Lula said.
