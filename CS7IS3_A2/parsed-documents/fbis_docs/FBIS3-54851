Your political rating is very high. Currently, you are first in all the polls. Tell me, please, how the former first communist secretary of Lithuania has managed to gain this authority? What is the "secret" of your political success? [Brazauskas] You know, I have been the first secretary for quite a short time.... [Fris] However, your reforms have scared the nonflexible communist majority.... [Brazauskas] It is possible. I was a party leader for only two years. During the first year, we were looking for ways out of the CPSU membership. The second year was devoted to reforms within the party. Next, two years of opposition followed. Only the 1992 elections demonstrated surprising results. [Fris] [passage omitted] If I understand you correctly, you differentiate between economic cooperation and the true independence of Lithuania. [Brazauskas] Of course. We are an independent state which is recognized by the international community. Our economic cooperation is built on mutually beneficial relations. Some representatives of our opposition propose to eliminate such relations. As for me, I do not worry about our foreign economic contacts.... There is no returning to the past. [Fris] What are your relations with Mr. Landsbergis [opposition leader]? [Brazauskas] Mr. Landsbergis could have run in the elections, however, he did not do so for unknown reasons. It seems to me that he did not want to take the risk. As for our opposition, it is very powerful. It has done a lot for Lithuania and I cannot deny this fact. The opposition had, of course, created its own political structures when it was in power. Currently, four parties out of five represented in the legislature are in opposition to us. Nevertheless, we are working. I am trying to meet with representatives of various parties and discuss political issues with them. Mr. Landsbergis and I meet quite often and debate various issues. However, I do not see any dangers facing Lithuania, which, in the opinion of Mr. Landsbergis, is in itself threatening to our Republic. Our organs of power have been elected in a democratic manner. I invite all our people to work for the state. Let us resolve complicated issues together. [Fris] [passage omitted] Mr. Brazauskas, my interview cannot be finished without your comments on Lithuanian-Ukrainian relations. They can be called rather weak.... [Brazauskas] To my regret, our relations are weak with many countries. The first reason for this includes broken economic relations, privatization, new addresses, new leaders.... In addition, our governments have changed too often. In a word, these reasons are of an objective character. At the same time, however, many of our companies have stable economic contacts with Ukraine and these relations are deepening. We have several intergovernmental agreements, including the agreement on free trade. So, we have the necessary agreements but lack specific conditions. I know that Ukraine is experiencing an energy crisis and a high rate of inflation. You will overcome these difficulties. I would like to bring something new to our relations. [Fris] Thank you.
