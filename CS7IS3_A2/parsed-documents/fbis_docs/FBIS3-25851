A ranking official with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Monday [24 January] from a political standpoint, it is feasible to go ahead with such project even though there may be no economic benefit. ROC Marines maintain a base on Taiping, an islet in the Spratlys. The South China islands are claimed wholly or in part by Brunei, Mainland China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. An ROC study group of officials and experts toured Taiping for about three weeks last November, and it has started to make a formal proposal on airport (?to be published in the media) later this year. Officials said the government plans to develop tourism on the Spratlys and has yet to resolve problems with accommodations and water supply.
