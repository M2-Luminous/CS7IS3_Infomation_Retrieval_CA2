Experts estimate their total reserves at several dozen tonnes. Thus, the company already owns 7 deposits in the region, regarded as one of the most promising in gold. The prospected reserves of 4 deposits, obtained earlier, amount to 300 tonnes, and the Tokur ore deposit amounts to over 250 tonnes. In order to develop these deposits the company, set up in 1992 as a closed joint-stock company, started to issue its stocks, worth 7.7 billion rubles, in September 1993. Today the stocks of "Tokur-Zoloto" are sold at a price approximately five times higher than their nominal value of 1,000 rubles. However, even under such conditions there will hardly be enough capital generated from the conversion into a joint-stock company, for fulll-scale development of a 250-260 tonne deposit -- half as much is required for this. In this case any company has two opportunities: either to find a major investor, most likely foreign, who will agree to participate in the project. Or engage in other operations which would enable it to obtain considerable financial resources in a short period of time. "Tokur-Zoloto" is pursuing both alternatives. On the one hand, talks are being conducted with Western mining companies on their participation in mining Tokur gold; on the other, "Tokur-Zoloto" can mine gold from its rather big tracer deposits. The tracer deposits call for less expenses (compared with ore deposits) and pay for themselves more quickly, the more so as the company disposes of unnecessary equipment in the Amur region. Last year "Tokur-Zoloto" mined about 500 kg of metal, which is not much for such a company, but in 1994 it expects to increase gold production, bringing it up to several tonnes. It is also quite possible to further increase the authorized capital and, consequently, new emission of stocks. In trying to make its securities more attractive, "Tokur-Zoloto" is preparing to hold a lottery in April-May 1994 among its share-holders, at which gold nuggets will be drawn. This will be the second lottery; the results of the first were revealed in January. Three winners -- a student of the Moscow Institute of Physical Engineering, the Moscow branch of "Metkombank," and the head of a construction firm from Samara -- won nuggets weighing 201, 147 and 99 grams respectively The presentation took place in late January at the Russian Army Theatre during the premiere of Peter Stein's "Orestea," which "Tokur-Zoloto" assisted in preparing. It must be pointed out that this was the first ever transfer of gold nuggets to citizens in Russia. The mounting confidence in the company may also be facilitated by the policy of "Tokur-Zoloto" on the domestic gold market, now taking shape. Since the time it was founded, the company has been linked with a number of Russian banks, having substantial shares of the authorized capital in two of them and, in addition, cooperating with several leading banks which may count on being granted the right of conducting operations in gold. Such a right will also spread to security operations with metal (at present the government is preparing a resolution on this issue) which will enable "Tokur-Zoloto" to draw additional means on the security of gold at its disposal.
