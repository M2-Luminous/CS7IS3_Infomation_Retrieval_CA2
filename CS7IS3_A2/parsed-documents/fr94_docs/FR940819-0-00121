Laboratories may provide the report to a consortium provided that the laboratory provides employer-specific data and the consortium forwards the employer-specific data to the respective employers within 14 days of receipt of the laboratory report. The laboratory shall provide the report to the employer or consortium not more than 14 calendar days after the end of the quarter covered by the summary. Laboratory confirmation data only shall be included from test results reported within that quarter. The summary shall contain only the following information: (i) Number of specimens received for testing; (ii) Number of specimens confirmed positive for_ (A) Marijuana metabolite (B) Cocaine metabolite (C) Opiates; (D) Phencyclidine; (E) Amphetamines; (iii) Number of specimens for which a test was not performed. Quarterly reports shall not contain personal identifying information or other data from which it is reasonably likely that information about individuals' tests can be readily inferred. If necessary, in order to prevent disclosure of such data, the laboratory shall not send such a report until data are sufficiently aggregated to make such an inference unlikely. In any quarter in which a report is withheld for this reason, or because no testing was conducted, the laboratory shall so inform the consortium/employer in writing. 14.
