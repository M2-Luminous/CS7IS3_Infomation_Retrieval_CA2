Yesterday Chris Patten said in Australia that the first part of the constitutional package has won the support of most Legco members and is expected to be passed intact. Meanwhile, the British side announced that, now that the first part of the package has been passed, Chris Patten will very soon put forward the second part of his constitutional reform package "without delay" and push it through in the same manner. Chris Patten is seizing the opportunity to step up his efforts to bring his ideas into reality and render Hong Kong a quasi-independent [ban du li 0584 3747 4539] political entity in order to extend British influence in the colony. Before embarking on this political gamble, Chris Patten racked his brains to garner public opinion in support of his constitutional reform package. He arranged a visit to Australia, once again playing the international card. After this trip, he will immediately rush back to Hong Kong to push through the first part of the constitutional package. It is obvious that these activities are two closely linked, consecutive steps in a schedule which was meticulously drawn up beforehand. In Australia, Chris Patten delivered speeches in a righteous tone, declaring that the purpose of his Australian trip is to ask the Australian people "to extend assistance to Hong Kong" and "to defend the value of democracy." He encouraged Australia to "support democracy in Asia," boasted about his constitutional reform package, and spoke extravagantly, assuring the Western countries that his constitutional package was bound to overcome China's objections. He brazenly publicized the relationship between his package and the demise of the socialist system and fiercely attacked the idea of one country, two systems: "No totalitarian regime can coexist peacefully with a free economy for any substantial amount of time. The collapse of communism and its replacement with the free market offers a lesson to the entire world as well as Asia." This remark vividly defines the Far East mission that Chris Patten is undertaking in his capacity as the last governor of Hong Kong and exposes his real motive in inducing international forces to intervene in Hong Kong in support of his constitutional reform package -- he wants to resist China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and opposes the idea of "one country, two systems." Chris Patten has openly challenged China's sovereignty, as he maintains that it is impossible for two systems to coexist peacefully within a country. He has not only strongly maligned the Asian countries' successful experiences in maintaining a balance between social stability and economic prosperity, but he has also slandered socialism as a totalitarian system and has pronounced a curse on China, saying that the Chinese Government is bound to collapse. Based on his mistaken appraisal of the situation, Chris Patten went all out to confront China in the vain hope that his attempt would succeed. Thus one can anticipate his repeated failures in the future. Going against the trend, he is playing the international card everywhere he goes and is trying to pull together an anti-Chinese camp. He has failed in this attempt, however, as very few people are echoing his appeal. The Australian Government has simply ignored his call for support for his constitutional reform package, giving him a direct rebuff. That is why Chris Patten is now trying to explain away his vain attempt, saying that his current visit to Australia is not trying to seek support for his constitutional reform package but for the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He is just hoping to gloss over his awkward position. Meanwhile, former Australian Prime Minister John Malcolm Fraser wrote to a newspaper to acutely expose Chris Patten's bluff and lie, pointing out that Patten knows little about Asia and Hong Kong and that his constitutional reform is mischief aimed at creating chaos in Hong Kong. Fraser refuted Chris Patten's absurd assurance that "even if the Australian Government supports the constitutional reform package, it will neither affect Australia's economic and trade relations with nor its investments in China." Fraser pointed out that, if Australia wants to strengthen its relations with Asian countries, it should strongly urge Chris Patten to withdraw his rash and mistaken policy. Prime Minister Keating declared long ago that he was not interested in the Patten package. During his meeting with Chris Patten yesterday, he absolutely refrained from touching on Chris Patten's constitutional reform package, nor did he express any intention of supporting it. Keating did not shake hands with Chris Patten before reporters, because shaking hands with him as the governor to a colony would not be in keeping with Australia's political goal of becoming a republic. The Australian mass media have played down Chris Patten's visit. Many local Chinese community leaders, as well as figures from the business circles, have expressed their views, noting that what Chris Patten has been doing in Hong Kong is unpopular with the Australian Chinese community. Chris Patten has found himself in a very isolated position, and his mission will prove fruitless. Chris Patten opposes the Asian countries' policy that places political stability before economic development. His preaching has been refuted by Australian scholars. Before Chris Patten came to Hong Kong, the territory had properly handled the relationship between stability and prosperity as well as its relations with the Chinese mainland, thus maintaining sustained high economic growth. The Asian countries have established their unique political-economic model in light of the local historical and cultural realities and based on their own interpretation of human rights, which is different from that of the Western countries. As a result, they have created economic miracles and have emerged as a region which has enjoyed the most rapid economic growth in the world in recent years. In the meantime, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have mistakenly copied the western model. Being too anxious for quick success, they introduced drastic changes which have resulted in civil wars, economic decline, a worsening public security situation, and poverty and starvation among the people. As the Asian people uphold their Asian social development model, Chris Patten's fantasy of forcing Western value concepts into Asia is bound to arouse criticism from the Asian world. While in Australia, Chris Patten has also talked glibly about the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The very soul of the Joint Declaration is China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, on which date Britain will return Hong Kong to China, and then all Hong Kong affairs will become China's internal affairs, and China will apply the principle of one country, two systems to Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law. If Chris Patten thinks that his manipulation of Legco will enable him to push through his constitutional reform package and then have it extended beyond 1997, then he is certainly making a terrible mistake. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, international law, and the Basic Law, no colonial government has the right to establish any organizations of political power on behalf of the Special Administrative Region government which is to rule the territory after 1997. Therefore, Chris Patten's constitutional reform will be short-lived, and the three-tier councils he is to establish will inevitably be dismissed on 1 July 1997.
