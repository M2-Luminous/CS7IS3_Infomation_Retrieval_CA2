For a large developing country like ours, only by paying close attention to the central task of economic construction and vigorously developing the productive forces can we constantly improve our comprehensive national strength and enhance the people's standard of living. The domestic conditions are very good at the moment. The international environment is favorable, and Sichuan is also equipped with the conditions for more rapid development. We should bring into full play the initiative of cadres and masses, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and widen the scope of opening up, so that our province will have sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu gao su jian kang 2170 4958 7559 6643 0256 1660] economic development and scale a new height every several years. In the last 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Sichuan Province has registered a comparatively good trend of development in its economy. In 1993, in particular, encouraged by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks and the instructions of 14th CPC National Congress, our province made encouraging achievements in economic development. The province's gross domestic product increased by 12.8 percent, the gross industrial output value at the township level and above increased by 20.9 percent, and there was a good agricultural harvest despite natural disasters, the increase in the gross output value being 1.5 percent over the previous year. We should soberly understand, however, that there is still a large gap between our province and the developed coastal provinces and cities, and that some total economic indices are even lower than the country's average. Therefore the cadres and masses in Sichuan have a strong desire for accelerating the province's economic development. Their common understanding is: If Sichuan does not seize the last several years in the 1990's to speed up its economic development, the gap between the province and the developed fraternal provinces and cities will become wider and Sichuan will make a historic mistake. Being aware of an opportunity is good, but a more important point is to seize and use that opportunity to formulate an economic development strategy with a scientific attitude in light of the new situation and to take practical measures to implement it on schedule. The year 1994 is a crucial one for China to establish the socialist market economy structure and is also an important year for Sichuan to fulfill the second-step strategic target three years ahead of schedule. We will comprehensively put into effect the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee; continue to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and strive to increase the province's GNP by 9.6 percent on the basis of achievements in 1993. We will increase gross industrial and agricultural output value by 12.8 percent, industrial output value by 15.6 percent, and agricultural output value by 4 percent. Though this development task is arduous, it corresponds with the province's actual conditions, and we have full confidence in fulfilling it. According to the dialectical materialist concept of development, internal factors are the basis for the development of things. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out repeatedly: Things in China "must be fulfilled by relying on the efforts the Chinese themselves," and "independence and self-reliance were, are, and will be our standpoints." He stressed: "For a large country like China, it cannot but rely on its own efforts in construction. It must mainly rely on its own efforts; this is called self-reliance." Sichuan is a large province, covering an area of 570,000 square km, with a population of more than 100 million. In developing its economy, it must, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "rely mainly on its own efforts." Sichuan is already equipped with some basic conditions for more rapid economic development: It has huge markets -- high-potential rural markets, in particular; it has tens of thousands of hard-working and capable workers; it has a large number of scientific research units and scientific-technological personnel; it has rich natural resources; it has a large number and a certain scale of large and medium-sized state enterprises, as well as town and township enterprises; it has a corresponding scale of basic facilities and is carrying out a number of traffic, telecommunications, and energy projects; its productive forces have greatly developed after some 10 years of reform and opening up; and the province now is experiencing political stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Taking the country as a whole, the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has provided us with the basic framework for establishing the socialist market economy structure; the party Central Committee and the State Council have put the development of the western region and the exploitation of its resources at the top of the agenda and have instructed Sichuan to develop more rapidly and to actively explore ways of reform and opening up in the western region. All these serve as very favorable conditions for our sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. The dialectical materialist concept of development suggests that the internal factors of things are the basis of their development, but no one thing is isolated from another. External factors are the necessary conditions for the existence and development of things. Their impact on the development of things varies with specific conditions, and some external factors even play an important role. Comrade Mao Zedong vividly described such internal factors as "temperatures." Without the proper temperature, eggs cannot develop into chickens. Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed not only the importance of "relying mainly on one's own efforts" in development, but also the important role of external conditions. He has dialectically integrated these two. He pointed out: "An important reason China remained for so long in stagnation and backwardness was that it closed itself to the outside world. Experience has proved that carrying out economic construction behind closed doors cannot succeed. China's development cannot be separated from that of the world." He also stressed: "Without opening up, there can be no development," and "we should be bolder in reform and opening up" and "should carry out a large-scale opening up." Taking the world as a whole, none of the countries and regions with economic achievements have failed to pay close attention to utilizing external conditions. Reviewing China as a whole, rapid economic development in Guangdong's Shenzhen, Shanghai's Pudong, and Shandong's Yantai has proved the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. In 1993, in accordance with the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks, we organized people to actively explore new ways to widen the scope of opening up, and we achieved some new progress. Through various channels and tiers, we carried out investment and capital orientation activities, and successfully held business talks in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, and the ROK on investment and capital orientation. We held "Sichuan Festivals" in Moscow and Sofia to advertise Sichuan's achievements in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and to explore the prospects for economic and technological cooperation. Last year, agreements throughout the province on introducing foreign capital amounted to more than $2 billion and newly established foreign-invested enterprises totaled more than 1,900. Some large international financial groups began to take an optimistic view of Sichuan and expressed a very deep interest in some of its important infrastructural projects, such as energy and communications, and in exploiting its superior resources. Both sides are negotiating on some major projects. Apart from this, the province also made new headway in exploring export markets, contracting for international projects, labor service cooperation, establishing enterprises outside the borders, and tourism. Although Sichuan is equipped with the internal factors for sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and has explored some new ways, done some work, and made some progress in understanding and utilizing external conditions, there are still some restrictive factors, such as fund shortages and backwardness in infrastructural construction. Whereas accelerating infrastructural construction requires a large amount of capital injection. We must seek a new idea to resolve problems in Sichuan's economic development. In this way, we will fulfill the target of the province's development strategy. In accordance with the principle of integrating theory with practice, in the fourth quarter of 1993 we repeatedly and seriously studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping on seizing the opportunity, speeding up development, and scaling a new height in the national economy every several years; on China's development being inseparable from that of the world, and opposing seclusion and isolation; and on using the criteria of "three favorable's" in our judgment, in light of the difficulties and key issues in our province's economic development, thus further improving our understanding of the importance of widening the scope of opening up. Sichuan is a large hinterland province with comparatively backward economic development. Although we have done a certain amount in opening up to the outside world, on the whole the impetus of opening up is not strong enough. Export volume, particularly foreign exchange earned through exports, does not match the scope of the province's economic development, and foreign investments and "three-capital" enterprises still lack high-tech projects. What needs to be pointed out in particular is that the country's opening up to the outside world is developing more profoundly and in a broader field, but some comrades still have obstacles in their minds which affect the widening of the scope of opening up and they have not regarded widening the scope of opening up as a strategic task in invigorating Sichuan's economy. We feel deeply that widening the scope of opening up has become a key point in accelerating Sichuan's economic development. Sichuan's future development rate and progress depend, to a certain degree, on the progress and achievements in its opening up to the outside world. Only large-scale opening up will bring about large-scale development. Therefore, in planning Sichuan's economic work for this year, we have placed widening the scope of opening up and improving the actual results of opening up at the top of our list of six key tasks. Opening up to the outside world is also an inherent requirement of the socialist market economy structure. The market economy is, in itself, an open economy. Opening up to the outside world will help widen the room for resource distribution. Some countries and regions in the world are not very rich in resources and their ability to accumulate capital is not strong, either. However, they can seize the opportunity of economic and capital internationalization to distribute their resources around the world, creating rapid economic growth rates. Looking at Sichuan, it is comparatively rich in some resources, but these need exploitation and a way out. Sichuan is short of resources in some aspects and needs to introduce some from abroad. Thus, it is necessary for Sichuan to open up to the outside world so as to absorb others' strong points to make up for its weakness and to accelerate its economic development. Widening the scope of opening up is an effective way to resolve the province's shortage of funds. Rapid economic development is inseparable from a huge amount of capital investment. This is a very simple theory. Sichuan is weak in capital accumulation and it has long been faced with a shortage of funds. China is a socialist country. We can neither plunder nor loot to accumulate capital. If we carry out development by means of slow accumulation, this could cause a long delay and make us miss the opportunity, thus widening the gap between Sichuan and other provinces. Widening the scope of opening up will enable us to absorb and utilize foreign capital to make up for our shortcomings. This is a common practice in some newly emerging industrialized countries and regions during their development period, and there are exploitable funds in some countries and regions in the present-day world. We can borrow others' money for our use, particularly for the construction of basic industries and basic facilities. We should be bold in this matter. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Basic industries are, simply speaking, the raw materials industry, communications, energy, and so on; investments in these fields should be strengthened and this should be carried out for 10 or 20 years. This should be strengthened, even if we become indebted. This is also a kind of opening up. In this respect, we should be bolder and there will not be major faults." Widening the scope of opening up is also an important method for promoting scientific, technological, and social development. Over the last decades, modern science and technology have brought about new leaps in almost all fields, rather than in just some individual fields or production skills, nor have they given rise to progress or reform in only general terms; they have and are producing a number of newly emerging scientific and technological projects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "There is a wide gap between our science and technology and the advanced world level; our scientific and technological strength is still weak and far from being able to meet the needs of modernization." Therefore, we should continue to widen the scope of opening up, absorb a large amount of advanced technology, introduce talented people, and carry out exchanges of scientific and technological achievements according to our needs. In the meantime, we also should introduce advanced managerial experience to promote our scientific and technological progress. Widening the scope of opening up will bring about rapid economic development, which is the basic guarantee for social stability. In this sense, widening the scope of opening up is, in itself, fundamentally promoting social stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly pointed out: "If we do not carry out modernization, our scientific and technological level is not boosted, the social productive forces are not developed, the country's actual strength is not increased, and the people's material and cultural life does not improve, then our socialist political and economic system cannot be consolidated and our national security will not have a reliable guarantee." Sichuan is a large province, with a population of more than 100 million. Its situation is complicated, its economy is comparatively undeveloped, and its people's material and cultural life needs further improvement and enhancement. To preserve social stability -- apart from distinguishing between two different kinds of contradictions and handling them correctly, stabilizing the overall situation, and properly handling relations in all fields -- there is also a need to firmly widen the scope of opening up, accelerate economic development, improve the comprehensive strength, and enhance the people's material and cultural life. In this way, the people will love and support the socialist system more, and our society will become more stabilized and developed. Widening the scope of opening up does not in the least mean neglecting agriculture or the peasants. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Eighty percent of the Chinese population are in the rural areas; whether or not China is stable depends on whether or this 80 percent is stable. Cities, no matter how beautifully they are built, will not stand without the rural areas, which serve as a stable basis." Therefore, keeping in mind the objectives of "stabilizing grain production, increasing income, and moving toward moderate prosperity," we will continue to take positive measures to speed up agricultural and rural economic development so that the peasants will increase their income and become better off. In accordance with the requirement of establishing the socialist market economy structure, we will continue to deepen reform, transform enterprises' operational mechanism, form a modernized enterprise system, and improve large and medium-sized state enterprises. General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: "Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang cu jin fa zhan bao chi wen ding 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651 4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353] are major aspects of the work of the entire party." Jobs in all fields must be subordinated to these major aspects, and Sichuan must make its contributions in this respect. Proceeding from Sichuan's actual conditions, we should make bold experiments and endeavors; promote development through opening up; and under the leadership of the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work harder for the achievement of sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development and overall social progress in Sichuan.
