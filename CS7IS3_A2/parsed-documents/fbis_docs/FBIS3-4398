Governor Shao Qihui gave a speech, in which he stressed: Leaders at all levels should realistically change their work style and turn their ideology and work to implementing all tasks. This provincial government plenary meeting was an important meeting held by the provincial government after the convocation of the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress. Governor Shao Qihui first relayed the guidelines of the NPC and CPPCC sessions, the national rural work conference, the national family planning work conference, the State Council conference on maintaining social stability, and the State Council conference on anticorruption work, and relayed the important directives which leaders of the party Central Committee and the State Council had given for our work, and devised specific measures for grasping this year's work. On agricultural work, Governor Shao said: At present, spring plowing is now in full swing and wheat sowing is being successively carried out from the south to the north. All localities should seize the opportune moment to carry out spring plowing, rationalize the farming structure, implement the grain farming plan, and guarantee the farming acreage of beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco. It is necessary to extensively raise production funds, and make tapping potential as the point of departure. Agricultural loans should be granted in a timely manner and payments for the purchase of beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco should be given to peasants rapidly. Relevant departments should formulate plans for implementing reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system and establishing the risk-taking fund for grain in the province in line with the central policies. Governments at all levels should do a good job in publicizing and explaining this system, and strive to implement the grain tasks in the grass roots and among peasant households at the earliest possible date. In referring to social stability work, Governor Shao Qihui said: At present, our province's social stability work is very heavy. We must never neglect it. We should regard stabilizing the enterprise contingents as the priority of social stability work, realistically guarantee the basic living of the masses of workers, and solve the problems on delaying the wages of workers and pension for retired workers. Meanwhile, we should actively organize workers to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production, make proper arrangements for settling workers from enterprises which have declared bankruptcy or be merged with other enterprises, further attend to helping enterprises end deficits and increase profits, and fundamentally solve the problem concerning the unstable ranks of workers. Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership over the work of handling people's letters and visits, form a system of rotationally working in the office for handling letters and visits, and directly listen to workers' voice and opinions. Governor Shao stressed: To carry out this work, we make pay attention to the priorities. This year and for some time to come, we should regard the industry of precision and intensive processing of farm and side-line products as a new economic growing point, designate it as an important task of the provincial government and governments at all levels, and strive to yield good results this year. Successfully controlling commodity prices is also one of the work priorities of the provincial government. During the past two months, prices rose quite rapidly in our province. We must conscientiously conduct a province-wide price inspection, persist in controlling the prices of commodities that are essential to people's living, pay great attention to the vegetable basket work, and realistically implement the system of mayor assuming responsibility. Governor Shao also said: To grasp this work, we must change work style. After listing 10 unhealthy trends of leading cadres, he said: The provincial government has called on government functionaries at all levels, particularly the leading cadres, to strengthen study, strive to know the market economic theory well, and solve problems personally. Governor Shao stressed at the end of his speech: It is necessary to deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conduct anticorruption struggle and continue to place the emphasis of anticorruption work on grasping three tasks. Leading cadres should continue to implement the five stipulations on keeping oneself clean and self-disciplined. This year, we should attach importance to investigating and handling cases on corruption, bribery, abusing power to seek personal gain, and violations of law and discipline involving leading cadres.
