It is remarkable that during this time it has not only failed to adopt a single draft law regarding the pressing problems currently facing Russia, but it has also failed to submit any for examination. It is also symbolic that the Duma began its session Friday with the issue of providing backup services for its work. Deputy Nikolay Travkin reproached his colleagues with the fact that "having received 800,000 rubles each," they have been in no hurry to get down to lawmaking work. Another "anniversary" observation. Joint sessions begin with "warm-up sessions" or discussions of the agenda lasting two hours or 90 minutes. As a rule, these are a kind of "stream of consciousness" during which it is possible to hear political statements, outbursts directed at arch-opponents, and comments on the business in hand. However, having worn out their nerves and wasted time on sorting out the agenda, its subsequent implementation is never brought to a conclusion. The same proposals are submitted at the next session all over again to be accompanied by the same discussion. Basically, the Duma is being dragged into discrediting itself. It sometimes seems that certain forces are doing this deliberately. It is not at all hard to lead the nervous parliamentary audience on. Thus on Friday 90 minutes were devoted to the agenda. It was not until midday that the deputies addressed legislative issues directly. These included the draft decree on the amnesty in connection with the adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution. In accordance with a decision made by the deputies, the issue of a general political and economic amnesty has also been submitted for examination. The issue chiefly involves the defendants in the State Committee for the State of Emergency case and people who are currently being investigated following their arrest in the events of October 1993. This is the first category. The second includes people who have received jail terms for economic crimes which are no longer considered offenses. The State Duma's draft decree "On an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution" proposes, among other things, that "defendants who have performed military service in operational armies and combined units and taken part in hostilities in defense of the Motherland or while performing military duties in connection with this" are to be let off. Moreover, a general pardon awaits men and women above the age of 60 and first and second category invalids. The list of names eligible for an amnesty is fairly wide. The only people to whom the state's mercy does not extend are recidivists and murderers.
