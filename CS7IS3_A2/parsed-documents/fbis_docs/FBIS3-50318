The source suggested that it was most likely that the trial of the Poles, which begins next Monday [31 January] in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, is intended to act as a counter to the trial in Warsaw on spying charges of Ukrainian security service officer Anatoliy Lysenko, which started in Warsaw on January 19. Neither the Polish Foreign Ministry, nor the State Protection Office (UOP), was prepared to confirm a statement on Tuesday [25 January] from the press bureau of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry that Polish-Ukrainian discussions on the Lysenko affair were held on January 24.
