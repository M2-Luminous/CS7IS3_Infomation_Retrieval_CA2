This time, we interviewed Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], who said that this campaign is again filled with categorizing one another. [Szombathy] What kind of program have the Socialists managed to prepare and what are the main elements of action? So far, apart from categorizing one another, we have not heard much about the program points. [Horn] It is unfortunate that, rather than discussing the important issues, this campaign is again filled with categorizing one another. Hardly any parties talk about the real problems: unemployment, the possibilities of changing the economic structure, restoring agriculture, and public law and order. Without handling and solving these kinds of issues the country will be unable to get out of the crisis. The MSZP's professional and political program was preceded by many months of expert discussions, and we also tested our ideas on the broader public. Naturally, the implementation of these depends on the circumstances after the elections, not only on our intentions. It is unfortunate that the government does not give much attention to the kind of situation in which it will pass the power over. In 1993, the economic condition of the country went through a lot of deterioration: The deficit of the payment balance increased to an unprecedented level and reached $3.5 billion. The country's foreign debt service obligations rocketed because the government had taken on more than $6 billion loans through the least favorable bond form. We are all facing very heavy burdens: According to some views, without some urgent measures of the new government, the country might become impossible to finance in the near future. We should be dealing with these cutting issues in the campaign. [Szombathy] What kind of debates preceded the finalization of the Socialist program? [Horn] I think that this issue belongs to the past now because these debates have been concluded. The MSZP managed to come to a compromise. It is obvious that, with the approach of the elections, all parties are trying to formulate promises that are impossible or hardly possible to fulfill. I add that the opposition parties are in a more difficult situation because many facts are not known to them. Therefore, they have to keep comparing their statements with reality. I can say with confidence that the Laszlo Bekesi's economic policy program reflects the MSZP's perception and its intentions to act. The internal debates were also useful because this program had gone through significant changes compared to the original version. [Szombathy] If you come to government, what will be the first tasks of the cabinet? [Horn] We immediately have to start to form a realistic view of the situation, we have to hold talks with the World Bank, and we have to make a permanent agreement with the IMF. Only a coalition agreement open to public scrutiny can be lasting. Whatever kind of government is formed, it will have a serious chance to complete its term only if it changes the current style and attempts to treat society as an adult partner. It has to show a large amount of self-moderation and begin the savings with itself. It will definitely have to start to streamline the state apparatus. [Szombathy] How can the aggravated media situation be solved? [Horn] Everything possible has to be done to establish impartiality in the public service media. The Hungarian Television's future might lie in keeping only Channel 1 for public service and it would be a good idea to privatize the other. Drawing up a media law instead of the terminated version will be one of the most urgent tasks of the new Parliament. It would not be good, either, if a witch hunt were started in the media: People who are good at their jobs should be kept, but perhaps not in their current positions. [Szombathy] Do you consider the possibility of the MSZP remaining in opposition after the elections? If you are too strong then it might be difficult to find a coalition partner because, with your dominance in government, you might "gobble up" others. [Horn] Relations within a coalition are not decided by the number of mandates. Several western examples prove that, in case of overwhelming victory, the will of the other partners is also considered. It is difficult to imagine a coalition agreement if the partners do not agree on the choice of people. I am not worried about these fears. [Szombathy] How would you comment on the public service television's boldest attack on you: The "Panorama" program showed a witness whom you had supposedly injured. [Horn] It is unprecedented for a public service media to shower a political party with so many abuses. The latest edition of "Panorama" is a culmination of this. If the editors had asked me, I would have told them that I had never been to a prisoners' hospital or in Kelebia. The statements were gross lies that hurt my human dignity without giving me a chance to answer all this. The government is responsible for the degeneration of the attacks: All this is making a subsequent dialogue between the political forces impossible.
