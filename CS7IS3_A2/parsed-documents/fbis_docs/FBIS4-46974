This Does Not Make It Any Better for Ukraine"] [Text] Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy believes "There is no economic crisis in Ukraine." The No. 2 leader in the state either does not read the bulletins of the Ministry of Statistics, or is not knowledgeable about economics, or wants to put a good face on in a bad situation. Judge for yourselves. Compared to the first quarter of 1993, the volume of industrial production fell by 38.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, the output of foodstuffs fell by 39.2 percent, and retail sales were off 47.6 percent. The accounts payable by Ukraine to the CIS countries exceed accounts receivable by 14 trillion [currency not specified], including those payable to Russia--by 10 trillion [currency not specified]. Simple calculations indicate that in February alone, Ukraine's exports to the CIS countries fell by 7.4 trillion karbovantsy. On the domestic market, the Ukrainian national economy is running on debt: Accounts receivable increased by 30 trillion karbovantsy in February, and accounts payable by 36.6 trillion karbovantsy. As of 1 March 1994, the total debt came to 172 trillion karbovantsy, which comes to no less than 80 percent of the national product. This was a factor in expenditures from the state budget exceeding revenues by more than 5 trillion in just two months because there was nothing to pay taxes with. If this condition in Ukraine is not an economic crisis, then what is a crisis? This happened while taxes and withholdings for centralized funds in the first quarter came to 89 percent of the amount of proceeds. Out of each karbovanets in proceeds, as little as 10 kopeks was left at the disposal of enterprises. Where are the enterprises to get internal funds for technical development, retrofitting, and conversion in order to begin structural changes at their level? Recently, there has been very much talk about the growth of prices for products and goods. In January through February alone, the value-added tax and the excise tax came to almost 9 trillion karbovantsy, or 25.7 percent of the revenues of the state budget. Add to this the higher outlays on materials, energy resources, credit rates, and the preservation of the breakdown of producer cost with the volume of production falling simultaneously, and you will easily imagine the rate of growth of wholesale and retail prices. Mr. Zvyahilskyy boasts that the current government has curtailed inflation. However, the price paid for this has been so high that one would not know what is more terrifying--the temporary curtailment of inflation or the general slump in production, budget deficit, and deterioration of the financial standing of the people. The same Ministry of Statistics bulletin contains data on the size of the average monthly income per employee in 1993. Frankly, the numbers are revealing. Employees with the highest incomes were in the merchant marine--256,449 karbovantsy, construction--231,693 karbovantsy, railway transportation--218,043 karbovantsy, the staff of state and sectoral management--205,678 karbovantsy, and banks and insurance companies--518,313 karbovantsy. Employees had the lowest incomes in culture--99,765 karbovantsy, arts--98,485 karbovantsy, consumer services--77,727 karbovantsy, public catering--101,451 karbovantsy, health care--114,677 karbovantsy, agricultural production--118,455 karbovantsy, higher schools--137,643 karbovantsy, secondary schools--116,204 karbovantsy, science-- 147,866 karbovantsy, and motor vehicle transportation--145,264 karbovantsy. As can be seen, individuals working in the social sphere that is financed from the state budget were the first ones to suffer. For reference, the average monthly income in Ukraine was 173,876 karbovantsy, including that of employees of machine building--148,952 karbovantsy--and of light industry--173,705 karbovantsy. If one reads the bulletin of the Ministry of Statistics carefully, he may determine unequivocally that government policy in managing the economy in the environment of Ukrainian independence has been a fiasco. The V. Fokin, L. Kuchma, L. Kravchuk, and Yu. Zvyahilskyy governments have displayed elementary short-sightedness in governing the state with deference to the habitual stereotypes and following the lead of managers of state enterprises, large and small, who religiously cling to the stereotypes of "developed socialism": to provide first for themselves and then for the collective, and to give what remains to our society. This is precisely what has resulted in the priorities of state policy, what was prompted by the director "lobby." The social aspects of this policy were merely declaratory.... This is precisely why the volume of agricultural production and the output of foodstuffs dropped by a factor of two compared to 1991. Despite the attempts to pass off the desirable as being real, the agro-industrial complex has now long been in a state of economic collapse. This is precisely why prices for foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 15,500 on the average, whereas wages-- by a factor of 3,500 at the very most. The process of overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and the restructuring of its economy will take at least six or seven years because we will have to overcome intellectual backwardness (may the jingoist patriots forgive me), as well as technological and organizational backwardness. There are many proposals for overcoming the crisis. They include replacing fiscal taxation with a progressive taxation that gives the producers of goods an incentive to manage more effectively, the need to reduce expenditures for defense, government, and funding of the national economy (as people in the know think, this is nothing but support for state enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy); fundamentally new foreign-economic legislation that would encourage the Ukrainian producers of goods to export competitive products. This also includes a privatization program for 1995 that will most likely remain on paper. However, all of this does not make sense until the leadership of the state changes, until the state sees fit to change its stance on the development of science and education in Ukraine, and finally, until the supreme officials stop maintaining that there is no economic crisis in Ukraine....
