The political association's leaders expressed their commitment to the peasant and labor masses during all the ceremonies and acts celebrating their anniversary during the week, which concluded on 19 February with a political activity at the Salesian school. Socialism as a political and economic alternative for Paraguayan society and the responsibility of the leaders of the various progressive organizations in the creation of better living conditions for peasants, workers, and other social groups were the most-discussed items during two panel-debates at Viola House during the week. All the activities were organized by members of the PCP, which celebrated its 66th anniversary on 19 February. Two commemorative activities were organized 19 February: During the first ceremony a flower wreath was laid at the Ortiz Guerrero-Flores public square in Jose Asuncion Flores' honor at 1000. During the ceremony PCP leaders outlined the participation of the creator of the Guarania [Paraguayan music] in Communist Party activities. The central activity, which had a political and cultural tone, was carried out at the Salesian Sacred Heart of Jesus School at 2000. Speaking on the occasion were PCP President Ananias Maidana, Febrerista Revolutionary Party President Victor Hugo Sanchez, political expert Line Bareiro, and others who expounded on the critical situation of poverty in the country and proposed a further unity of leftist forces and progressive organizations in actions seeking to better organize groups affected by the present socioeconomic situation. "Socialism Has Not Died" Maidana held a news conference. He said Marxism has a lot to contribute to the country's new era. "Those who say that socialism has died have bad intentions or do not know anything about the historic process of peoples development," Maidana said. "A form of socialism has died, yes, but we know that the greater victories in favor of the most unprotected groups of society have been achieved following pressure exerted by society in demand for respect for their rights. The achievements in the area of social rights were not won by just conservatives and reactionaries," Maidana said. Asked about the PCP position regarding private property, Maidana said that at present "we are not against private property, but we favor the idea that land should be in the hands of those working it, which in this case are the peasants."
