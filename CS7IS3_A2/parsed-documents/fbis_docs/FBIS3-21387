The agreements apart, the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the visiting dignitary, are understood to have opened vistas of wide-ranging economic cooperation, and even discussed specific projects at their level at a one-to-one meeting, after which they led their respective delegations in a 90-minute dialogue. The Singapore leader arrived here last evening on a week-long official visit and will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day function. He and Mrs Goh called on the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, and Mrs. Vimala Sharma. Mr. Goh's high-level delegation includes his Foreign Minister, Prof. S. Jayakumar, and the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong, besides a host of senior officials, and 36 leading members of the Singapore business community. The President hosted a lunch in honor of the visiting dignitary and it was attended by Mr. Rao and his Cabinet colleagues.

Invitation to Rao He said the specific areas of cooperation were discussed at the level of the Prime Ministers. The Singapore leader is understood to have invited Mr. Rao to his country at the earliest opportunity. While the two leaders discussed regional issues as well as the overall prospects for economic cooperation in their one-to-one interaction of just over half an hour, the thrust of the entire exercise today was undoubtedly economic. Hosting a banquet for the visiting leader, Mr. Rao said India looked forward to a further expansion of relations with the ASEAN, with which it was a sectoral dialogue partner. Singapore is an ASEAN member. Mr. Rao also noted that cooperation between India and Singapore could extend to third country projects and hoped that Mr. Goh's visit would provide a "timely and strong impetus." Singapore's resources of capital, technology, and managerial expertise could find excellent net- working with India's agricultural and mineral wealth, skilled manpower and markets, he said. Tourism, housing, shipping, road-building and the setting up of corridors in India from which joint India-Singapore endeavours could thrust out to export markets, were understood to have been some of the concrete areas of discussion between the two countries today. The suggestion here today was that in the area of tourism Singapore could act as a "funnel" for India, if the necessary infrastructure and facilities were available in this country. In this context, it is understood, India could amend its laws to permit Singapore Airlines to operate at airports so far restricted to domestic air services. It is expected this would be to augment the tourist inflow. Property development in the country with Singapore finance, and low-cost middle-class housing, and private road-building, in which Singapore is said to have considerable expertise, were also believed to be areas of active discussion. The broad sense available here is that Singapore could become a routing point of economic inflow of diverse sources if the Governments of the two countries could reach effective mutual understanding. In the discussion between the two Prime Ministers, the spokesman said, the Singapore leader suggested that the ambit of India's dialogue with the ASEAN could be expanded. For now India is a sectoral dialogue partner of the ASEAN. He also briefed Mr. Rao on the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) at Seattle. Mr. Goh said he was gratified to note that India's "focus" was now "turning to the east," and it had integrated its economy with the world economy. Dialogue with Pak.

The Prime Minister referred to the Shimla agreement, and said India would like a dialogue with Pakistan to get under way under this agreement. The two leaders also discussed the role of the major Asian economies, i.e., Japan, China and India, the spokesman noted. Developments within the APEC were also discussed. At the corporate level, the spokesman said, a "strategic framework for cooperation" was signed between the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Singapore Manufacturers' Association (SMA). Mr. Goh is scheduled to meet the captains of Indian industry tomorrow. The Minister for Shipping and Surface Transport, Mr. Jagdish Tytler, and the Minister for Communications, Mr. Sukh Ram, are to call on the Singapore leader tomorrow.
