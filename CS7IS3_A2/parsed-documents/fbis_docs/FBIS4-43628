That may be so. But all the parties, including the prime minister's party, are falling over themselves to get into position for the election campaign that has not yet begun officially. Every single statement made by leading politicians in one party is dissected by the leaders of the other parties, and a lot of time is spent on possible party combinations each day. It is predictable, but entertaining. Actually an incredible amount of political energy is spent on establishing a strategy prior to the as yet unknown election day. At the same time nothing big is happening in the Folketing. The parties always go off the rails in the last part of an election period when they know the election must be held by a certain date. It is unusual that the parties experience an entire election period in strict accordance with the text of the Constitution, for decades elections in Denmark have been held every other year on the average. The last time the Folketing went into the fourth year of an election period was in 1987, under Poul Schluter, when practically all of 1987 was taken up with guessing that the election would be held in late fall. However Schluter struck earlier and called the election for 8 September. Therefore the fact that it created such a commotion recently when Holger K. Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist People's Party (SF), spoke of closer cooperation between the SF and the Radical Liberals must also be attributed to the current unofficial election campaign. His stand was received positively by the Radical leader, Economic Minister Marianne Jelved. However Nielsen has been talking about this cooperation ever since the SF issued a government program that could include the Social Democrats, the SF, and the Radicals a year and a half ago. And if one looks closely at what Jelved actually replied to Nielsen recently, she did not directly invite the SF to participate in a government with the Radicals, but acknowledged that the two parties have common interests in a number of areas. The Radicals do not feel the SF has passed the litmus test yet. This concerns economic responsibility, and as long as the SF Folketing members do not vote for the budget bill they cannot be accepted as one of the group. According to the Radicals, who have always scolded parties that are unwilling to share responsibility for the budget. But naturally the hard-pressed Center Democrats (CD) immediately dissociated themselves from Jelved's statements about closer contact between the SF and the Radicals. CD leader and Industry and Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen will not sit in a government based on SF support. The CD's emphatic stance and the continued uncertainty about the placement of the Christian People's Party after the election continue to create turbulence about the party's cooperation in Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's four-party government, to the great irritation of the prime minister. Regardless of the uncertainty about the placement of the CD and the Christians after the election, the Liberals and Conservatives have more or less written off the two small parties in the nonsocialist bloc this time around. Both Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and Hans Engell have done so publicly. Thus the only thing the opposition can do is suggest a VKZ [Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party] alternative. And that is what they are doing, no matter how skeptical the Conservatives are about this constellation at times. The most probable outcome after the Folketing election is a continued Social Democratic-Radical minority government that can seek support from the SF and/or the CD and the Christian People's Party. Drawn up against this government will be a large offensive Liberal Party, the Conservatives, and the Progress Party, and at the same time the Liberals and Conservatives will start drawing the CD and the Christian Party back into the nonsocialist fold. Prime Minister Rasmussen will probably not throw the CD and the Christians out of the government, although many members of the Social Democratic Folketing group and many local party people are sick and tired of having to make allowances for the two small parties. If Rasmussen dismisses the CD and the Christian Party he will have the same problem as his predecessor in the prime minister's office. Mimi Jakobsen, Erhard Jakobsen, and the other CD members along with the leaders of the Christian People's Party have never forgotten how Poul Schluter threw them out of the four-party nonsocialist coalition in favor of the Radicals after the 1988 election. Those wounds have not healed, nor will they heal. But the election results for the CD and the Christian People's Party may be so poor that they themselves decide to leave a government led by the Social Democrats. Just as the Radicals left the nonsocialist government after the election defeat in 1990. However, for the time being the two small parties think they are in the right company in the government and that they are given extensive consideration. At the national congress of the Christian People's Party in Kolding during the holiday at the end of April there was no real criticism of the party's participation in the government. However party leader Jann Sjursen would not say who the party would back after the election, but only stated that they will campaign as an independent party. And, paradoxically, some of the demands the Christians will make for providing a new government base cannot be met by the Social Democrats, but can be by the nonsocialist parties. These include such things as the old Christian special issue, namely the demand that mothers or fathers who stay at home to care for their children receive financial support from the state. On the other hand, the Christians are on a collision course with the Liberals and Conservatives in their attitude toward leave programs and tax reform, among other things. [passage omitted]
