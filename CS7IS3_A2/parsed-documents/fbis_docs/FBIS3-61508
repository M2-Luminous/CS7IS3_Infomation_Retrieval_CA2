The principal clinical symptoms in patients and epidemiological characteristics are described in the article. The authors of this report observed four patients, three of whom were identified in Pavlodar and one in Uralsk. Helminths (Dirofilaria repens) belong to the genera of Nematodes and Nemathelminthes and have the dimensions of 100 to 110 x 0.2 mm and, as a rule, parasitize in nodular intumescence under the skin, subcutaneous fat, and the eye. The larva migrans cutanea phenomenon, i.e., a parasite movement over substantial distances under the skin, has been recorded. Dirofilarioses are transmissive helminths. Humans are infected with them in the locations where invaded animals proliferate (dogs, foxes, wolves, etc.) through mosquito bites. References: 4. Key words: Parasitism--A form of cohabitation of two organisms advantageous for one and harmful for the other species; filaria--several species of white filamentary helminths; Dirofilaria--one of the filaria species; larva migrans cutanea phenomenon--parasite movement over a considerable distance under the skin; transmissible diseases--diseases whose etiological agents are transmitted by vectors. Several dozen cases of parasitizing of animal filaria in humans identified as Dirofilaria have been recorded in the world, including the CIS. Moreover, single, usually sexually immature female and less frequently, male filaria have been detected in the organism of most patients. Helminths, as a rule, parasitize in nodular subcutaneous intumescence, subcutaneous fat, and the eye. Filaria have been found in people living in the territories with subtropical and moderate continental climate. Cases of Dirofilaria have been described in the maritime kray [3] and Turkmenia [2]. In Kazakhstan, the first cases of local Dirofilarioses infestation were described by T.K. Besedina and N.A. Khokholnikova [1]. Both cases were identified in Alma-Ata in 1960-1961, and in the author's opinion, the southern Kazakhstan and Urals oblasts are regarded as likely infestation areas [4]. The latter two Dirofilarioses cases were recorded in Kzyl-Orda in 1964 and 1968. The authors of this report have observed four Dirofilariosis patients in the last six months. Due to the increased frequency of the rare helminthism occurrence on the republic territory, it would be interesting to examine the principal climatic symptoms on invasion among the patients, especially its epidemiology. Patient B, born in 1940, is a biology teacher in a Pavlodar secondary school. She fell acutely ill on 19 Mar 90, felt a sharp pain and an edema of the left eye. For several days prior to that, she experienced headaches every evening. On 20 Mar 90, she sought medical help at a trauma center of the oblast hospital where a filamentary helminth with a 110 x 0.2 mm size was removed from under the mucous membrane of the eyeball. Patient S, born in 1954, is a designer engineer working in Pavlodar. A hyperemic spot which, with time, transformed into a 1 x 5 mm node, appeared in the left groin area. The larva migrans phenomenon, i.e., a parasite movement over a considerable distance under the skin, was detected. The process was accompanied by pain in the elbow and radiocarpal joints and an edema of the tongue. On 25 Sep 90, a 110 x 0.2 mm nematode was pulled from under the eyeball mucous membrane. Patient P, a retiree born in 1930, is also a resident of Pavlodar. She fell ill in late February 1992 when she noted a hyperemic tumor-like formation on the forehead. She was bothered by severe headaches. The tumor disappeared several days later. On 8 March, she had sharp pain in the right eye and developed photophobia and lacrimation. On 20 March, a 106 x 0.2 mm nematode was removed from under the eyeball mucous membrane at the eye department of the oblast hospital. Patient M from Uralsk is a retiree. In February 1992, she noted an edema on the front of the right crus and a zigzag-shaped reddening as well as pain in the area of the knee joint. Some time later, the reddening moved lower, and a pea-sized tumor appeared on the rear surface of the right crus. The movement of the reddening was accompanied by itching. After self-treatment of the tumor with Vishnevskiy ointment, no recovery was noted. After she sought medical assistance, the tumor was operated on, and a white 110-mm-long nematode was pulled from the purulent wound. All patients recall numerous mosquito bites during the summer and none left Kazakhstan. The helminths extracted from them were sent to the republican sanitary and epidemiological station for identification; they are encapsulated preadolescent males belonging to the Dirofilaria repens species. Dirofilarioses are transmissible helminthisms. They are widespread in the world among dogs, but foxes, wolves, coyotes, tigers, and wild cats may be the final ``host,'' although humans are only accidental ``hosts.'' Humans are infected in the areas of habitat of invaded animals through mosquito bites of the Aedes, Cubex and Anopheles species. The filaria development phase prior to the invasion stage depends on the intermediate ``host'' (10-20 days). After entering the mosquito's stomach together with the blood, the Drepens microfilaria migrate into the insect body cavity for 1.5 days. After reaching the invasion stage, the larva migrate into the head and mouth organs of the mosquitos and from there--into the human organism through bites. An increase in the gnat population was noted in Pavlodar and Uralsk between 1982 and 1991: the mean seasonal indicator rose by twofold. Such a widespread proliferation of insects in the aforesaid regions is the factor which determine the unfavorable situation with the transmissible disease, including Dirofilariosis. Bibliography 1.
