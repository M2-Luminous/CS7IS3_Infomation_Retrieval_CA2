The announcement was made by Consecomercio President Berend Rossen, who warned of the inevitable shortage of goods and services supplied by this private sector company. "We need to implement a cost and price reality. That is why we are warning the national government, by way of the Development Ministry, that meetings with industrial sector representatives have already taken place and we have not yet been advised. It will depend on the government to continue with the Solidarity Pact which enables consumers to have affordable prices of vital imported goods such as food and medications. Berend Rossen acknowledged that food prices had increased during the past weeks not only as a result of the rise in the U.S. dollar, but also for other reasons such as the implementation of the bank debit tax and the increase of the minimum wage. With respect to the exchange rate situation, Rossen believes that the BCV [Venezuelan Central Bank] must turn to a much more open market such as the Caracas Stock Exchange in order to carry out currency bids since this will allow the price of the U.S. dollar to be fixed with more certainty. "There is the pressing need to put a ceiling and a bottom on the official and parallel currency market even when the commerce and service sectors do not support the currency control measures." The monetary authorities should present formulas to stabilize the currency market once and for all in order to provide more security for importers and to ensure macro-economic equilibrium. At the same time, there should be attempts to prepare an outline for the procurement of additional "stand-by" type credits such as the one obtained by Mexico with the IMF under situations similar to what Venezuela is going through at this time. Rossen proposed the future sale of gold and orimulsion on the market to compensate the drop in the currency market and he pointed out that this will help restore the climate of trust in Venezuela abroad. Rossen is satisfied with the Venezuelan Government's policy of once again proposing an increase in the price of gasoline as another revenue alternative and as a way of preventing the flight of Venezuelan goods to the Caribbean, Colombia, and other markets where our gasoline and other products become contraband items. On the other hand, Nicola Escapaticci, president of Consomercio Agriculture Commission disclosed that there is a limited supply of certain items. There is a sugar shortage because sugar is being illegally exported to Colombia; a rice shortage because of a fall in national rice production; and shortage of items such as powdered milk, which is being imported from New Zealand.
