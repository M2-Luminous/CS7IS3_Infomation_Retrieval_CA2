FBIS4-29891 "dreas120_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 North Korea U.S. 21 Jun `Aerial War Exercise' Reported U.S. 21 Jun `Aerial War Exercise' Reported SK2206142394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1210 GMT 22 Jun 94 SK2206142394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1210 GMT 22 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists on 21 June perpetrated aerial espionage on the northern part of the Republic by bringing an RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane from an overseas base into the sky of South Korea. The reconnaissance plane that flew in from a base in Okinawa, Japan ran amok in taking aerial pictures and conducting electronic air reconnaissance of the Northern Republic by flying high on the skies above Kangnung, Yangpyong, and Tokchok Island between 1100 and 1600. In the meantime, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off and landing attack planes, and early-warning planes that took off from overseas bases ran madly about in a surprise bombing exercise in the skies above Yongyol, Pyongchang, and Asan Bay as operation theaters in cooperation with the flying corps of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. The powder-reeking aerial war exercise, conducted under the command of an E-3 early-warning plane known as an aerial flying commander, was a reckless play with fire aimed at reviewing actual warfare capabilities of a coordinated strike in times of northward invasion between flying groups from overseas bases and those belonging to the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. On the same day, a formation of KC-135 refueling planes took off from a U.S. base in the Pacific region and was deployed at the U.S. Air Force base located in South Korea.
