In his words, the Latvian interpretation of the letter is that the Russian president called on the Latvian leader to meet and iron out differences. "Nothing can be farther from the truth. The letter is chiefly about the position of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia. It expressed Russia's serious concern over that," the diplomat said. He explained that only in the beginning of the letter did the Russian president confirm his willingness to have a summit meeting to discuss a broad range of issues and sign agreements on troop withdrawal, social guarantees for Russian military pensioners and the functioning of the Skrunda radar station. "The ironing out of formulations in international agreements is not the function of presidents. It is apparent from Yeltsin's letter that the summit is impossible unless negotiating teams agree on key provisions of bilateral documents," Udaltsov said.
