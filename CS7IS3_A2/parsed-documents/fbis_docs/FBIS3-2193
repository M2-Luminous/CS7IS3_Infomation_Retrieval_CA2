At the closing session of a national working conference on the civil aviation service, Zou said that since the new leadership of China's civil aviation services analyzed the major problems and took some measures to deal with them at the end of last year, progress had been made in the work of the services. But, he noted, the problems -- including some slackness in management and low service quality -- have not been totally solved and arduous tasks remain for the services. He said that civil aviation services play a special role in China's opening to the outside world and it is an industry with modern scientific and technological knowledge. He called for practising strict management and discipline, and improving various responsibility systems. The primary task for the civil aviation services is safe flights, he said. He said that he is against blindly setting up airlines without taking account of conditions. He urged the China Administration of Civil Aviation to regulate the air navigation market and set up good order in navigation. The vice-premier also stressed the need for readjustments in those local airlines which had had more accidents. He said that punctual flights and improvement of service quality should be an obligation for all airlines. He urged the airlines to study the psychology of passengers, understand their difficulties and make efforts to meet their needs.
