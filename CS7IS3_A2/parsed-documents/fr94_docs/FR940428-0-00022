FR940428-0-00022 FR940428-0-00008 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD07&hyph;93&hyph;091] Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Kissimmee River, FL AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is changing regulations governing the operation of the CSX Railroad bridge, at mile 37.0, near Fort Basinger, Florida, by requiring 96 hour advance notification for an opening of the draw. This proposal is being made to be consistent with three other bridges on the waterway. This action will relieve the bridgeowner of the burden of having a person available within 72 hours to open the draw, which has not opened during the past twenty years, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter Paskowsky, Project Manager, Bridge Section at (305) 536&hyph;4103. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Walter Paskowsky, Project Manager, and LT J. M. Losego, Project Counsel. Regulatory History On November 9, 1993 the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations in the Federal Register (57 FR 59426). The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose This swingbridge presently opens with 72 hours advance notice for the passage of floating equipment employed for flood control work under the jurisdiction of the South Florida Water Management District or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This regulation was established in 1964 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the Kissimmee River Flood Control Project was under construction. The State Road 70, 78 and 98 highway bridges which cross the same waterway have been authorized to open with 96 hours advance notice. This change will allow the CSX Railroad bridge at mile 37.0, which must be opened by hand, to open with a similar 96 hour advance notice.
