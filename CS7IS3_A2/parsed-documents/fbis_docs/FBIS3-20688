Both Zagreb and Livno have thus stopped for a step, in the attempt to give a political answer to the impossible question of "the chicken or the egg," and thus sacrificed only what a great part of the world and a significant number of Croats, both in Bosnia and in Croatia, have labeled a rotten egg that could stink up the entire basket. Mate Boban has gone, Karadzic is still firmly in the saddle, and Alija Izetbegovic has not yet been significantly threatened by Fikret Abdic's rebellion, so it was only the Croats (read: the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]) who roamed around and lost their way among the idealist Stjepan Kljujic, the trouble-making Ivo Perinovic, and the extreme Mate Boban, in which the curve kept jumping and trembling between impotence and stupidity. Thus Mate Granic, whose feet Mate Boban was constantly under, like a tongue-tied sidekick (because he does not know a word of English), has finally had to appear in Livno in the role of an elegant executor who, in the long-awaited scene, paraphrases the famous Shakespeare verses: "He was an honorable man, but...." What can Mile Akmadzic, who for months had been prepared for the role of heir apparent, do now? The international media, which can sometimes expose things to the bone, claim that Mate Boban was very useful when the Croat defense had to be organized during the conflict with the Serbs, but very harmful when he became involved in the war with the Muslims, which has brought Croatia before the wall of international sanctions. Those who have met him privately claim that he even secretly admired the Serbs, while he never gave an inch to the Muslims, something literary connoisseurs had discovered as early as in Boban's attack on cardinal Franjo Kuharic, in which he used a literary example from which it follows that the killing of a Turk is not a thing for which an honorable man should go to confession. It was most probably the conflict with the friars, with Kaptol [the Zagreb see], and the Vatican, which can not agree with such views, that encouraged many Bosnian Croats from Bosanska Posavina, Sarajevo, and central Bosnia to conclude they should finally get organized and found associations, assemblies, and political bodies that would reject Mate Boban and dispute "Herceg-Bosna." The grief-stricken session in Livno, at which even Vice Vukojevic [HDZ representative in Croatian Parliament, military official in Herceg-Bosna] and Ivan Aralica [Croatian writer, HDZ representative in Croatian parliament] had to hear Drazen Budisa out [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party], moved between political self-defense and a silent commemoration, and one could guess what the matter was about only from between the lines. "When a Muslim in Livno or a Serb in Mostar have the same rights as the Croats, then Herceg-Bosna will be a truly democratic state," said Boban's former protector Gojko Susak [Croatian defense minister], while Boban's successor Mile Akmadzic gloomily concluded: "The Church is our mother, and a mother's hand is the same when it scolds as when it caresses." Playing the role of the innocent who does not even know why he is being charged, Mate Boban made public the tragic list of Croat victims, Croat losses, Croat defeats, and Croat misfortunes, and in doing so he never once asked if the policy that was befallen by this entire encyclopedia of suffering could at all be proclaimed successful and the only possible one. Boban is leaving, but the "Declaration" stays, confirming that people are replaceable, but the spirit remains. It promises the continuation of the irreconcilable war over Mostar, which has been proclaimed "the capital city of a sovereign state-forming people" and "an indivisible entity," as if Mostar has not become Vukovar already, as if before the war there were not Croats, Muslims, and Serbs in the city, as if it had not been decided in principle that it should be placed under international management, as if the State Department has not announced that the "Croat cleansing" of Mostar was what caused the Croat-Muslim conflicts. The nontransience of cultural monuments was also suddenly discovered, while no one knows if the investigation against the "three members of a tank crew" that destroyed the Old Bridge has moved from a standstill. (Izetbegovic is even shooting his bandits.) The international court for war crimes and the protection of humanitarian convoys are supported, while no one accepts responsibility for what has happened so far. "Everything that happened were only consequences," says Boban, "and the consequence is always less punishable than the act in the cause." This way of thinking is what has led to his final downfall.
