Criminals removed the capsule from a measuring instrument in the hope of lining their pockets by selling the valuable metal. Twenty of the plant's workers have so far been affected. Three had to be dispatched to Kharkov for special treatment at an institute. An investigation is under way. Meanwhile specialists have worked out that 200 cubic meters of contaminated soil will have to be removed from the plant's territory and buried. An even bigger quantity of water will have to be removed from the reservoir where water for fire-fighting purposes is kept. It is assumed that the ill-fated cesium capsule is resting at the bottom of this reservoir. [201147] [video shows extensive aerial views of Nikolayev alumina plant and reservoir]
