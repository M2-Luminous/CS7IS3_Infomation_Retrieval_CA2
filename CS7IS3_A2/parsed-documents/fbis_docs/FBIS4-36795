A specialized institution is carrying out that duty and is distributing these necessities and medicines to pharmacies and other marketing centers. A new group of people, however, has entered the trade markets along with traders, brokers, and parasites on this profession, which are using various ways to torture the sons of their people and to suck their blood in order to make huge profits and to become wealthy at the expense of millions of poor, patient people. God, conscience, and history will punish this group of people for standing in the ranks of Iraq's enemies, which want to hurt the patient people. Regrettably, the pharmacies have been drifted by this current and have imposed high prices on pharmaceutical materials and necessities and medicines, although the Medicine Corporation has fixed the prices of these materials. Woe unto you if you ask the pharmacist any question. He may refuse to give you the medicine which you badly need even if you pay him a fortune. This is not how the elite treat each other. They do not forget their patriotism to make profits at the expense of the sick and the poor of our people. Some pharmacies even sell medicines and antibiotics to hospitals or private clinics, instead of displaying them, so that they can avoid questioning. At the same time, these hospitals ask for fantastic prices. In this way, pharmacists avoid embarrassment before the citizens. The majority of the pharmacies also exploit weak control, inspection, and follow up by the competent authorities to invent ways to sell these medicines as imported materials. Although these pharmacies were charged by the competent authorities with violating the fixed prices, they resumed their violations following the end of their closure periods. The pharmacists union should take a firm position toward these violators by withdrawing their licenses, the Medicine Corporation should cancel agency contracts with them, and the security, party, and popular institutions are urged to follow up and deal with this phenomenon like other phenomena which have recently surfaced, especially the phenomenon of the surging prices of basic commodities.
