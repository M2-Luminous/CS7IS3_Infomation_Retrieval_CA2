The rally was led by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, Communist die-hard Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov and other members of the opposition. The demonstrators marched from the Byelorussky Railway Station in the northwest of the Russian capital to Manezh Square outside the Kremlin and then to Lubyanka Square near the former KGB headquarters. Rutskoy called on the demonstrators to "meet the 50th anniversary of the victory over the Nazi by a victory over the present regime." He stressed that there is still enough time to understand "whether we want to go on living like this," referring to the disintegration of the Soviet empire. Other speakers called on all opposition forces to unite in order to win the upcoming presidential elections. Umalatova announced her decision to run for presidency, but at the same time recommended former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov for the post of president. Labour Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the opposition has got its own leaders, namely Umalatova and infamous Nina Andreyeva. He urged his supporters to begin preparations for the presidential elections due to take place in 1996 and suggested compiling lists of candidates for preliminary voting. "Let the people themselves choose their candidate to the supreme state post," Anpilov said. Konstantinov, leader of the National Salvation Front, stressed that "it is time to set up a single, well-organised opposition movement and set forth a clear-cut programme of action." He said "there is no confidence that the next presidential elections will take place in 1996 as planned." Konstantinov said the opposition's immediate goal is to unite its forces and collect one million signatures required for holding a referendum on early presidential elections. According to various reports, the rally gathered about 7,000 people. Among its organisers are the party Vozrozhdeniye (Revival), the standing presidium of the Congress of Soviet People's Deputies, the Labour Russia movement, the All-Russia People's Union and the Agrarian Party of Russia. The Union of Army Officers led by Stanislav Terekhov also took part in the rally. The union's members and war veterans were expected to march to Manezh Square together with the opposition and then part with them to lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall.
