[Klaus] We achieved what we could. The reversal of Slovakia's one-off measures and the fact that further solutions will be sought were the only way out of the situation. The fact that Slovakia, in the current political crisis, does not want to deal with its economic problems in a more emphatic manner is not unusual; it is even very common. Therefore, I do not anticipate that the current Slovak political representatives would, within the context of the political crisis, demonstrate more meaningful courage and adopt a more radical measure, a measure that would certainly not do them any good on the domestic scene. [Danes] Do you think that the measure adopted by Slovakia on 11 February--requiring special certificates testifying to the quality of imported foodstuffs--was motivated unequivocally by an attempt to reverse its unfavorable situation in the clearing account? [Klaus] Of course. Slovakia is making a monthly payment for exceeding the clearing account that amounts to roughly 10 percent of its foreign currency reserves. That is a distressing sum. [Danes] Do you not view the future of the Czech-Slovak Customs Union skeptically? The current situation of recurring Slovak deficits in the clearing account is not beneficial to either of the partners. [Klaus] The situation in the clearing account is not a repercussion of the Customs Union. It is a consequence of the Slovak koruna's poor exchange rate. So, I believe that the Slovak koruna's exchange rate will be devalued, and not the Customs Union. [Danes] You issued a statement last week on the Allies' ultimatum in Bosnia, and, shortly afterwards, the president issued a completely different one. Would it not be in the interest of the Czech Republic's good name abroad to coordinate your stances on such fundamental international issues in advance? [Klaus] I think these differences are being overstated. I do not think that this has caused a tragedy in our country. Let us not look for fundamental disputes in these statements. I am absolutely certain that, in the United States, Great Britain, and France, various opinions are being expressed on how to resolve this terribly difficult problem. There are radical and less radical opinions in these countries, opinions that emphasize an internal solution and opinions that emphasize an external solution. I think that emphasis on the fact that air strikes per se will probably not solve anything is the majority opinion, at least judging by the way I interpret the reactions of world politicians.
