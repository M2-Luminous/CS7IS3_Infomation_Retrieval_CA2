Both the President and the Minister of Justice have said that people who come forward to confess their crimes will be granted indemnity. We hope that amongst the people who come forward to confess will be those responsible for the serial murder of more than 350 leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and thousands of its supporters. The President of the ANC and current State President, Mr Nelson Mandela, went before the United Nations and labelled the IFP a surrogate of the former South African Government. If one were to believe him, then one must logically assume that the former government would not have murdered IFP leaders. Now, logic compels one to conclude that the IFP cannot be guilty of murdering its own leaders. So, if the former government was not murdering the IFP, must one conclude that it was the ANC? Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, a strong supporter of the proposed Truth Commission, was seemingly unable to cast any light on the matter. Under the circumstances, what hope is there that the identity of the murderers will be brought into the light? Are they likely to confess to the truth commission? One would have to believe in miracles to expect that. We repeat -- the murder of the IFP leaders and its supporters is a crime of monumental proportions against the people of this land. If those punting a truth commission want to be taken seriously, they should tell the loved ones of those that have been murdered how they intend going about solving these murders. After all one of the two -- the former government and the current one -- must either know something about these dastardly crimes or at least know how to go about solving them.
