ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This action corrects the amendatory instructions for a rule published in the Federal Register of May 25, 1994. The regulations implemented Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0001 hours Hawaii time, June 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Svein Fougner, 310&hyph;980&hyph;4034. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sections 685.15 and 685.17 were published originally in the October 16, 1991, Federal Register , effective from October 10, 1991, through April 22, 1994. On May 25, 1994, when NMFS revised these sections, NMFS inadvertently used the amendatory instruction term ``revised.''
