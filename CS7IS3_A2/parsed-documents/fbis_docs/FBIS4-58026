In his letter he calls for the necessary contacts to be made regarding the call to ICO member countries to hold an emergency session of the conference of ICO foreign ministers before the date of this year's pilgrimage. The meeting would be to discuss the subject of Libyan pilgrims being impeded from carrying out the religious ceremony of pilgrimage, due to the unjust measures imposed by Western states via the Security Council, that would enable Libyan citizens to perform this religious duty free from the hindrances imposed by the resolutions of the Security Council. In his message he emphasized that the resolutions of the Security Council which imposed an air embargo on the Great Jamahiriyah were in essence purely political resolutions which had led to Libyan pilgrims being impeded in the performance of their religious duty securely, peacefully and easily and had led brotherly Islamic states to assist the Security Council in its resolutions by stopping the Libyan people from getting to the holy mosque in Mecca.
