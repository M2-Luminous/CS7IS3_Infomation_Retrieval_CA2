Kim told NSP officials at a ceremony commemorating the 33rd anniversary of the agency's founding that North Korea's nuclear development program poses a serious problem, asking the officials to prepare for the possibility of an emergency situation. He emphasized specialization, efficiency, internationalization and science as the NSP's four operating principles and called on the officials to help establish the agency as an "intelligence organization of the people." The intelligence body was inaugurated on June 10, 1961, as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) and changed its name to the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) on Jan. 1, 1981.
