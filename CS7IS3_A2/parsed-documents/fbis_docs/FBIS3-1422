In an article today, the paper notes: During his election campaign, Clinton competed with his predecessor George Bush to win Zionist votes by pledging never to forsake the Zionist entity. The paper points out that this pledge included Clinton's readiness to support the Zionist entity by giving it loans and grants to finance the establishment of settlements in the occupied West Bank, and assurances that the Zionists will not find a better friend at times of war or peace. The paper reviews some of Clinton's actions after he won the presidential elections. The most important of these actions are his disavowal of the statement in which he expressed his readiness to turn over a new leaf in relations with Iraq if Iraq complied with the UN Security Council resolutions, his missile attack on Baghdad, and the current scandals in which he and his family are involved. The paper notes that the campaign against Clinton's reputation by the Republicans and certain Zionists is due to the fact that these circles are not satisfied with the White House President merely announcing openly that he supports the Zionist entity, they want him to prove, through words and deeds, that he will pursue this course, and show that any deviation from this course will result in blackmailing and exposing him, making him a lesson to others.
