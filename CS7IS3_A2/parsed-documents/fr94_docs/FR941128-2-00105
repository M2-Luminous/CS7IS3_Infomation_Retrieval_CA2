ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare Land Use Plan Amendments and Environmental Impact Statement. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 43 CFR 1601, 43 CFR 1610, and 40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508 notice is hereby given that the Susanville District Office, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), California, will prepare amendments to three land use plans (LUPs) and prepare an associated environmental impact statement (EIS). The LUPs to be amended are the (1) Cal-Neva Management Framework Plan of 1982, (2) Tuledad-Home Camp Management Framework Plan of 1977, and (3) Alturas Resource Management Plan of 1984. The LUP amendments and EIS will be published in a single document entitled East Lassen Ecosystem Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (ELEMP/EIS). PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: The public will be provided opportunities to participate and comment throughout scoping, preparation, and review of the ELEMP/EIS. Opportunities for public participation at a series of public scoping meetings will also be provided. Times, dates, and locations of public meetings will be announced through the news media, by mail, and personal contact. Public meetings are anticipated to be held in Susanville, California; Alturas, California; Sacramento, California; and Reno, Nevada. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION OR RELATED DOCUMENTS CONTACT: Herrick E. Hanks, District Manager, Attention: East Lassen Project, Bureau of Land Management, Susanville District Office, 705 Hall Street, Susanville, California 96130. Telephone: (916) 257&hyph;5381. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The East Lassen area is located in the northwestern Great Basin, encompassing about 1.25 million acres in portions of Washoe county in Nevada, and Lassen and Modoc counties in California. The area contains many jurisdictions, including lands and resources administered by BLM Susanville and Winnemucca Districts, Modoc National Forest, Sierra Army Depot, State of California, Nevada Division of Wildlife, California Department of Fish and Game, and private lands. A BLM interdisciplinary (ID) team of specialists has been assigned to prepare the ELEMP/EIS. The ID team anticipates the LUP amendments to result in decisions to incorporate ecosystem management principles, make resource allocations, set goals and objectives, establish priorities, establish standards and guidelines, be consistent with Rangeland Reform '94 and other initiatives, and define future public participation processes. The LUP amendments will be applicable to the land and resources administered by BLM Susanville District in the East Lassen area. Preliminary issues to be addressed are (1) vegetation, including riparian-wetland, (2) wild horses and burros, (3) fish and wildlife, (4) livestock grazing, (5) recreation opportunities, and (6) local socio-economics. Preliminary future management strategies (alternatives) to be addressed are (1) Baseline/Current Management (No Action), (2) Custodial Level Management, (3) Native Species and Habitat Restoration, and (4) Featured Animals Management. At this time the ID team does not anticipate LUP amendments to address BLM oil and gas, coal, geothermal, other mineral resources, cadastral survey, user fees, or realty related decisions or actions. Herrick E. Hanks, District Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29124 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;40&hyph;P
