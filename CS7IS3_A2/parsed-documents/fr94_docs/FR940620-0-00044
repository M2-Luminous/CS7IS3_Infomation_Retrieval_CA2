The Port Clinton Offshore Grand Prix will have an estimated 35 offshore power boats, racing in a closed course on western lake Erie which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation restricts vessel traffic in the area and is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District until May 20, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids, to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and J.M. Collin, Commander, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney, Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The Port Clinton Offshore Grand Prix will be held on Lake Erie on July 9, 1994. This regulation restricts general navigation on Lake Erie from the East Pierhead Light 1 (LLNR 5870), Port Clinton, OH to The Colony Club Harbor, Catawba Island, OH. This event will have an estimated 35 offshore Power boats, racing in a closed course on western Lake Erie which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property during this event. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Marblehead, OH). This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Economic Assessment and Certification This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary. Collection of Information This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
