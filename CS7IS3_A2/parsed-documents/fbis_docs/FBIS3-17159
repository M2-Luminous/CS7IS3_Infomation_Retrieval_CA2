DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil briefed Russian reporters on the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement regarding the rupture of DPRK-U.S. talks. Ambassador Son Song-pil pointed out that Pyongyang cannot but take countermeasures against pressure on resuming Team Spirit, an ROK-U.S. joint military exercise. Last March, the DPRK declared its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], but temporarily suspended its effectuation of such a decision last July so as to resume talks with the United States. He pointed out that the DPRK cannot but implement its decision to withdraw from the NPT if the U.S. Administration breaks up talks with Pyongyang and resumes the Team Spirit exercise to step up the nuclear threat against the North. He added: Continuing dialogue is also in the interest of the United States. We are not in any hurry as time is on our side.
