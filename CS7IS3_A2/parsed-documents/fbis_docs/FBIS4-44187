The year 1994 has not become the year of the dollar, as many had expected. On the contrary -- the dollar rate is dropping surprisingly steeply. It is true that central banks have intervened, but this has apparently not solved the problem. Nervousness and uncertainty continue to dominate the markets, as our reports have shown. There are many explanations for the weakness of the dollar -- speculative assumptions and quite acceptable considerations on interest rate implications, cyclical developments, investment behavior, the problem of derivatives, and growing distrust of the U.S. Administration and its policy. All this is not funny, as U.S. President Bill Clinton says in a relaxed way, especially not for the Americans, whose exchange rate stability depends on the capital influx. Fundamental data and political intentions are one thing, expectations and reactions on financial markets, another. Whether the central banks will get this development under control remains to be seen. For the time being, there is intense speculation on a possible U.S. key interest rate increase. Any attempt to make policy against the markets now would be disastrous.
