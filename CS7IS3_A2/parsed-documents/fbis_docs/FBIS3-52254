Hundreds of civilians have been wounded in this fighting. In a report published here today, AL-JUMHURIYAH's correspondent in Ninawa quotes these reports and people coming from al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil Governorates as saying that more than 56 people were killed in these battles over the past week. AL-JUMHURIYAH's report adds that the number of those killed over the past week is more than those killed over the past two months, that is, since the beginning of the fighting between the two agent groups. AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the agent groups -- which control the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq under the protection of the allied forces and aircraft that take off from southern Anatolia -- are hiding the number of civilian casualites. It is believed, the paper adds, that the number of victims is increasing now that the fighting has extended from the military areas, which are under the control of the two groups, to villages and subdistricts in al- Sulaymaniyah and Irbil Governorate. The reports added that over the past two weeks al-Sulaymaniyah was the target of arbitrary shelling from launchers and mortar guns. The reports said the shelling, which lasted for more than 10 straight days, resulted in the killing and wounding of hundreds of people and the destruction of houses and mosques. AL-JUMHURIYAH's correspondent noted that Irbil's streets are full of bodies and burned vehicles. He added that shops and markets were looted during the barbaric shelling.
