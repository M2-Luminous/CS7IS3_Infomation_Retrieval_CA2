Elias] [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- The routing of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] from Bophuthatswana left the homeland's defence force in control of the territory on Friday [11 March]. By Friday afternoon, however, it was not clear if the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] was in control on behalf of besieged President Lucas Mangope, or whether it was siding with the rest of the civil service which has rejected Mr Mangope's policy of continued independence. Civil servants and people working for parastatal organisations have been on strike for the past week demanding the homeland's re-incorporation into South Africa and participation in the April elections. On friday afternoon, Mr Mangope announced his intention to participate in the elections. The country was left in a state of chaos on Thursday when police decided to join the rest of the public sector and refused to work. Within minutes of their decision people took to the streets singing and dancing and shouting that they had overthrown the Mangope government. However, the AWB, with the knowledge of the BDF, began entering Bophuthatswana in convoys of cars, minibuses and bakkies [pickup trucks] filled with the khaki-clad and heavily armed men. Estimates of their strength ranged between 1,500 and 5,000. By early Friday morning the AWB was deployed around strategic buildings in Mmabatho, including government offices and the looted Mega City shopping centre. By noon the BDF had chased the AWB contingent out of Mmabatho and a bloody skirmish occurred in the Mafikeng central business distrcit between the BDF and the AWB militants. They eventually left the area, but South African Police [SAP] at Rooigrond, a part of South Africa about 20km outside Mafikeng, said only about 20 cars and bakkies had passed through a roadblock set up by the SAP. It was not known whether the AWB chose another route out of the homeland or whether they were still in the area.
