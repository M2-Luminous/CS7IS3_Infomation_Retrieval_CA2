FBIS4-63330 "drsov099_t_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Meri Statement Indicates Displeasure With Laar Meri Statement Indicates Displeasure With Laar LD2005120694 Tallinn Radio Tallinn Network in Estonian 1100 GMT 20 May 94 LD2005120694 Tallinn Radio Tallinn Network Estonian BFN [Text] The presidential press service forwarded to Estonian Radio a statement by President Lennart Meri in response to the joint statement from the Riigikogu speaker and the prime minister. According to the joint statement issued by Riigikogu Speaker Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart Laar, the president's welcoming speech [on 17 May] to the diplomatic corps accredited to Estonia did not reflect the official position of the Republic of Estonia. President Lennart Meri notes with regret in his response that the prime minister's attempt to embroil the Riigikogu speaker in political games may turn the current government crisis into a constitutional crisis. The president states the text of the welcoming speech was drafted by Toivo Klaar, head of the Foreign Ministry's foreign policy department, at his request and with the knowledge of the foreign minister. According to the president, this fact could not have been unknown to Prime Minister Laar, and if it was, it is a sign of impermissible shortcomings within the state apparatus. The president considers particularly dangerous for the Estonian national security policy the fact that five days before the conference of the foreign ministers of the countries on the Baltic Sea, the prime minister has begun to resolve the government crisis with foreign policy arguments, involving top state officials and incomplete information. In his statement the president says a government crisis is a customary manifestation of parliamentary democracy. The president considers it impermissible to set party political interests above the national interest of the Republic of Estonia.
