[Text] Academician Mikayel Kotanyan, a well-known economist in this republic, heads the National Academy's Institute of Economic Sciences. At a time when the young and inexperienced leaders in power were breaking all economic ties with Russia one after another, in the naive belief that this meant liberation from colonial rule, M. Kotanyan was one of the few economists to raise a voice against that naive policy, the bitter fruits of which we are now tasting. It is not too late to make use of his knowledge and experience. We present below an interview with Mikayel Kotanyan by Candidate of Economic Sciences Suren Gevorgyan. [Gevorgyan] Mikayel Khachiki, it has been almost three years now that the republic's leadership has been trying to change over to a market economy. What is the present level of the economy? [Kotanyan] First of all we must bear in mind that in governmental and economic policy the market is not simply a goal but rather a means of achieving improvement in public affairs, of raising living standards, and of satisfying needs. Therefore the transition to a market economy must be accomplished by means of raising the level of prosperity, not by worsening living standards. Living standards have declined in particular this past year. This was a result of an incorrect economic policy. Under conditions of freeing of prices and an economic decline, retail prices on necessities sharply increased in comparison with the same period last year. Armenia showed the highest prices for foodstuffs among all the CIS member states. It was calculated that, according to figures for the first quarter of 1993, the per capita cost of a minimum market basket in Armenia amounted to 12,476 rubles per month. And this was in conditions where the average pay for a state employee for the first quarter of 1993 was 4508 rubles, an average of 2500 rubles per person per month, while consumer spending was a mere 950 rubles (1490 rubles when counting in the month of June). Unemployment in this republic is growing day by day. These government figures represent the true state of affairs as regards the people's living standards. All this attests to the fact that this republic is at a critical point in the decline of living standards. [Gevorgyan] The government considers transition to a market economy to be the cornerstone of privatization.... [Kotanyan] Ensuring diversity of property ownership is one of the important conditions of a transition to a market economy. The issue at hand is by what method diversity of property ownership is being accomplished, by what principles of social justice, and under conditions of what socioeconomic situation. To accomplish this, those conditions selected as a point of departure must not worsen the condition of the people, but should ensure a stable rise in living standards, rather than putting additional stress into the social situation. Thus privatization and multiple ownership is merely a precondition for transition to a market economy, not a solution to the problem, as is naively believed by the top people in our republic's economy. They believe that privatization will solve the problems of transition to a market economy and that we shall immediately find ourselves in a common market-economy association with countries that enjoy a high level of production, technological sophistication, and civilized socioeconomic relations. All this is merely a pipe dream. There are many countries in the world that have private ownership of one type or another but still cannot even think about transitioning from a simple bazaar-type economy to sophisticated market relations. [Gevorgyan] Are the results of land privatization not proof of what you say? The republic's agriculture has been thrown back to the level of the 1960's. [Kotanyan] Land privatization in this republic was carried out in a most unsophisticated fashion; its purpose was not so much the development of agriculture as the speedy dismantling of the existing economic system. This task was entrusted to persons who had no knowledge whatsoever of the village or of agriculture. The land, livestock, and property were simply squandered, farms and agricultural complexes ruined, with nobody giving any thought to the question of what food supplies the government would use to feed the urban population and the military or what raw materials would be supplied to light industry and food processing industry still under government operation. Incidentally, land privatization has not been carried out at such a bold pace and scale in any other country. Even in the German states following reunification, in conditions of a powerful West German economy, East Germany's economic structures were not demolished. They have been maintained, and are gradually being restructured. 80 percent of the farm operations are being maintained, in spite of the fact that the state is providing economic incentive to stimulate development of the farm economy. This is due to the fact that certain economic conditions are necessary for transition to a privatized farm economy, and certain economic conditions are essential as well to ensure that people are psychologically prepared to work as independent individuals. [Gevorgyan] Efforts are presently being made to argue that if collective farms and state farms had been preserved, by now they would have been looted and plundered. Is this not an involuntary admission of the government's powerlessness to preserve state property? [Kotanyan] That is truly a result of self-delusion and ignorance. Even today the state farms which were preserved to one extent or another are the only sources for replenishing meager state food supplies. One can read statistics to become convinced of this. The fact is that state farms, in addition to "feeding" themselves, also allocate food supplies to the state, while the contemporary farmer is accumulating assets; the farmer has forgotten his duty to give a portion to the state.... On the whole the economy has become a system out of control, which is careening toward the abyss. Suffice it to note that generated national income in 1992 was approximately equal to the 1975 level, declining by 42.6 percent in comparison with 1991, while gross output has dropped correspondingly by 39.4 percent. [Gevorgyan] This decline has continued in the first quarter of this year, while the newly-appointed prime minister had promised to halt the economic downswing within this period of time. [Kotanyan] That is absolutely right. According to the 1993 socioeconomic development program submitted by the government, the target is to boost industrial output volume 32.3 percent, while according to figures for the first quarter it amounts to only 48.6 percent of the total for the corresponding period in 1992. This means that the new government has failed to halt the swift decline of the economy. All figures pertaining to economic results in comparison with the previous year are negative numbers. There is no point in speaking about growth or even about stabilizing the economy. [Gevorgyan] Incidentally, the prime minister has addressed the Supreme Council requesting postponement of this month's accountability report.... [Kotanyan] He is doing the appropriate thing, since he has nothing to say.... The previous prime minister resigned because of the flimsiness of the present prime minister's submitted plan, which was approved by the parliament.... The new prime minister, however, has not implemented any part of this plan. None of the economic statistics are positive. This, as well as what the people think about the situation, are of no importance to the prime minister. Of importance is the fact that the president of the republic is pleased with his work. It is "God's" will, not the people's will.... It is simply amazing how, after all of this, government officials, including the president and the prime minister, can calmly tell the people that progress has occurred in our societal and economic affairs. Can they really believe that the people have lost their ability to reason and that they believe "their chosen saviors"? [Gevorgyan] Mr Kotanyan, do you see any way out of this difficult economic situation? [Kotanyan] Ensuring the physical survival of the people and solving the fundamental issue of social protection have become a matter of paramount importance in this republic today. In past years, however, this issue was not substantially addressed in the government's plan of action, while it was totally absent in the plan for 1993. The goal can be achieved through a system of state guarantee of minimum means of existence. There must be established on the one hand a certain relationship between prices for the minimum means of existence and fixed prices, and on the other hand between wages, minimum pension and subsidy amounts. Each and every citizen must be provided with foodstuffs of various types, in a guaranteed manner, by the state, and this also applies to an assured annual ration of clothing, including footwear, which should be provided at very low prices on a quota basis to every citizen of this republic, with the addition of a system of compensation for paid and municipal services. The state must take over the task of solving the problem of ensuring physical means of existence, securing the necessary resources by means of state procurement, humanitarian aid, and other means. This is the foremost, urgent item in this republic under present conditions. The next most important issue is the drawing up of a complex program of the republic's economic development. This must be grounded on the preservation and further development of the genetic resources of our people. With its centuries-old history, the Armenian people have proven that it displays exceptional skills in the fields of science and education, literature and music, the applied arts, aesthetics and sculpture, architecture and construction, engineering, and commerce. Securing and further development of the above by the state is the most rapid and reliable way to implement reforms in this republic and to make an early entry into the world market. Unfortunately the state is promoting primarily an unregulated, profiteering system of commerce, and this greatly aggravates the social situation. Finally, one must clearly recognize that the long duration of the process of worsening of the people's standard of living and the absence of programs to correct the situation at the present time seriously endanger the prospects of transition to a market economy, and it becomes unacceptable to people. This situation essentially means collapse of the process of reforms, and this can be of fateful significance to the future of the republic. [Gevorgyan] Development of the economy is essentially dictated by the system of government management. Can one consider the presently functioning system to be productive? [Kotanyan] Essentially the republic and economic management model is a repeat of the Russian Federation model. Russia is an extremely large state, with its population as well as its resources and territory. It therefore definitely needed substantial decentralization of the economic management system and a broadening of local (state, autonomous republics, etc) functions, in order to give many of the entities below the national level a status of specific economic management and regulation. This is a characteristic of a multinational state which possesses ethnic and territorial integrity. The Republic of Armenia is a small state, which assumes, based on the scale of the state, a state system of government, and therefore it requires a very limited decentralization of economic management. If we add to this our distinctive, specific geopolitical requirements, it will become apparent that the Russian variation of decentralization of economic management is unacceptable for our republic. The group which is carrying out our "economic reforms," however, lacking knowledge of our republic, failed to grasp those distinctive features and was unable to tailor legislative formulations to these features. The only solution was to repeat (with cursing and adjustment to the Armenian pattern) the Russian orientation, Russia's adopted resolutions, laws and decisions. One other important and disturbing question deals with choosing a system of state management which will further promote democratization of the country's political and economic affairs and will ensure further growth. We should note in this regard that none of the CIS countries, including Armenia, is ready for a presidential system of government. Presidential government requires an appropriate political sophistication, an arena for economic and law-related activities in which each citizen, political and public organization functions only following laws developed on the basis of a democratic constitution, and where there is no possibility of violation of the constitution at all levels of government. In order to create such a situation, a certain period of time is required for psychological restructuring of the people. This applies in equal measure both to the masses and to officials involved in economic management. It follows from this that in Armenia the parliamentary system of government must be maintained for the foreseeable future.
