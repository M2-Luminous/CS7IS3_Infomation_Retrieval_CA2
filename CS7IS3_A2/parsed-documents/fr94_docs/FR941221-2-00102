FR941221-2-00102 FR941221-2-00071 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;352 and 50&hyph;353] Philadelphia Electric Company; Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;39 and NPF&hyph;85, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation of the Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Units 1 and 2, located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Environmental Assessment Identification of the Proposed Action The proposed action would grant an exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, ``Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing for Water-Cooled Power Reactors,'' Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3, which require that Type B and C containment penetration leak rate tests be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case greater than 2 years. The licensee requests that, this one-time exemption would allow the two-year interval to be exceeded by no more than 26 days and not to surpass February 19, 1995. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated July 22, 1994. The Need for the Proposed Action The affected containment penetrations must be leak rate tested (either Type B or C test) during shutdown reactor conditions because testing of the penetrations requires access to the drywell or requires isolation of safety systems. The required leak rate test intervals for the affected penetrations listed on the licensee's exemption request will exceed the 2-year maximum test interval, if not tested between January 24, 1995 and February 18, 1995. The licensee's upcoming refueling outage is scheduled to begin on January 28, 1995. The licensee has proposed the exemption to extend the leak test interval for the affected penetrations by no more than 26 days. This will allow the licensee to avoid shutting down 4 days earlier for the sole purpose of conducting Appendix J Type B and C tests. The proposed action will permit the licensee to have flexibility to schedule the leak rate tests within the upcoming outage time period. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The licensee has presented information in support of their request for a 26-day extension of the Type B and C test intervals. The Unit 2, as-left minimum pathway leak rate (i.e., maximum allowable leakage rate for maintaining primary containment), following the second Unit 2 refueling outage, was .13 L a (maximum allowable pathway leakage) or 20,625 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), including contributions from the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV); with a maximum pathway leak rate of .27 L a or 42,502 sccm, excluding MSIV leakage, in accordance with LGS's current Appendix J exemption. These as-left leak rates represent a significant margin to the maximum allowable pathway leakage of 158,273 sccm.
