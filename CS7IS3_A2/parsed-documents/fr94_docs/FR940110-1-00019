FR940110-1-00019 FR940110-1-00002 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Parts 1005, 1007, 1011, and 1046 [DA&hyph;93&hyph;29] Milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Marketing Areas; Revised Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Orders AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed suspension of rules. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal that would suspend for nearly two years certain provisions of the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Federal milk orders. If adopted, the proposal would regulate a plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order, instead of the Carolina order, and it would keep regulated under the Tennessee Valley order a plant at Somerset, Kentucky, that otherwise might become regulated under the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order. The proposals were submitted by Land-O-Sun Dairies, which operates the Kingsport, Tennessee, plant, and Southern Bell Dairy, Inc., which operates the Somerset, Kentucky, plant. These handlers contend that without the suspension they would be subject to pricing disparities that could jeopardize their business. DATES: Comments are due no later than January 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be sent to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29): Issued October 22, 1993; published October 28, 1993 (58 FR 57970). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action would lessen the regulatory burden on small entities by removing pricing disparities that are causing or could cause financial hardship for certain distributing plants. The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 57970) on October 28, 1993, concerning the proposed suspension of certain provisions of the Georgia, Carolina, and Tennessee Valley Federal milk orders (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29). The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the notice by submitting written data, views, and arguments by November 4, 1993. Six comment letters were received concerning the three-market proposed suspension. Subsequent to the issuance of the above proposed suspension, a suspension request was received from a handler regulated under the Tennessee Valley order that in effect expands the initial suspension issue to the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order. It also affects a proposed suspension that was issued earlier for the Louisville order. Because of the interrelationship of these several requests, it has been determined that a revised proposed suspension involving all four orders should be issued for comment. Therefore, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), the suspension of the following provisions of the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville marketing areas is being considered for a 23-month period beginning February 1, 1994: 1. In §1005.7(d)(3) of the Carolina order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; 2. In §1007.7(e)(3) of the Georgia order, the words ``, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section,''; 3. In §1007.7 of the Georgia order, paragraph (e)(4); 4. In §1011.7(d)(3) of the Tennessee Valley order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; and 5. In §1046.2 of the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order, the word ``Pulaski''.
