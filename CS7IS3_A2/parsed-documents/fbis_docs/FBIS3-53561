The first signs coming from this summit suggest that the principle of achieving progress on all the negotiating tracks has been accepted. Formerly, there were numerous attempts to isolate the Arab parties and deal with each of them separately. The U.S.-Syrian meeting also appears to have clarified other basic principles of the peace process. I have said that it is wrong to believe that a meeting of heads of state would deal with details. It is also wrong to believe that such a summit meeting is an uncalculated adventure. In other words, I believe that the summit has successfully laid down general principles and fundamental policies in connection with the peace operation. I am sure that this will have a favorable effect on the Lebanese negotiating track [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] Has there been any contact between you and the Syrian foreign minister? [Buwayz] I believe that a meeting will be held shortly to clarify certain points that have not been fully outlined. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have noted that the summit will have a favorable effect on the Lebanese negotiating track. In what way do you think this will happen? [Buwayz] You know that the Lebanese negotiating track and the issue of south Lebanon, though primarily dealing with private Lebanese affairs, are also linked to the general regional situation, both with regard to the peace process and a prospective peace agreement. Lebanon has repeatedly declared that it will not sign a peace agreement except in concert with the other Arab brothers and after all Arab rights have been secured. Additionally, there are actual conditions in the field that are connected to the regional situation. Doubtlessly, the broad outlines agreed upon yesterday will have a positive effect on these conditions and give fresh impetus to the negotiations. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what impressions did you get while following the U.S.-Syrian summit yesterday? [Buwayz] Of course, it was a summit meeting between the President of the United States whose decisions, following the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, are significant on the international level, and President al-Asad, who holds several cards enabling him to negotiate from a position of power. The dialogue, therefore, took place between two strong figures who were able to make decisions and commitments. This is a very important point. I also feel that the dialogue was between two people fully conversant with the complexity of the Middle East crisis and its secondary problems and able to handle them. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the Israeli condition to halt resistance operations before a solution is reached? [Buwayz] We have repeatedly said that the resistance in the south is a consequence of the occupation and can never end until the occupation is terminated.
