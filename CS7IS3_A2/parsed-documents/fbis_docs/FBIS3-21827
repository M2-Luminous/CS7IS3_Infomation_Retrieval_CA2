Correa Isaza was the regional director of the Antioquia Prosecutor's Office technical corps. The assassins were traveling in a white Renault 9 and fled the scene after killing Correa Isaza. So far, authorities have been unable to locate the perpetrators. Correa Isaza was traveling in a gray Renault 18 when several men attacked his car near a building at No. 82-24, 49B Street and shot him several times. The Antioquia Prosecutor's Office official was immediately taken to Pablo Tobon Uribe hospital in Medellin, where he died in the emergency room a few minutes later. Correa Isaza's driver was also seriously injured in the attack. Correa Isaza was reportedly going to look for his girlfriend when he was attacked. Luis Fernando Correa, a 34-year-old lawyer who graduated from Medellin University, was a key government figure in obtaining the surrender of several criminals and implementing the witness protection program. He was widely known in legal circles for helping get Nicolas Escobar Urquijo, nephew of Medellin Cartel drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria, out of the country, and for helping transfer Escobar Gaviria's relatives to Santa Fe de Bogota. Moreover, Correa Isaza was conducting important investigations of people accused of belonging to the Medellin Cartel. According to witnesses, Correa was shot by a young, stocky man dressed in blue who was picked up a few seconds later by a white Renault 9. It is therefore suspected that more people are involved in the crime. Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he regretted the incident and although the reason for the crime and the perpetrators are still unknown, Correa Isaza was involved in many delicate investigations that could have prompted the murder. The ranking judicial official said the regional director of Antioquia Prosecutor's Office technical corps was a brave man who took too many risks because, despite his delicate position, he liked to move about the city alone or only with his driver. Ivan Felipe Palacios, secretary of the departmental government, said "one cannot understand how such things happen to people who are only honestly and positively working in favor of justice and the country." He asked the Prosecutor General's Office to begin immediately an investigation of the crime, because "we cannot progress without finding the real culprits." He asserted: I am going to be very conscious of everything related to this case because it is very painful for justice and for the people of Antioquia." During one of Correa Isaza's latest operations, 70 kg of dynamite were seized from the estate of the father of late Medellin Cartel member Alfonso Leon Puerta Munoz, alias "El Angelito."
