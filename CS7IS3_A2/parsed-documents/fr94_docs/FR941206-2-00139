FR941206-2-00139 FR941206-2-00093 Research and Special Programs Administration [Docket No. PS&hyph;94&hyph;1W; Notice 1] Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline Tensile Properties of Unknown Steel Pipe, Grant of Waiver; Amoco Pipeline Co. Amoco Pipeline Company (Amoco) petitioned the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for a waiver from compliance with a pipeline safety standard regarding determination of tensile properties of unknown steel pipe (49 CFR 192.107(b)(1)). This standard provides certain methods of establishing the yield strength of pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification not listed in Section I of Appendix B to Part 192 or whose specification or tensile properties are unknown. This petition applies to approximately 35 miles of 16 inch pipeline in the State of Missouri. Amoco requested the waiver for a section of pipeline that is being converted from liquid to natural gas service. The pipeline is composed of 17 miles of 0.250 inch wall thickness, A.O. Smith electric weld pipe, constructed in 1948 and 18 miles of 0.281 inch wall thickness, National seamless pipe, constructed in 1952. Although it is believed that both sections consist of Grade B pipe, no documentation verifying this is available. Hazardous liquids were transported through this line until 1993, when it was purged with inert nitrogen gas. The pipeline, which was internally inspected in 1988, has not been hydrostatically tested. The petition requests that the tensile strength determination procedures contained in Section II-D of Appendix B to Part 192, as referenced in 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1), be waived in favor of the tensile strength determination methods contained in 49 CFR Part 195.5(a)(1) with consideration to applicable class location factors contained in 49 CFR 192.111. Furthermore, the petition states that the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP), will be established by reducing the test pressure as required by 49 CFR 192.619(a)(2)(ii) for the class location. A recent amendment to 49 CFR Part 195.5(a), Docket PS&hyph;127; Amendment 195&hyph;52, allows determination of design pressure by pressure testing a hazardous liquid pipeline to yield in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N. The design pressure is calculated as eighty percent of the yield strength, as determined by the pressure test. In an August 31, 1992, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Docket PS&hyph;124; Notice 1, RSPA proposed similar amendments to 49 CFR 192.14(a)(1). Since RSPA has received no comments opposing the rulemaking and a rule change is forthcoming, RSPA, by this order, finds that the requested waiver of 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1) is appropriate and is not inconsistent with pipeline safety. Therefore, Amoco Pipeline Company's petition for waiver from compliance with 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1) is granted, effective December 12, 1994. Issued in Washington, DC on November 28, 1994. George W. Tenley, Jr., Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29998 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;60&hyph;P
