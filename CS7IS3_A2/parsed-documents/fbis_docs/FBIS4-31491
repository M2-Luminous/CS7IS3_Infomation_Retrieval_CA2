"The question is only by how many percent -- whether it will be enough to form a government or whether there will have to be a coalition," Meciar said today at a meeting with journalists. "We're not closed to anybody... we'll go with anyone who the voters choose for us," he said, adding however that he would not like to have Hungarian minority leader Miklos Duray as a coalition partner. If the other parties were not interested in cooperating with the HZDS, it would be their mistake if they did not get into the government, Meciar said. "We are not isolated. We have our half of the playground which we're playing on, and all the others are in the other half," he said. The HZDS had calculations of the results, and they would be totally different from what was forecast in the polls. He also said that dispute reigned in the coalition, that the Hungarian parties were distancing themselves from it because of rivalry with the Democratic Left Party (SDL) concerning its position in southern Slovakia. Once again, he forecast that the SDL, his main political rival, would break up after the elections. Meciar presented himself as a defender of the Romany minority, and "let on" that negotiations between the HZDS and Romany leaders were in their final phase. Many Romanies are now declaring themselves to be of Hungarian nationality. "With today's spread of power, it could happen that the Hungarians do not get into power if the Romanies come forward as one political grouping," he said. If the HZDS wins the elections it will be able to come to a agreement with Hungary on the conclusion of a basic treaty, Meciar said. "I am an optimist as far as finding a solution to relations with Hungary in the near future goes," he added. Interest in European integration would result in a "major settlement" between the two countries, which would put aside historical and psychological barriers such as memories of Magyarisation, wartime occupation and the presence of Hungarian troops in Slovakia in 1968. While his opponents accuse him of worsening relations with Hungary, Meciar said today that during secret talks the late Hungarian president, Josef Antall, had agreed to Slovakia's request that the inviolability of borders be confirmed. "The only problem was whether to declare it directly or with reference to international documents," Meciar said, adding that the same agreement had also been made with ex-Premier Peter Boross, but had not been made public due to the Hungarian election campaign. On the situation after the socialist election victory in Hungary, Meciar said that two groups were forming. One wanted relations with Slovakia to improve first, and then a solution to the minorities issue, while the other wanted to solve the minorities issue first and then improve relations. "The rhetoric of Gyula Horn (chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party) is not so very different from Antall's rhetoric. He has changed the terminology, but as regards autonomy (for the Hungarian minority) he has not changed anything. Some of the things he has said about Slovaks have not inspired hope either. Nonetheless, we believe that it was pre-election or post-election euphoria, that he will return to political realism and that in the interest of improving relations we can sign an agreement in a few months. Meciar ascribed his bad reputation in the media to "expedient propaganda" which until the end of 1992 was supposed to save Czechoslovakia and afterwards served new interest groups in the world. However, he admitted that the HZDS and former government information policy had been "catastrophic" and "sinfully neglected." He added that "one neighbouring state last year alone spent 98 million dollars on creating its reputation," part of which had been allegedly spent on forming a negative image for Meciar. "And we did not put up even a heller [as recieved] against it. That is not the way to build an image," Meciar said.
