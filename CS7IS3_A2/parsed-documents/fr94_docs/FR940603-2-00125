FR940603-2-00125 FR940603-2-00081 [Release No. 34&hyph;34127; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Submission of Options Transaction Data for Trade Recording and Price Reporting Purposes May 27, 1994. On January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties,'' Interpretation and Policy .01, to allow members to submit options transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes through an electronic data storage medium approved by the Exchange. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 On April 12, 1994, the CBOE submitted a letter clarifying that the proposal would allow buyers and sellers to submit transaction information through an electronic data storage medium acceptable to the Exchange and allow them to provide the information required for price reporting through an electronic data transmission link approved by the CBOE. See letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated April 8, 1994. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33730 (March 8, 1994), 59 FR 11814. No comments were received on the proposed rule change. Currently, CBOE Rule 6.51, Interpretation and Policy .01, requires both the buyer and the seller in a transaction to record on a card or ticket information concerning the transaction, including the buyer's or seller's assigned broker initial code and his clearing firm (if a market maker), the symbol of the underlying security, the type, expiration month and exercise price of the option contract, the transaction price, the number of contract units comprising the transaction, the time of the transaction, the name of the contra clearing firm member and the assigned broker initial code of the contra member. Under Interpretation and Policy .01, this information constitutes the ``transaction record.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow members to submit options transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes through an electronic data storage medium approved by the Exchange. Under current CBOE Rule 6.51, Interpretation and Policy .01, buyers and sellers must submit transaction data in paper form only, either on a trade ticket or transaction card. The CBOE believes that in today's market and operations technology environment, that limitation is unduly restrictive, and some CBOE members have requested the opportunity to submit transaction record data by means of electronic data transmission. Submission in that form would enable those members to enjoy the efficiency of reporting trades and prices to the CBOE through the same automated medium they use to report that information to their clearing firms. Accordingly, the CBOE seeks authority to approve particular electronic media in addition to paper that CBOE members may use for trade recording and price reporting purposes.
