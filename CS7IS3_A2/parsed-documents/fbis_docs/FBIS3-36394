The attempt was made yesterday by the management of a vessel construction team, quoting an instruction by the Black Sea Fleet command. Reporting this fact, the press center of Ukraine's Navy recalls that the day before, on 3 February, base personnel informed the Ukrainian Navy and Black Sea Fleet commands, as well as Ukraine's Defense Ministry about its decision to transfer to the Ukrainian Army to serve the people of Ukraine, since both commissioned and non-commissioned officers had lost all hope for a civilized solution on the part of the fleet's command to the problem of dividing the Black Sea Fleet and, consequently, to their social problems. In its own commentary on the incident, the Black Sea Fleet press center notes that the fleet's command does not object to servicemen joining the Ukrainian Army, but the materials and capital equipment must remain with the fleet until the presidents of Ukraine and Russia make an appropriate decision on the division of the fleet property. Employees of the hospital base complain of an ongoing removal of materials and equipment from the supply depots. They say they are trying to prevent any new attempts to seize the stock.
