[passage omitted] Turkey's overt declaration that Ankara and Tel Aviv are cooperating on combating hizbollah indicates that gradual moves by the Muslim combatants are taking shape in Turkey and in all Muslim countries. [passage omitted] Iran has displayed great restraint over Turkey's irresponsible and provocative actions, which include its cooperation with the various counter-revolutionary Iranian groups. This restraint and tolerance has limits and Ciller's government should ponder the dangerous consequences of these adventurist actions. It is the Iranian people and Government's rightful expectation that these aggressive actions are halted and that the Turkish Government tenders an apology and a guarantee that such incidents will not recur.
