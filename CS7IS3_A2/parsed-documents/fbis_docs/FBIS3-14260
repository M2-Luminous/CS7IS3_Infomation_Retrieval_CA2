[Al-Saqr] There were many motives for my resignation but I do not believe it is appropriate to reveal them. They are personal. [Al-Salman] But it has been claimed that the resignation had something to do with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. [Al-Saqr] One of the reasons for the resignation was the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the lifting of the boycott of Israel, perhaps because I belong to a generation which has Arab convictions. Generally speaking, my views may not be in harmony with the current trend. [Al-Salman] Why did you withdraw the resignation? [Al-Saqr] At the insistence of my colleagues, the Assembly members. [Al-Salman] To what extent does the Foreign Affairs Committee contribute to the formulation of Kuwait's foreign policy? [Al-Saqr] In the previous session the National Assembly decided to form a joint overall committee combing the interior and defense and foreign affairs committees to submit a study on Kuwait's affairs, security, and defense strategy. And indeed we did that and I chaired both committees. We began our work during the previous session but the task was not completed. [Al-Salman] Why not? [Al-Saqr] Because of the complex diverse issues. We have sought the assistance of some academicians, specialists, and officers and we intend to seek the help of experts in the Arab world, Europe, and the United States. That is why we have requested an extension of the committee's deadline by another year and the Assembly has granted that request. [Al-Salman] How do you assess the Assembly's achievements? [Al-Saqr] It made good achievements up to the last third of the second term. For example, it discussed public funds and investments and passed a law for the protection of all public funds. All these were achievements. Let us not forget that this Assembly came after the catastrophe of the Iraqi occupation and it faced challenges in exceptional circumstances not experienced by past legislative assemblies. The public believes that some priority issues are not worth discussing but we should view matters comprehensively and weigh the challenges which Kuwait has had to meet. [Al-Salman] What is the National Assembly's position on the Damascus Declaration? How do you view it? [Al-Saqr] We back and support the Damascus Declaration because we see it as a step in the right direction. If we view the Damascus Declaration as an advanced step in the development of the Arab League's work and link it to the regional organization of the Gulf Cooperation Council states on which we pin great hopes, we will see a solid interlinked chain on the right road. [Al-Salman] What about Iran? [Al-Saqr] Iran is a neighboring state with which we have geographical and historical links. We seek relations based on mutual respect. That "respect" is what we wish for.
