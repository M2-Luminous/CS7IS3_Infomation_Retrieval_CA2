China's advisory body on transitional matters--the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)--put forward the radical proposal yesterday, to counter a potential legal vacuum which members say could cripple Hong Kong for between three to six months. The proposal resolved to ask the National People's Congress to authorise the Preparatory Committee to make laws until a permanent legislature is established. China has said it will dissolve the Legislative Council in 1997, leaving the territory without a law- making body. It is believed it will take China between three to six months to set up a new government after 30 June 1997. But a legislative vacuum will only exist if China decides to change or abolish existing Hong Kong laws. If no changes are made there will be a parliamentary recess until the new Legislative Council is formed. The PWC's legal group will conduct a review of Hong Kong laws and recommend if any need to be changed under Chinese rule. In a heated debate during the PWC's meeting yesterday members also planned to grant the chief executive power to proclaim interim legislation. Some members argued that under the Basic Law the Preparatory Committee did not have the power to take on the role of the legislature. But others said the committee's task was to deal with issues concerning the formation of the first government. China threatened to abolish the through train principle and dissolve the Legislative Council following the breakdown of Sino- British talks on Hong Kong's political future.
