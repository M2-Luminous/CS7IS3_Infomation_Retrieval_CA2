No one was hurt in the firing, which caused the pupils to retreat to their classrooms. Police then sealed off the school, situated some 500 metres (yards) from the home of President Pascal Lissouba. The students said they would go on strike Wednesday if the identity checks, said to be for security reasons, were not stopped. The Chaminade, one of Brazzaville's leading schools, has more than 2,000 students.
