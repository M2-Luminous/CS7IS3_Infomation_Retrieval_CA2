On August 1, 1994, Ogden Martin Systems of Onondaga Limited Partnership (Ogden) filed a petition seeking waiver of certain of the Commission's regulations. In particular, Ogden requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR Part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by Ogden. On October 14, 1994, the Commission issued an Order Granting Waiver of Regulations And Denying Refund Request (Order), in the above-docketed proceeding. The Commission's October 14, 1994 Order granted the request for blanket approval under 18 CFR Part 34, subject to the following conditions found in Ordering Paragraphs (D), (E), and (G): (D) Within 30 days of the date of this order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the Commission's blanket approval of issuances of securities or assumptions of liabilities by Ogden should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211, 385.214. (E) Absent a request to be heard within the period set forth in Order (D) above, Ogden is authorized to issue securities and to assume obligations or liabilities as guarantor, endorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issue or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of the applicant, compatible with the public interest, and reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. (G) The Commission reserves the right to modify this order and to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected by continued Commission approval of Ogden's issuance of securities or assumption of liabilities or by continued holding of interlocks. Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is November 14, 1994. Copies of the full text of the order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3308, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
