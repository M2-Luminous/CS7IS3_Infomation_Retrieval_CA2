"There are two issues: The apparent gulf between the European public and European bureaucracy and the controversy over the transfer of responsibilities," he said. "Some years ago this choice of title for a talk would have been inconceivable; it would have seemed ridiculous or Moscow-inspired. But now the advocates of European building must come to terms with a challenge to its very principle, as well as doubts and unenthusiasm. This was not serious as long as the very foundations of Europe were not threatened, but this is happening now, and publicly too. Mrs. Thatcher has gained converts, and not only in Italy. In other words, to be a European now means to expose yourself to suspicion or marginalization," Van Miert explained. Minimalist Europe "The Paris-Bonn axis is no longer the heart of European action. Paris is not happy about Europe's enlargement or about Germany's growing influence, so much so that it is becoming an internal French problem of balance," Karel van Miert continued. "But there is more to it than that: Every member state is engaging in an increasingly sharp debate on its financial contribution and on what benefits its derives in terms of budgets and transfers. Germany and Spain stand out in this regard. This kind of inter-Belgian debate, with which we are well acquainted, is now developing throughout the Europe of the Twelve. We have even heard remarks that indicate a negative attitude with regard to aid to Palestine. Thus the minimalist Europe is gaining ground. The possible elimination of the Commission is even being suggested. Such ideas are being advocated publicly and even in election campaigns." Positive Aspects of Europe Nevertheless, Karel van Miert believes that the advocates of Europe must go back onto the offensive more. And that they have every justification for doing so. "First, there is the historic necessity for European unification, which guarantees peace in Western Europe. Furthermore, if we slide down the slippery slope of nationalisms, nobody knows where the trend could lead. And threats of confrontation could reemerge, doubtless more quickly than is imagined." And this is why the European commissioner considers populism and hypernationalism major and very dangerous faults. "Last, there is the entire internal dynamic of the great European market, despite certain shortcomings, compromise decisions, and disappointments. It is leading to the liberalization of markets in both telecommunications and air transport. It is a difficult transition, but the change will enable Europe to meet the challenges presented by the United States and Japan worldwide." "This dynamism also occurs in other fields, such as audiovisual media. The Commission is currently examining some 20 cases: The disputes are between the public and private sectors, the national and the regional, while major groups are being established to implement the latest advances in computer technology and other innovations. The dispute extends to sports and to the broadcasting of soccer matches." "I also note," Karel van Miert said, "that it is often the countries that most criticize European building that are also most demanding in terms of community directives." "Experience also shows that major principles are not enough if they are not accompanied by specific instructions for their implementation. Last, within the growing interdependence, of which even the Germans are now becoming more aware, in the light of their own difficulties, European Monetary Union also appears to be a necessity. And the Twelve absolutely must reach agreement on this." Crucial Issues Having described the negative and positive aspects of the EU today, the EC vice president concluded by saying that "the EU enlargement will raise some crucial issues. He fears blockages, because individual members will from time to time raise questions, as in connection with the accession of Malta and Cyprus. The EU foreign and defense policy also suffers as a result of this. At the institutional level, some major member states are unwilling to accept that the rotating presidency be granted to minor states." "Last, there is the huge cost of the envisaged enlargement. In order to achieve it it will be necessary to increase the Union's resources `enormously.' And there is therefore a danger of lapsing into a policy of expedience." Karel van Miert therefore thought it inevitable that the trend would be toward a two-speed Europe. This prospect has become unavoidable. "To pretend otherwise would be to lie to the public," he said. "Some countries are tired of waiting for new progress on the road to union. Some member states must also realize that at the end of the transition period they must better honor the obligations connected with their EU membership. This also applies to Switzerland, which citing its democratic aspirations, is trying to establish new relations with the Twelve, in the belief that it can derive the maximum benefits for the minimum of drawbacks and offsets."
