Konstantin Zatulin Becomes Still Dearer to Sergey Shakhray"] [Text] A press conference by Konstantin Zatulin, Duma CIS Affairs Committee chairman, was devoted to presidential elections in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus]. The last week before them, the Duma man thought, will be decisive. In both sovereign republics there are two main candidates for the lofty position: Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Kuchma in Ukraine, and Mr. Kebich and Mr. Lukashenko in Belorussia. Mr. Zatulin pointed out the high probability that a second round of voting in both countries may be required to determine the winners, whereas just recently no one doubted the victory of Mr. Kuchma and Mr. Kebich. From then on, however, the committee head remarked, it is the Russian mass media that played a negative role. For example, the media resolutely sided with Leonid Kravchuk although, Mr. Zatulin thought, "Ukraine's policy under this president has been marked by craftiness and a lack of sincerity, and by the desire to oppose Russia in things big and small, from the United Nations, to NATO, to the CIS. Leonid Kuchma's program calling for closer and friendlier links between an independent Ukraine and Russia is liked much more by the Duma man. The latest "pro-Kravchuk" publications in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and especially television's Channel One's taking a program about Mr. Kuchma off the air, appear more than strange to him. Also obvious is Mr. Zatulin's Belorussian affection -- Vyacheslaw Kebich. Albeit he cannot understand a few things there: Why should the Duma, on a cue from the Agrarian faction, give the floor to the chief opponent of today's Belorussian premier, that "local version of Gdlyan." The CIS Committee head likened Aleksandr Lukashenko's report with the report of his fellow committee chairman, Mr. Ilyukhin, head of the Security Committee, during the reading of the Law on Combating Corruption, referring to both as "a method of squaring accounts with entrepreneurship." Mr. Lukashenko's victory would mean compromising the idea of mending fences between Belorussia and Russia, concluded Mr. Zatulin. He also pointed to the danger of a polarization of the heretofore calm Belorussian society once supporters of recent speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and of People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak unite on one flank. In winding up, Konstantin Zatulin explained his quitting as executive secretary of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord faction in the State Duma by his being too busy in the CIS Committee, in the party, etc. He specially stressed the absence of differences with Sergey Shakhray, and even pointed out the now established harmony because resignations are something the Party of Russian Unity and Accord has come to live with.
