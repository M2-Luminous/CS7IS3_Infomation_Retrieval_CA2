The purpose of the petition is to have the two Lao generals investigated in accordance with government policy, because they support the organization of illegal movements on Thai territory opposing the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The LNLA secretly gathered men, weapons, and food supplies in areas of Chiang Kham District in Phayao Province and Thung Chang, Mae Rim, and Tha Wang Pha Districts in Nan Province to launch several armed operations in the LPDR. [passage omitted] In October 1993, the Thai Supreme Command stated that action was being taken against some of the 6,096 Lao refugees living at Tham Krabok temple in Saraburi Province when it was discovered that they were followers of Vang Pao. The Thai Government's harsh policy against Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit and their followers -- charging them with national security violations and illegal entry -- will help eliminate the LPDR Government's suspicions and contribute to stronger relations between the two countries.
