Almost weekly newspapers trumpet the crash of one or another of these ventures that mushroomed in all the four winds, but it is also newspapers that advertise new such games run by "dependable" firms. Naive people ignore warnings from the authorities and the over one million complaints registered so far with the police, claiming return of invested sums, and keep placing their money hoping that, for once, they will strike it. But when it all comes to a dead end, they suddenly start to panic and revolt at the thought that they will not be able to recover at least the money first deposited. In some cases game runners return 80 percent of the initial deposit, keeping the change for their pockets. In other cases the end begins with announcements like "no payments today," or "the bank did not have enough cash," or "the boss is away for two days," or "operations halted for repairs to defective computer." Last Monday in Pitesti, frustration reached such magnitude in those cheated that the town was on the verge of disaster. Several thousands of the 600,000 investors in the various "mutuals," seized with rage, marched to the local game houses, threatening to devastate and set them ablaze. Their wrath then found other targets: the mayor of Pitesti, the prefecture, the Agricultural Bank, the financial police. A young man, suspected of being the bodyguard of one of the game bosses, was molested by the mob. The prompt intervention of the police somehow quenched the fury of the crowd stopping it from making more victims and causing more damage. However, four such houses had been already ravaged. The police announced that one of the bosses of such a "mutual assistance" circuit, the "Philadelphia," Ioan Negruta, 39 years of age, an electrician by profession, was arrested under the charges of fraud, embezzlement, and fraudulent bankruptcy, only two days after he had given assurances on the local TV network that the circuit was all right and going on after having made, he said, no less than 25,000 millionaires among Pitesti residents and having made payments in the region of 35 billion lei. The police detected a 2 billion lei fraud in the firm's books. More exactly, the total deposit stands at 25.2 billion lei, of which 150 million had been registered as the owner's profit and 23 billion as paid to investors.
