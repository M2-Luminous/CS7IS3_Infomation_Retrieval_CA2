FR940622-1-00050 FR940622-1-00015 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300345; FRL&hyph;4868&hyph;6] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 Ethyl Oleate; Tolerance Exemption AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes that ethyl oleate (ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils) be exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, cosolvent) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities after harvest. This proposed regulation was requested by Victorian Chemicals. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300345], must be received on or before July 22, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Tina Levine, Registration Support Branch, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 2800 Crystal Drive, North Tower, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-5971. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Victorian Chemical Co. Pty. Ltd., 37-49 Appleton St., P.O. Box 71, Richmond, Victoria, 3121 Australia, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4303 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for ethyl oleate (ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils) when used as a solvent or cosolvent in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities after harvest. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125 and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statment on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for ethyl oleate will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below. 1. Ethyl oleate, as defined, is expected to be metabolized to ethyl alcohol and edible fatty acids, rendering it of minimal toxicological concern. 2. There is no significant difference between ethyl oleate and methyl oleate, which is approved under 40 CFR 180.1001(c). In fact, as noted by the FDA (57 FR 12709, Apr. 13, 1992), on an equal basis, methyl esters of fatty acids have more toxic potential than the ethyl esters because of the potential for the release of methyl alcohol. 3. The FDA has approved ethyl oleate as a direct food additive in aqueous emulsions for dehydrating grapes to produce raisins under 21 CFR 172.225. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredeint is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300345]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Dated: June 7, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Divison, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1001(c) is amended in the table therein by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredient, to read as follows: §180.1001 Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. *␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣*␣␣␣* (c) *␣*␣* ␣ 1Inert ingredients 1Limits 1Uses ␣ *␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣* Ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils ␣ Solvent, cosolvent ␣ *␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣*␣␣␣* *␣␣*␣␣*␣␣*␣␣* [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15078 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
