This kind of opportunity presented itself with an invitation issued by the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission where Minister Olechowski spoke Thursday [17 February]. His speech was very concrete. The minister, who has been talking from the beginning about a need for close cooperation between politics and economics, outlined five programs for specific cooperation with the countries from beyond our Eastern border: --"Contact" is a program that is designed to support the development of human contacts, broadly speaking--individual, interparliamentary, intergovernmental, interministerial, and cultural contacts; --"Associates" is a program of measures aimed at establishing mutual, capital-related associations which would strengthen economic cooperation; --"Wokulski" is a program designed to support Polish exporters of merchandise and services; --"Transit" is a program of measures for improving and widening the infrastructure which would make it possible to profit from Poland's beneficial geographical location; --"Market and Democracy" is a program designed to cover governmental and extra-governmental projects which will support the development of market and democracy. Polish East policies are without a doubt a continuation of the policies of postcommunist governments. But since 1989, so much has been happening beyond our Eastern border, that a straightforward continuation of the policies applied up to now is not possible. Besides, it turned out that while Poland has a vision of a policy regarding its own security and that of the region, Russia has no such vision. At least that was the impression made after the "whole confusion" linked with President Boris Yeltsin's Warsaw statement regarding our membership in NATO. We will be able to find out soon what kind of policy Russia really wants to conduct vis-a-vis Poland and East and Central Europe. The Russian foreign minister will talk about that in Krakow next week--he has been invited to a Polish-Russian conference called "In the Direction of a New Partnership," which is being organized by the International Center for the Development of Democracy.
