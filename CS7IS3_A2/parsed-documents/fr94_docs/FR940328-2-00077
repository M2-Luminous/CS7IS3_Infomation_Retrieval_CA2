FR940328-2-00077 FR940328-2-00050 The Exchange is therefore proposing permanent approval of the amendments to Rule 109. In the alternative, the Exchange is requesting an extension of the pilot program for an additional one-year period, if the Commission feels that further study and monitoring of the effects of the pilot program are necessary. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 109 are consistent with these objectives in that they are designed to allow stops, in minimum fractional change markets, under limited circumstances that provide for the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b)(5) 7 and section 11(b) 8 of the Act. The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 109 should further the objectives of section 6(b)(5) and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum fractional change markets, under limited circumstances that provide the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops. 9 7 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). 8 15 U.S.C. 78k (1988). 9 For a description of Amex procedures for stopping stock in minimum fractional change markets, and of the Commission's rationale for approving those procedures on a pilot basis, see 1992 Approval Order, supra, note 3.
