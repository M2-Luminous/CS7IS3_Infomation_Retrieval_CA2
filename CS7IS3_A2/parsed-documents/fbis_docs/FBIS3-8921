"I ask that the Security Council conduct an investigation of the situation in Kosova at the earliest possible time, and I repeat the appeals of the Albanian Government for a discussion as soon as possible of measures that might be taken in order to prevent further conflict in Kosova," writes Ambassador Kulla. The Albanian ambassador asks for the immediate discussion of the sending of United Nations troops to Kosova in order to prevent the spread of the conflict from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Kosova and asks at the same time that his letter be circulated as an official document of the Security Council. On the subject of ethnic cleansing against the Albanians in Kosova, the ambassador writes that "hundreds of Albanian homes have been raided and 3,400 Albanians have suffered from Serbian police violence, and most of them have been imprisoned. In many cases, the Serbian police have ordered Albanian families, under the threat of death, to leave their homes and emigrate from Kosova. Mr. Kulla also condemns the political trials against Albanians, stressing that "defendants have been tortured, serious procedural errors have been committed, and sentences have been excessive."
