What did you mean by that? [Vazquez] A society can be individualist or collectivist. The first centers on a person's ego, and so society inevitably becomes egoistic. The other alternative seeks the common good for present and future generations. I think that is the key to the matter. The neoliberal concept points to an individualist society, with free competition, where "the best" wins. If we all participated on equal terms I could, perhaps if not accept it, at least analyze it. But not everyone starts from the same point. Some people start with an advantage and arrive first. This is tremendously unfair. Besides, individualist societies can lead to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of very few individuals, who end up controlling the rest of the population. This system considerably weakens democracy. In this system the people do not govern. They are governed by a group of individuals who have concentrated strength, power, and wealth. This group has power and force because it has wealth. This is not democratic, and it materializes as a consequence of the neoliberal concept. On the contrary, societies working with a democratic, collectivist, socialist spirit tend to be a model like the one we have tried to implement in Montevideo, where we have tried to decentralize power, seek people's participation, and redistribute wealth to deepen democracy. This is why we think we will see a confrontation of two sets of ideas. On the one hand there are the liberal or neoliberal ideas--whatever you want to call it, it is the same thing--and on the other progressive, socialist ideas. That is the center of the confrontation. I do not think there are other options. [BUSQUEDA] Who are the "socialists" and who the "neoliberals?" [Vazquez] I do not want to characterize Uruguayans as good or bad. Some of us simply think in one way, and others in a different way. In the National Party the Herreraist faction, other related movements, and Gonzalo Aguirre all point to a neoliberal idea. I do not know what Carlos Julio Pereyra would do in government. All I know is that he has participated in the government with the ruling party, and has supported liberal or neoliberal ideas. The Colorado Party as a whole has neoliberal principles. All Colorado Party factions support neoliberal principles. Pacheco Areco, Jorge Battle, and Luis Maria Sanguinetti do so. [BUSQUEDA] In your opinion, then, a vote for either the National Party or the Colorado Party suggests a vote for "neoliberalism," while the Broad Front alone supports "socialist" ideas? [Vazquez] Yes, although it is not only the Broad Front that believes in alternatives to the neoliberal system. Many progressive groups within the National Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Civic Union, and the PGP [Party of Government by the People], which do not want to join in a coalition with the Colorado Party, also have alternative ideas. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think Cerro Largo Mayor Rodolfo Nin Novoa is the best candidate for becoming your running mate? [Vazquez] I do not know if he is the best candidate, but from the point of view of an alliance, he has extremely important credentials. He was Cerro Largo's mayor during the previous period, and was reelected. There must be a reason. He could have chosen between the Cerro Largo city hall and a seat in the Senate. He chose to continue in a very difficult position, in a very poor department, with very few resources. This shows that he is a very serious politician. He also worked against the impunity law. Then he worked against the imposition of the state enterprises law, and on very important municipal issues. He defended the deregulation of services and functions, political decentralization, and people's participation. He has maintained really progressive ideas within his party, adopting clear positions. He recently said that he was willing to resign from the National Party if necessary to defend his political position. This is extremely serious and consistent. Nin Novoa's political behavior moves in a clearly defined direction, which must be respected. For all these reasons I think he is an excellent candidate for becoming part of a presidential ticket. [BUSQUEDA] What will be the main issues in the campaign? [Vazquez] We think the numbers have to add up, the accounts have to balance, but our ultimate objective is not balanced accounts but an improvement in people's standards of living. All issues that have something to do with human beings will be given priority. For instance, the issue of social security. There is no social security without solidarity. [BUSQUEDA] Do you think the current social security system must be reformed? Or should it be left the way it is now? [Vazquez] I think we have to improve the system, not destroy it. We must improve the system's administration and the collection and distribution of funds. But all improvements must be done without changing the state role, and insisting on each employee's work history. [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the fight against inflation? [Vazquez] The current government reduced the country's inflation rate, but we want to reduce it faster. At what cost and how is another matter, but inflation dropped. We also want a fiscal balance, such as that we achieved in the municipality. This shows that efficiency and the good handling of figures can also be achieved by groups that are not liberal or neoliberal. The difference is that progressive groups seek to benefit man. Figures are not the final objective. Now if you ask me what will be more important, or whether I will support and seek loans for bankrupt financial institutions and banks, the answer is no. That will not prevail in any way. [BUSQUEDA] The state has more than 250,000 employees. Would you implement programs aimed at reducing the number of public employees? [Vazquez] The number of public employees during my municipal administration dropped from 13,000 to 10,500. That was all right because there were too many employees. But I cannot give you an answer now about what we will do if we win the presidential race. If the situation in the national administration is similar to the situation we found at the Montevideo city hall, we will make adjustments. In Montevideo we had a significant number of administrative personnel and few people rendering services to the people, which is what the public needs. We spent more money in the area of services than in any other area. Perhaps the problem is similar at the national level. But we will see about that later. [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the issue of privatization if you become president? [Vazquez] Without prejudices. Private initiative can also generate jobs. If it is correctly handled it can also redistribute wealth. Private initiative is not a dirty word. We can say the same thing about "entrepreneurs" or "enterprises." [BUSQUEDA] Will you speed up the devaluation of our currency if you become president? [Vazquez] From our point of view it is clear that our currency is overvalued, and there is a clear increase in the import of luxurious items. This is the result of the free market concept. These kinds of policies inevitably end up benefiting a small group of people. This group handles large amounts of capital and treats Uruguay as if it were just a financial market. This path is not best for the public. On the other hand, it is true that inflation punishes most harshly the poorest sectors, and particularly those with fixed incomes. I think the goal is to reduce the inflation rate. We must change the concept that the country is just a financial market. We must produce and export more. Trade must be balanced, or it must show a surplus. [BUSQUEDA] Yet exporters contend that as the dollar is cheap, their activity is not cost effective. If you are elected president, do you think you will have to implement some measures in the exchange system? [Vazquez] In the exchange system, and in the country's system as well, because inflation is not the result of only one factor. At one time this administration argued that inflation stemmed from a fiscal imbalance. It therefore undertook a fiscal adjustment to roll down inflation. The fiscal adjustment had some measure of success, but inflation did not go down as much as expected. The administration resorted to other measures that were in obvious alignment with laissez-faire ideas. I think we have to seek a meeting of minds if we are to curb inflation--which weighs more heavily on precisely the neediest--through a different economic, political, and social concept. This cannot be achieved overnight, and the steps to be taken will be gradual. We are not proposing a radical change in policy, but rather a gradual one, trying to keep inflation under control but changing into a producer country through a major industrial retooling. [BUSQUEDA] You said in Rivera last December that wealth ought to be "taxed" and redistributed. Are you considering establishing new taxes or increasing those that are already in effect? [Vazquez] Tax policy should be changed, for example on landholding of unproductive large estates, or on those used for extensive rather than intensive agriculture. Taxes should be levied on the financial sector, and the country's production should be fostered by easing the tax burden on productive activities. Wealth should be taxed so that those who have more may pay more, changing the distribution of taxes. This change may allow us, for example, to reduce the VAT [value added tax]. [BUSQUEDA] Will you encourage the elimination of bank confidentiality if you gain the presidency? [Vazquez] Bank secrecy in Uruguay has led some international sectors to the opinion that Uruguay is a stronghold for the laundering of drug money. If Congress does enact such legislation, and the judiciary gives its okay, I believe that it would be quite appropriate to do away with bank confidentiality in some cases. [BUSQUEDA] Referring to you and to the Broad Front's problems, Luis Eduardo Gonzalez, a sociologist, said in an article published in the MIAMI HERALD: "We have a jockey who is a real pro, but the problem is the horse." What is your opinion on this remark? [Vazquez] The Broad Front is neither the pinnacle nor the ideal as a political party, but it is making much headway. The Broad Front has had internal problems, but over the last few months it has shown very significant coherence. First, it elected provisional authorities who are also empowered with significant decisionmaking power. Second, it proposed that the decisions of the second Broad Front Congress--held in August 1991--concerning political alliances be firmly pursued. Third--and this is something that would have been unimaginable seven or eight months ago--it has been able to draft a framework program dealing with crucial issues such as the external debt, relations with the Armed Forces and the police, and the country's economic and financial policy. We will be able to use this program as a basis for our discussions with other political parties. Moreover, it has nominated its consensus candidates.
