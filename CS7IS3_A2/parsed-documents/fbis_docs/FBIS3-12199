FBIS3-12199 "drnes039_k_94005" FBIS-NES-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 IRAQ Newspapers Comment on Killings at Hebron Mosque AL-QADISIYAH, AL-'IRAQ, AL-JUMHURIYAH: 26 Feb JN2602121894 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0800 GMT 26 Feb 94 JN2602121894 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA)--Iraqi newspapers today stressed that the Zionists' crime in Hebron will continue to be a disgrace to the Zionist entity, America, and all the dwarfs of those who betray their people and nation. Victory is always for the people. In their editorials, the papers denounced the heinous Zionist crime which was perpetrated by the fascist Zionists against Muslim worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron yesterday, Friday. The papers said that the dreadful Hebron massacre shows the treacherous fascist nature of the Zionist Movement and its plotting against the Arab nation and the Palestinian Arab people's entity. The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH calls on the Arab and Muslim masses to rise up against the agent regimes, the Zionist entity, and all those who perpetrated and supported the Zionists' crime in Hebron, which defied the feelings of the Arabs and Muslims in their most sacred holy places and rites. In its editorial under the headline "A Condemned Abominable Zionist Crime," the paper says: This criminal act proves that the Zionists are thirsty for the blood of Muslims and Arabs, and that they have always been seeking to kill and persecute them and to confiscate their right in Arab Palestine. AL-QADISIYAH stresses that the Zionists and their masters must know that this brutal crime and similar despicable hostile acts perpetrated against Muslims in the occupied Arab territories will only strengthen their resolve, escalate their valiant intifadah against the repression of the Zionist entity, and will clearly expose those who are desperate for a settlement and those who pant after the mirage of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The paper says: The odious Hebron massacre has exposed the treacherous fascist nature of the Zionist Movement and its plotting against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people's entity. It reminds us of the Zionists' massacres in Dayr Yasin, Bahr al-Baqar, Abu Za'bal, and elsewhere. The paper explains that this dreadful Zionist crime proves the Zionist entity's insistence on ignoring the feelings of all Arabs and Muslims, confiscating the Palestinian Arab land, and annihilating the Palestinian people in a way that exposes Arab regimes that are linked with the foreigner as well as those who are desperately panting after capitulatory solutions of the settlement Arabs. Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The sons of Palestine are now bolstering their unity with the trench of the eternal Mother of Battles. At the same time, the facts of the Mother of Battles have clearly showed Iraq's ability to stand fast in the face of the Zionist-Atlantic-U.S. satan and its local agents and traitors. Iraq's steadfastness in the eternal Mother of Battles and the Palestinian people's intifadah will continue to be the torch which will dissipate Arab darkness and lead to the Arab nation's historic awakening. The newspaper AL-'IRAQ stresses that what took place at the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn on Friday, the 15th of Ramadan, the month of worship, faith, fasting, and piety, was a new Zionist crime and an abhorrent massacre to be added to the criminal enemy's record of ceaseless acts of killing, annihilation, and mass liquidation of the sons of the Palestinian people, which it has been carrying out since its establishment in Arab Palestine. In its editorial, the paper says: This crime, which was perpetrated by the enemies of God and humanity, the murderer Zionists, has exposed the true nature of the Zionist enemy and its criminal scheme to annihilate the Palestinian people and to uproot them from their holy land through escalating the killing and pursuing of the Palestinian citizens by the occupation forces and settlers who are actually professional military men in civilian clothes, and who have been supplied with the same weapons used by the regular army personnel. AL-'IRAQ adds: Those who scrutinize the enemy's negotiations record and its dirty and twisted methods, beginning with the Rhodes negotiations in 1948, passing through the Camp David Accords with al-Sadat, and ending with the series of meetings which were held in Norway, Switzerland, France, and Egypt, will emerge with one conclusion only; namely, that this treacherous fascist enemy does not believe in peace, will not recognize Arab rights, and has no intention to withdraw from a single inch of Palestine. The paper stresses that the history of the Arab-Zionist conflict has proved that one cannot count on any solution no matter how capitulatory this person maybe and regardless of whether he is responsive to the Zionist avarice or not. This is because our enemy, as the statements of its officials show, beginning with Moshe Sharit [name as transliterated] and Ben-Gurion and ending with Yitzhaq Shamir and Yitzhaq Rabin, is simply committed to the Zionist dream. The paper notes that the new crime will not affect the official U.S. and European stands, especially since the U.S. and Western media, particularly the ill-famed British BBC which, from the very beginning of the massacre, tried to play down the true number of martyrs and wounded, and to show that what has happened was only the the act of an individual Zionist settler. Concluding its article, the paper stresses: We are very confident and certain that this odious massacre will only strengthen the determination of our brothers in the occupied territories to adhere to their sacred land and rights. We are facing a criminal usurper enemy which only understands the language of force, fateful confrontation, and challenge until final victory is achieved and until its evil and expansionist schemes are defeated after we retaliate for all the galaxies of martyrs on the road of struggle, and intifadah for the sake of maintaining Palestine's Arab identity. AL-JUMHURIYAH calls on the Arabs and Muslims to honestly raise their voices and say: Shame on America which is sponsoring and committing the Zionist crime and protecting the perpetrators. Under the headline: "God is Great: They Are Slaughtering Us Collectively in the Name of Human Rights," the paper says: America's followers are not satisfied with violating honor, demolishing mosques, killing children and starving old men. Furthermore, they indiscriminately shoot worshipers in a place protected by God. The paper asks: Has this crime shaken the consciences of those who shook hands with the people whom they themselves once said that any hand extended to those people will be chopped? AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: He who wants peace with the Arabs will not kill their children, steal their lands and waters, and demolish their mosques. Yesterday's crime revealed that the peaceful settlement is a lie and a delusion and that walking this road is a falsehood. Addressing the U.S. president, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: You well- mannered Clinton: You must remember that human beings are the same throughout the world, in America and elsewhere. Therefore, your reaction is strange if you really believe in what you call human rights. How can you invade a country with your country's armies to guarantee the freedom of expression, as you say, while watching in silence the killing of hundreds, in fact thousands, of people with the guns and in accordance with the decisions of your army and followers in other countries and in the United States? Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: We are disgusted by your hypocrisy O Americans. The entire world despises your slogans and symbols. Are you aware of this, or will the cowboy continue with his crimes until he falls in a grave which he will dig with his own criminal acts?
