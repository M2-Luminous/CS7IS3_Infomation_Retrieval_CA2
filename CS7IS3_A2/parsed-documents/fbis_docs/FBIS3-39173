Konstandinos Kosmopoulos, Thessaloniki mayor and committee president, headed the committee. Correspondent Dhespina Khari reports: [Begin Khari recording] The resolution addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Administration stresses that this action is against the historical [word indistinct] of the symbols and boundaries of Greece, since they are threatened if this situation continues. Consequently, it also threatens to ignite the greater Balkan region. Finally, the resolution stresses that the current stance of the United States fatally injures the traditional friendship between the Greek and American people. It also creates an adverse climate for the United States from the Greeks who expected understanding and justice from our great ally. The resolution asks the United States to exert pressure on Skopje to eliminate all those aspects that obstruct the development of good relations with this state, including the name, symbols, propaganda, and expansionist designs. In a statement, Kosmopoulos emphasized that this U.S. action has shaken Greece, called on the government to take a position on the issue, and noted that people and leadership should finally unite to face the critical issues of the country. The mayors of Macedonian towns plan to hold an extraordinary meeting 19 February to decide on new initiatives in the framework of the local administrations and submit proposals to the Central Committee for dealing with the issue further. It has not been ruled out that they will propose new dynamic mobilization, similar to the rally of 14 February 1992 in Thessaloniki and the one in Athens in 1993. [end recording]
