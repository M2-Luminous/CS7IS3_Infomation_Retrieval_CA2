Federal President Thomas Klestil, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak, and Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend concentrated on security. At an information rally "Youth for Europe" in Vienna, Klestil emphasized that as far as the EU entry is concerned the main focus would be Austria's security. He pointed out that the Germans and French alone engaged in 27 battles against each other, "while today war between the two great European peoples had become unthinkable." Klestil also argued that, as a small country, Austria was unable to deal with such new threats such as mass immigration, organized crime, or risks related to nuclear power, by itself. Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said that Austria's accession to the EU will increase the security of our country. After EU entry, the judicial authorities would be able to directly cooperate in the sphere of criminal investigations to fight organized crime. According to Loeschnak, Austria can also expect support from the EU on immigration policy: "After all, it is indeed hard to understand that one and the same person should file applications for asylum in several states, while the various states shift the burden of illegal immigration to one another instead of joining forces and seeking solutions together." Moreover, Austria, which has made the greatest contribution to the temporary accommodation of Bosnian war refugees, can expect at least some easing of the situation from fair, European-wide burden sharing. Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend expects EU membership to enhance security. Many Austrians underestimate the danger of possible crisis spots in the region. For Fasslabend it is clear that an attack against an EU member state is less likely than one against a state outside the European system. A "no" in next Sunday's EU referendum would not mean the rejection of something new but rather a departure from Austria's present course, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said. Austria's EU accession is the logical consequence of its current cooperation with the west European states, with which one must react to the political changes in Europe and economic developments. Busek also stressed that all over countries are joining together in regional blocs, as the United States and Mexico have done. Austria must not remain alone in these developments. We have to provide for security in our country. "In the cold war" Austria "benefited from its situation" and was well protected, "but now one must not expect other states to fight for us only because we are so nice or because of our Lipizzaner stallions." The vice chancellor is convinced that within the EU our country would be protected by the other states, while the EU would hardly fight as actively for third countries. Transport Minister Viktor Klima pointed out that even within the EU there would be enough room for Austria to pursue a transportation policy of its own. Austria should continue to play the pioneering role it has played so far in this sphere even once it is a EU member, and not pursue a narrow-minded, isolationist policy. On Wednesday, the three presidents of the Nationalrat, Heinz Fischer, Robert Lichal, and Heide Schmidt repeated their appeal to the electorate to turn out in as large numbers as possible for the 12 June referendum. The poll is one of the most important decisions in the Second Republic, and every citizen should participate in it after fairly weighing all arguments in favor against those against membership; Sunday's vote should neither be a decision on the government nor on the opposition but a vote on Austria's future.
