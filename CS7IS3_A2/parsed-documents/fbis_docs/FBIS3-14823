"The Russian procurator general sent a letter to the State Duma on Saturday morning to specify circumstances preventing the procurator's office from the implementation of the Duma resolution on political amnesty. Two Duma committees started to prepare a response to the procurator's inquiry believing that the procurator general's office waits for the answer," they said. Meanwhile the committees did their work, the procurator general's office implemented the resolution to free culprits of the October 1993 bloodshed, which runs counter to the law, judging by Kazannik's letter. The resolution on liberation of the accused was signed by Deputy Procurator General Kartsev "on silent consent of the procurator general, stressed presidential assistant on national security and doctor of juridical sciences Baturin. As a result, the procurator general's office created a precedent of illegal implementation of decisions, he said. In his turn, Satarov said the procurator general's office adopted a resolution to free the Lefortovo inmates while the Duma tried to remove contradictions in its resolution on political amnesty.
