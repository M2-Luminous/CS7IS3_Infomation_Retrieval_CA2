At the outset the Cabinet discussed the situation in the country, security, and the media. It then discussed its agenda and approved most of the topics, including the amendment of Legislative Decree No. 104/77 governing the publication law. The Cabinet approved two bills on concluding agreements between Lebanon and France on a cooperation protocol signed in Paris on 14 October 1993 and a cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation agreement signed in Paris on 14 October 1993. The Cabinet approved a draft decree amending Article 14 of the lending law at the Agricultural, Industrial, and Land Lending Bank. It approved a decree transferring and appointing editors and clerks in some public departments. It also approved four decrees pertaining to the potable water authorities of al-Batrun, al-Miyah wa Miyah, 'Akkar, and al-Kurah. The Cabinet formed the National Authority on Childhood and approved a memorandum of understanding with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under which the Kingdom will give Lebanon $100 million to finance reconstruction projects. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] The Cabinet did not discuss this subject. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] Several amendments were made to the appeals attorney general's right under Article 23 to confiscate publications without suspending them. A mechanism for quick trials has been adopted and fines have been increased. The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY will tonight release the amended bill approved by the government. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] This topic, which has caused an uproar, is groundless. Neither the government nor the information minister have thought of banning plays on television and radio. Whoever watches private Lebanese stations listens to all kinds of plays. In the media bill being prepared [words indistinct], it is one the articles being discussed by the ministerial committee on radio and television media. Emphasis is placed on the need for national theatrical production in every field. [passage omitted on the theater and culture] [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] I believe the mission is big. It does not concern a person or a minister. It does not concern the Cabinet or the ministerial committee. We are striving to accelerate things with the necessary speed. I hope we will finish as soon as possible. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] We are awaiting a Cabinet decision. This decision [words indistinct] television and radio law after it is issued by the Chamber of Deputies. I hope this law will be issued soon. It is difficult to imagine Lebanon with only one company and once voice. But all companies and all radios must adhere to instructions.
