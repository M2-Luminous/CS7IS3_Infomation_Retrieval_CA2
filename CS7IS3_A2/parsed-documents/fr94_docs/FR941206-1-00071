Materials containing HAP are often stored in containers that are left open, allowing the volatile HAP to evaporate and be emitted through room ventilation to the atmosphere. The Work Practice Work Group agreed that a straightforward, inexpensive method of reducing emissions from HAP storage would be to cover all containers storing finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials when not in use. In addition to reducing HAP emissions to the atmosphere, this work practice has the added benefit of reducing worker exposure to volatile HAP. ii. HAP transfer. In wood furniture finishing, gluing, and cleaning operations, solvent, finishing material, and adhesives are pumped from storage containers to the spray gun through piping. In wood furniture operations, leaks can occur in equipment used to transfer or apply finishing materials, solvents, and adhesives. Therefore, the Work Group agreed that requiring sources to check this equipment for leaks was reasonable. To implement the leak inspection program, sources will be required to develop an I&M plan that requires the inspection of each piece of equipment used to transfer or apply finishing materials, solvents, and adhesives; a schedule for inspection; reporting of the results of the inspection, any repairs that were made to the equipment, and the timeframe between identifying the leak and performing repairs. The Work Practice Work Group agreed upon the concept of an I&M plan, but never discussed whether the proposed rule should require a specific inspection frequency and, if so, what the frequency should be. In establishing the regulatory framework for the negotiated rule, the Agency decided that a monthly inspection frequency is appropriate to accomplish the goal of reducing leaks from transfer and application equipment. More frequent monitoring was considered burdensome because smaller shops would not have the personnel to perform the inspections. To ensure that action would be taken if leaks were detected, the proposed rule requires that repairs be made within 15 calendar days, with a first attempt at repair made within 5 calendar days. The Agency's decision is supported by previous regulatory action; the hazardous organic NESHAP (HON) and the NESHAP for coke oven batteries both require this same repair timeframe. As stated above, the Agency used the Committee's conceptual agreement for an I&M plan to address equipment leaks as a foundation for the more specific provisions in the proposed rule. The Agency requests comment on the specific requirements of the proposed rule, and data to suggest that more or less frequent monitoring or shorter or longer repair times may be appropriate. iii. Finishing material application. Another aspect of wood furniture finishing operations that the Committee evaluated was the type of finishing material application equipment used. There have been numerous studies comparing the transfer efficiency of one type of application equipment with that of another type. Transfer efficiency is the ratio of the amount of coating solids deposited onto the surface of the coated part to the total amount of coating solids used. The higher the transfer efficiency, the less finishing material that is used and the less that is lost as overspray (sprayed finishing materials that miss the piece). Overspray eventually dries, releasing volatile HAP, and becomes a solid waste source for the facility. Thus, by increasing transfer efficiency, both air emissions and solid waste are reduced. The Committee agreed that highly efficient transfer methods are desirable. Traditionally, however, the Agency's position on transfer efficiency has been one that advocates the use of more efficient transfer methods, but contends that emission reductions resulting from these methods can not be quantified. For the purposes of the proposed rule, the Committee reached a consensus that an equipment standard rather than a standard that identified transfer efficiencies for specific application methods would be most appropriate. The Committee also agreed that data supporting one type of application equipment over another were conflicting except in one instance; almost all data suggest that conventional air guns are the least efficient transfer method. Therefore, the Committee proposed that the rule prohibit the use of conventional air spray guns.
