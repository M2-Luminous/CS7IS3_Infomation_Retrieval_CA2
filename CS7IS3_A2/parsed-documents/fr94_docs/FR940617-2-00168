FR940617-2-00168 FR940617-2-00094 The Index was designed and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``Nihon''). The Index's component securities were selected for their high market capitalizations and high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the relative distribution of industries within the broader Japanese equity market. The median capitalization of the companies in the Index on March 31, 1994, was 340.1 billion yen (US $3.3 billion at the exchange rate of 102.75 yen per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994). The average market capitalization of these companies was US $7.5 billion on the same date and using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalizations of these companies ranged from a low of US $875 million to a high of US $76.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock accounted for 3.41 percent of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04 percent. The Index is a capitalization-weighted index and is calculated by multiplying the price of each component security (in Japanese yen) by its number of shares outstanding, adding those sums and dividing by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor was determined initially to yield a benchmark value of 100 on October 1, 1982. The Index's closing value on April 13, 1994, was 296.35. The Index multiplier is 100, and, for valuation purposes, one Index unit (1.0) is assigned a fixed value of one U.S. dollar. The Index will be maintained by Nihon. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component securities. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The composition of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon. The proposed options on the Index are to be European-style ( i.e. , exercises are permitted at expiration only), and cash-settled. Trading hours for the Index options will be 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. (New York time). Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series normally will be the business day immediately preceding Expiration Friday of each expiration month (normally a Thursday) and trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on such day. The exercise settlement value for all of the Index's expiring options will be the special opening quotation, which is calculated based upon the opening price of each of the component securities on the TSE on the last business day prior to expiration. If a stock fails to open for trading, the last available price of the stock will be used to calculate the Index's settlement value. When an option expiration is moved in accordance with an Exchange holiday, the last trading day for the expiring Index options will be Wednesday, and the exercise settlement value of the Index options will be determined at the opening of the regular Thursday trading session on the TSE, even if the TSE is open on Friday. If the TSE will be closed on the Friday before expiration but the Amex is not, the last trading day for expiring Index options will be on Wednesday. The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the three additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer-term options series having up to 36 months to expiration may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value long-term option will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) after the initial computation. In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months. Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of standardized and long-term option contracts based on the Index. These rules cover issues such as sales practices, margin requirements, exercise prices, position and exercise limits, and floor trading procedures. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Exchange represents that the TSE has requested that a new comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement be executed with respect to options on the Index. This agreement will cover the sharing of surveillance information regarding the Index's component securities.
