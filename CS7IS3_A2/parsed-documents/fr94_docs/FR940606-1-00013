FR940606-1-00013 FR940606-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;4891&hyph;8] National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing commercial, civil, and military aerospace original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and rework facilities that are major sources of HAP emissions. A major source is defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act) as a source that emits, or has the potential to emit, considering controls, 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any individual HAP or 25 tpy or more of any combination of HAP. The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Act, which requires the Administrator to regulate emissions of the HAP listed in section 112(b) of the Act. Many of these pollutants are emitted from cleaning, primer, topcoat, depainting, and chemical milling maskant operations. These operations are being covered in the proposed rule. The intent of the proposed rule is to protect the public health by requiring new and existing major sources to control HAP emissions to the level attainable by the maximum achievable control technology (MACT). The EPA is also proposing Method 309 with the standards. Method 309 would be used to determine the rolling material balance period for carbon adsorbers. A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards. DATES: Comments: Comments must be received on or before August 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments: Comments should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), ATTN: Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;20, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Public Hearing: If anyone contacts the EPA requesting a public hearing, the hearing will be held at the EPA Office of Administration Auditorium in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Persons wishing to present oral testimony must contact Ms. Julia Latta, Standards Development Branch (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;5578 by July 1, 1994.
