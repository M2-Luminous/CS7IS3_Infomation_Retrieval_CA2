ACTION: Notice of public meeting to discuss environmental auditing policy and related environmental compliance self-evaluation and disclosure issues. SUMMARY: This notice announces that EPA will hold a public meeting on Wednesday, July 27, 1994 in Washington, D.C. which will be devoted to environmental auditing policy, and the related issues of self-evaluation and disclosure. The focus of the meeting, to be chaired by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, will be to consider the need for reinforcing or modifying the Agency's existing policy on environmental auditing. The Agency is providing this forum for the regulated community and other interested parties to present views on whether additional incentives are needed to encourage the self-disclosure and prompt correction of environmental violations uncovered during facility audits. DATES: The public meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 27, 1994 from 8:30 a.m to 5:00 p.m. The meeting will continue, if necessary, at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday, July 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: The public meeting will take place on Wednesday, July 27, 1994, at the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Headquarters, in the Auditorium, located at 807 Maine Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. If necessary, the meeting will continue on Thursday, July 28, 1994 at the EPA Auditorium, located at 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian P.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In a memorandum dated May 13, 1994, Assistant Administrator Steven A. Herman announced that, in response to the request of Administrator Browner, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) will coordinate a reassessment of EPA's current policy regarding environmental auditing and self-evaluation by the regulated community. OECA will seek to ensure that any decision either to reinforce or to change existing policy on environmental auditing is informed by fact. Therefore, the approach to the upcoming evaluation of auditing policy can best be characterized as an empirical information-gathering effort. EPA is committed to investigating the perceived problems relating to auditing and self-disclosure. The Agency must, however, develop a sufficient information base in order to give serious consideration to any policy options. EPA hopes to collect such relevant data through implementation of four actions this summer: 1. EPA will convene the public meeting described in this notice as an opportunity for the Agency to obtain a wide variety of views and to sharpen the focus on these issues. The range of issues appropriate for discussion at the public meeting is outlined under ``Agenda/Focus Topics'' section below. 2. Prior to the public meeting, EPA expects to publish in the Federal Register a restatement of the Agency's current audit policy. The most recent policy statement on environmental auditing was published in the Federal Register on July 14, 1986, at 51 FR 25004. 3. Published elsewhere in today's Federal Register is a companion notice soliciting proposals for the Environmental Leadership Program (ELP) pilot projects. EPA expects that the ELP pilot projects will generate useful data on auditing methodology and measures. The ELP projects may serve as vehicles for experimenting with policy-driven incentives. 4. Finally, EPA will encourage the private sector to collect data and survey auditing practices in order to gauge the effect of enforcement policies on self-evaluation and disclosure in the regulated community.
