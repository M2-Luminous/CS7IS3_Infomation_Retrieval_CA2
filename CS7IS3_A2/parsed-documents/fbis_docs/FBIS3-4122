More than 20 million people have directly benefited from the schemes. This was revealed at a symposium which concluded here today on the subject of WFP assistance for development in the Asia- Pacific region. Since 1979, when China first participated in the organization, the WFP has supplied great quantities of food, including 9.4 million tons of wheat, 45,000 tons of skimmed milk powder, 15,000 tons of butter and many advanced facilities to China's 55 agricultural development projects, covering 160 poverty-stricken counties all over the country. Among the projects applauded by local governments and people are improvement of dairy products in six large cities, fish farming in nine large cities, soil erosion prevention on Loess Plateau, protection of pandas in Sichuan Province and production of forage grass in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. WFP assistance is mainly utilized for comprehensive agricultural development projects and its aid emphasis in recent years has been further shifted to areas inhabited by minority nationalities and remote mountain areas in north-western and south-western China. With 43 projects already completed and 12 others still under way, the WFP-assisted schemes have played a positive role in improving production conditions and the ecological environment and in increasing farmers' incomes.
