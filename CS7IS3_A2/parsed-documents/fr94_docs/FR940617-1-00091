FR940617-1-00091 FR940617-1-00012 III. Analysis of Impacts FDA has examined the impacts of this proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. This proposed rule increases the number of ingredients tentatively classified as generally recognized as safe and effective for use in OTC health-care antiseptic drug products from the previous proposal and, if finalized as proposed, would reduce the need for further safety and effectiveness testing for a number of health-care antiseptic drug products. The detailed testing procedures included in the proposed rule should assist manufacturers of products containing ingredients not included in the proposed monograph, due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness, in performing the tests that would demonstrate effectiveness so the ingredients can be included in the final rule. The testing procedures will also provide manufacturers guidance on testing requirements for regulatory compliance. Products that contain ingredients for which safety and effectiveness are not established will require reformulation. The proposed monograph includes ingredients that may be used if reformulation becomes necessary. All products will need some relabeling. One year will be provided from the date of publication of the final rule for any necessary relabeling or reformulation. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with product testing, relabeling, repackaging, or reformulation. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. Because the agency has not previously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drug review on health-care antiseptic drug products, a period of 180 days from the date of publication of this proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register will be provided for comments on this subject to be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.
