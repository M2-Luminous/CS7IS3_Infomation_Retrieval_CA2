FR940202-0-00099 FR940202-0-00011 The Coast Guard received a number of comments supporting this proposal. However, the Coast Guard also received comments in opposition to this grandfathering provision, indicating that the Coast Guard should not issue a pilot's license to an individual unless that individual passed the written examination. A number of significant events have occurred since the 1988 SNPRM. There have been several major vessel casualties, the most notable of which was the EXXON VALDEZ. Pilotage issues and requirements played a prominent part in the EXXON VALDEZ investigation. Following the EXXON VALDEZ casualty in 1989, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), which includes provisions regarding pilotage. As a result of these events, the Coast Guard believes that it is inappropriate and not in the best interest of navigational safety to issue a first class pilot's license or endorsement without requiring a written examination, including a chart sketch. Therefore, the grandfathering provision is not adopted in this interim final rule. The other major issue in the 1988 SNPRM which received comments was the definition of a ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' contained in 46 U.S.C. 8502. The SNPRM definition of the term ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' made the distinction between a vessel authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to make voyages only on U.S. internal waters and a vessel authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to make voyages beyond the Boundary Line. The 1988 SNPRM considered a coastwise seagoing vessel as a vessel that is authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line. Some comments supported this definition. However, other comments and recommendations from TSAC did not support this definition, suggesting that pilotage requirements for coastwise seagoing vessels should be at least partially tied to the voyage on which the vessel is engaged. Those comments and recommendations urged the following definition: ``A coastwise seagoing vessel, for purposes of the manning of vessels by pilots or for individuals acting as pilots, means a vessel authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line, and whose movement in pilotage waters relates to a voyage in which the vessel has or will cross the Boundary Line.'' The Coast Guard is adopting the proposal published in the June 6, 1988 SNPRM, i.e., that a coastwise seagoing vessel for pilotage purposes is one that is authorized by its Coast Guard issued Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line. The Coast Guard did not adopt the alternative proposal because that definition would have enabled coastwise seagoing vessels to make voyages without a pilot within the internal waters of the United States, including those waters where most hazards to navigation are encountered. Adopting the alternative proposal would have reduced pilotage requirements by requiring fewer vessels to use a pilot, permitting more vessels to make extensive movements within harbors or between ports without the services of a pilot in the exact waters where pilotage can be most beneficial.
