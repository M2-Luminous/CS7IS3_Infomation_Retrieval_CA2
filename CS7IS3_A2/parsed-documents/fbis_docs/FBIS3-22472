The Upper West Region which reported less than 10 cases of HIV/AIDS in 1990, recorded 47 cases last year and a frightening 313 cases as at September, this year. To combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in the region, the regional health directorate with the support of the GTZ which has also equipped the Wa Hospital laboratory with HIV/AIDS screening equipment launched a survey to find out the people's knowledge, attitude, beliefs and practices with regard to AIDS. The findings of the survey that interviewed 1,100 people comprising primary, junior and senior secondary school pupils and students, members of youth associations and women's groups, civil servants as well as chiefs and elders make interesting reading. Majority of the respondents were aware of AIDS with Wa having 95 percent awareness rate, with 70 percent of the respondents saying that behavioural change would minimise greatly the spread of AIDS. Regrettably only five percent of these people said they were prepared to change their sexual behaviours. Also only 2.4 percent of the respondents said they were prepared to use condoms as a means of preventing the transmission of the HIV virus. With the findings of the survey, a regional forum was held with representatives of health-related institutions coming together to discuss the findings and to adopt effective strategies to minimise the spread of the disease. The forum was very successful as the participants brainstormed and made useful contributions relating to the survey findings. Another forum will be held in December during which the results of the survey will serve as a guide for a comprehensive information, education and communication (IEC) health plan for the region. Though the survey findings are only preliminary, it will nonetheless give more impetus to measures and efforts being made to combat the spread of HIV and AIDS in the region. Meanwhile, a number of strategies are currently being pursued to fight the spread of the deadly disease in the region. A month-long AIDS awareness campaign has been launched during which lectures, symposia, debates and sports activities among others will be organised. Launching the campaign, the Deputy Regional Minister, Mr. Bede Ziedeng called for concerted efforts to rid the region of quack doctors whose activities he said enhances the risk of HIV/AIDS infection. He said quack doctors take undue advantage of the people's ignorance and use unsterilised and unhygienic equipment to administer treatment to patients. The National Council on Women and Development (NCWD) in the region has also been organising workshops to educate women's groups on AIDS. About 650 leaders of women's groups throughout the region have so far benefited from the programme. AIDS counselling centres have also been established at Wa, Lawra and Jirapa where 46 AIDS patients are currently receiving counselling. The education of prostitutes now referred to as "commercial sex workers" on AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) is also underway at Wa. It is hoped that the education of prostitutes who constitute a major source of HIV transmission would further enhance efforts at reducing the spread of the disease. Though the Upper West Region has initiated these encouraging measures towards combating the spread of AIDS, yet since AIDS is a killer with no known cure, it is in the interest of everybody to be careful and abstain from casual sex and irresponsible sexual lifestyles.
