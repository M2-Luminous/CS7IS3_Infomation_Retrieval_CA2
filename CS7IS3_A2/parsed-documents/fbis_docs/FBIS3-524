In a statement, Mr Maninger said it appeared from Mr Mandela's utterances he had not considered the alternative. "We are convinced there will be a volkstaat, particularly once the ANC realises it is cheaper to accommodate the aspirations of the Afrikaner than to try to suppress us indefinitely," he said. The only positive things about his statements were that he had increased Afrikaners' determination to obtain a volkstaat and mobilised them, he added.
