FR940413-0-00077 FR940413-0-00026 New and Revised Definitions Defining ``Mixed Population Project'' The final rule provides a definition for ``mixed population project.'' ``Mixed population project'' is defined to mean a public housing project reserved for occupancy by elderly families and disabled families. As discussed in the preceding section, these projects are not required to meet the designation requirements of part 945, but must be reserved for occupancy by elderly families and disabled families in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 960. Revising the Definitions for the Various Categories of ``Families'' The final rule also introduces a new term to clarify the specific category of families under discussion. Instead of referring frequently, and awkwardly, as was done in the proposed rule to ``families who are members of the group for whom the project is to be designated for occupancy,'' the final rule uses the term ``designated family.'' ``Designated family'' is defined to mean the category of families for whom a project has been designated. Depending upon the designation to be made, designated families will be either elderly families or disabled families. The final rule provides, as did the proposed rule, definitions for the statutory terms ``families,'' ``elderly families,'' ``disabled families,'' and ``near-elderly families,'' but the final rule defines these terms in their singular context rather than the plural context. Additionally, the final rule makes some clarifying changes to these definitions. ``Elderly family'' is defined to clarify that an elderly family may include one or more elderly persons with disabilities, and members of the family who are not elderly. ``Near-elderly family'' is defined to clarify that a near-elderly family may include one or more near-elderly persons with disabilities, and members of the family who are not near-elderly. ``Disabled family'' is revised to clarify that this term includes a person with disabilities who is also elderly or near-elderly. An elderly person with disabilities would be eligible to reside in a designated project-disabled, designated project-elderly, or a mixed population project, subject, of course, to availability of units in these projects, and the person's place on the waiting list. As noted in the preamble to the January 7, 1994 proposed rule, the definitions for ``family,'' ``elderly family,'' and related terms are currently contained in 24 CFR part 912, entitled ``Definition of Family and Other Related Terms; Occupancy by Single Persons.'' Part 912, however, has not yet been amended to reflect the revised definitions provided by section 621 or to add the new terms defined in section 621. Under separate final rulemaking, part 912 will be amended to include several of the revised and new definitions set forth in section 621 (and which are included in this final rule). When the part 912 rule is published in final, the Department will amend the regulations in part 945 to remove the definitions from part 945 and to cross-reference to the definitions in part 912. The advantage in keeping these definitions in part 912 (which was established to define ``family'' and related terms) is that part 912 offers a convenient location to place the definitions for terms that are applicable to all public housing programs. Revised Definition of ``Service Provider'' In response to the many public comments that objected to the ``licensing requirement'' for service providers, the final rule revises the definition of ``service provider'' to remove the requirement that the service provider must be licensed under State or local law. In lieu of this requirement, the final rule provides that the service provider be ``qualified and experienced'' in the provision of supportive services. ``Qualified'' means that if the type of supportive services to be delivered by the service provider requires a State or local license, the service provider must be in compliance with these laws. Revised Definition of Supportive Services In response to public comment, specifically by persons with disabilities, the definition of ``supportive services'' is revised to clarify that this term refers to non-housing services available to persons residing in a development for which there is a need and demand by disabled families. The qualifier of ``non-housing'' before the word ``services'' is to clarify that supportive services do not include plumbing, minor repair and maintenance of dwelling units that the housing authority is required to provide under the lease. The provision of supportive services in a designated project does not relieve the PHA of its obligation to provide similar services in other developments for persons with disabilities as required by 24 CFR part 8. The inclusion of the phrase ``for which there is a need and demand'' is to emphasize that PHAs should not designate public housing projects for occupancy by disabled families unless the disabled families served by the PHA and to whom the PHA intends to offer occupancy in the designated project clearly indicate a need and demand for the proposed supportive services. The consensus among commenters who indicated that they were persons with disabilities or who represented the interests of persons with disabilities was that designated housing for disabled families is not the preferred residential setting of persons with disabilities. Allocation Plan_Development and Contents The final rule significantly consolidates and streamlines the information required to be included in the allocation plan, without, however, reducing information necessary to determine the possible adverse impact that the designation process may have on elderly families or disabled families, particularly non-elderly disabled families. Removal of Allocation Plan Objectives Section 945.203(a)(2) of the proposed rule contained language that encouraged PHAs, in developing their allocation plan to strive to provide, regardless of the designation to be made, as broad a range of housing choice as possible to elderly families and disabled families with respect to the level of supportive services, and availability of accessible units. Additionally, this section stated that PHAs should strive to provide, regardless of the designation to be made, housing for disabled families in the most integrated setting possible.
