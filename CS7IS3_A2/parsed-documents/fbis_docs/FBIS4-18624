Europe succeeded in not making a commitment on the audiovisual sector within the GATT agreement reached on 15 December 1993. In so doing, it stressed the idea that cultural creations are not products just like any others. Ever since then, however, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has ceaselessly reiterated that the cultural exception was, for the United States, the "greatest disappointment in the Uruguay Round." The annual report on "obstacles to trade," which was published last Thursday [31 March] in Washington, took up that issue at length again, listing the existence of broadcasting quotas for television and taxes on video cassettes and cinema tickets, which are deemed to discriminate against U.S. producers. The producers in question are particularly concerned by the 40-percent quota of French songs that France intends to impose from 1996 onward on the airwaves covered by its 1,700 radio stations -- a step that would result in a 30-percent reduction in the amount of U.S. music broadcast. The report also pinpoints Italy for the tax reductions awarded to cinemas showing nationally produced films, and Spain, which requires that anybody seeking to distribute non-European dubbed films within its borders must secure authorization to do so. This requirement is costing U.S. companies "more than $15 million per year." Mickey Kantor has pointed out that he would not hesitate to resort to the so-called Super 301 clause (which enables President Clinton to impose sanctions on any country suspected of unfair trade practices and which refuses to open up its market more to U.S. products) in an attempt to preserve the dominance on European screens by the major Hollywood studios. According to Washington, the fact that the audiovisual sector has escaped from its obligation to open up markets as enshrined in the 15 December GATT agreement gives them every freedom to resort to exerting bilateral pressure. On the other hand, this argument is firmly rejected by GATT Spokesman David Woods. He believes the audiovisual sector is actually covered by the agreement, namely by the procedures provided for resolving conflicts. Consequently, according to this line of reasoning, if the United States wants to take action against the European Union (EU) in this sector, it will have to respect the rules laid down by GATT or the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT in 1995. Eurotaxes? Meanwhile, the Commission says it is "ready," with the EU member states, "to consider introducing a system of indirect taxes to support the European audiovisual industry." In its white paper on the EU audiovisual policy, which it will probably adopt on Wednesday, the Commission believes these indirect taxes (levied on the prices of cinema tickets, advertising revenue, and video rental charges) already imposed by some member states could be extended to apply throughout the EU.
