FR940224-1-00024 FR940224-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 79 [FRL&hyph;4840&hyph;7] Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: On April 15, 1992, EPA published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for Fuels and Fuel Additives (F/FAs) Registration Regulations (57 FR 13168). The purpose of the proposed regulation would be to establish requirements for the registration of motor vehicle F/FAs as authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under the proposed regulations, manufacturers of F/FAs would be required to conduct certain tests and submit information regarding the composition of emissions produced by such F/FAs and the effects of these emissions on public health and welfare. EPA held a public hearing on the NPRM on May 28, 1992 and accepted written comments until June 30, 1992. Subsequent analysis indicated that additional public notice to clarify and reconsider a few specific compliance-related and technical issues would be helpful in developing the final rule. Today's action presents these issues and requests comments on EPA's proposals for addressing them. The issues addressed in this document are the following: Timing of requirements for new F/FAs, alternative testing requirements in lieu of Tier 2, general emission generation methodology, mileage accumulation for the testing of atypical F/FAs, and base fuel specifications. DATES: Written comments on the specific issues discussed in this document will be accepted until March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this document should be submitted in duplicate to: EPA Air Docket (LE&hyph;131); Attention: Public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Background The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 USC section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration and prohibits manufacturers of designated fuels or additives from selling such products unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic registration requirements, as stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to submit certain information, such as commercial identifying information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition, in order to register a fuel or fuel additive. The CAA also gave EPA discretionary authority to establish additional registration requirements under section 211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require F/FA manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential public health effects of such fuel[s] or additive[s] (including but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions and determine their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on the public health and welfare. EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require testing of F/FAs under section 211(b)(2) when the general registration regulations were issued in 1975. However, in the CAA Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph;95, August 7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) mandatory. On August 7, 1990, EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) (55 FR 32218) and, on April 15, 1992, published an NPRM (57 FR 13168) proposing additional registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the CAA. The purpose of the rule would be to provide EPA with information for identifying and evaluating the potential adverse health effects of motor vehicle F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of related regulatory actions in the future as specified in section 211(c). The reader is referred to the NPRM and Public Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07 for detailed information on the proposed registration requirements. Subsequent to the publication of the proposal, a public hearing was held on May 28, 1992, followed by a written comment period which closed on June 30, 1992. A transcript of the public hearing and the written comments are contained in the docket.
