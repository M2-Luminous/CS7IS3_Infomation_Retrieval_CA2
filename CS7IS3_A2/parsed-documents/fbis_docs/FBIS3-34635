FBIS3-34635 "drnes030_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 SYRIA Press Reacts to Israeli-PLO Cairo Agreement Papers Criticize Agreement JN1302102494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 13 Feb 94 JN1302102494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "The Achievement of Just and Comprehensive Peace is an International Responsibility," the newspaper AL-BA'TH editorial says: Many world capitals are taking a special interest in the current Middle East situation. This interest seems to be prompted by fears over the possible collapse of the peace process, which was viewed by the world as a unique opportunity for the achievement of just and comprehensive peace that would spare the region the calamities of war and provide it with security and stability, one that would not come again. The paper adds: The world community is unanimous that a durable peace must begin with an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, because this would consecrate international legitimacy. This is a must if the requirements of peace are to be met. It goes without saying that meeting these requirements would help the peace process achieve its objectives, which are enshrined in the relevant UN resolutions. The paper notes the working paper Syria submitted to the Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington bilateral talks, which was appreciated by the world community and deemed a positive step forward. The world community believes that if heeded, this paper would help achieve true peace in the region. However, Israel, which was pressured into attending the Madrid conference in the first place, has declined to discuss the article pertaining to withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and raised issues that should have been raised only after rather than before the withdrawal is completed. The paper goes on to say: Israel's position on this issue has to date remained unchanged. For, the Rabin government has continued to make impossible and unacceptable demands. The developments in the peace process over the past two years have revealed to the world which party is working to achieve just and comprehensive peace, and which is working to thwart this noble objective. In this regard, the paper notes the reaffirmation made by Douglas Hogg, British minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, regarding the need to achieve a just and comprehensive regional settlement, affirming that there can be no peace in the region unless Syria restores its sovereignty over the Golan. AL-BA'TH says: If this is indicative of anything, it is of the entire world community's convictions that if peace is to be achieved in the region, Israel must implement the relevant UN resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The world community, which is taking a special interest in achieving a just regional settlement, is required, now more than ever before, to take a firmer and more serious position to achieve just and comprehensive peace in the region. In one of its commentaries, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: Undoubtedly, the world community is fully convinced that Israel has continued to obstruct the efforts aimed at achieving just and comprehensive peace, the peace that is grounded in the relevant international legitimacy resolutions, and that would achieve security, stability, and prosperity in the region. AL-THAWRAH notes the difficulties and obstacles the Israeli Government has created to obstruct the peace process and prevent it from achieving any accomplishment that could promote the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East through the pursuit of a policy based on evasion and procrastination to evade any clear commitment to the requirements of peace, as enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions. Israel has repeatedly and deliberately stepped up violence, repression, and terrorism in both the occupied Arab territories and Lebanon to provoke the Arabs and make them abandon the peace process. The paper adds: Nonetheless, recent developments have undoubtedly shown that Israel has failed to achieve its objectives in this regard. Had it not been for the patience, wisdom, and prudence demonstrated by the Arabs when confronted with Israel's maneuvers and games, the peace process would have collapsed. The positive stands the Arabs have taken toward the peace process and their honest favorable response to the efforts made to activate the bilateral talks have enlightened the world community in general and the United States in particular with regard to peace process issues. These stands have prompted the world community and the United States to conclude that it is the Arabs who are honest in their peace efforts, that they are working to achieve durable and true peace, and that they are the party that respects international legitimacy and clings to its resolutions and laws. What the Arabs are demanding is only that the principles of right and justice be upheld. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In contrast to this positive Arab stand, Israel has been exposed to the world community as an aggressive occupation power that does not care about peace. Its peace stand is tailored to promote its ambitions and objectives. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The bilateral talks will be resumed in Washington at the chief delegates' level within days. The achievement of progress in these talks requires a drastic change in the Israeli negotiating positions. It also requires a reconsideration on Israel's part of many of its flawed perceptions and views regarding the nature of the solution required for the region. Under the headline "Israeli Threats," the newspaper TISHRIN says: Israel has revived the policy of threats and intimidation against the Arabs of the occupied Arab territories, deriving strength from the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres. This agreement has granted Israel complete control over security affairs. These threats are coming even before the ink used to sign this agreement has dried. Israel has stepped up its terrorist and repressive policy against the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and warned that collective punitive measures will be escalated if the resistance and intifadah-related activities are continued, and if the condemnations and denunciations of the Cairo agreement continue to be made. The paper adds: What Israel is saying is that aggressive and terrorist military force could be used to ensure the implementation of the Cairo agreement. Israel, before others, is aware that this agreement has nothing to do with peace, and that it cannot be called a move toward achieving just and comprehensive peace. The paper maintains that the Cairo agreement has ensured Israel a powerful partner in accomplishing the so-called security missions, and in protecting settlements. The agreement has granted Israel the authority to pursue suspects. Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Partial measures and separate deals could only aggravate the situation. They will create a state of open war in the occupied territories. The developments that we have seen in the aftermath of the Oslo accord and the Cairo deal are testimony to all that we are saying.
