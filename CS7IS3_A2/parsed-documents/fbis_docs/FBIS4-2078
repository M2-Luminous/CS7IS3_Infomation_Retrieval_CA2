According to some Russian economists and government officials, the sense of a market economy has been planted in the minds of their citizens and changes have taken place in Russia's economic system and ways of management since the country began to reform the economy in 1992. Since then, private enterprises, stock companies and cooperatives have been established in Russia. However, as these economists and officials point out, very serious problems still exist. Russia's economy and industrial and agricultural production have been declining since the beginning of 1992, casting gloom over economic reform. Industrial output dropped by 16.3 percent in 1993 compared with 1992, and output value for the first two months of 1994 decreased 23.6 percent compared with the same period last year. Russia's agricultural and husbandry production has also declined between six and eight percent. Economic recession has become the most difficult issue for the government. Therefore, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin proposed that they "close the door of romanticism." one of the important principles for Russian reform is to strengthen the government's control over the economy. According to the prime minister, Russia can neither return to its old management by administrative decree nor take a laissez-faire attitude toward enterprises when the economy is in turmoil. Another serious problem is high inflation and soaring commodity prices. Average monthly inflation was 20 percent, and prices went up 10 fold in 1993. This January prices increased by 22 percent. In order to solve these problems the Russian government has decided to adopt a comprehensive administration system. The government now offers loans to departments of national defense, energy and agriculture to stimulate production. The government is also attempting to tackle the problem of triangle debts, which are estimated by the ministry of finance to be 31 trillion rubles. The government has also decided to allow enterprises which have long incurred losses to go bankrupt in order to ease the nation's burden. Other means, such as an increase in export taxes and rigorously enforced tax regulations, will be implemented to curb inflation, which Russia has pledged to decrease to seven or nine percent by the end of 1994. At the same time, Russia will continue its privatization policies. Some 70 percent of all stores, hotels and other service facilities had been privatized by the end of 1993. The declining standard of living and the extremes of wealth and poverty are becoming serious problems which must be dealt with. One-third of Russia's citizens are living below the poverty line, and some four million people are unable to provide themselves with basic necessities. The income of the rich, perhaps 10 percent of the population, is about 30 percent of the total income of society. But the poor, another 10 percent of the population, secures only 3.4 percent of the nation's income. Therefore, chernomyrdin proposed enhancing the reform of social guarantees and gradually increasing retirement pay. The government will also compensate veterans for savings lost before 1992. Russia called for a crack-down on crime in a government report; organized crime groups were rampant throughout the country last year. It is believed that these mafia-type gangs now control over 40,000 economic entities in Russia, including state-run enterprises and banks. This situation is greatly disturbing both to society and the government. The above policies are being carried out by the Russian government one by one, and time alone will demonstrate their effectiveness.
