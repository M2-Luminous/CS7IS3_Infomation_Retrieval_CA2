When reviewing the situation in 1993, Lu Xueyi, an expert in rural society, and his colleagues said: Last year, the social situation in the Chinese countryside was more serious than the economic situation. Although the situation of agricultural production was basically stable, social stability worsened. "It was a year full of worrisome events, but it was fortunate that no major trouble occurred." They predicted that this year, town and township enterprises in China would continue to develop at a high speed, but that agricultural production would remain stagnant. According to Lu Xueyi's prediction, China's cotton production will pick up in 1994, but will reach only the 1992 level. The grain production situation, however, will not be satisfactory because of the continued decrease in the area of farmland, plus other reasons. It is likely that gross grain output will decrease by 10 to 20 billion jin. They held that along with the appearance of stagnation in agricultural production, the grain supply will become more strained. It is expected that this year's grain output will reach some 440 billion jin, and if the reserve in the state granaries and in the hands of peasants are put together with imported grain, demand and supply still may be basically balanced. However, the degree of strain in the cotton supply will not be mitigated in 1994, so if things are not handled properly, another "cotton war" may be triggered. Another problem that makes the rural situation worrisome is that in 1994, although town and township enterprises will continue to develop rapidly, peasants' income still will increase slowly and the rural market will continue to be less brisk then the urban market. On the other hand, it will be hard to lessen the burdens imposed on peasants, and such burdens may exceed 5 percent of the net annual income per capita. A particularly worrisome fact is that the contradiction between the local governments, on one side, and the individually run and private enterprises in rural areas will become the focus of the social problems in 1994. In some localities, this may bring about social conflicts. Lu Xueyi pointed out: The implementation of the tax-division system will become a serious test for most individually run and private enterprises in the vast central and western regions, as they have just started operation, and it also will become a serious test of the relationship between the local governments and these individual-run and private enterprises. The authorities concerned must pay sufficient attention to matters in this regard because the sentiments of private entrepreneurs will affect the vast peasantry. He held that in order to mitigate the contradiction, it is necessary to do a good job in the following three aspects: First, reducing the burdens imposed on peasants and removing charges according to the relevant policies. Second, developing town and township enterprises, especially those in the central and western regions. Third, streamlining government institutions and reducing the staff there. Those that can be merged should be merged, so that the number of people to be fed by government finances can be reduced. This is certainly an important way to lessen burdens on peasants.
