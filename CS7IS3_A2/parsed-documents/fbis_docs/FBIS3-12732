Our correspondent Ravid Bushinsky says that police forces at the Temple Mount area and forces summoned to the area are removing the youths without using force. It is assumed that the youths are seeking to spend the night there in order to be among the many worshipers who arrive for Friday prayers tomorrow and for fear that the police will prevent youths from entering the mosques.
