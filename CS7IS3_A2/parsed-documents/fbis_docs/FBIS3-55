Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23MAR94-SLOVAKIA Meciar's Ouster Sets Stage for Early Elections The ouster of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar by five diverse opposition parties has led to the establishment of an interim government with no program beyond acting as a caretaker government until early parliamentary elections, scheduled for 31 September and 1 October. Meciar, whose ouster was preceded by a series of defections from his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and its partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), has begun his election campaign by portraying himself as the main protector of the country's independence and deriding his opponents in the new government as traitors to Slovakia. Suggesting that substantive changes prior to the fall elections are likely to be minimal, members of the new cabinet have indicated that the heterogenous coalition's main goal is simply to keep Meciar out of office and have emphasized the temporary nature of the governing coalition. Introducing his cabinet members to parliament, new Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, a former foreign minister and erstwhile Meciar ally, admitted that not all of the government's objectives "can be fulfilled in the time available" and that its main goal is "to get Slovakia to early elections" (Bratislava Radio, 17 March). Moravcik also said the formation of the new government was part of an effort to "unite very divergent and disunited entities" in order to "lay the foundations for a new political culture" (Narodna Obroda, 16 March). More pointedly, the government, in its "statement of intent," described itself as a coalition of "people with different political opinions" united by the "need to overcome the authoritarian way of ruling" practiced by the Meciar government and to "create conditions for respect, tolerance, and cooperation among citizens" (Bratislava TV, 16 March). At the same time, the coalition parties appear to be coalescing in their efforts to prevent Meciar from making yet another comeback, while calling for a preelection truce among themselves. Peter Weiss, the leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), said that in order to defeat Meciar, the coalition must "convince the electorate" that it is possible to govern "by means of cooperation and reasonable compromises" (CTK, 22 March). Likewise, Christian Democratic Party (KDH) leader Jan Carnogursky said that despite "different views within the government" all of the coalition parties have a "joint objective" and "know what is at stake" (Vienna Kurier, 16 March). It is far from certain that the coalition parties can be held together until the elections solely by their common perception of the dangers of Meciar's return to power. In the past, leaders of the coalition parties frequently clashed over programatic and personal differences. For example, during Carnogursky's tenure as Slovak prime minister in 1991, Weiss accused him of being "blind to problems, deaf to criticism, and asocial when it comes to people" (Zemedelski Noviny, 19 December 1991). In addition, three current ministers -- including the prime minister, a deputy prime minister, and the finance minister -- were leading HZDS members in March 1992, when the HZDS accused Carnogursky's brother of collaboration with the former communist secret police (Mlada Fronta Dnes, 26 March). In ousting Meciar now, the opposition parties--galvanized by President Michal Kovac's parliamentary speech accusing Meciar of corruption (Bratislava Radio, 9 March)--appeared to be reacting to reports that Meciar was rapidly selling off state enterprises to political cronies (Narodna Obroda, 15 March). After Kovac's speech, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) agreed to join the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), along with three new parties consisting of former HZDS and SNS members voted to dismiss Meciar and to form a new governing coalition. The coalition agreed to give the SDL seven cabinet seats, the KDH six seats, and the "Center Bloc" of former "Meciarites" five seats, including the prime ministership. Calling for an investigation into the rapid sell-off of state firms during Meciar's last weeks in office, new Privatization Minister Milan Janicina called the privatization spree a "form of political corruption," comparing it to "when William the Conqueror invaded Britain and handed out property to his beloved Normans" (Bratislava Radio, 17 March). Likewise, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, a founding member of the HZDS who was expelled from the party in September 1993, announced that one of the government's first acts will be to "depoliticize the privatization process," which he contended had "become a tool for the political concentration of power" under Meciar (CTK, 16 March). Meciar's Strategy Using what is likely to be the main theme of his election campaign, Meciar reacted to his ouster by portraying himself as indispensable for Slovak independence. In a parliamentary speech just prior to the no-confidence vote, Meciar asserted that by leading the country to independence he has "managed to achieve what no Slovak has succeeded in achieving in several decades or even centuries" (Bratislava Radio, 11 March). Meciar also contended that as prime minister he frequently had to rectify foreign policy mistakes made by President Kovac, such as attempting to sell arms to Croatia, almost provoking an "international crisis" with China by proposing the recognition of Taiwan, and "wasting an opportunity" to improve relations with the United States during President Clinton's January visit to Prague. The day before his ouster, Meciar also claimed that by confronting the chief of the Czechoslovak Army's General Staff in late 1992, he and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had prevented a possible "attack against Slovakia" by the Army (CTK, 11 March). In addition, Meciar and the pro-Meciar daily Republika have also suggested that the new government represents a threat to Slovak sovereignty. After his ouster, Meciar said that the new government and the puppet government installed by Nazi Germany in 1939 "might be similar" (Bratislava Radio, 14 March). Republika chief editor Jan Smolec, a Meciar stalwart, called the prime minister's ouster a "Czechoslovakist, communist, and Hungarian conspiracy" (Republika, 12 March)--a reference to the KDH's past opposition to the split of Czechoslovakia, the presence of the SDL in the coalition, and the tacit support of the Hungarian minority deputies for the new coalition. Emphasizing the communist past of Moravcik and the SDL, a front-page article in Republika on 16 March accused the new prime minister of grabbing the "post that he was modestly longing for around the Leninist campfire" as a member of the communist "Leninist Spark" organization in 1989, compared the formation of the new cabinet to the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, and charged that SDL leader Peter Weiss "hides badly his longing for the renewal of communist power." Outlook While the opposition parties may have managed to thwart Meciar's attempts to consolidate his power in newly-privatized firms, the new coalition's gains will be short-lived if the HZDS, which continues to top public opinion polls (CTK, 22 March), improves on its June 1992 performance. Freed from the burdens of governing, Meciar may have more success campaigning as an opposition figure rather than as a defender of the country's flagging economy, and his bloc of 65 deputies--56 HZDS deputies and nine SNS seats--in the 150-member parliament may prevent passage of any substantial reform legislation before the elections. Operating against Meciar, however, is the possibility of further defections from his party, the apparent decline in popularity of the SNS, and the limited possibility of the HZDS forming a postelection coalition with the parties that participated in his ouster. Although the HZDS will likely end up with a larger share of seats than it currently holds, having suffered the defection of 18 of its deputies in the last year, if Meciar is to regain and maintain the prime ministership, the HZDS will have to capture a solid majority of the seats in parliament- -something it did not achieve in June 1992 when it fell one deputy shy of a parliamentary majority. If the HZDS again falls short, the other parties may find themselves in an awkward marriage of convenience, united only over the danger posed by Meciar, while he attacks them from his opposition seat in parliament.
