This important document was signed by Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, foreign ministers of the FRY and Croatia, respectively. The signing ceremony was attended by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic, Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. It has been decided that as the first step toward the normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia the two governments open representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade. The joint communique states that the opening of the aforementioned representative offices will improve relations and facilitate contacts between the two states, as well as contribute toward mutual trust and the process of normalization of Serbian-Croatian relations in the interest of peace, cooperation, and stability in the region. The representative offices of the FRY in Zagreb and of Croatia in Belgrade will commence work on 15 February. It appears that the signing of the aforementioned statement, which implies the beginning of the normalization in relations between the FRY and Croatia, is so far the only tangible result of the very difficult two-day negotiations in Geneva. The negotiations will continue this afternoon. Here is what Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated after the signing of the joint declaration, especially for Belgrade Radio: [Begin recording] [Jovanovic] The document that has just been signed is an important event and document because it sanctions the positive efforts made by the FRY and the Republic of Croatia in the current peace process in a positive way, especially with regard to the settlement of the Bosnian crisis. This document also stresses their determination to establish closer bilateral contacts, to establish direct communication links in the form of offices, and we are convinced that this will help the (?establishment) of peace and the prospects for the political settling of all outstanding issues in relations between the two countries and the broader region of Yugoslavia. We hope that this statement will have positive effects on the (?situation) and the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because (?it represents) a sign of political goodwill and unity in the efforts of political factors to politically overcome the problems that require exclusively political solutions and not solutions with force. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how do you assess the two-day talks in Geneva? [Jovanovic] They are very complex, very slow, and contain many anachronisms, especially by the Muslim delegation, which has obviously come here with the intention not to sign peace but to make it more complicated, that is, to make its realization more difficult. This is the most negative moment in the work so far. On the contrary, however, there are continuous efforts, efforts made by the cochairmen and the Serbian and the Croatian sides. Thanks to this, one could say that there are still some chances of saving the peace process this afternoon and evening, and if we can be optimists without having much reason to be, to bring this process closer to an end. [Colovic] Thank you Mr. Jovanovic. [Jovanovic] Thank you. [end recording]
