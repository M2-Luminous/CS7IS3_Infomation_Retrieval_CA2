How come that the Republic of Moldova became divided into two parts? [Plugaru] The site where God places us becomes an advantage only when we know how to make use of it, the way in, which, for example, Stefan cel Mare [ruler of Moldova in the 15th century] did. If we do not do it, others will make use of it in their own interests, the way Russia did in the past and continues to do today. When it became clear that the "union" with Russia will not live long, some wise Russians found the way to calm down the "display of sovereignty." Thus, the malady called the Moldovan Dniester Republic appeared on the banks of the Dniester River and it finds solid support in the 14th Russian Army. There was much dispute on the issue of this strip of land, just like in all the other places where the Russians are not pleased with the locals. The Russians consider all the locals to be bad sorts. The Russians believe that their rights are violated, they are oppressed, they are not bosses everywhere, and on top of it, they are asked to speak the language of the locals. The Russians are not used to all this. If the world is not good, the world has to be changed, because all those Moldovans, Georgians, Latvians, and others are demanding too much. While in Russia -- the country that has assumed the responsibility to protect all of them from good or from evil, throughout this "immense homeland," and the country that has suffered from birth of an insatiable hunger for foreign lands -- the great political race is in full swing and each participant in the race wants to acquire more and more land for Russia. We have to accept the thought that Russia can be led only by those who become the winners in this race, which might also be called chauvinism. Because all those who do not practice chauvinism have no place in the Olympus of the Russian leadership. Everything that is happening in the world today speaks of Russia's increasingly aggressive and unstoppable intention to preserve what it conquered in the past and to gain new spheres of influence. Thus, it is clear that the Dniester region as well as other areas where Russia has its own interest will still suffer if no cure is found soon to this malady. [Chifu] What is the role of the 14th Army in Dniester? Who are the enemies from whom this Army has to defend the Russian Federation in Tiraspol? [Plugaru] No mater how strange it seems, and although the big politics are not made in Chisinau, all the cure that we need can be found here at home. First of all I am referring to our location, since we are at the crossroads of the world. We must understand that this place is suitable for all kind of exercises, military occupation, coups, counter-coups, and for the utilization of all kinds of weapons aimed in all directions; certainly, all this in the name and interest of Russia. We can also notice that the 14th Army faces a beautiful and prosperous country that is called Turkey, with which Russia has been "friends" for centuries on end. I am not familiar with Russia's military doctrine and its secret plans, thus I do not know whom it has in mind for the role of the next most-probable adversary. However, I know very well that, still, in the time of the Soviet Union, nobody in the Command of the South-West Armies, located in Chisinau, was concealing for whom the missiles in our forests, the planes in Marculesti and Bolgrad, the airborne troops in Chisinau, the means of communication, and all the other facilities of the 14th Army were meant. Greece is not too far away either, not to speak of Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, or Italy. I do not believe that these countries feel too much at ease knowing that General Lebed [head of the 14th Army] is in Dniester -- who initially promised to hang all the Moldovan leaders -- or knowing that there is a loony in Russia's State Duma who wants to wash his boots not only in the Mediterranean, but also in the Indian Ocean [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy]. Or, maybe they put their hope in the one who recently chided Nixon, because he thought they were sitting and having a drink [Yeltsin]. Poor of him, he could hardly stand. And just think that he has access to the button that can destroy the world. One can hear rumors that he will be demoted soon. Let them do it, it is their problem. But what if the loony comes to power? Needless to say that these people were not appointed and did not seize power, but were elected by and are dear to tens of millions of Russians. As far as Lebed is concerned, I believe that due to his outstanding qualities, he will advance in position and will be soon one of the leaders of Russia's Armed Forces. And if what he does is called saving Russia, we have to expect other promotions as well. The State of Neutrality Is Convenient If You Have Means With Which To Defend Yourself [subhead] [Chifu] Nevertheless, what solution do you see to these problems? How do you think that the current leadership in Moldova and the West should act? [Plugaru] I believe that one of the solutions would be to establish a modern military base on the other bank of the Dniester River. Whose base should that be? Whoever you wish, because in our situation it is the same for us. Certainly, the country with which we have the best understanding should have priority, but at the same time, that country should have everything necessary to make the presence of the Russian troops in this part of Moldova unnecessary. I believe that the most suitable country would be Turkey. It has the means and the reason, and it is also familiar with these places... However, it is essential for us to open our doors and tell the whole world what our problem is. A part of the world will get scared, others will decide against getting involved, and others, who have the means with which to face Russia, you can be sure will come and will even thank us. Probably, the country or the groups of countries that will accept the proposal, will establish a base in two-three months and will bring over everything that they need. It is Russia that should worry about the rest. [Chifu] Recently, the Republic of Moldova signed the Partnership for Peace. How does this act match all that you have suggested and the neutrality for which people voted on 6 March at the same time when the opinion poll "What People Advise" was held? [Plugaru] We will have to be patient with the already proclaimed neutrality, because we have no other choice. Neutrality is fine, but only when you have means with which to defend yourself, or you have guarantees that somebody is ready to defend you. It is not sufficient, and even dangerous, to limit ourselves to measures such as Partnership for Peace. All these things for which you have to pay nothing, will result in nothing. Such things are good, but they mean only a first step, nothing else, and only as long as Russia does not do anything foolish. Those who invented the idea of the Partnership for Peace meant well, but you see, Russia did not like it, it does not like to be isolated, so it came at once to sit at the big table. We should not have illusions that this would ensure the preservation of peace in the region. Were we not members of the United Nations when Russia, a member of the same organization, attacked us in summer 1992 in Dniester? Europe and the new world have signed, and will still continue to sign, alliances, blocs, pacts, and all kinds of treaties but, ever since the world began, the powerful ones were the ones who started wars. People like us were witnesses, victims, or were simply ignored. Certainly you can feel like the United States and Japan, or can even look like them, but this will not make you stronger. Power has always been and will continue to be decisive. And the powerful ones know each other. Thus, we should not rail against relations with Russia. Although nobody can rely on today's Russia -- it does not know itself what is happening to it -- however, willingly or unwillingly, we have to accept friendship with it because we have no other choice. But to completely lose our self-esteem, the way Russia wants, is not possible either. If we preserve out self-esteem and we want the world to respect us, we should know how to convey to Russia the message to forget its intentions. That is what I meant when I talked about a small military base to oppose the Tiraspol base. [Chifu] How will Russia react to such an initiative? [Plugaru] Officially, it has no say in it because it is our own business with whom we associate and what we do at home, and Russia's borders are far away from us. Certainly, it would try to stop us by putting pressure on those who make decisions on such matters. Nevertheless, in the end it will accept it because there are countries in this world with which Russia is compelled to speak with respect and with much deference. Apart from that, it might be possible that the separatist tendencies that have engulfed Russia will inevitably lead to its dismantlement and, one day, when it has no time to think about the Dniester region, it will have to give up this region. What we are suggesting will help Russia to reach this conclusion sooner. At the same time, we do not really have a choice, there are not that many variations from which we can choose or that many ways in which to cut the Gordian Knot. Mature Countries Are No Longer Fighting, They Are Distributing Weapons to Others [Chifu] The Republic of Moldova is currently holding negotiations for the withdrawal of the 14th Army from its territory. What will be the fate of that army? [Plugaru] All these negotiation for the withdrawal of the 14th Army, unconditionally or on certain conditions, have been both this year and the year before, just talks held in vain. These negotiations have to be held because there is nothing better to do and Russia has to be told every day that it is occupying a part of our land and that it has to gather in all those weapons that it distributed to bandits. Nevertheless, ultimately the negotiations will not lead to the withdrawal of the 14th Army. It cannot happen because it is at variance with Russia's strategic interests. It does not matter that today the nature of wars has changed somehow, namely rich countries are no longer fighting but rather distributing weapons to others, leaving them to shoot each other and then, it can purchase what is left for peanuts. Mature countries are conquering new territories, new assets, however not through military operations but economic ones. In our case, the importance of military operations is still topical because Russia has not reached the stage of economic operations. It is just training at the expense of the former Soviet republics. Thus, Russia will not leave so easily and so soon. You can rest assured that if today Russia's reason for staying is that it has to preserve peace in this area and defend Russians from who knows whom, tomorrow, when it becomes clear for everybody that this is just an excuse not to leave this area, it will invent another excuse. And how could Russia possible leave? While it stays in the Dniester region, it does what it wants in the Republic of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine. Even in Ukraine, a country that allowed the separatists to emerge and flourish. The affirmation that, all this time while we were occupied, including the time of the conflict, Ukraine has been neutral or even helped us, is pure demagogy. As a matter of fact, Ukraine refused to open the joint border crossing points that would have been more useful for both sides and that would have isolated the criminals in Tiraspol from the whole world. Certainly, the separatists and the 14th Army would not have dared fire at these joint points because they would have started a war with Ukraine. But, to our great regret, Ukraine certainly remained "neutral" only in words, because everything that emerged from Dniester on land, water, or air, crossed Ukraine. [Chifu] Nevertheless, how does Ukraine view the presence of the 14th Army, under conditions of dissent with Russia on the issue of Black Sea fleet and especially the Crimea region? [Plugaru] Ukraine feels the real pain in its Western side. It feels that it will hear the noise of shooting from those weapons that were crossing the "neutral" Ukraine. Only God knows how much military technology has been collected in Dniester region. From this place the Russians do what they want with Romania. Because I have to tell you truthfully, the 14th Army has modern systems of electronic radio espionage devices. They are working hard on systems to intercept telephone connections from a distance, and there are other devices for stealing information in general, because this part in territory of the Republic of Moldova is a wonderful intermediary base for the activity of Russian secret services. From what other part could Russia's security services come closer to Moldova or Romania? Its agents feel in their element in this part of the world. There are practically no serious restrictions that might hamper their free circulation on the Russia-Tiraspol-Chisinau-Bucharest route. It does not matter anymore what depth into Romania Lebed's technology reached. Romania Should Never Forget Where the Policy Promoted by King Carol II Led [Chifu] What is Romania's role in this region? [Plugaru] I believe that, first of all, we should ask the question: Is Russia indeed the country that wants a stronger and independent Greater Romania? If the answer is yes, then long live Russia and the 14th Army. But what if the answer is no? How can we face it? What is our army today and what can it do? What is the Romanian Army compared to Russia's and when did Russia produce the weapons that Romania's armed forces are using today? I do not believe that the recent replacement of General Spiroiu [former Romanian defense Minister] is connected with the answer to this question, just as it has no connection with the other changes that took place in Bucharest. New commotion and turmoil in the structures that must ensure state security never led to anything good. However, if too much garbage has been collected, it is good to dispose of it, otherwise it will dispose of you. However, Romania must never forget where the policy promoted by King Carol II led. If one wishes for the country to be united at home, one should take into account what is happening around it. It is not possible that one has no trustworthy allies. [Chifu] You said that "they cannot make us unite." Are you in favor of unification? [Plugaru] Mr. Chifu, one cannot just foolishly shout "unification" without knowing the answer to a few questions in advance: What is Russia's attitude and possible reaction? What will the Hungarians and Bulgarians do? What will Ukraine say, although it is in a state of discord with Russia? Who would benefit from a united Romania? Which of the superpowers will support us? And who will want to stop us? It is important to know things, not only to wish for them and also to be able to act, not only today but tomorrow too, and even in the most unfavorable circumstances. If you do not exactly know what you are doing and you are just feeling your way, then it does not matter whether you are a lunatic or insane person, or somebody just got hold of you and you are working for him. No one can invent a greater disfavor than this for Romania, for the Republic of Moldova, and for Romanians in general. It is not bad to wish for something and dream about it. What I said does not refer to honest people, who do have great aspirations and who act according to their feelings, because they believe that is the normal thing to do. I am talking about those who make politics without looking around. I am talking about those who are duty-bound to know and to weigh things -- as any person, party, or state should do -- before calling on masses of people and before moving borders and relations with other people, with or without involving the Army. This is the concern of all of us who in one way or another have made a contribution to the deterioration of relations with Russia. And I am one of them. Just look at all the fuss made by Russia about the so-called rights and interests of Russians who live beyond Russia's borders. Have you noticed how, for several month on end, Russian propaganda has been striving to prove to the whole world that ethnic Russians, their fellow citizens, are oppressed and their rights and freedoms are being violated; in short, that they need help! Since we are in the situation of the small and harassed one, or rather in the situation of the little one who has been beaten up by an older person, it would be advisable if we did not rush in with an answer, because in any event we are going to grow up, while he will be just growing older.
