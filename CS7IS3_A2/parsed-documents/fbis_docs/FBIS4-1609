Africa Opens First China Fair"] [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing African nation into the mainland market. More than 300 South African business representatives are attending the four-day event. "The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations between the two countries," said David Graaff, South Africa's deputy-minister of industry and trade. Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come from 31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as mining equipment, electronics and jewellery. Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor Mining & Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial market. Graaff said he believes the exhibition "will make an important contribution to bilateral trade relations by stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism." Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992, sound trade ties have been achieved, he said. Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30 percent to reach $658 million last year. If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses $1 billion. "China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and we always take her as an important trading partner," said the deputy-minister. He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with China for years to come. After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa has become a strong economic power. Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated by exports. China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry products to the South African nation. Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also produces construction equipment.
