According to Palestinian sources, the visit will take place on 7 June, the day on which the West Bank was occupied in 1967. Interviewed by IDF Radio this morning, Knesset Member [MK] Hanan Porat of the National Religious Party said he would welcome any attempt to assassinate 'Arafat when he visits Jericho. Porat was interviewed by our correspondent Itay Engel. [Begin recording] [Engel] Hanan Porat, would you not like to meet Yasir 'Arafat? [Porat] No, absolutely not. I would not like to meet him. I do not think he is a partner or interlocutor of Israel. He is a man of terror whose hands are tainted with blood. A man who continues to talk about a jihad for Jerusalem is not my interlocutor. I am prepared to meet him only looking down the barrel of a gun. [Engel] Should I infer from your remarks that if a gun sight were aimed at this man when he arrives in Jericho, you would find it acceptable and would even encourage it? [Porat] I would congratulate anybody who does it, and I am saying this with the utmost resolve. You know, sometimes we tend to behave like doormats. If you ask me, however, what is the proper and deserving thing to do to this man called Yasir 'Arafat, he deserves a bullet in the head. [end recording]
