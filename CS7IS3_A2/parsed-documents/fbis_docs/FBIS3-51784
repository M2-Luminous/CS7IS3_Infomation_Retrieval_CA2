How will the $40 million be spent now that this agreement was signed? I ask this question because there are great expectations. It has been said that the country faced economic problems, more economic problems when the aid was not disbursed. The $40 million will be forthcoming. The $40 million will reportedly, and according to U.S. Ambassador Maisto, be credited to Nicaragua's account this week. How will the $40 million be spent? [Taboada] This is a donation that will be applied to our balance of payments. This means that those resources will be added to Central Bank reserves. The Central Bank may sell this foreign currency to Nicaraguan importers, pay oil debts, or pay debts to multilateral financial organizations in Washington. Those are basically the three options for which we may earmark the foreign currency that will be deposited in the Central Bank. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Taboada] The entire debt, the debt in arrears, which is a government priority, may be paid with these funds as long as such payments are made to multilateral financial organizations such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. We cannot use this money to pay Germany, for example. [Reporter] How much does the Nicaraguan debt amount to at present? [Taboada] The Nicaraguan debt, unfortunately, is more than $10 billion. This is why the government has focused efforts on renegotiating and obtaining pardons for our debt. Thus, the stock [previous word in English] of the debt continues to be very high. This is why when we talk about payments on our debt it must be clearly understood that we are referring to payments of that part of the debt that the government considers to be a priority. We must pay about $254.5 million in 1994. [Reporter] Minister, you talked about a deficit in our trade balance. How much does it amount to? [Taboada] That deficit could reach $400 million, perhaps a little more. This is why we need to cover this deficit with foreign cooperation, that is, loans or donations. [Reporter] Minister, let us switch to another topic: the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]. You said moments ago that the ESAF was signed. The ESAF is a reality. The signing of this agreement was strongly questioned months ago, last year, late last year when the first IMF and World Bank delegation visited our country. The government was unable to sign at that time. Days later a new delegation of the IMF and a World Bank delegation arrived to finalize the signing of the ESAF. My question is: Opposition leaders, Sandinist leader Daniel Ortega thinks that the signing of this agreement will bring about negative effects, because there is talk of drastic public expenditure reductions. Will this bring about positive or negative consequences? The government argues that the signing of this agreement will bring about positive results for the entire population. What are the final conditions for the signing of this agreement called ESAF? [Taboada] We are now at a stage in which structural reforms have already been agreed upon. For example, in the financial sector we will continue to maintain the independence of the Bank Superintendency. This commitment was also acquired by the Legislative Branch through Law 125. There are at times attempts to reaffirm [reiterar] aspects that are already recognized or contained in the government plan. Such aspects include the independence of the Bank Superintendency, the role of state-owned banks as effective mediation instruments in the financial sector, and the continued efforts to further reduce bank operational costs and increase revenues. In sum, to turn banks into instruments to support Nicaraguan production activities. There are also reforms, that is, agreements in the fiscal area to reduce exonerations, except, obviously, those granted by law. The idea is to benefit Nicaraguan society with the collection of taxes from certain import sectors that are currently exonerated and not protected by law. [Reporter] What about a reduction in public expenditures? [Taboada] We realize the need to make further adjustments, that is, reduce public expenditures, in keeping with the resources available to the Nicaraguan economy, that is, the revenues that will be at our disposal from taxes, funds collected by public sector companies, and loans and donations. We must continue our efforts to reduce the size of the nonfinancial public sector to secure resources to ensure that the private sector is able to produce.
