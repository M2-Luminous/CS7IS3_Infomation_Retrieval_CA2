FR940105-2-00086 FR940105-2-00041 10. Questions regarding the wisdom of allowing Tenneco to contribute Cummins stock to the GEBT since, according to the commentator, Tenneco owns Cummins. 11. Comments indicating that the Plan participants would prefer to receive cash contributions rather than stock. 12. Allegations that individuals who would be affected by the proposed transaction have not received proper notice. 13. Questions concerning the independent fiduciary's alleged determination that the Stock will experience no precipitous declines in value in the future. 14. Confusion over the consequences for the GEBT of any decline in value of the Stock. 15. Concern over the proper exercise of the voting and other privileges applicable to shareholders of the Stock. 16. Questions about the guidelines for determining if and when to adjust the amount of the letter of credit (or alternative collateral) which secures the Contribution Obligation. 17. A request that Tenneco guarantee that the value of the contribution will not be diminished by transaction costs when the Stock is sold at some future date. Responses to these comments were submitted by the applicant, on behalf of both Tenneco and Woodbridge, the GEBT'S independent fiduciary. These responses are summarized as follows, corresponding in order to the comments listed above: 1. According to the applicant, subsequent to the publication of the Notice of Proposed Exemption, Cummins had a 2 for 1 stock split which accounts for the change in the price of the Stock as listed on the NYSE. 2. The applicant notes that after a review of the Stock's past performance, Woodbridge has determined that the Stock is a prudent investment for the Plan despite the restrictions on transferability. Furthermore, the applicant states that the Stock's value has been determined by an independent appraisal company, taking the restrictions into account. Finally, the applicant notes that the restrictions on transfer of the Stock will expire in July, 1996. 3. The applicant explains that once the Stock is contributed to the GEBT, it will represent only 5.65% of the assets of the GEBT. In addition, because each of the Affected Plans has an undivided interest in the assets of the GEBT, no single plan will hold all of the Stock. 4. The applicant asserts that Standard & Poors and Moody's rating of Tenneco debt as investment grade, as well as Tenneco's recent sale of $1 billion of equity, are indications that Tenneco is a viable company. The applicant again notes that the proposed transaction is backed by the judgment of Woodbridge as independent fiduciary, by the independent appraisal of the Stock and by the letter of credit in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 5. The applicant represents that due to Tenneco's financial condition, as described in 4. above, a letter of credit in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock is sufficient to protect the interests of the GEBT. The applicant represents that the face value of the letter of credit is approximately $32,000,000. The applicant also represents that Tenneco's financial condition is good and that its credit-worthiness is adequate security for the unsecured portion of the Contribution Obligation. 6. According to the applicant, the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is part of an overall strategy to ensure that the Tenneco Plans will be fully funded. 7. The applicant represents that the Contribution Obligation assumed by Tenneco guarantees the value of the contribution since Tenneco is required to make a cash contribution to the GEBT to compensate for any loss in the value of the Stock in any calendar quarter. Furthermore, the Contribution Obligation is secured by a letter of credit issued by a major bank in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 8. The applicant responds by explaining that all plans invested in the GEBT are defined benefit plans, the benefits of which are not affected by the investment performance of plan assets. 9. Retiree medical benefits are not relevant to the proposed exemption. 10. Tenneco does not own Cummins. The applicant represents that Tenneco owns less than 10% of Cummins' stock. 11. The applicant represents that the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is essentially the same as a cash contribution to the GEBT followed by a purchase of Cummins' stock by the GEBT. In addition, the applicant states that maintaining the Plan assets primarily in uninvested cash would be a breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA. The applicant further states that the GEBT will at all times maintain sufficient liquid assets to pay benefits when due. The applicant also represents that the Stock is not replacing cash or other assets in the GEBT; rather, the Stock is being contributed in addition to the assets already held in the GEBT. According to the applicant, the contribution of Stock enables Tenneco to accelerate the time at which the GEBT will receive contributions. 12. The applicant represents that it has complied with all applicable notice requirements. An authorized representative of Tenneco has provided the Department with a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to the truth of the information regarding Tenneco's notice to interested persons as required by the Department's regulations (see 29 CFR 2570.43). In addition, in response to information indicating that several interested persons in and around Hutchinson, Kansas had not received proper notice of the proposed exemption, the applicant represents that notice was again provided to people in the Hutchinson area. 13. The applicant explains that, contrary to the commentator's assertion, Woodbridge has not made any such determination but has concluded that the Stock is a prudent investment for the GEBT, based in part on the Stock's market history over the past 3 years. In addition, Woodbridge has determined that any decline in value of the Stock would be adequately compensated for by the Contribution Obligation. 14. The applicant asserts that the Contribution Obligation ensures that the value of the stock contribution will remain the same even if the value of the Stock decreases. The applicant explains that, if, for example, the Stock is valued at $160,000,000 on the date of contribution to the Plan and, over the course of a year the price drops, Tenneco would be obligated, over the course of that year, on a quarterly basis, to contribute cash so that the value of the Stock plus the aggregate amounts of cash contributed pursuant to the Contribution Obligation equals $160,000,000. It is represented, therefore, that the value of the intial contribution will never be diminished. 15. The applicant responds by explaining that Woodbridge, acting in its capacity as independent fiduciary, will exercise the stock voting rights and the right to designate a person to the Cummins Board of Directors, pursuant to the direction of the GEBT's Investment Committee; provided, that Woodbridge may decline to designate the Investment Committee's choice if it determines that to do so is in the GEBT's best interests. 16. The applicant states that the determination regarding the increase in the amount of the letter of credit or the need to provide alternative collateral is a simple calculation based on the difference between (a) the balance of the letter of credit and (b) the product of the number of shares of the Stock held by the GEBT, the contribution price of the Stock and 20%.
