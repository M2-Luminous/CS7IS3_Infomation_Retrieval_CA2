FR941012-0-00056 FR941012-0-00011 In addition, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final logging standard estimates, based on the various data in the record, that there are an average of 158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries and 3,770 non-lost workday injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. (For further discussion see section VI of this preamble.) Of the 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations as defined by the final rule, only 38 percent (27,170) are covered by State Plan State logging standards, 5 which currently provide protection regardless of kind of logging operation in which the loggers are employed. Of the estimated 62 percent (44,930) of logging employees who are not covered by State plan State standards, OSHA estimates that at only one-third (16,478) are covered by the existing pulpwood logging standard. That means that almost two-thirds (28,452) are not covered by any Federal or State logging standard. (This estimate is consistent with the WIR survey, which indicated that only 35 percent of those surveyed were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.) 5 In 1977, the leading states in logging employment (with 48 percent of the total) were Washington (15, 400), Oregon (14,000), California (6,100) and Maine (4,300). By 1982, the employment pattern had shifted and the leading states (with 42 percent of the total) were Washington (11,900, down 3,500); Oregon (11,300, down 2,700); Georgia (5,400, up 1,600); and Alabama (5,000, up 1,200). California (3,900, down 2,200), was no longer one of the leaders. Overall logging employment in the Pacific Coast states decreased 22% during this period. The South was the only region in the country to show an increase in logging employment (21%). This employment trend, resulting in the change from harvesting the Pacific Coast's old-growth timber to increased harvesting of third and forth-growth pine forests in the south, means that an increasing proportion of logging employment is in states not covered by state logging standards. (As noted earlier, only Alaska (16th in 1982), California (7th), Hawaii (very small), Michigan (19th), Oregon (2nd) and Washington (1st) have OSHA approved state logging standards covering all loggers.) This means that as the centers of activity (and employment) shift from the old growth forests of the pacific coast to the pine forests of the south, fewer employees conducting general logging (non-pulpwood logging) will be covered by these State plan State logging standards. The preceding section shows there has been a steady decrease in injury and lost-workday incidence rates since the adoption of OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard and the State plan State standards. In addition to a further reduction in accidents for those employers currently covered by OSHA and State logging standards, OSHA believes that a substantial reduction in incidence rates can be achieved by promulgating a uniform national logging standard that provides protection for all employees engaged in logging operations. In developing the proposed rule, OSHA used the l978 ANSI standard as its model for a uniform national logging standard, since many of its requirements were stated in performance language. This is in keeping with the Agency's determination that properly drafted performance standards can adequately address safety and health hazards without unnecessarily impeding technological advancement and employer innovation. The final rule provides a base level of safety for employees in all logging operations. At the same time, it still allows those State plan States with more complicated or specialized local conditions to develop their own detailed standards, as several States have already done. Many participants in this rulemaking have said that a comprehensive performance-based logging standard is necessary to reduce the risk of injury and death (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 21, 73, 202). OSHA agrees with these commenters. The Agency believes that the integrated program of personal protective equipment; equipment, machine and vehicle protective devices, inspection and maintenance; work practices; and training contained in the final rule is reasonably necessary and appropriate to reduce the high injury and fatality incidence rates in this industry. V. Major Issues A. Introduction As a result of issues raised by those commenting on the proposed logging standard, OSHA solicited information on 10 major issues in the notice of public hearing (55 FR 19745, May 11, 1990). OSHA requested detailed information on a variety of issues including training, personal protective equipment, first aid, chain-saw protective devices, and seat belts. These issues were discussed by the participants during the public hearings and in post-hearing comments. The evidence submitted to the record is summarized and evaluated in the following discussion of each issue and in the summary and explanation of the final rule.
