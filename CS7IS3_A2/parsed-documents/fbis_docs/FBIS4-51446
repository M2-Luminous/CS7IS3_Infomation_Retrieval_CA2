NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi presented the certificates to the 13 new PWC members. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun presided over the ceremony. Chairman Qiao Shi made an important speech. He said: Since its establishment in July last year, the PWC has worked very hard and pragmatically. It has attracted extensive attention and won favorable comments from various quarters. On behalf of the NPC Standing Committee, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Chairman Qian Qichen and the committee's vice chairmen, members, and working personnel. Qiao Shi said: The PWC's work burden will become increasingly heavier as the day when China assumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong draws near. The purpose of selecting additional PWC members is to strengthen its working power. We believe that the additional members will certainly live up to the people's aspirations and join other committee members and take the initiative in doing solid preparatory work for the establishment of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee under the guidance of the general principle of "one country, two systems," the Basic Law, and the relevant NPC decisions. Qiao Shi emphasized: The PWC's work has a direct bearing on the transfer of government and the smooth transition of Hong Kong in 1997. I hope that the PWC will continue to widely listen to the Hong Kong people's opinions; pay attention to investigation and study; and by various means and ways, make the Hong Kong people show a common concern about and participate in the preparatory work for China to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong. So long as the vast number of Hong Kong people participate in our work and the people across the country strongly support our work, we certainly can triumphantly accomplish the glorious mission assigned us by history. Present at today's ceremony were Wang Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Sun Qimeng, Chen Muhua, Qin Jiwei, Lu Jiaxi, and Buhe, vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; Cao Zhi, secretary general of the NPC Standing Committee; and Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and chairman of the PWC.
