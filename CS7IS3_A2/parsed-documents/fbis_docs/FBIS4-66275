What will Henan do? When interviewed by this reporter, the delegate, Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen [7456 1813 5256] stated, "We must speed up Henan's development by converting our resource advantages into economic superiority." Delegate Ma Zhongchen said that Henan was located in the inner platform, so it is a major province for resources. There are 107 types of mineral products found in Henan, and among the verified mineral products, 49 are listed among the top ten nationally, including 12 types listed among the top three. The three energy mineral products of coal, oil, and natural gas, the four metal mineral products of aluminium, gold, molybdenum, and silver, and such non-metal mineral products as refractory clay, cement stone, salt, trona, solvent limestone, pearlite, and orchid asbestos are especially rich. The area is also very rich in arable land and output of agricultural products and by-products, with winter wheat, beans, cotton, and tobacco, as well as various fruits, and reserve quantities of large livestock all listed first in the nation. Transportation extends in all directions, the highways cover the province as densely as a spider's web, and air flights connect Henan with more than 20 Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Japan. The North-South and East-West central coaxial cables intersect at Zhengzhou. Seventeen prefectures or cities and 83 counties (cities) have operational domestic direct dial telephones, with a provincial total of over 500,000 automatic exchange phones. Henan is first nationally in underground cultural relics, second in above-ground relics, and our museum collections rank third in the nation. Since reform and opening, we have made our base upon developing our resource superiority, and have made great progress economically. In 1993, Henan's GDP was up to 158 billion yuan, a 15.7 percent increase over 1992, and 9.7 times that of 1978. However, Delegate Ma Zhongchen pointed out that "Due to the affects of the economic division under the traditional economic system and limitations on capital and technology, Henan has not significantly altered its status of being a producing and exporting base for agricultural products, by-products, energy resource, raw materials and major primary level products, so we have not maximized our resource advantage, and our resource efficiency is not high enough. Viewed from the opposite angle, it demonstrates that the Henan economy has great potential for development. Therefore, the key to accelerating Henan's economic development lies in further releasing the huge potential its of resource advantages, doing our best to convert this resource advantage into economic advantage." Ma Zhongchen said firmly, with emphasis in his voice, "We have therefore laid out the general idea that developing Henan's economy in the future lies in accelerating the process of national economic marketization, implementing a comprehensive strategy for developing industry and agriculture. We must use the cities to promote the countryside, completely opening up and developing from a high starting point, facing toward both the overseas and domestic markets, going the way of deep processing with value adding driven by the resource advantages. Convert our resource advantages into economic advantage." "But, how do you convert resource advantages into economic advantage?" the correspondent asked. "First of all, we must strengthen the market economic concept, try to realize the four changes', and do a good job on three key points' of developing resource advantages." Delegate Ma Zhongchen explained that, "The so-called four changes' are, one, change from fixing projects according to resources to fixing them by market requirements; two, change from driving processing value adding by exploiting resource advantages into driving exploiting resource advantages by deep processing value adding; three, change from mainly facing inward for developing resources into developing resources facing the overseas and the domestic market, while giving special attention right now to developing export oriented industry, enterprises and products; four, change from developing and using solely local resources into a base of using both international and domestic, especially taking full advantage of foreign capital, technology, expertise and information resources, to realize bilateral compensation through the province's advantages in land, agricultural products and by-products, mineral products and labor force resources. "Principally, the `three key points' are: (1) Vigorously develop the deep processing of advantageous mineral resources, really working on five industrial systems: coal-electricity, coal chemicals, petrochemicals, aluminium and construction materials. 1. Focus on coal-electricity, vigorously developing deep processing for primary energy. Henan not only has rich coal resources, we are also close to two coal bases in southeastern Shanxi and Shaanxi, which is very favorable for development of the Kengkou and Lukou power stations. By the end of the century, we will build Henan into an important coal-electricity base with a 12 to 15 million KW generator capacity in the united national electricity network. We will try to add 3.5 million KW of generator capacity during the Eighth Five Year Plan, and will try to add 6.5 million KW during the Ninth Five Year Plan. 2. Develop the coal chemicals industry on the base of advantageous coal resources. Led by nylon 66 salt, based on coal tar processing, we are developing synthetic materials and fine chemical industry products while developing basic chemical raw materials. There are projects which have been set by the state, such as the Pingdingshan nylon 66 salt project, Pingdingshan coal tar project, Yima gas chemicals project, etc. 3. Make oil, natural gas-fuel, oil-chemical fibre and plastics a deep processing chain to develop the petrochemical industry. Relying on the oil and gas resources of the Zhongyuan Oil Field, Henan Oil Field and the five million tons of raw oil processing at the Luoyang Oil Refinery, we will gradually establish a Luoyang petrochemical industrial base focused on oil refining, chemical fibre and plastic production, a Puyang petrochemical industrial base focused on production of chemical fertilizer and ethylene, and a Nanyang petrochemical industrial base focused on high-density oil treatment and natural soda. 4. Make aluminium oxide-fine aluminium-aluminium materials-aluminium products an aluminium deep processing chain. As one of 20 projects being promoted by Henan Province, the Great Wall Aluminium Industry Corporation has an annual aluminium oxide production output of 1.2 million tons, aluminium electrolysis of 500,000 tons and 300,000 tons of aluminium materials. Among these, the first stage of a 200,000 ton aluminium oxide project at the Zhongzhou Aluminium Plant is now being completed. After completion, this project will be the biggest aluminium industry base in China. 5. Led by cement, glass, and advanced refractory materials in the construction materials industry, increase the pace of deep processing products by means of developing enterprises on an appropriate scale. Our hope is to establish industrial sectors which will be national leaders and correspond to our resource advantages. 2) Do a good job of adding value by deep processing in the sphere of "agriculture." Gross output depends on the depth to which agricultural products are processed, that is. the final form of the product. Therefore, agricultural development in Henan will depend on how deep is the processing of agricultural products. We regard the deep processing of agricultural products and by-products as a breakthrough point for vigorously developing Henan's economy, and around "agriculture" will do a good job in the light textile industry to realize good circulation of promoting industry through agriculture and building agriculture through industry; focus on doing well the deep processing of nine big series and 18 varieties of products, such as cotton-cotton processing-textiles-clothes, wheat-flour-fine foods, tobacco leaves-double curing-cigarettes, papermaking, winemaking, peanuts, corn, fruits and vegetables, comprehensive poultry and livestock processing, etc. We will gradually establish an industrial system for the deep processing and fine processing of agricultural products and by-products on a suitable scale and certain technological level. In this part of the work, we have attained certain achievements: Henan's monosodium glutamate and ham production are on a certain scale, with a very high sales rate in the domestic market. We have chosen to give priority in development to agriculture and its by-products, with food products, and to the textile industry as a leading industry, as well as bringing along other light industrial development such as papermaking, leather, medicine, etc. (3) Exploit our geographical superiority and develop our cultural resources. At present, we are making rapid progress in key infrastructural projects, with periodic achievements in such areas as transportation, telecommunications and tourism. Among 10 tourism projects for exploiting cultural resources, there is the original site of the "foolish old man who moved the mountain" in Jiyuan, Kuilichen in Tangyin, the "little Yellow River" channel excavation in the Yellow River Daguan, the reconstruction project of digging a channel according to the "Qingming Shanghe Picture" in Kaifeng. These are in general completed and opened to tourists, while the construction of other projects is in full swing. Construction of the Henan Provincial Museum, which will exhibit the cream of Henan's antiquities, will be completed and the museum operational this year. In order to bring about conversion from resource superiority to economic superiority, we must also adopt some practical measures, giving serious attention to implementation. In this regard, we plan to focus on giving force to the following five aspects: One: add force to deepen reform, insisting on maintaining the dominance of public ownership, vigorously developing the various economic component parts. Of Henan's more than 149.3 billion yuan gross industrial output value at the town level and above, individual industry and "three types of capital" industry in urban and suburban areas is less than 20 percent, so there is great potential here. According to what is required to develop the socialist market economy, we must persist in the principle of developing whatever suitable economic component sector that fits, bringing the enthusiasm of each sector into full play, pushing the provincial economy to a new level. Two: add force to improving the investment environment, expanding our opening toward the outside, with wide use of foreign capital, technology and human resources. At present, Henan is fully supporting construction of 10 major infrastructural projects, including Zhengzhou's new airport and a group of freeways. We are trying our best through environmental beautification and excellent service to provide the most favorable conditions for attracting foreign businessmen to invest in Henan in various forms, based on our resource superiority, and vigorously developing "three types of capital" enterprises. We are trying to exploit more than $1 billion in foreign capital in each of the last two years of the Eighth Five Year Plan. Three: add force to pushing scientific and technical progress, improving the technological content of the domestic economy a great deal. Liberate scientific and technological workers, accelerating the conversion of high and new technological achievements to productive force. Meanwhile, make a major effort to replace technology in industrial enterprises. During the final two years of the Eighth and Ninth Five Year Plans, we plan to choose about 50 enterprises (groups) whose industrial sales productive output value are expected soon to be over 500 million yuan, to conduct a name brand strategy, concentrating capital to support their technology replacement, extend their products chain, cultivate leading edge products, establish economic scale, and produce economic giants. By the year 2000, we hope to achieve an average annual new increase in industrial marketing production output value of over 2 billion yuan, with taxes on profits of more than 200,000 yuan in these enterprises. It is very possible that key projects in areas which are capital and technology intensive, such as petroleum, chemicals, deep processing of nonferrous metals, electricity, etc., will start construction with designs which select internationally advanced technical equipment from the late eighties and the nineties. Four: add force in amassing construction capital through multiple channels and forms, with a stress on key construction projects. In addition to vigorously exploiting foreign capital, vigorously develop a joint-stock system, taking fullest advantage of a variety of financial measures, such as stocks, bonds, etc., under the supervision of the state's policies. Take advantage of society's extra capital in multiple areas, at multiple levels, via multiple channels, in multiple forms and in multiple ways, accelerating construction of 20 development projects throughout the province, and increasing the staying power of economic development throughout the province. Five: add force in bilateral economic coordination, welcoming coastal provinces to invest and develop resources in Henan. With the rapid development of the coastal economy, there is a growing demand by basic products for energy and raw materials, an area in which Henan has an exclusive superiority. We have instituted bilateral favorable and beneficial policies, and warmly welcome coastal and economic developed areas to co-exploit our province's resources, promoting co-economic prosperity.
