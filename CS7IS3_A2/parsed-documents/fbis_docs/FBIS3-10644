The talks had the purpose of opening the Japanese market to U.S. exports. Goals and Planning This failure was a sign of Japanese annoyance at the U.S. "plan" for the Japanese market. U.S. officials, in the best tradition of the 1930's New Deal, requested planned participation in the Japanese market through previously fixed quantitative "goals." These "goals" do not accomplish anything but to destabilize Hosokawa's government, which was elected after a government promise to fight the large Japanese bureaucracy and its excessive planning. The "goals" only imply more planning and more paperwork for bureaucrats. U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor reacted against the Japanese rejection, proposing a list of harsh sanctions against Japan on 15 February. The truth is that these sanctions would be ineffective because Japanese firms have so many factories abroad that have become, in practice, immune to sanctions. Seeking Their Share Since then the U.S. Congress has brought back to the fore an old demand. Members of Congress called on Japan to buy more U.S. spare parts and automobiles, despite the fact that Detroit almost does not produce cars with the steering wheel on the right. Congress also is revising the "Super 301" provision applicable to U.S. foreign trade laws and through which the government can impose unilateral reprisals against other countries' "discriminatory practices." The Americans not only reacted against Hosokawa's NO, but also against the Japanese refusal -- which followed the NO -- to respect a previous agreement giving the U.S. consortium Motorola a larger share of the Japanese telecommunications market. The Real Problem These are, however, only the symptoms of a much larger problem: the negative U.S. trade balance with Japan. In effect, in January alone, the U.S. trade balance with Japan showed a $6.1 billion deficit, 17 percent more than last year. The overall Japanese trade balance surplus with the United States now stands at $50 billion. In a fascinating article called "Let us play geo-monopoly: diplomacy is to occupy your time with other nations' affairs" (THE NEW YORK TIMES 30/Jan/94), Thomas L. Friedman points out the Clinton's administration's great concern with the insufficient Japanese purchase of U.S. exports and tells how U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen asked the Japanese Finance Ministry to not only reduce taxes to stimulate consumption of "U.S.-made products," but also requested a commitment not to increase the IGV [general sales tax] for two years. Geo-Monopoly According to Friedman, U.S. Treasury officials are fully conscious that those measures also will imply a destabilization of Hosokawa's economic policies, but have decided to maintain the pressure. Friedman says that for the present U.S. administration, "all foreign policies must be economic policies and all economic policies must be foreign policies." Therefore, this new diplomacy does not stop, as in the past, at other countries' independent and sovereign borders, but on the contrary, it begins right there and sinks deeply in the social and economic system of other nations. This new policy, baptized as "geo-monopoly" by Friedman, changes the traditional definition of who is a friend and who an enemy in the international arena. Friedman describes how for U.S. Treasury officials "our enemy there is bureaucracy" (in Japan). Polyglot Joke Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen now are articulating an offensive against Japan under the flag of this new policy. Their strategy includes, according to Friedman, "to deliberately cause a political crisis (...) to pressure Japanese leaders." The Japanese, conscious of this fact, say, half-jokingly and-half seriously, that "the United States is the only opposition party here." If political crises are now just tools serving U.S. economic diplomatic purposes, then these "jokes" will be sung in many languages in the future.
