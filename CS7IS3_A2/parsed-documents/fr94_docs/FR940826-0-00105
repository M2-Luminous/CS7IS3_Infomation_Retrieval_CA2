FR940826-0-00105 FR940826-0-00018 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Kolesar, Director, Program Policy Division, Office of Affordable Housing Programs, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2470, TDD (202) 708&hyph;2565. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2501&hyph;0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection requirements. II. Background The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701&hyph;12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). Implementing regulations for the HOME Program are at 24 CFR part 92. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) included a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. These amendments were implemented in rules published on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 60960), June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130), and April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18626). The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDRA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994) included an additional number of amendments to the HOME Program. The following discussion, arranged according to the sequence of the MHPDRA sections, summarizes the changes made to the HOME program regulation in this interim rule. Section 201 of MHPDRA amends section 104(2) of NAHA to allow governors to designate State agencies or instrumentalities of the State (e.g., housing finance agencies or housing authorities) to administer HOME Program funds. Prior to this change, a subrecipient agreement was required between the State and its instrumentality to administer the HOME funds. This amendment provides greater flexibility to designate such an organization to run the program and the definition of State in §92.2 is amended accordingly. Section 202 of MHPDRA amends section 214(1) of NAHA which required that at least 90 percent of the HOME funds invested in rental housing be for units occupied by families below 60 percent of median income. This amendment changes the requirement to say that at least 90 percent of the units assisted, and in the case of tenant-based rental assistance, the families assisted be below 60 percent of median income. This amendment, as implemented through §92.216, will simplify the targeting requirement since it is easier to count units than funds invested. Section 203 of MHPDRA amends section 215(b) of NAHA in two ways. The first change is the elimination of the ``first-time'' designation for homebuyers. The HCDA 1992 amendment broadened the eligibility of ``first-time'' homebuyers to include almost all low-income homebuyers. By eliminating the designation, participating jurisdictions will not have to document the statutory category under which income-eligible homebuyers qualify. The change will also conform the HOME Program to the CDBG Program, which does not restrict homebuyer assistance to first-time homebuyers. The second change would permit participating jurisdictions to use funds recaptured from the sale of homebuyer units for any eligible HOME cost. The provision formerly limited the use of the recaptured funds to assistance for additional first-time homebuyers. This change will effect the use of current and future recaptured funds. Conforming changes have been made to §§92.2, 92.61(b)(4), 92.150(b)(4), 92.205(a)(1), 92.206(b), 92.214(a)(7), 92.254(a), and 92.354 to implement the new homebuyer requirements. Section 204 of MHPDRA amends section 220(a) of NAHA to effect a flat 25 percent match on all funds drawn down for HOME projects or tenant-based rental assistance. This provision eliminates the 30 percent match of funds drawn down for new construction. This new, lower match rate will be applied to all Fiscal Year 1993 funds currently expended or future year funds drawn down for eligible HOME activities, and §92.218 has been changed accordingly. The new environmental provisions make three amendments to section 288 of NAHA which are implemented for the HOME Program by §92.352, for Subpart M_HOME Funds for Indian Tribes at §92.633, and also by revisions to HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 58, which govern the assumption of environmental responsibilities by recipients under the HOME program and other programs with similar statutory authority for recipient environmental reviews. The first amendment provides for assumption of HUD's environmental review responsibilities by all jurisdictions receiving assistance under the HOME Program, not just participating jurisdictions, as well as Indian tribes and insular areas. The second amendment to Section 288 makes HOME environmental review procedures consistent with the procedures under the Community Development Block Grant and McKinney Act homeless assistance programs with regard to States' responsibilities. Where a State makes funds available to a unit of general local government, the State would perform the release of funds function otherwise performed by HUD, and local governments would assume the responsibility for performing environmental reviews. To the extent that the State would be using the HOME funds directly, HUD would approve the request for release of funds.
