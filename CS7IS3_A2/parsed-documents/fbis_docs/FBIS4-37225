I warmly welcome our brothers and neighbors, the leaders of the African-Muslim countries: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in the same manner as we welcomed our friend Museveni, the Ugandan president, and before him our brother Deby, the president of Chad. The Libyan people welcome and appreciate such solidarity from their brothers because it will consolidate the Libyan people's position in its confrontation with the conspiracy led by three colonialist-Western countries. [passage omitted] The Libyan people feels comfortable after the effort it extended to the neighboring fraternal peoples and deems that the patriots have assumed power in these countries and the agents have fallen. The Libyan people has undertaken numerous responsibilities toward these peoples. The victory of the will of the peoples of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, and the consolidation of freedom and democracy....[pauses] On the other hand, from the viewpoint of the Western imperialist countries, what the Libyan people were doing was considered support for international terrorism, and considered the training camps for those leaders and peoples, who were carrying out a liberation war, as terrorist camps. This pretext has now been exposed, and this Western propaganda, which they used so frequently in the aggression against Libya, has fallen. But, it seems that the colonialists will not let the Third World achieve stability and build itself in order to progress. After these national movements won in these countries, we see that the colonialist countries work toward creating trouble and problems for them. The material evidence that condemn the countries of Western colonialism are obvious. They accuse us of all untrue accusations and refuse to be confronted with the facts that condemn them. Regrettably, this will not lead to an understanding between us. We all know that these peoples now, in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, who aspire for stability and construction, are today the target of a new plot. The role of the old type of colonialism has been concretely confirmed. This implicit and flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of these peoples contradicts the statements and declarations made by these countries. In the past they accused Libya of being behind the destabilization of African states. Yet, it transpired that Libya was behind the cause of liberation and people's democracy. Now, the very states who used to accuse Libya are the ones who are trying fervently to destabilize the African continent. These are inhuman ethics and a flagrant injustice. The Western states are constantly pursuing these states; they are trying to sow instability in them; they deny them a chance to prove themselves. Psychologically speaking, we feel as if we are facing groups who are enemies of humanity. We are facing a mentality used to arrogance and the enslavement of others. This is not an accusation, but a reality. Who on earth can belittle a person who happens to have a black skin? Who in the world introduced the words racial discrimination to the dictionary? They are the Western colonialist states. Regrettably, we are facing peoples who are defying the whole of mankind. We are in confrontation against arrogant states, who impose their wrath against us; they use a veto against our future. When we raise our voice and resist, they accuse us of being warmongers, and against peace. What kind of peace are they talking about? They are talking about surrender and that Third World people should surrender without making a stand. We have decided, nonetheless, to resist. A fact that they must understand. Africa should not be destined to face poverty and misery until doomsday merely because of its skin, which was God's creation. They have begun a new flagrant interference. Regrettably they have meddled with the United Nations, which used to be the refuge of peoples seeking peace and protection. They have torn up the UN Charter. They had no right to tear up a charter that was written by the people. They have trodden on international law; they have no right to do so. It is an international law and not an internal one. They have been using the United Nations for a purpose completely different from the one that was intended for it. They are using the United Nations as a vehicle for neo-colonialism. Before, they used the League of Nations to impose their protectorate on the colonized Third World countries. As soon as they fiddled with it the League of Nations fell. Today, the Western powers are accused of working seriously for the fall of the United Nations. The best proof is the fact that they have been using the United Nations for their manipulation; they have transformed it into an instrument in their hands. They have trodden on its charter. Today, they are carrying out their own work in the name of the United Nations. They are using the United Nations outside its Charter. Thus, they have decided to kill the United Nations. This attitude is a serious one that can be very harmful to people of the world. This means that we will face a new form of chaos. The world will be transformed into a jungle; and the Western states will be responsible for the outcome. What is happening these days in a number of Third World countries is clear proof of what I have just said. They believe that the Third World is made up of children and duped people; this is in addition to their inferior attitude toward Africa; they think that the African people are mere gorillas living in a jungle; they do not believe that the inhabitants of Africa are human beings. Even Dr. Barnard, the heart surgeon who succeeded in performing the first heart transplant operation used to hold this way of thinking; i.e., black people are not human beings, consequently, one should carry out tests on them unreservedly. Consequently, he carried out numerous tests on black people, like the test performed in the West on mice and rabbits. After having killed a large number of people and destroyed their hearts, he succeeded in perfecting the right heart transplant technique. All this stems from their attitude of inferiority toward the black race. They think that we do not understand this. Their behavior is aimed at undermining our will, our desire to live, and our right to our land. Now, they are interfering in the internal affairs of every state; they believe that we are children and duped to the extent that they create problems, then they claim that they have to send military forces to solve these problems. We are aware that they are the ones who created these problems so that they have a pretext to intervene and solve them; they think that we are naive and ignorant and imbeciles to be fooled by this game. Their mentality is still that of Vasco de Gama; they think that Africa still resembles the one discovered by Vasco de Gama when he gave Africans shells and beads and took raw material and land in return. All Western states are like Vasco de Gama; they share the same mentality as that of Vasco de Gama; they still perceive and consider us as the same people who were discovered by Vasco de Gama. These are the matters that incite revolution, and force us to accept the challenge. Why do they not leave Mali alone, and stop their interference? They should let this poor country rebuild itself and live. Why do they not leave Niger and Chad alone? All the suffering of these countries is due to this policy. They must understand that while we meet at this level we are fully aware of their conspiracies. It is our right to fight and we have decided to fight so that they respect us and recognize that we are people like them, at least like them, even if we believe that we are better than them because we do not commit the acts they are committing. Therefore, our mentality is more noble than theirs. We do not have the mentality of absurdity, human disdain, race, and color segregation. They take pleasure in the suffering of the African peoples and laugh at the backwardness of the African that they imposed on them in the first place. They consider Africa as a jungle, a place for hunting, a source for raw materials, and a garden where you can pick fruits, but they consider its inhabitants as gorillas. Thus is the Western culture that led to colonialism, and world wars, and it is the one we are facing nowadays under various names. In Libya, they confronted us in the Gulf of Sirte. When the world condemned them and this problem was over, they invented a problem called al-Rabitah. When it became clear that al-Rabitah was a pharmaceutical plant, and the world condemned them and showed solidarity with Libya, they created the so-called Lockerbie issue. In this context, the Libyan people hails your stance during the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit meeting. The Libyan people hails its brothers and neighbors, as well as all the African leaders who stood with the Libyan people. The world condemned them in the Gulf of Sirte and al-Rabitah cases, and is now condemning them in the Lockerbie case. Despite all this, we hear astonishing things. They say that Libya is defying the international community. Who is defying the international community? For them, the international community means the Western colonialist countries. As for the others, they are not at the level of the international community. The conspiratorial memorandum handed by the United States, France, and Britain to the United Nations was considered as the will of the international community. They ignore the will of Africa. What do they have to say about the OAU summit meeting held yesterday in Tunis that expressed support to Libya and the proposals it made. Are the African countries considered out of the international community? The Nonaligned Movement expressed support for Libya, the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] expressed support for Libya. The Arab League expressed support for Libya. The OAU adopted the Arab League resolution, in addition to the peoples, groups, parties, and organizations throughout the whole world. Despite all this, should we listen to them tomorrow, we will hear the same broken record: Libya is defying the will of the international community. In fact, they are the ones who are isolated. They are the ones who are isolated by the will of the international community. This will is now on the Libyan side. The international community is now expressing full support and sympathy for Libya, and condemns the three Western countries. Despite all this, we can still hear insolent statements full of disdain to the international community. This is the stubborn mentality that we are facing. We recently heard that a Palestinian person admitted responsibility for causing the explosion of the Pan Am aircraft. He made this confession before a court. The day after, the West denied this confession. The world was shocked. How could this happen? Yesterday, we were looking for whoever was behind the Pan Am explosion. We say to the world: Do not be surprised, for the reason is very simple. This Palestinian is poor. He does not have millions to compensate the families of the victims. Therefore, how could one charge him for this act? Libya, however, is rich. It can pay damages. So, one must accuse it. This is the reason the world has been laughing at this: How can one admit [responsibility for this act] only to hear the West tell him: No, no, it is not you. As long as the issue is one of compensation, and so that Libya rids the world of this problem and prevents respectable presidents coming all the way from their countries to Libya on foot [as heard], because of this unjust resolution....[pauses] The world is tired of all the fuss made about Libya. The embargo on Libya has ruined many countries and even the West has lost out because it is stupid. In order to rid the world of this problem, since the issue is about compensation, Libya does not object to the creation of a compensation fund, for this would be a humanitarian action. This fund would be used to compensate the victims' families, including those of Lockerbie, just for the sake of the world and in order to rid the world of this tension. There are families of Libyan victims who were killed by America and Britain. However, the Libyans are perhaps rich and may not need any compensation. There are also Iranian families whose relatives were killed by America when the U.S. Navy shot down the civilian aircraft aboard which they were flying. It could be that Iran is rich and would not want any compensation. There are also the victims of the Italian airliner shot down by the U.S. fleet over Ustica. There are the Lockerbie victims and maybe the Americans and the British are poor and would like damages. We do not object to the creation of a compensation fund; and let us erase the confessions of that Palestinian and let us tell him: Keep quiet, we know that you carried out the Pan Am operation but you have not got any money. This is a good solution. The Libyan people are once again, I believe, doubly happy. Once because their efforts with the neighboring and sister states would not have been wasted. Nationalist regimes were established in Egypt [as heard], Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Tunisia. Nationalist regimes and popular regimes dear to Libya were established in these countries. These efforts were considered as aimed at destabilizing Africa and were regarded as terrorism, but the result was the triumph of the nationalist regimes. When we were working against the lackey regimes they told us: You were destabilizing Africa. Now we have united with nationalist regimes they tell us: This is unity, you have imperial ambitions. They have been stubbornly against us in both cases. [passage omitted] I have one remark to make before I conclude my speech, it is about our sisterly Rwanda. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not the first catastrophe that has shaken Rwanda. We still remember with sadness and bitterness the tragic massacres of 1959 and 1973. Today we are witnessing fresh massacres. I am afraid that such ugly massacres will be repeated. We should, therefore, accept the bad in order to avoid the worse. We are aware that the Tutsi tribes immigrated to this region hundreds of years ago. They might have come from Arab countries. Problems began to emerge between the original people and those coming from outside. Like between Palestinians and Israelis and whites and blacks in South Africa. The situation in Rwanda is, however, a particular one and should not be taken as an example for other countries. Regrettably, the solution I am about to propose is a bad one, but it is better than the worse. If we want to stop the massacres and prevent their recurrence forever, we must separate the two races, the Tutsi and the Hutu. What is now called the National Front is in fact the frontier of the Tutsis, and the so-called government is for the Hutus. International forces should now separate the two sides. The separation should be final between them. In fact, this is the only solution to prevent these tragedies from recurring. Dear brothers, I thank you for this visit and this meeting that provided us with an opportunity to talk about these important issues, which we discussed today and yesterday. I once more welcome you in your country and among your kinsfolk. We are your natural ally, and you can rely on this ally which will never disappoint you. The struggle continues.
