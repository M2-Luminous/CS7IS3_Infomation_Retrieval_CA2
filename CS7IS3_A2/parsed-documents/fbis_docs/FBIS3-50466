FBIS3-50466 "drlat001_c_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Jan 1994 MEXICO Radio Reports Situation PA0201170094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 1512 GMT 2 Jan 94 PA0201170094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] The most important event featured today in Mexico City's newspapers is the following: An armed group, mostly Indians, the self-styled Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] -- linked with the Procup [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party] and the Poor People's Party, according to state officials -- violently seized on the morning of 1 January the municipal offices in San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas, with a toll of at least 11 dead and dozens of injured -- three in clashes sustained with public forces -- according to unofficial sources. According reports from state officials, the Indians -- according to witnesses, there were about 2,200 of them -- were armed with AR-15 rifles, .22 caliber rifles, and shotguns, and they simultaneously stormed the five municipalities. Given the situation, the government secretariat warned it cannot justify the fact that fair social demands, for which there exists a willingness to provide a solution, be used as a pretext to violate legal order. A Government Ministry communique said the government is urging these groups to act wisely, recant, and establish negotiations within a legal framework. Meanwhile, state officials called these actions a violent provocation. They also ordered public security forces to dissuade the armed groups, making it possible to seek a solution to their demands, which have yet to be stated, through dialogue and legal means. Given the situation, the bishops of Chiapas State issued an appeal to the EZLN forces to accept the bishops' mediation in an effort to restore harmony and social tranquility in the municipalities involved in the conflict. Furthermore, it is appropriate to mention that contacts are being maintained between federal government officials and state officials in an effort to quickly resolve the situation. The declaration of war issued by the Sandinist National Liberation Army, excuse me, the EZLN, to the Mexican Federal Army asks the nation's legislative and judicial branches to strive to restore the nation's legality and stability. The EZLN is asking international organizations and the International Red Cross to supervise and regulate the clashes that its forces are waging to protect the civilian population. The declaration of war rejects any links to drug traffickers, narcoguerrillas, or any other groups when referring to the struggle waged by the EZLN, which has ordered its military forces to advance toward the country's capital, defeat the Mexican Federal Army, and allow the liberated people to democratically elect their own administrative authorities. This is, in short, what is currently taking place in five municipalities in Chiapas State -- San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas -- where the self- proclaimed EZLN violently seized the municipal offices and where there is a toll of 11 dead and dozens wounded. A report issued early this morning by NOTIMEX reports that, after stating the need to contribute their efforts to prevent a possible confrontation involving the people of Chiapas, the bishops of Chiapas agreed to take part as mediators to restore harmony and peace in the municipalities involved in the conflict. A communique issued by the diocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez and Tapachula, Chiapas State, stated that, in an effort to create conditions that will allow a fruitful dialogue, we issue an appeal to the so-called EZLN, urging it to accept four points. The bishops request an end to violence, respect for people's lives, the release of kidnapped people, and they urge them to put down their weapons, respect the law and human rights, and to take part in a dialogue to resolve social problems. The bishops' document mentions that, in the event that their proposal is accepted, within the next 48 hours the bishops promise to ask the government to establish an office to handle social problems in the region. The bishops said they have been trying to contact the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, since early this morning. Their efforts have failed so far, but they add they can count on the solidarity of this diocese's pastor. The bishops of Chiapas note that their agreement to serve as mediators was prompted by requests they received from different social groups in Chiapas to search for a solution to the problems that have arisen in San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano.
