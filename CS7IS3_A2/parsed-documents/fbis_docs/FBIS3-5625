The two ministries said they will prevent the major contractor from being offered public works projects for up to three months. Saitama and Fukui are among the prefectural governments which will bar the company from their projects for five months, while Karatsu in Saga Prefecture, southern Japan, will take the same measure for six months. Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama was rearrested Tuesday for his suspected involvement in allegedly bribing former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura with 10 million yen. This is the first time the Construction Ministry has suspended a company from public works projects in relation to the alleged bribery of a Diet member. Kajima is one of eight major general contractors at the center of investigations into a series of bribery scandals involving politicians and construction firms. On Wednesday morning, prosecutors raided Kajima's head office in Tokyo in connection with Nakamura's alleged acceptance of the 10 million yen bribe from the construction giant. The raids covered more than 30 locations, including the homes of Kajima Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa and President Akira Miyazaki. On Tuesday, prosecutors rearrested Kiyoyama for allegedly passing the bribe to Nakamura, a House of Representatives member, for his help in heading off a Fair Trade Commission criminal complaint over a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama Prefecture in 1992. Prosecutors are asking the Diet to remove Nakamura's parliamentary immunity to allow his arrest. Despite the punitive action against Kajima, the central Japan city of Nagano signed a contract with a joint venture led by the scandal-tainted company Wednesday for the construction of the 1998 Winter Olympics speed skating venue, city officials said. Nagano city officials approved the pact with the Kajima-led joint venture because its sanctions against Kajima were irrelevant since Kiyoyama was not a representative of the firm at the time of arrest.
