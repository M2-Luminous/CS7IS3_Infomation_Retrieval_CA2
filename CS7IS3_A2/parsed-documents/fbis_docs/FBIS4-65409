The moment the president finished signing the 25 appointment decrees, he heard the first sounds of mortar fire. It came from the direction of National Alliance [AN] headquarters, and the trigger was pulled by Maurizio Gasparri, one of [AN leader] Gianfranco Fini's generals. He said nonchalantly: "Scalfaro was very worried about the Italian Social Republic, which ended 50 years ago. We, however, are very concerned and very worried about the Sisde [Intelligence and Military Security Service], which is much more currently at the center of judicial developments. Furthermore, time will tell whether Scalfaro is as beyond reproach as many believe him to be, or whether, as interior minister, he too, like others, was implicated in the scandal." In Fini's MSI [Italian Social Movement], it is Gasparri who sets the line every day with his editorial in IL SECOLO. So his recent interview marks the end of the cease-fire between the new government majority and the chief of state. Its tone gives no room for uncertainties, because the National Alliance deputy even hints at problems for the president with the judiciary: "The fact is that the chief of state enjoys legal immunity only with respect to acts performed in the exercise of his duties. The Sisde affair, however, does not concern these duties." So according to Gasparri, Scalfaro could be accused and tried over the scandal of the intelligence service funds. This was made clear by MSI member Teodoro Buontempo, known for his plain speaking: "Scalfaro must go, because he has everything to lose if he remains a prisoner in his own palace." [passage omitted] Former President Francesco Cossiga has sided with Scalfaro: "The president's strong intervention [sending a letter to Berlusconi] was correct and legitimate. I approve of and agree with his action, and he personally enjoys my esteem, my friendship, and my support." Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio agrees that he was right: "Overall, I judge it a very opportune act at this stage in Italy's political life," because the presence of the National Alliance "is prompting anxiety" abroad. "The aim was to issue as clear and as strong a signal as possible to the international community and to the national community on three issues of particular importance from the viewpoint of internal and international relations."
