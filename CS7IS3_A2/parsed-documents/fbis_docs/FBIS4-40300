The Russia's Choice faction will urge the president to recall the decree, one of this faction's leaders, Doctor of Law Boris Zolotukhin told Interfax. Although the importance of combating crime is not in question, the decree is at variance with the Constitution, the Criminal Code and international human rights legislation, approved by Russia. Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party's faction Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that the decree did not cause any objections. He noted, however, that it would not work fully if it was not supplemented with a State Duma resolution. He announced that his faction was drafting a resolution which would reduce the circulation of cash to the minimum by introducing credit cards, impose a state of emergency in individual regions, set up temporary courts for emergency trials which would be granted the right to execute the ring-leaders of criminal groupings without trial or due process, close major cities and banish foreigners from them, and close the state border in a number of regions. Leader of the Communist Party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov stated that the decree "grossly violated the current laws and neglected the Federal Assembly." Member of the New Regional Policy group, Vice Chairman of the Committee for International Affairs Aleksandr Dzasokhov told Interfax that the time had come to intensify the campaign against crime. "However, it must not be based on mass violations of human rights," he said. He believes that the president's representative must make a proposal in the State Duma on amending the current legislation for stepping up measures to combat crime. A leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Sergey Stankevich, said that whereas the importance of a resolute campaign against crime was indisputable, the methods listed in the decree were quite alarming. The decree gives everyone direct administrative access to commercial information, which goes against the constitutional norms, he said. Leader of the Russian Way group Sergey Baburin said that the decree would give rise to administrative terror. He told Interfax that the decree neither defended human rights nor created mechanisms for combating crime. He also noted that he welcomed the State Duma's decision to include the discussion of the decree in the agenda of the next session. Leader of the Democratic Party faction Nikolay Travkin said he would welcome the most ruthless measures to combat crime. If we fail to cardinally change the situation today, tomorrow human rights will be violated everywhere and more seriously than in the decree, he said. The president's decree is an anti-constitutional act which is at variance with other Russian laws, Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for Security Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist Party's faction) told Interfax. The guarantor of the Constitution, the president violates the Constitution, he said. He also urged Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko to respond to such violations of the law.
