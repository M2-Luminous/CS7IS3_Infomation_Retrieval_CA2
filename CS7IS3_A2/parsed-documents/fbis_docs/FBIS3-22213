The authors considered it to be their task to point out the primary causes of the ecological blind alley -- the actions of the economic ministries during the years of the ``great construction projects'' that destroyed the environment (primarily, the activities of Minvodkhoz [Ministry of Water Management] when the project for diverting the northern and Siberian rivers was being created). They also see their task in revealing the facts in the history that has led us down the ecological blind alley. Many readers are in total agreement with the authors of the article and write to us that ``Minvodkhoz, together with certain scientists, inflicted colossal damage on our country. That damage consists of the completely wasted tens of billions of rubles from the state budget at that time; the ruination of agriculture in many regions where millions of hectares of land that had been `improved' by water reclamation were written off; and the party leaders' crimes that they committed hand in hand with the people in water management.'' They also write, ``The water management partocracy is an as yet unrevealed and gloomy page in our economic and political history, and the role of the scientists in this secret system is a unique phenomenon that, sooner or later, will be deciphered.'' At the same time, Candidate of Technical Sciences V. Aleksenko takes a negative attitude toward the academicians' pessimistic position. She feels that ``the resolution of the problem of the ecological crisis must be a party program of the social-democratic movement at the present-day stage. The way out of the ecological crisis has a concrete and accessible solution.'' But she ends her letter by saying, ``Despite all the offensive words said by me with respect to the authors of the article `Environment of Extinction,' their criticism of the state ecological service, and their brave opposition to the official structures, evoke a tremendous amount of respect and contribute to the awareness of social and ecological tasks.'' However, in their article the academicians do not simply ``oppose the official structures.'' In their article they give the names of specific people with whom, over the course of many years, they discussed the river diversion project. And that, naturally, evokes the sharp objections of those who were mentioned. In particular, the employees of Ministry of Ecology. It is necessary to speak separately about a letter to the editor that was writtebjects n by F. V. Voropayev, corresponding member of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], who since 1977 has headed the Scientific Council for Problems of the Caspian Sea. He considers the article to be direct libel against himself, his council, and the AN [Academy of Sciences] Institute of Water Problems, where he was the director until recently. He demands the publication of his reply. We are printing it in abridged form. ``The statement concerning the 'assimilation' of millions of rubles by the council is an insinuation that is intended for the uninformed readers. The council is a public organization that is not financed by the state. The council has not sold and does not sell information on the Caspian to Iran. The Russian Federation has a treaty of scientific-technical cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with which certain joint work is carried out. At such time each contracting side makes its own expenditures. No one has ever transferred funds, or transfers them now. This is firmly established in the cooperation documents... Other ridiculous assertions are those stating that the scientists at the Institute of Water Problems were the initiators, originators, and developers of the projects to divert part of the river runoff (emphasis added). In particular, this is attested to by the decisions of USSR Gosplan's State Expert Commission for reviewing the TEO [technical and economic substantiation] of the diversion of part of the runoff of the northern rivers to the drainage area of the Volga River. I was the deputy chairman of the commission to review the TEO, and a number of scientists from the Institute of Water Problems were members. According to our recommendations, the TEO was declined in 1980... As a result of what has been stated, I demand an immediate refutation of the article and the accusations from the newspaper's editorial office and the authors for having insulted the honor and dignity of a scientist and citizen. Otherwise I shall be forced to take court action.'' The editorial office has acquainted the authors of the article ``Environment of Extinction'' with the objections made by Corresponding Member G. V. Voropayev. In response to his request they provide the following answer. In particular, concerning the council's monetary operations: ``We must admit the insufficient precision of the formulations addressed to the Council on Problems of the Caspian Sea,'' the academicians write. ``The fact of the matter is that the Scientific Council on Problems of the Caspian Sea was created in the Institute of Water Problems, of the Academy of Sciences; it was financed by that institute; it consisted chiefly of its employees; and was headed by the director of that institute, V. Voropayev. It is therefore difficult to separate the activities of the council from the activities of the institute. It is possible that certain shortcomings addressed to G. V. Voropayev as the council chairman should pertain to his activities as the director of the institute.'' The authors go on to mention the history of the river diversion and, in this regard, they are completely incapable of agreeing with G. V. Voropayev's version. They prove, by quotations taken from a number of works over a period of many years, that it was precisely he who was the initiator of the diversion project, but that he was covered by the efforts of other individuals. In 1976 G. V. Voropayev wrote to VODNYYE RESURSY magazine (No. 3, pp 4-6): ``It is proposed to carry out the water supply of the southern rayons at the expense of the more complete use of local resources and the bringing in of the runoff of the country's northern slope (drainage areas of the Kara, White, and Barents seas), that is, at the expense of territorial redistribution on a large scale.'' He emphasized that ``the unity of water management ties on a countrywide scale is becoming especially obvious in the version of runoff redistribution that was developed by the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Water Problems.'' We have been sent a Xerox copy of the book by G. V. Voropayev and A. A. Bostandzhoglo, ``Problema izyatiya, perebroski i raspredeleniya chasti stoka sibirskikh rek dlya rayonov Zapadnoy Sibiri, Urala, Sredney Azii i Kazakhstana'' [Problem of Withdrawing, Diverting, and Distributing Part of the Runoff of Siberian Rivers For Rayons of West Siberia, the Urals, Central Asia, and Kazakhstan]. The publisher is USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Water Problems, 1984 (For Official Use Only). In these ``closed'' works we read on page 40, ``The development of the national economy determines the desirability of constructing a system among drainage areas for diverting the runoff of the Danube River into the Dniepr drainage area; the carrying out of a series of operations to divert part of the runoff of the northern rivers into the Volga drainage area; and the construction of the Volga-Urals and Volga-Don canals to use the diverted runoff in the Northern Caucasus for irrigation. Scientific research and feasibility studies that have been conducted have substantiated the desirability of diverting part of the runoff of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia and Kazakhstan in the volume of the first phase (27.2 cubic kilometers).'' The chapter entitled ``Conclusion'' states even more decisively: ``Computations have demonstrated the economic effectiveness of the measures being considered for diverting part of the runoff of Siberian rivers and the profitability of the complex within the normative limits.'' The authorship of the diversion project also does not cause any doubts. The statement is made that ``the approval of the TEO of the Asian diversion and the scientific research on the problem has become a stage that has summed up the results of many years of scientific-research and surveying-design work that was carried out by the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Water Problems and Soyuzgiprovodkhoz [All-Union State Planning, Surveying and Scientific Research Institute of Water Management Construction].'' In their letter to the editor, the authors of the article ``Environment of Extinction'' recall that, ``On 18 July 1986, at a session of the presidium of USSR Sovmin [Council of Ministers], success was achieved in stopping the insane work to divert the runoff. N. F. Vasilyev, minister of water management, considered the diversion of the runoff to be the only measure for saving the Caspian and the Aral Sea and a chief measure for developing agriculture, and he demanded the immediate expansion of earth-moving operations also on the Ob River and the area between the Volga and the Sukhona rivers. G. V. Voropayev defended the project even more fiercely than the minister did. Stenographic reports still exist, and there are many witnesses to this who are still alive. But G. V. Voropayev still did not calm down. Soon his article `The Project Will Live' appeared in newspapers, and in 1988, in an article in VODNYYE RESURSY (No. 1, pp 5-13) that was written jointly with D. Ya. Radkevich, he asserted the very same position.'' Meanwhile G. V. Voropayev considers specifically his constancy to be ethical. ``I do not change,'' he writes, ``my opinions to fit the political situation. I continue to work as a scientist on the same problems that I did ten years, and 40 years, ago.'' In addition, he assumes that ``Environment of Extinction'' was conceived as a personal attack: ``The article was timed for a period when the nomination of candidates for election as members of the Academy of Science was coming to an end. Similar statements by the same authors did their `job' in the past, as was noted during the discussion of these questions at the Russian Academy of Sciences. That statement also 'started things working' today. At a number of official agencies that statement served as guidance during the making of decisions pertaining to the activities of our collective. The authors hope that it will continue to 'do its job.' S. P. Zalygin and A. L. Yanshin for many years asserted their impunity with regard to their libelous statements. The high positions occupied by both of them protected them against criticism and responsibility. But those protections are collapsing, and now it is becoming more obvious who is who.'' Nevertheless, in our view, it is currently important not to delve into the problem of ``who is who,'' but to recall that, in the history of the river diversion, the final dot has been placed by the nation's powerful movement that has banned the disfigurement of the land. People have wanted, and want now, to have an environment in which they live, rather than become extinct. Therein lies the crux of the problem.
