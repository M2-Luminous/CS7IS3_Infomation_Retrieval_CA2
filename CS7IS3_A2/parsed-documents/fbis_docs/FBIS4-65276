As an opponent of Maastricht, however, the Alliance 90/Greens top candidate for the European Parliament [EP] elections on 12 June sees this treaty as a symbol of an undemocratic European Union [EU] that helps rather than hinders right-wing nationalists. Eight German Greens went to Strasbourg in 1989 as members of the European Parliament and two have since joined other parliamentary groups. Karl-Otto Sattler spoke with 39-year-old Claudia Roth. [Sattler] You and other Green members of the European Parliament have filed an appeal in Karlsruhe for a constitutional review of the Maastricht Treaty--like the nationalist and anti-European Manfred Brunner. Is it a comfortable feeling to be in such company? [Roth] I was never in league with Mr. Brunner. We filed a constitutional appeal against Maastricht because we are for Europe; Brunner did so because he is against Europe and because he wants the national option. I am passionately for Europe but I am equally convinced that this Europe cannot be achieved with a European Union that is thoroughly undemocratic. For me, Maastricht is a symbol of that kind of undemocratic structure. I fear that this helps rather than hinders right-wing nationalists. [Sattler] It is mostly criticism of the EU--of the EU's environmental, asylum, and transportation policies--that is forthcoming from the Greens. Do you, in fact, have a positive, pro-European perspective? [Roth] In a time of renationalization of politics, it is our job to present a European option in contrast to these tendencies. It has to be a democratic option, however. At issue, for example, is a true separation of powers--a fundamental element of democracy that is not built into the EU. Moreover, our understanding of Europe extends beyond the EU; our concern is to overcome the division of Europe as a whole--a task that is urgent following the collapse of the former East Bloc. [Sattler] What kind of politics have the Greens engaged in thus far in Strasbourg: Principled opposition or realpolitik? [Roth] Both, and that is not at all a contradiction. In many areas we have introduced a fundamentally different approach and formulated alternatives based on different principles. In our case, for example, the debate about an integrated ecology policy is very much further advanced than it is in the Bundestag. We have also engaged in realpolitik by introducing amendments on the most diverse subjects. [Sattler] Were there specific instances of success? [Roth] We have had some successes. Caution is advised, to be sure, so that one does not get caught up too much in this farce. If someone thinks that he can be a real parliamentary representative here, he is, in my view, falling for a stage production. A European Union theater piece is being quickly staged and that is dangerous. For me, a success is when, for example, after preliminary work with the other parliamentary groups, we pass a very good resolution in a current affairs debate on the situation in Turkey that then mobilizes the public there and helps individual people. Of course, as a member of the European Parliament I cannot draft any real laws, but you have to be aware of that in advance. I also function a little bit as a kind of extraparliamentary opposition in a parliament that is not very democratic. [Sattler] What are the Greens' main points of emphasis in the election campaign? Who is your opponent? [Roth] Our opponents in the election campaign are all those who fool around with rightist, right-wing extremist, and racist ideologies. We fight for a Europe in which all citizens have the same rights. We oppose a Europe with ethnic hierarchies. We commit ourselves to the democratization of the EU. And we want to overcome the division of Europe as a whole: East Europe must be included. Then there is an issue that no longer seems to be very attractive but that is very important for us--the ecological restructuring of industrial society--and starting at the European level. [Sattler] Elections for the European Parliament function for the most part as elections in which voters send a message regarding domestic political issues--something which the Greens can also profit from. Will people vote on 12 June for your party for reasons of European policy at all? [Roth] I hope very much so. But you are right, that is a real sore spot. As a matter of fact, it is hardly about Europe at all. Basically, it is a kind of preliminary Bundestag election. In the campaign, I am striving to have our party--our clients--deal with Europe. Even among Greens people often still persist in thinking along national lines. Many citizens have no idea of the far-reaching influence of European policy on every individual. That is why we say: Concern yourselves with Europe, take Europe seriously!
