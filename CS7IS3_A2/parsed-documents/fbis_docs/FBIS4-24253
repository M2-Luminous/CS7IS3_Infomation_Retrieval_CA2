The Northern Universities Joint Campuses Committee [NUJCC] considers Moshood Abiola's arrest as "the biggest blunder of the century and evidence of the confusion that has hit the ranks of the military junta" in power, according to the communique which was passed to AFP. The NUJCC voted "unanimously on a motion of defiance to the Constitutional Conference" which was inaugurated today in Abuja by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha. For the NUJCC, it is obvious that the delegates from the 30 states of the federation to this conference "were not elected" because the people did not take part in those elections. "How can delegates handpicked by the government claim to be representing the people?," the association queried in its communique, calling on the government to put an end "immediately" to the deliberations of the conference. The communique was signed by representatives of the Universities of Jos (center), Zaria, Makurdi, Kano, Yola, Bauchi, Sokoto, Abuja, Minna, and Maiduguri (north).
