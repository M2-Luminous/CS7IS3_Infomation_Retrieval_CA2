In his opinion, new voracious [holodni] people have come to power. They are not guided by the interests of voters, but by their own immediate interests. In Ye. Saburov's opinion, the way out of the deadlock lies in negotiations between the two sides that would rule out the use of force. He sees the Crimea's future "first and foremost, within Ukraine."
