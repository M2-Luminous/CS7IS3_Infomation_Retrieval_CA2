Alternate Chairman U Saw Philip, alias U Philip San, and Panel of Chairmen members U San Tha Aung, U Sai Aung Htun, U Kan Nyunt, U Mahn Ohn Maung, U Soe Maung, U Tin Maung, U Khin Maung Htoo, and Dr. Than Nyunt present analysis on the "Head of State" chapter. The Panel of Chairmen's report clarifies and appraises the reports presented by the various delegate groups concerning the head of state and suggests the following as basic principles concerning the appropriate terms of office for the president and vice presidents for the "Head of State" chapter. "The term of office of the president and the vice presidents shall be five years; the president and vice presidents shall carry on in office until the new president and vice presidents are duly elected after the expiration of incumbent terms; incumbents shall serve in the office of the president and vice presidents for not more than two terms; and the term as acting president or acting vice president shall not be considered as a term in office." Moreover, the analysis report proposes that "if for some reason the post of president or vice president becomes vacant and someone is elected to fill the vacancy, the term of office of that person shall be only until the end of the original term of office." Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report clarifies the political position of the president and proposes the basic principles. "The president and vice presidents shall not be representatives of parliament; if a parliament representative is elected president or vice president, this person shall be deemed to have resigned his seat in parliament, and if a public service person is elected president or vice president, that person shall be deemed to have retired from the date of such election; if a person elected president or vice president happens to be a member of a political party, that person shall not participate in party activities of that party organization from the date of such election during the term of office." Continuing, the analysis report defines the oaths of office for the president and vice presidents before they assume their official responsibilities and cites suggestions by various delegates, including: "A. To observe and safeguard the state constitution; B. To protect the laws of the nation; C. To strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty; D. To execute the constitutional duties and responsibilities with righteousness and without depravity; E. To strive for the promotion of Lawkapala [universal] principle of justice, liberty, and equality." The analysis report proposes that the basic principle on the oath of office include the following points: "To be loyal to the Union of Myanmar [Burma] and its citizens; to perpetually bear in mind and strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty; to observe and safeguard the state constitution and to protect and abide by the laws of the nation; to execute duties and responsibilities with utmost integrity and righteousness; to strive for the promotion of Lawkapala principle of justice, liberty, and equality in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar; and solemnly swear to offer one's body and life to the nation for the benefit of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar." Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report suggests another basic principle, stating that "the president and vice presidents should not accept any other office or position of emolument." Further, the analysis report evaluates the assets of the president and vice presidents and proposes that "the president and vice presidents should furnish lists of assets -- such as family-owned land, houses, buildings, businesses, savings, and other valuables, stating their values, and belonging to the respective families headed by them -- and send them to the leader of the union parliament." The report then describes remuneration, benefits, and lodging suggestions and proposes that "the president and vice presidents should each be entitled to enjoy legally appropriate remuneration, privileges, and benefits; each should be provided with a suitable residence; and when a president or vice presidents, apart from those being impeached, retire after completing a term in office, they should be granted pension and suitable benefits." The Panel of Chairmen's analysis report determines the duties and responsibilities and proposes the basic principle that "the president and vice presidents shall exercise responsibilities and rights assigned and vested by the constitution and other laws." The report next assesses the points for impeachment, the procedures to be followed, and prescribes the basic principles "1. The president or a vice president can be impeached for the following reasons: A. treason; B. violation of the state constitution; C. misconduct; D. deterioration in the specific qualifications prescribed in the constitution for the president and vice president; 2. If a president or a vice president faces impeachment, a written proposal signed by not less than one quarter of the total members of any of the two parliaments included in the union parliament will be submitted to the leader of that parliament; 3. The impeachment procedure can continue only if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total members of the parliament concerned; 4. When an impeachment motion has been referred by one parliament, the other parliament shall investigate the motion or cause the motion to be investigated by a body; 5. The president, vice presidents, or their representatives shall have the right to refute the motion; 6. If, as a result of the investigation, a resolution is passed and is supported by not less than two-thirds of the members of the parliament by which the charge was investigated or caused to be investigated, declaring that the charge has been sustained and that the offense -- the subject of the charge -- was such as to render the president or vice president unfit to continue in office, that parliament should submit it to the leader of the union parliament to remove the president or vice president from office; 7. Immediately upon receipt of the submission, the leader of the union parliament shall proclaim the removal of the president or vice president from office." Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report analyzes the election of a president or a vice president if the positions become vacant due to resignation, death, or inability, and proposes the basic principles that "1. The president or vice president should have the right to resign from office of their own volition before the expiry of the term of office; 2. If the post of president becomes vacant due to resignation, death, inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office, or any other cause, the vice president who has won the second highest number of votes in the presidential election shall serve as acting president; 3. If the vacancy in the presidency arises while the union parliament is in session, the acting president should promptly inform the leader of the union parliament to fill the vacancy within seven days; 4. Upon receipt of the announcement from the acting president, the leader of the union parliament should take the necessary steps to elect a new vice president by the electoral college; 5. After electing a new vice president, union parliament members shall elect a president of their choice from among the vice presidents; 6. If a vacancy arises when the union parliament is not in session, the leader of the union parliament shall summon a special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the announcement from the acting president and carry out the above-mentioned process for choosing a new president; 7. If a vice presidential post becomes vacant due to resignation, death, removal from office, permanent disability, or any other cause while the union parliament is in session, the electoral college which has elected that vice president should promptly inform the leader of the union parliament to fill the vacancy within seven days; 8. If a vacancy arises when the union parliament is not in session, the leader of the union parliament shall summon a special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the announcement from the president and carry out the required process for choosing a new vice president."
