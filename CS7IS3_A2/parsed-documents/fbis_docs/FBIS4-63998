A few days before Pavel Grachev arrived in Belgium, a group of Moscow journalists and scientists of the Russian Sociopolitical Center along with your correspondent visited Brussels, where the NATO leadership devoted the maximum attention to us to explain the essence of the partnership program. Let me remind you that the invitation to states belonging to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and to CSCE countries to subscribe to the partnership program was approved by the 16 NATO countries 10 January 1994. The framework document of this agreement proposes that each country should make an individual contribution to military cooperation with NATO and that joint peacemaking, rescue, and humanitarian operations should be conducted. Eighteen countries, including several CIS states, have already responded to NATO's invitation to join the partnership. In June their representatives will take their seats in a specially prepared office and will commence joint work. But Russia, as is known, has put to NATO the condition that its great-power status be recognized and that our country be granted special powers within the framework of the "Partnership for Peace" program. Pavel Grachev's position was even more rigid: He repeatedly advanced a demand for preliminary consultations between the leadership of the North Atlantic alliance and Russia in the event of decisions being adopted on the forced establishment of peace in conflict zones. NATO Deputy Secretary General von Moltke and also other leaders of the alliance, with whom we associated closely, told us gently yet adamantly that the North Atlantic alliance is prepared to take Russia's special status into account and to conclude an individual bilateral agreement with it, but only outside the program, participation in which presupposes equal terms for all countries. To judge from the answer to a question which I put to the president of Russia on the eve of the Russian Federation defense minister's visit to Brussels, Boris Yeltsin gave Pavel Grachev instructions to defend the position declared by Moscow: To join the partnership, but to stipulate the simultaneous signing of a large-scale agreement between NATO and the Russian Federation. Thus, the question of Russia's joining the partnership remains open, as before. The misgivings that the Russian authorities have about the NATO program are accounted for both by the fact that the USSR's former Warsaw Pact allies have joined the North Atlantic bloc alliance and, particularly, by the recent bombing strikes against Bosnian Serb positions in the former Yugoslavia, which were not agreed with Russia. Proceeding from this, Russian politicians are focusing attention on the military aspect of the partnership program. On the one hand, they are concerned about the question of obligations relating to the joint ensuring of democratic control over defense forces, about which our military are, naturally, unenthusiastic. On the other hand, the problem of standardization of the NATO partners' military equipment, which could deprive Russia of sales markets for its armaments, is being raised repeatedly. At the NATO headquarters, in response to misgivings of this kind, we heard arguments which merit attention. Participation in international structures really does bind countries in a net of obligations, Mr. Leroy, leader of a department, told us, but what is bad about that if joint obligations restrict states with regard to drastic actions without prior consultations? For this constitutes concern for collective security. Developing this argument, NATO experts said that Russia's failure to subscribe to the partnership program would give our internal opposition a clear trump card, and in that case there will be an increased potential danger of Russia's being drawn into conflicts. Another counterargument by the Russian military against subscribing to the partnership porgram was the opinion that participation in it will mess up the CIS countries' collective security treaty. But, first, eight former Soviet republics have already joined the partnership with NATO. Second, overall membership of the program would be capable of ensuring global security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok." In addition, it is also impossible to disagree with the argument that it is better to influence decisionmaking -- which Russia seeks to do within the framework of the European and world community -- by being within the structure and not being isolated. On the other hand, the thesis that economic cooperation with developed countries is the priority for Russia seems fair. If we are invited to military cooperation, why not link this question to the opening up of European markets to goods from Russia? Otherwise we get an undisguised picture of the desire of the United States and West Europe to bind Russia with obligations to maintain stability and security without reinforcing its membership of the partnership program with economic cooperation. Without the latter it will not be easy to find considerable additional funds in the Russian budget for Russia's dues for the "Partnership for Peace" program. Having adopted the political decision to subscribe to it, Russia still retains the right to draw up a bilateral agreement with NATO.
