FR940414-1-00041 FR940414-1-00010 As mentioned above, sampling of wastewater treatment systems occurred for 7 of the 14 sampling episodes. The treatment technologies that were sampled to test treatment performance include: Activated carbon adsorption, membrane filtration (ultrafiltration and cross-flow filtration), ozonation, clarification and biological oxidation. EPA analyzed the levels of pollutants in the raw and effluent streams and the overall performance of the treatment systems. Whenever possible, prior to a sampling episode at a pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facility, representatives from the Agency conducted an engineering site visit. Following the visit, a draft sampling plan was prepared which provided the rationale for the selection of sampling location as well as the procedures to be followed during sampling. A copy of this draft plan was provided to the plant for comments. During the sampling episode, teams of EPA engineers and EPA contractor engineers and technicians collected and preserved samples and shipped them to EPA contract laboratories for analysis. Levels of conventional pollutants, non-conventional pollutants (including the pesticide active ingredients), and priority pollutants were measured in raw wastewater and treated effluent. EPA always offered to split the samples with the facility so that the facility could have an independent analysis of pollutant concentrations made. When facilities chose to split samples with EPA, either the facility accepted the split samples provided by the EPA or plant personnel independently collected wastewater from the EPA sampling sites. Following the sampling episode, a draft trip report was prepared that included descriptions of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging operations and treatment processes, sampling procedures, analytical results, quality assurance/quality control evaluation, and discussion of the raw wastewater composition and treatment system performance. The report was provided to the sampled facility for review and comment, and any corrections were incorporated into the report. The facilities also identified any information in the draft report that the facility considered confidential business information. 5. EPA Bench-Scale Treatability Studies EPA performed several treatability tests with various treatment technologies on various pesticide active ingredient pollutants and also a variety of pesticide manufacturing and formulating, packaging, and repackaging process wastewaters. The purpose of these studies was to expand the treatability information available on various active ingredients to verify given technologies' effectiveness on pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging wastewater matrices and to evaluate the ability of some technologies to allow for recovery of product. In addition, EPA is relying in this rulemaking on various treatability studies done in conjunction with the development of the recent pesticide manufacturers rulemaking. EPA also studied the performance of a treatment system that will be referred to as the ``Universal Treatment System'' for pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging wastewater (described below), and studied the performance of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis separately due to their use in recovering wastes. EPA also performed a treatability study on the pyrethrin active ingredients, testing both hydrolysis rates and carbon isotherms. The Universal Treatment System treatability study was done because EPA had no performance data on this complete system of control technologies for treating pesticide active ingredients. Although EPA has considerable data from the pesticide manufacturing rulemaking to demonstrate that the individual treatment technologies are effective at removing specific active ingredients from wastewater, the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater may have a more complex matrix (as compared to manufacturing wastewater) because of emulsifiers and surfactants and thus these individual treatments might not be as effective absent pretreatment to remove the emulsifiers/surfactants. There are some pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that do pretreat their wastewater to remove surfactants and emulsifiers prior to treatment by activated carbon. However, these facilities may not be using the most effective physical/chemical technology for removing the active ingredient in their wastewaters. Bench-scale test results using a wastewater generated by a facility which formulates and packages products containing Bromacil, Tebuthiuron, Diuron, Terbufos and Benthiocarb indicate that the concentrations of these active ingredients can be reduced to levels below the analytical limit of detection. The technologies tested on this wastewater were chemical assisted separation (emulsion breaking), ozone/ultraviolet light oxidation and activated carbon adsorption. The emulsion breaking step removed turbidity, a major portion of the oil and grease and some total organic carbon (TOC). The rate of oxidation of the active ingredients appears to be a function of the concentration of other oxidizable organics contained in the wastewater. In this case, oxidation converted a portion of the soluble organics into insoluble precipitates, thus requiring a second clarification step prior to activated carbon treatment. Carbon isotherm and carbon adsorption column tests indicate that oxidation generates short chained organic acids and alcohols which are poorly adsorbed on carbon, resulting in a large TOC concentration in the effluent. The second facility generated cleaning wastewater which contained an alkali soap and followed a cleaning with isopropyl alcohol. The active ingredients present in the wastewater included Piperonyl Butoxide, Propoxur, Allethrin, Tetramethrin and Permethrin. The study indicates that emulsion breaking using ferric chloride and a polyelectrolyte removes the majority of Allethrin, Permethrin, oil and grease and turbidity. This would indicate that the Allethrin and Permethrin are more soluble in the organic or oil fraction and thus are removed in conjunction with the removal of the oil and grease or organic fraction. Alkaline hydrolysis at pH 12 and 60 â—‹C followed by carbon adsorption decreased the concentrations of Allethrin and Permethrin to below the analytical limit of detection. Carbon adsorption effluent contained approximately 800 mg/L of TOC of which nearly 60 percent was derived from isopropyl alcohol.
