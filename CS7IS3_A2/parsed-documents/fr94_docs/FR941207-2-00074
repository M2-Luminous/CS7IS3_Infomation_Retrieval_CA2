FR941207-2-00074 FR941207-2-00058 3. The Funds currently offer one class of shares (the ``Existing Class''). The Existing Class is not subject to any sales or redemption charges and is not subject to any charges pursuant to a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. Shares of the Existing Class have been primarily sold to individuals and institutional investors through referrals and general media advertisements. Applicants currently propose to establish a multiple class distribution system that would authorize each Fund to sell four classes of its shares, Class Y, Class A, Class B, and Class C. Applicants also propose that the Funds be able to create additional classes of shares in the future. 4. Applicants propose that the current shares of each Existing Class be redesignated as Class Y shares. Class Y shares will not be subject to any sales charges or fees pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or shareholder services plan. Class Y shares will be sold solely to (a) all shareholders of record in one or more of the Evergreen Funds prior to the commencement of the multi-class distribution, (b) institutional investors, and (c) investment advisory clients of the Adviser or affiliates of the Adviser. 5. Class A, Class B, and Class C shares will be offered primarily to individual investors. Class A shares will be offered with a front-end sales load and will be subject to a distribution fee under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan. Class B shares will be offered without a front-end sales load, but will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan. After a specified period, Class B shares will convert to Class A shares. Class C shares will be offered without a front-end sales load and also will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan. The Class C CDSC will only apply for the first year after purchase and Class C shares will have no conversion privileges. 6. Each Fund may also enter into servicing agreements (``Shareholder Servicing Agreements'') with broker-dealers, banks, and financial institutions with respect to each newly created class of shares to provide various shareholder record keeping, administrative, personal, and support services to their customers. While it is currently anticipated that payments made under Shareholder Servicing Agreements will be pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, a Fund may in the future make such payments pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing plan in the event such a plan is duly adopted by the Fund in accordance with condition 5 of this application. The services provided under a Shareholder Servicing Agreement will augment (and not be duplicative of) the services provided by the Adviser or the Fund's custodian. 7. Each class of shares would be identical in all respects, except for: (a) The impact of expenses described in condition 1 below that are attributable only to certain classes (``Class Expenses''); (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan, and if applicable, any shareholder servicing plan; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) any conversion feature applicable to a class of shares; and (e) different class designations. 8. All classes of shares of a Fund will bear Fund or Trust expenses on the basis of the relative net asset value of the classes. Expenses specific to a class will be allocated to that class. A Fund's investment adviser may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses of certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by the Adviser may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. 9. In addition, the Adviser may voluntarily waive or reimburse Trust expenses and/or Fund expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust expenses and/or Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Trust expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust expenses and Fund expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Trust expenses or Fund expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. 10. Because Class Expenses and payments made under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan may differ for each class, the per share net income of, and dividends on, each class may differ from the net income of, and dividends on, the other classes of shares of a Fund. In addition, except for Funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value and declare dividends daily, the net asset value attributable to each class of shares of a Fund may differ. 11. Shares of a class of one Fund will be exchangeable for shares of the same class of another Fund. Any exchanges will comply with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 12. Shares of certain classes, including Class B and Class C, may be subject to the imposition of a CDSC if they are redeemed within a prescribed time after their purchase (the ``CDSC Period''). The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as a specified percentage of the lesser of the net asset value at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption. 13. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing increases in the value of shares due to capital appreciation, redemptions of shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions, or redemptions of shares held by longer than the CDSC Period. In determining whether the CDSC is payable, it will be assumed that shares not subject to the CDSC are redeemed first and that other shares are then redeemed in the order purchased. This will result in a charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. 14. If a shareholder pays a CDSC upon redemption and a reinvestment occurs within a specified time period stated in the prospectus in effect at the time the shares are sold, the shareholder may receive a credit, paid by the distributor, for any CDSC paid. 15. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC on certain redemptions. Any waiver of the CDSC will comply with the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act. 16. Shares of some classes subject to a CDSC (``Convertible CDSC Shares'') retained by an investor past a prescribed period following the purchase of Convertible CDSC Shares will convert into shares of other classes not subject to a CDSC (``Non-CDSC Shares''). Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Convertible CDSC Shares also will be Convertible CDSC shares, but will convert to Non-CDSC Shares on the earlier of a prescribed period following the date of such reinvestment or the conversion date of the most recently purchased Convertible CDSC Shares not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions. 17. The sum of any front-end sales charge, asset-based sales charge, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge as provided in Article III, Section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. (``NASD'').
