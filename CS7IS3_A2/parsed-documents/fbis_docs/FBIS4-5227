Hata, who concurrently serves as the deputy prime minister, told a hastily arranged press conference at the Foreign Ministry that he considers it important to play the role of making adjustments within the coalition government rather than becoming the next prime minister. Hata also indicated he may go ahead with his planned trip to Marrakech, Morocco, next week to attend the signing ceremony of a global trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since Hosokawa instructed cabinet ministers to fulfill their duties until the end, his scheduled trip to Marrakesh has not been totally scrapped, Hata said. As for Hosokawa's successor, Hata said he wants the person to be someone who has the "same ambition to further promote reforms" and who wants to create a more stable government. Turning to the possible effects the latest development would give to international affairs, Hata said it would give negative influence not only on Japan-U.S. relations, which has been sour over trade disputes, but on the rest of the world. He said it would give the world anxiety concerning Japanese politics so that it is important to stabilize the government as early as possible. He also said Japan should explain about the course of Japanese politics at the Marrakech meeting. "Japan has become a country which could influence various countries," Hata said. "So there should not be a delay in politics not even for a day." Hata, who was expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said he thinks it possible to hold "frank" discussions with Kantor since Japan's determination to promote free trade and to make efforts to make a more open market remains unchanged no matter how the domestic political situation is. "There aren't many options concerning what Japan can do," he said. The foreign minister also indicated there will be no problem in dealing with the problems involving North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons because the Japanese administration has the consistency and continuity of policies. Hata, also the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] which broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party, said he told an extraordinary cabinet meeting that he wants Hosokawa to stick to the post. But Hata said he cannot dissuade Hosokawa because he has already officially announced his intention to step down. He described Friday's development as one of the "aftershocks" from a major "diastrophism" last June, when Shinseito split from the LDP, which led to the birth of the coalition government, indicating that it may be a chance toward a major reorganization of the political world. He reiterated the need to create two stable political forces, saying the coalition government of seven parties had difficulty in making a single decision.
