The media claimed he was referring to David Levi, and Bibi did not deny it. At that time, Levi decided not to cooperate with the man who leveled such accusations at him and his colleagues. Since then, Levi has hardly set foot in the Likud headquarters at Metzudat Ze'ev, and he conducts his political activities from an office on Balfour Street in Tel Aviv. Levi was active in the municipal elections, in which many of his followers (heads of local councils and mayors) ran, but has stayed out of events and consultations conducted by Netanyahu or Moshe Qatzav. In a surprising and one-sided move, Netanyahu apologizes here to David Levi for the distress inflicted on him. He calls on Levi to cooperate with him and to patch things up: "I appeal to David Levi. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it." Netanyahu's new initiative should be seen in the broad context of recurrent secret efforts to renew their dialogue. These efforts were conducted by former Knesset Member [MK] Re'uven Rivlin, Levi's confidant, and by his brother, Maxim Levi. All these efforts have so far proved fruitless. [Barzel] What is your attitude toward David Levi's prolonged boycott? Do you not think it is time the two of you made up? The animosity between you is so obvious, that not too long ago MK Hayim Ramon even had the audacity to propose to Levi to head his list in the elections to the Histadrut labor federation. [Netanyahu] In view of the big national challenges ahead of us, the Likud and all the other parties in the national camp should rise above personal disputes and rivalries. I would like to seize this opportunity to call on David Levi to set aside past squabbles. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it. Many people look up to us and expect us to close ranks in these difficulties times. We must act together for the success of the Likud, which is so vital to the future of the country. [Barzel] Why the sudden urge? Was not a whole year wasted, during which the resentment increased? [Netanyahu] People have their own personal resentments, but it seems to me that Israel has never before experienced such a period of deterioration in personal safety and confidence in the future of the country as that brought about by the government's failed policies. This is why I arrived at the clear conclusion that this is a fateful hour which calls for special efforts to achieve unity. All personal considerations must be tossed aside, and everything possible must be done to close the ranks of the national camp. [Barzel] How can such an appeal help? What do you expect Levi to do? Kiss and make up? [Netanyahu] This is not my first appeal. I took similar initiatives in the past, away from the public's eye. I hope this appeal will elicit a positive response. [Barzel] All the key positions in the Likud institutions have been filled. If Levi heeds your call, how do you envision his role in the leadership? [Netanyahu] Some senior Likud members hold jobs, while others, such as Beni Begin, chose not to run for any official positions but are very well integrated in the Likud's work, consultations, and decisionmaking on central issues. There is a broad range for cooperation and teamwork for anybody who so wishes. [Barzel] Refa'el Eytan proposed to set up a shadow government. Were you to set up such a government, what job would you offer Levi? [Netanyahu] To the best of my knowledge, the shadow government system exists only in Britain, where there is a big party in the opposition and there is no coalition. I am not sure that the idea can be applied in Israel or that there can be a shadow government that includes all the opposition factions. It might lead to more divisiveness than unity. On the other hand, I am very much in favor of getting the opposition used to teamwork and cooperation. Indeed, this is what we have been doing over the past few months, not entirely unsuccessfully, as proved by our joint position opposing the government's policies and the removal of the Jewish settlement from Hebron. It goes without saying that I would not presume to determine now the exact composition of the next government, but there is no doubt that David Levi would have a dignified and central role in it. [Barzel] Have you met with him this past year? [Netanyahu] We have not had any talks worth mentioning. [Barzel] Does the recent appointment of Maxim Levi indicate that your mutual confidence has been restored? [Netanyahu] I will not go into an analysis of relations among Likud members. As far as I am concerned, I will cooperate with whoever wishes to do so. [Barzel] Do you enjoy the cooperation of members of Levi's camp? [Netanyahu] I work with all Likud members. We have come a long way from the critical situation in the Likud a year ago: a shattered movement on the brink of bankruptcy, without any institutions. We have fundamentally changed this situation. In less than a year, we set up all the institutions that had not existed in the previous 15 years. We enacted a constitution and appointed a tribunal. We pulled the Likud out of its financial crisis, and in recent months, we began activating thousands of members. Fortunately, I enjoy the cooperation of all flanks of the Likud. This is mainly because of the field activists' eagerness to work and take part in the activities needed to curb the policies of this government and to replace it as soon as possible. This, of course, is not reflected in the media, which tries to highlight the divisions and rivalries. For example, there were reports about a mass walkout from the Likud's ranks. Let me tell you that the Likud is the largest party in the country today. At the end of last year, after we raised membership fees, no more than 19 percent dropped out, and we now have 180,000 paying members. In most parties, the typical drop-out rate after primaries is over 50 percent. We built the organizational and financial tools to demonstrate this strength in the upcoming struggles and in the next Knesset elections. [Barzel] Does the message about the need for unity also apply to Ari'el Sharon? He talks about the need for a collective leadership. [Netanyahu] Sharon can make quite a considerable contribution to the Likud's success if he so wishes. I do not understand what the term "collective leadership" means. If it means team work, then let me tell you that I regularly summon the Likud's institutions and senior members in order to make decisions. However, I was chosen by thousands of Likud members to lead this team, and that is how I work. The door is wide open to anybody who wishes to join in or make a contribution. Furthermore, the negative focus on the Likud is rather surprising for two reasons: First, because the Likud is clearly undergoing a speedy recovery and is growing stronger. This process is corroborated by all public opinion polls, and the government is very well aware of it. Second, because divisions and rivalries -- which I do not ignore -- are not exactly the exclusive domain of the Likud. There is hardly any party in Israel that is not afflicted by disputes and rivalries. What is happening today in the Likud pales compared to the rivalry in the Labor movement, which ultimately led to a rift. [Barzel] Do you think the pullout from Gaza, which many right-wing people support, and the contacts with Syria will reawaken in the public the euphoria caused by the signing of the Oslo agreement? [Netanyahu] The euphoria of Oslo will not recur. The government is using the withdrawal from Gaza, which is supported by most Israelis, as a smoke screen for a withdrawal from all parts of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and the ensuing return to the 1967 borders. The people already realize whom they are dealing with. The Arabs have not abandoned their ambitions, and they take advantage of every retreat on the part of the government to fulfill their goals: pursuing terror in the short run, and bringing about Israel's annihilation in the long run. [Barzel] Would you pull out of Gaza? [Netanyahu] As prime minister, I would definitely be prepared to consider a redeployment of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Gaza and its vicinity. However, there is no way I would forgo the IDF's right to enter any place, including Gaza, in the course of a hot pursuit, to cite just one example. But Rabin is not just pulling the IDF out of Gaza. He is about to establish an army of terrorists there, as well as in Jericho, Nabulus, and Hebron. He is handing terrorists the responsibility for fighting terrorists, and he is allowing 'Arafat to establish a state of armed terrorists overlooking a shriveled up and dwarfed State of Israel. This is no peace process. This is the process of establishing a second Lebanon in the heart of Israel. [Barzel] Even under these conditions, Rabin is having a hard time finding partners for a political process. With whom would you reach an agreement about the IDF governing Gaza? [Netanyahu] I am not surprised that the Arabs are demanding more than even these capitulation terms. They have become used to the idea that this prime minister, Rabin, has no red lines. All his promises are absolutely worthless. He has promised just about everything imaginable. The PLO has not abrogated the charter calling for Israel's annihilation and has not stopped terror or taken any steps against Fatah men who continue to engage in terror and, what is more, who closely cooperate with the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] assassins. [Barzel] Why should they talk to you about less than what Rabin has already promised them? [Netanyahu] The fact is that when we conducted a genuine peace process, the Arabs demanded less and received less, because we know how to negotiate with the Arabs. Did al-Asad and the Palestinians believe they would get everything they are getting today when they came to Madrid? Did anybody conceive that the Likud would allow them to have a Palestinian state or would give back the Golan? Certainly not, and yet they came nevertheless. When the Arabs realize there is a different government, a determined government and not an appeasing one, they will have to forgo their exorbitant demands. [Barzel] The current government will soon sign agreements, and this looks irreversible. If you head the next government, will you honor these agreements? [Netanyahu] We will honor any international agreement that is honored by the other side, but there is no way we will honor them unilaterally. So far, the PLO has grossly violated all its basic commitments. [Barzel] What will you propose to the Palestinians? [Netanyahu] The Israeli public is gradually coming to realize that there are two concepts in the search for peace. The first, which is being pursued by this government, has it that we must withdraw to the 1967 borders, establish a Palestinian state, and entrust our security to an army of terrorists, led by 'Arafat. I believe in a totally different concept. Israel must keep its sovereign rule all the way to the Jordan River. The IDF, and not an army of terrorists, must be solely responsible for security in all areas of trans-Jordan, and the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza will be given autonomy. No autonomy in the world has a flag, an anthem, an army, border controls, foreign relations, and judicial and executive branches. This is not autonomy. This is a state. And therein lies the essential difference between us and the government: They are offering a state, not autonomy. [Barzel] Who on the other side will accept the kind of autonomy you propose? [Netanyahu] I believe my plan will enjoy significant support among prominent elements in the Arab world -- first and foremost, Jordan, whose king probably realizes he will not survive if a Palestinian state is established in the West Bank. Such a state will result in his downfall. I believe a common denominator can be found with Syria, which should ask itself what it would rather have to its south, in its underbelly: King Husayn, or a Palestinian state that would strike an alliance with his enemy, Saddam Husayn? [Barzel] Is this the basis on which you expect an accord with Syria? [Netanyahu] If I were the prime minister, I would conduct the negotiations with Syria in a totally different matter. Who has ever heard of a government announcing the concessions it intends to make before negotiations have even started? I would tell al-Asad: You stand to lose from a state of war. I would elaborate on the issues that are more important to Syria than they are to us, such as water, security arrangements, striking Syria from the list of terror-supporting countries, and an arrangement in Lebanon acceptable to both countries. There is no way I would offer Syria the Golan, which is a buffer against war. As long as the IDF is on the Golan with its tanks and artillery, the Syrians do not have the option of war. [Barzel] In a few days, the government will sign an agreement with the PLO. Even if you return to power, you will face a fait accompli. What will you do? [Netanyahu] Contrary to others, I do not think the establishment of a Palestinian state is an irreversible process. If the government thinks it can race from Gaza and Jericho straight to the permanent solution while uprooting settlements, it will encounter growing opposition on the part of the public. This is not a nation of idiots. It will not agree to be forced back to the banks of the Yarqon River and to deploy 'Arafat and his terrorists on the hills overlooking Tel Aviv. This opposition is being led by the Likud, along with all the parties in the national camp. [Barzel] Finally, how do you feel today about your personal affair a year ago? [Netanyahu] I am deeply sorry about my personal slipup. I hurt myself and my wife, Sara. The media blew the issue out of all proportion, to the point of reporting out-and-out lies, which definitely did not make things any easier for us. We had quite a tough year, but I believe that in the end, we will emerge stronger.
