He also said the special services of Japan, North Korea, and China had recently stepped up their activities in the Maritime Kray. Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how, in the light of the latest decree by the Russian president on the immediate measures to protect the population against banditism and other forms of organized crime, local counterintelligence and interior directorates would interact, Stepashin said the federal counterintelligence service next week would sign an agreement with Viktor Yerin, interior minister of the Russian Federation, which would define the interaction and division of powers between the two departments. In Sergey Stepashin's words, it has been decided to put an end to competition between the departments. From now on counterintelligence officers, jointly with the interior ministry, will deal in real earnest with cases of corruption in the top echelons of state power and a number of organized crime groups using the channel of international terrorism and drugs smuggling. The federal counterintelligence service will help the interior ministry with equipment. Sergey Stepashin said the president in the very near future would sign a decree setting up a special directorate in the federal intelligence service and territorial directorates, accordingly. Thus, counterintelligence will get the opportunity to participate directly in searching, detaining, and eliminating those who encroach upon the law and people's rights and lives. The director of the federal counterintelligence service also visited the major port town of Nakhodka.
