The announcement came after a police investigation linking him to drug-trafficking activities. In a televised address to the nation, Paz Zamora said during his term in office (1989-1993) "there was no crime, but there were errors," in reference to his relations with Isac Chavarria, alias Oso, allegedly Bolivia's most notorious drug trafficker. Paz Zamora appeared dispirited on the television screen. He stood as he dramatically delivered his statement beside a crucifix. The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking [Fuerza Especial de Luchas Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] revealed this week there are indications that during his presidential administration, Paz Zamora received and obeyed instructions from Chavarria to appoint officers in the Armed Forces and the government. FELCN also delivered to a parliamentary commission a report indicating relatives of the former president as well as distinguished members of the social democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR], Paz Zamora's party, gave protection to the drug trafficker. Among the accused are Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's secretary when he was president, and MIR leader Oscar Eid. Colonel Faustino Rico Toro, who in 1991 was appointed commander in chief of the antidrug struggle, was arrested on 22 March. The U.S. Government asked the Bolivian Government for his extradition on drug-trafficking charges on 23 March. In announcing his withdrawal from politics, Paz Zamora, current vice president of Socialist International, acknowledged implicitly his relations with Chavarria but said he always acted in "good faith, close to naivete." Several MIR leaders and relatives of the former president have admitted an old friendship united Chavarria and Paz Zamora who appear together in various old pictures the media have published. Although he admitted his "mistakes," Paz Zamora said today he is astonished by certain people's "intention to treat maliciously" his personal relations, referring to his relations with Chavarria, who is in La Paz' maximum security prison. The president said the charges against him "have not been proved" and accused his accusers of "tarnishing my family's honor." The former president said he is concerned only with "the international impact" the charges against him and his party may have. He said "an effort is being made now to deny the results of the antidrug struggle" that his government waged, a struggle that has been acknowledged by the international community, he claimed. Since handing the Presidency over to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada following the 6 June 1993 elections, Paz Zamora has secluded himself in his private residence in the town of Tarija, on the border with Argentina. He made his only public appearance today since then. It came several months after the first reports of the drug-trafficking charges against his party, charges that in the past few days have centered on him.
