In addition, the province will make efforts to speed up the creation of a market system and improve the social insurance system as two necessary measures in support of the implementation of the major reform program. The outline of reforms was announced recently at the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress. Differentiating it from past years, the provincial government has formulated a series of laws and regulations -- instead just issuing political appeals -- to safeguard and boost the implementation of the new economic structure, said Lu Wenge, chairman of the provincial Commission for Restructuring the Economy. As one of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang is currently taking a lead in developing the market economy and improving the social insurance system in China. The province has chosen the corporation system as well as group management as the breakthrough to be made this year in reforming the property rights system of most of its large and medium-sized enterprises, sources from the congress said. More than 1,000 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises will introduce the corporation system in 1994, the sources said. The state and collectively-owned small enterprises will be at the same time revitalized by means of auctions, mergers and leasing. According to officials from the provincial government, local governments at all levels will this year totally withdraw their control over management of enterprises and the allocation of resources and will even transfer part of the supervision function to some social intermediary organizations. The province has also planned to introduce the market system in such fields as investment, finance and foreign currency. It will change all of the existing specialized and cooperative banks into commercial banks in the near future. Meanwhile, national banks and foreign-funded banks are welcome to set up branches in the province, officials of the provincial government said. While expanding the current commodity markets, the province will also develop the markets of labor, property rights, technology, finance and information, in a bid to create good conditions for the reform of the enterprise system. The province now has more than 4,000 commodity markets, whose total transactions were worth some 65.1 billion yuan in 1993. According to sources from the people's congress, the province will further develop its insurance services for pensions and unemployment. As well as covering employees of the state and collectively-run enterprises and joint ventures, the sources said, the unemployment insurance system would be extended this year to employees of all the township enterprises all over the province. An integrated pension insurance system will be introduced in more than half of the cities and regions in the province, the sources said.
