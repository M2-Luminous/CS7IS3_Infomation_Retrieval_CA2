This time, too, the Serbian mass media announced the news in the same way as several years ago when the Serbian authorities in Belgrade concocted a story about the murder of several soldiers at a barracks in Paracin city in Serbia. Even at that time, the killer was an Albanian, the late Aziz Kelmendi. According to Serbian television in Belgrade and the report by the same television in Prishtina, the murder of Serbian soldiers in Mladinovac was committed by a Shaban Bajrami from Medvegje, a commune situated in eastern Kosova, which, together with the communes of Presheve and Bujanovc, have declared political and territorial autonomy with the possibility of uniting with the republic of Kosova. According to Serbian television, the murderer Shaban Bajrami allegedly fired on Serbian soldiers with an automatic weapon and is now in hiding. It is known that young Albanians are refusing to serve in the army of the Serbian aggressor. Even those who are violently pressganged into this army are not given any weapons or ammunition; thus these fabrications of the alleged murder of Serbian soldiers by an Albanian soldier are completely false. Serbia needs such propaganda to hide the truth about the murders of hundreds of Serbian youths in the war in Bosnia. The majority of the Serbian youths are being secretly sent to this front, without even their families being informed .
