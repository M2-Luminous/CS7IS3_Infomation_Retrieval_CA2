FR940830-0-00063 FR940830-0-00013 Response: The comments clearly demonstrate a need for an increase in the administrative cost limit. Accordingly, HUD has raised the administrative cost limit to 10% for all HAs. Field Offices may approve amounts higher than the 10% limit where there is sufficient justification to warrant an increase. Because of the increase in the overall administrative cost limit, HUD has deleted the additional 2% limit related to travel costs. It should be noted that costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing (whether conducted by force account employees or by a contractor) are excluded from the 10% administrative cost total. In response to the request for clarification on the issue of administration of force-account labor, it should be noted that non-technical oversight costs associated with force account work are included in the cost limitations for administrative costs (account 1410). The actual force account labor costs including direct supervision are charged to the appropriate account for the work being performed, e.g., dwelling structures (account 1460). Administrative costs related to resident training programs are eligible management improvement costs. Additional Eligible Costs Issues Comment: Recommended additions to the list of eligible costs were air conditioning, wallpaper, garbage disposals, carpeting in all units, lawn sprinkler systems and maintenance vehicles. Two commenters requested that eligible items and modernization standards be consistent. Response: Recently, the Public Housing Development Program, revised its cost containment and modest design requirements to provide HAs with maximum flexibility regarding work items previously considered amenities. Maximum flexibility is hereby being provided in the CGP. The Department has modified its policy regarding eligible work items under CGP to allow work items that are modest in design and cost, but still blend in with the design and architecture of the surrounding communities by including amenities, quality materials and design and landscaping features that are customary for the locality. The Indian Housing Development Program also encourages IHAs to incorporate culturally relevant design concepts into their developments. For guidance in culturally relevant design considerations, IHAs may refer to a publication prepared by the American Indian Council of Architects and Engineers, Our Home, Giving Form to Traditional Values. It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added to promote the blend of public housing into the surrounding neighborhood. Such items may be included in the modernization of a development as long as the provisions for cost reasonableness are met. The PHA/IHA Board Resolution approving the Comprehensive Plan/Annual Statement, Form HUD&hyph;52836, will be modified to include a certification that the modernization work will promote Public and Indian housing that is modest in design and cost, but still blends in with the surrounding community. Comment: Additionally, it was asked that HOPE I, HOPE III and 5(h) Homeownership activities be listed as eligible items. Response: The current rule and this final rule permit the study of the feasibility of converting rental to homeownership units, as well as the preparation of an application for conversion to homeownership, as eligible management improvement costs (see resident homeownership costs, ยง968.310 (g)(3)). Comment: Clarification on the quality of materials to allow for higher quality security and plumbing fixtures was requested. This was suggested because of the high use factor and increased security needs of public housing. Response: HUD does not mandate the specific quality of materials used. HAs must ensure that the quality of materials used is appropriate to meeting the needs of the HA and its residents. In keeping with the flexibility mandated under the CGP, the quality of materials used is a local decision subject to the provisions relating to cost reasonableness. Comment: Clarifications were also requested on replacement of old maintenance vehicles. Response: Purchase of maintenance vehicles that are necessary to administer/implement the modernization program are eligible under the CGP. However, the HA must indicate in its Management Needs Assessment that such purchase is necessary to improve or sustain maintenance operations. If the maintenance vehicle is to be used for both the Low-Rent Public Housing Program and other programs administered by the HA, the cost of the purchase shall be prorated among programs. By statute, CGP funds are to be used to improve the physical condition of existing public housing projects and to upgrade the management and operation of such projects. All work items, including the purchase of equipment, must be directly related to carrying out the physical and management improvements to HA property.
