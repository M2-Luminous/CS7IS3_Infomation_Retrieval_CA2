This joint development is considered a step forward in the field of electric commercial vehicles (delivery vehicles and city busses) and could help reduce exhaust in cities, metropolitan and resort areas. Moveable battery exchange stations in a container are to improve short-term prospects for battery-driven busses used for public local passenger transportation and in delivery vehicles within the city. Modern exchange stations would avoid the drawbacks of relatively short ranges and operating times which are currently preventing the use of electrically driven busses and commercial vehicles. These mobile charging stations using a container format require only a small space (the required area for a standard version is 2.5 x 6.0 meter) and can be set up practically anywhere. Recharging the batteries from the AC line current requires only a 380 V outlet. As Rainer Bitthin, head of systems development at Varta, points out, this allows unrestricted 24-hour scheduled city bus service. Neither "refuelling" at fixed charging stations which takes hours nor the rather cumbersome battery exchange by fork-lift truck are necessary. As he explains, the bus driver himself can exchange the battery at the mobile charging station within a few minutes. To start the semi-automated battery exchange the bus rolls backwards to the charging station with its charging flap open. Two roller belt arms from the changing station are connected to the bus. When a button is pushed the empty battery automatically moves across the roller belts to an empty charging site at the station. By pushing another button a charged battery is automatically moved across the roller belts into the rear section of the vehicle. All the bus driver has to do is to connect the batteries. Depending on the version, the battery exchange containers can accept four to six batteries. They are placed in two shelves on two or three levels each and can be charged there. The required charging devices including the water supply for the Varta Aquamatik system are in a separate compartment inside the container. According to calculations by the experts at Neoplan and Varta, for instance, five batteries would be needed for permanent scheduled service with two busses between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m including the required battery exchange intervals. For the pilot projects, Neoplan and Varta are using led-traction batteries with tubular plates. According to reports the Varta Perfect type battery with electrolyte circulation and Varta Aquamatik is very energy efficient and requires little maintenance. The charging time per battery is reported to be five to six hours. As Bitthin explains, the complete system including bus, battery and exchange station has been studied as a pilot program in Saxony and Mechelen/Belgium. He says that there has been wide acceptance both among the bus service operators and the bus drivers who actually had to exchange the battery.
