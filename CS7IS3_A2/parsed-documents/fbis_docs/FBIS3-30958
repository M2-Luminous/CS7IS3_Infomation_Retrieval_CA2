He said the Yugoslav conference was adjourning longer than usual to give time for changes in light of a February 21 NATO deadline for air strikes in Sarajevo if Serb heavy weapons are not withdrawn and diplomatic pushes by both Washington and Moscow. Serbs, Moslems and Croats have waged a three-way war in Bosnia since April 1992. The EC-UN Geneva peace conference began in September 1992. The three days of talks here failed to advance the plan of EC mediator Lord Owen and Stoltenberg for a loose union of three ethnic mini-states in Bosnia, Stoltenberg told reporters. The talks were marked by the United States putting its weight behind the diplomatic process and saying they would defend the Bosnian's right to a fair settlement. U.S. special envoy Charles Redman said Friday his aim was "to do what (Clinton) has said we're going to try to do which is to try to help the Bosnian Government in these negotiations to come to an acceptable solution." The key issue of whether Serbs and Croats will give up land the Moslems demand for their state, which is to be made up of one-third of Bosnia, was the main sticking point here, Stoltenberg said. "We did not suceed to resolve the issue of the disputed territories," Stoltenberg told reporters. He explained the long adjournement by saying that "both the United States and Russia will in the days to come have a high activity with the parties to see if they can influence the negotiating process." Owen had earlier Saturday said the Moslems did not want to talk about Sarajevo "until they see what happens. Probably the NATO deadline has to pass." Owen said the increased U.S. role here, matching the military one signalled by NATO's gearing up for possible air strikes if the artillery is not withdrawn, would require re-calculations by all the factions. Washington will "consult very widely and that will take a little time and certainly the Bosnian Government is not going to shift its position until they get that and also probably until they see what is happening in Sarajevo and whether or not there are air strikes. "So I think there's an inevitable pause," he said. Owen said the focus was now on talks under the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo. "There's a tremendous amount of negotiating load being put on (UNPROFOR Bosnian commmander) General (Michael) Rose and his commanders down in Sarajevo." Asked about the possibility of the Moslems using an eventual NATO intervention as a cover for an infantry advance of their own, Owen said: "There is an imbalance of forces in Sarajevo with the Bosnian Serb forces having a overwhelming preponderance of heavy weapons and the Bosnian Moslem army having a massed preponderance of infantry in Sarajevo. "This is potentially destabilizing unless it is met by confidence-building measures and deloyment of UN forces on the ground," Owen said. He pointed out that Sarajevo would not be totally demilitarized if the artillery withdrawal succeeds since soldiers would remain "and what is going to be done, is the UN is interposing itself between the forces, which is brave and necessary decision to take."
