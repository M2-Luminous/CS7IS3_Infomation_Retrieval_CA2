Mahmud Mohammadi, a Foreign Ministry's spokesman, referred to the final communique of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC) Sunday night [5 June], and said the communique did not reportedly pass unanimously, and that all six PGCC ministers were not present at the time of approval. However, he stressed that according to the historical documents the islands have always belonged to Iran, and said Iran has always welcomed mutual talks with UAE without any precondition. "The invitation for Shaykh Hamdan is still valid," he added. Prominent university scholars in a recent seminar in Paris reviewed the historial documents on Iran's ownership of the islands. On the Saudi protest to the Iranian media reports concerning Saudi Arabia, which had been included in the PGCC final communique, Mohammadi said Iranian media "are totally free". "The media in Iran criticize also formal policies of the country most of the time, and our neighbours should understand this reality," he said adding "on the other hand it is natural that the media would react when they see the negligence of an agreement." Mohammadi also refuted the claims of Iran's support and military aid to one of the warring sides in Yemen, and said Iran had expressed its regret over the clashes and opposed any military operations in Yemen. The Islamic Republic adopted an impartial position and announced its readiness for mediation in Yemen, he said. More on the issue the spokesman said Iran is deeply interested in the integrity of the Islamic countries, whose disintegration, he said, are provoked by the foreigners. "We support the settlement of disputes in a peaceful way." "We are deeply sorry for the killing of each and every Muslim whether in the north or in the south, and we invite the two sides to end the clashes and begin talks with the aim of preservation of Yemen's unity," he said. Mohammadi also invited other countries to show self-restrain and avoid flaming the tension.
