Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's speech, to a conference on the Hungarian Holocaust at the Budapest University of Arts and Sciences, was drowned out by stamping and slow handclapping from audience members when he drew a parallel between Communism and Nazism. A statement sent to MTI by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry today says Jeszenszky originally did not plan to contribute to the conference. However, he changed his mind when inspired by formal greetings, first of all by those of Chief Rabbi Jozsef Schweitzer, who expressed the hope that the conference would help people become familiar with justice and promote spiritual reconciliation. Moved to contribute, Jeszenszky said he was pleased to realize that he could identify himself with the overwhelming majority of views expounded in the opening speeches. Jeszenszky said it was Nazism that made it possible for Bolshevism to gain ground in Hungary. It cannot be forgotten that the liberation of Hungary in 1945 marked the beginning of another, decades-long dictatorship, he said. The minister quoted late prime minister Jozsef Antall as saying that both Nazism and Communism are barbarous ideas which should be condemned together. At that point, some people in a corner of the hall started handclapping -- to prevent the minister from ending his speech rather than express their approval of his ideas, the statement says.
