FR940526-0-00022 FR940526-0-00009 Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The 1994&hyph;96 term of office begins May 1, 1994, and this action should be effective as soon as possible so that these positions can be filled as close to May 1, 1994, as possible; (2) this action does not impose additional regulatory requirements on handlers or producers and, therefore, neither handlers nor producers need additional time to comply; (3) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at an open meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
