In an unprecedented television appearance, MI5 director general Stella Rimington revealed that almost half the service's resources are now devoted to combatting the activities of the IRA and other Irish paramilitaries. But MI5 must also contend with foreign extremists from the Middle East and elsewhere active in the UK, Mrs Rimington added. "The service's overwhelming focus today -- three-quarters of our work -- is concentrated on terrorism. But the service's most important task -- and one which takes up nearly half our resources -- is mounting intelligence operations to counter the threat from Irish terrorism." The revelation follows the decision in 1992 to give MI5 the lead over Special Branch in countering Irish paramilitaries on the mainland. Since then, the service is thought to have been instrumental in securing the arrest of several IRA bombers. Referring to the risks faced by MI5 staff and their informants, Mrs Rimington said: "Intelligence gathering against terrorists is difficult and dangerous. Some of my staff and many others who work closely with us risk their lives to do it." Mrs Rimington's comments on the role of MI5, the first to be uttered publicly by a head of the Security Service, came as she presented the Dimbleby Lecture tonight on BBC1. In the lecture, entitled "Security and Democracy -- Is there a Conflict," she links the work of MI5 with the defence of democracy. This link has been questioned in the past amid allegations that the service showed bias in monitoring the activities of trade unionists and left-wing politicians. Mrs Rimington, who became the first woman to head MI5 when she was appointed in 1991, said MI5 staff and their contacts are motivated by a desire to defend democracy. She also referred to the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre in which 29 people died, including a number of MI5 staff prominent in the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland. "They do it from a sense of public service and a firm belief in the rule of law and the democratic system. It is an anxious life for their families, who support them because they too believe in the importance of their work. When tragedy strikes -- as it did on such a scale with the helicopter crash on June 2 -- they suffer their losses silently and with dignity. We have much cause to be grateful to them all." Explaining why counter-terrorism is now the service's main role, Mrs Rimington said "the collapse of Soviet communism had reduced the need for MI5 to concentrate resources on thwarting the activities of foreign spies in the UK -- one of its main roles for much of the Cold War. Countering espionage now takes up less than a quarter of our resources," she said. Turning to MI5's work against foreign extremists, she said the service had scored several successes in combatting foreign terrorist groups and even other intelligence services who were trying to assassinate opponents living in the UK and elsewhere. "As one example, we have helped to prevent the intelligence services of a number of Middle East states from carrying out sustained campaigns of murder against their opponents in this country and elsewhere. Members of Islamic extremist terrorist groups and terrorists from the Indian sub-continent have been identified and their plans disrupted." The threat from international terrorism had declined from its peak in the 1980's, when Middle Eastern nations such as Iran and Libya were apparently sponsoring various terrorist groups, including the IRA. But she added: ``In the foreseeable future I expect there to remain a significant threat to British interests, although the sources of it will vary from time to time. For example, the determined efforts to locate and kill the author Salman Rushdie seem likely to go on. ``Extremists from parts of North Africa and also Kurdish groups pose an increasing threat of violence, including to British tourists. ``And the conflict in former Yugoslavia could well spill over into acts of terrorism in Europe and elsewhere.''
