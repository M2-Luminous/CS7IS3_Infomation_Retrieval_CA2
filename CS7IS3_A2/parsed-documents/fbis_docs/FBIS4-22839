Kostin, V.A. Skvortsov, and V.Ye. Fortov, Institute of High Temperatures at Russian Academy of Sciences, Science Department; Moscow; UDC 539.124] [Abstract] Breakdown of metal targets by high-intensity ion beams and the dynamics of stressed state formation in targets during their bombardment by proton beams are analyzed by mathematical simulation. Interactions of high-intensity ion beams and target material not resulting in high-temperature heating of the plasma corona are considered so that preheating of the target can be disregarded. Correspondingly is considered interaction of high-energy (about 10 MeV) proton beams incident on solid targets in short pulses of up to 100 ns duration. The nonsteady flow of target material under an incident high-intensity ion beam is calculated in the hydrodynamic approximation in accordance with the three applicable integrodifferential equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The elastoplastic characteristics are evaluated in accordance with the Mises model. The simulation program includes a two-dimensional ``flow of continuous medium'' algorithm in Lagrangian coordinates, constructed according to the explicit ``cross'' scheme and involving the ``predictor-corrector'' procedure of second-order precision. Oscillations of nonphysical quantities are prevented by insertion of an artificial viscosity into both tensor and scalar forms. The breakdown model is based on the kinetic description of crack formation as a defect buildup process and attendant weakening of the material, the system of its equations being closed by an equation of state which covers not only a large class of materials but also wide temperature and pressure ranges up to extremely high ones. The deformation resistance increases with increasing intensity of the compression shock and reflection of the latter gives rise to a rarefaction wave, the tensile stresses in latter disrupting the continuity of the material. Numerical calculations on the basis of this model have been made for an aluminum target and two different high-intensity ion beams delivering the same total energy to the target: 1) thin tubular beam about 0.5 mm wide with the maximum current density at the 1 mm radius, 2) solid cylindrical beam with a Gaussian radial distribution of the current density peaking at the 0.5 mm radius. For simplification, the kinetic energy of protons is assumed to remain constant at the 10 MeV level over the duration of an incident pulse. An important parameter included in the calculations is the strain rate characterizing the response of a target to an incident shock wave. The results indicate that both the evolving stressed state of a target and the degree of its breakdown depend largely on the configuration of the focal radiation spot, a tubular beam producing defects over a larger target area. A high-energy proton beam evidently forms a large region of lower-density material surrounded by higher-density condensate, both temperature and pressure in this region rising appreciably within the Bragg peak deeper inside the target.
