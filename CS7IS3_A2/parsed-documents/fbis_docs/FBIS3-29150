Hosokawa was asked by reporters at his official residence for comment on exchange rates as the dollar fell below 103 yen in Tokyo Tuesday morning for the first time since last August. Asked how the government plans to cope with the yen's rise, Hosokawa said he will make every effort to weather the adverse effects of the stronger yen on the economy. The premier was asked whether he believes the yen's rise is the result of his failure to reach agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton last week in Washington on a new framework for bilateral trade. "I believe it's not a question like that," Hosokawa said when asked whether he believes the yen's surge is a high price for saying "no" to Clinton over U.S. demands for numerical trade targets. In a related development, a government source said the yen's surge is a concern and expressed hope that the dollar will stay at around 115 yen. "I believe it (the stronger yen) will probably trouble the United States too. I believe they don't think it's OK to leave the situation as it is because it will lead to an erosion of confidence in the dollar," the source said.
