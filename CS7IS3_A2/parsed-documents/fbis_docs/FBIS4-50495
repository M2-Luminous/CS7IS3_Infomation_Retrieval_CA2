C. Tang and Y. C. Tsai] [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- The first bilateral tariff consultations between Taiwan and Canada under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ended here Monday [16 May] in a friendly atmosphere. Director General Huang Yen-chao of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade, who led the Taiwan delegation to the tariff talks, said that during the one-day meeting, the Canadian side again stated its support for Taiwan's bid to join GATT. The Canadian delegation was headed by Paul Haddow, a division chief in charge of tariffs and market access under the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Canada is prepared to give a detailed reply to Taiwan's tariff proposals before the end of June and to hold another round of negotiations with Taiwan at any time, Huang said. Taiwan proposed to maintain current import duties on certain products, and to lower tariffs on some others all at once or in batches following its entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body, he elaborated. During the talks, he pointed out, both sides focused on tariff reductions of 837 agricultural and industrial items, non-tariff barriers, government procurement, and trade in civil aircraft. The Canadian delegation said that the first round of consultations will have a positive effect on subsequent talks and that Taiwan's plan to begin bilateral discussions on the government procurement agreement immediately after its accession to GATT is encouraging, Huang reported. Canadian delegates, however, expressed deep concern about some of Taiwan's price and quantity-based taxation systems as well as protective measures for agricultural products, he added. While Canada asked Taiwan to slash tariffs in line with its application as a developed contracting party, Huang said he told the Canadian delegation that Taiwan's import duties on industrial goods are relatively low and that Taiwan remains a developing country in its agricultural sector. The two sides agreed to add service industries to the next round of bilateral consultations, Huang noted. In addition, he said, Canada showed keen interest in exploring Taiwan's telecommunications market. Huang is among a 33-member Taiwan mission here for the fifth meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application, which will open Tuesday and go through Thursday. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng is leading the mission. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
