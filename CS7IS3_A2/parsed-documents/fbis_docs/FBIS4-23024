Kolganov, S.B. Vakulenko, National Antibiotics Research Center, Moscow] [Abstract] The mechanism of clinical enterobacteria strain resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics due to the antibiotics modification by three types of enzymes is discussed, and it is stressed that despite the great diversity of enterobacteria's aminoglycoresistance genes, three-to-four different types of encoding enzymes are predominant among clinical isolates. Consequently, an attempt is made to determine the types of enzymes produced by Serratia marcescens strains which inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics and to identify the genes which encode them. To this end, 31 aminoglycoside antibiotic resistant strains of Serratia marcescens isolated by mid-1908s are used. The experimental procedure and the components used are outlined in detail. The study of the clinical isolates' sensitivity to a number of aminoglycoside antibiotics did not reveal strains which are highly resistant to amikacin yet the microorganisms' levels of sensitivity to this antibiotic varied within 0.5-8 �g/ml. The diameters of the micro-organism growth suppression zones and types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes determined by two methods are summarized, and the conclusion is drawn that DNA-DNA hybridization is a reliable method of determining the presence of the specific resistance genes which makes it possible to identify silent genes which cannot be detected by the AGRP method; the latter, however, is suitable for reliably determining the types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes provided that the strains do not contain genes which code the enzymes with overlapping resistance spectra. Thus, 85% of the strains under study contain other genes encoding aminoglycoside activating enzymes in addition to the gene encoding the AAC(6')-Ic aminoglycosideacetyltransferase; this makes these strains resistant to a broad range of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
