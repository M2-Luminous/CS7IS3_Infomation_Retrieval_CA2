In reply to a question by Radio Monte Carlo, al-Zahhar said that Saudi Arabia, as a government, has not offered any financial assistance to the Hamas Movement. Al-Zahhar said that Saudi Arabia is committed to the Arab stand of supporting the PLO. Al-Zahhar explained that Hamas receives donations from private persons as Zakat [alms tax] funds, which are collected from Muslims and offered to the mujahidin in all parts of the world. These also include donations to the poor, and to the families of martyrs and detainees. He said that these donations are received from many countries, not just from Saudi Arabia and are not government funds. [passage omitted]
