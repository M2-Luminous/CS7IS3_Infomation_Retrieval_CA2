They may possibly be introduced to the public today. This disclosure was made by Lieutenant Colonel Abraham Correa L., chief of that police office, who stated categorically that none of those under arrest had been tortured or mistreated, as persons interested in procuring the captives' release are apparently attempting to claim. Legal Arrests Correa declared that "Operation Nortenito" was the result of many investigations conducted by agents from this office for nearly four months. They began bringing results last Sunday, when several members of this drug trafficking organization were caught "red-handed." They had concealed the drugs inside a truck parked in a garage at the La Atarazana housing complex. The Interpol chief remarked: "With the police intelligence data, the police superintendent in charge, Manuel Velez, was asked to issue the pertinent search and arrest warrants for the suspects, to prevent their possible release later on grounds that the proper legal procedures were not followed." Abraham Correa also confirmed the fact that those in custody had not been mistreated. He said that, on the contrary, they are being visited regularly by members of the Guayas Red Cross, who are responsible for examining them and determining that they are in good condition. He added that this type of procedure had been carried out in previous operations, in which members of the Human Rights Commission also verified that torture was not used to obtain information from the accused. Operation Continuing He also remarked that "Operation Nortenito" is continuing, noting that they are now on the trail of the Colombians, Alejandro Castano Garcia and Agustin Rodriguez Garcia, as well as other persons of different nationalities involved in the drug traffic and who are currently fugitives at large. The seven subjects under arrest are seriously implicated in the possession of 540 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, the international market value of which exceeds $10 million. According to the Interpol investigations, the drugs were to be shipped through this city's seaport to Miami, camouflaged among Colombian products such as cookies, candy, and instant coffee.
