Watanabe told reporters ahead of a meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono on Friday afternoon that "I am groping for (a way) to realize our ideas and principles." But Watanabe did not give a specific answer to a question of whether he has already decided to leave the LDP and set up a new party, saying, "now is not the time to declare it." Asked when he will make an official announcement of his candidacy, Watanabe said, "I have to talk with my party's colleagues before speaking out on a final decision." Kono is to meet with Watanabe in a last-ditch effort to settle on a sole LDP candidate for the prime ministerial election. Political sources said Watanabe's remarks suggest he will reject Kono's request for giving up his candidacy, which may lead to a breakup of the LDP. Although ousted from its 38-year grip on power last August by the coalition government led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the LDP remains the largest force in the Diet. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, once a mentor of Watanabe as the former head of his faction, denied the possibility of Watanabe forming a new political party, saying that such a move "is not imminent."
