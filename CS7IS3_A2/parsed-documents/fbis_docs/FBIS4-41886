Russian Minister for Nuclear Power Engineering Viktor Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS that the agreement will aim to establish partner relations in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He hopes that the former Soviet republics that have nuclear power plants will join the IAEA and sign a similar agreement. Russia will help this process, he said. In 1994 Russia plans to pay part of its debt to the IAEA at a sum of 11 million U.S. dollars. The overall Russian debt to the international organization is estimated at 40 million U.S. dollars. In his turn, the IAEA director-general called on the Russian side for the soonest completion of the construction of nuclear energy- producing facilities. He said that delays are simply not economical. He is also concerned over Russian non-joining of the Paris and Vienna conventions under which specialists from the state guilty of a nuclear accident carry full responsibility for it. In the words of Soskovets, not a single state was affected more than Russia by the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
