A relatively well-off province in China, Liaoning is quite imbalanced in its regional development and there were 3.6 million people living below the poverty line in 1986. Under the government's preferential policies, adopted since 1986, areas in the eastern, western and northern parts of the province have been offered loans of more than 550 million yuan for upgrading and restructuring the local farming industry, enterprises and commercial sectors. Preliminary success has been achieved. The aided projects have created tax-yields and profits of 330 million yuan and benefited some 700,000 families in the past eight years. In addition, public facilities and infrastructure facilities have been improved: 49 highways -- 1,800 kilometers in all -- and more than 100 new bridges were constructed. New irrigation channels and wells were upgraded. Drinking water problems for more than 1.24 million people and 260,000 head of livestock in these areas have been solved.
