There are many reasons for this decision, the spokesman for the Front stated. The academic year-end exams, the deadline for the U.S. sanctions to go into effect, the fact that the population might like to get fresh supplies, the fact that some people, including both Haitians and foreigners, should leave the country before the suspension of the commercial flights scheduled for Saturday, 25 June, are among the reasons that prompted the Front officials to withdraw their call for a strike, according to its spokesman.
