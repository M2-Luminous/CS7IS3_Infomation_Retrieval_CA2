The Results of the Ashgabat Summit: `More Unanimous Than Ever Before,' and, As Usual, Meaningless"] [Text] Failure. Among the 14 conferences of heads of CIS states held up to the present moment, the Ashgabat meeting during 23-24 December was not the first that one can confidently categorize as a failure for the Russian delegation. Representatives of the Russian Federation completed their mission quite ignominiously in all four major clubs whose sessions make up the traditional program of such summits--the councils of defense ministries, foreign affairs ministries, government heads, and presidents. There was no dearth of analytical developments, conclusions, and recommendations prepared for the opening of the summit by specialists from the government apparatus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the administration, who were well oriented for the forthcoming discussion. And probably the simplest thing would have been to explain our current failure by the indisputable fact that Russian officials of the highest ranks who represented the Russian Federation in negotiations with their colleagues in the hateful Commonwealth again demonstrated their deep scorn for the work of their own experts. Documented results of the Ashgabat work of Boris Yeltsin, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Andrey Kozyrev, and Pavel Grachev are filled with the most impressive examples of that "impromptu diplomacy" whose unpredictable rules the Russian leaders have been following recently, unfortunately, not only in contacts with nearby foreign countries. Here are just a couple of examples. For Russian specialists who are reliably informed about the political situation in the Central Asian region, there was no secret about the completely pragmatic objectives pursued by President of Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov in arranging a full-scale meeting with Boris Yeltsin. The only political result of the widely advertised program "Ten Years of Well-Being," which, according the author's intention, was to have transformed the more backward Union republics into a flourishing "second Kuwait," was the rapid formation of a personality cult of the "father of all Turkmens." The efforts of romantics who hoped at least to look beyond its beggarly attributes to signs of an eastern autocratic tradition consecrated over the centuries ended in failure. The failure of the adventure with the hasty exchange of the ruble for the "freely convertible" (in fact it seems to be convertible by force and at an absurd artificial rate) manat only reinforced observers in their conviction that they were dealing with the remnants of an attempt to build socialism of the classical Soviet type in one separate emirate. It is not surprising that attempts by the political relic to establish contacts with the civilized world evoked in democratic states a reaction that was almost instinctual repulsion. The acquisition by Turkmenistan of the status of a full-fledged partner of the Russian Federation was intended above all to quell this reaction even though it partially legitimized Niyazov's regime in the international arena. Hence the persistent initiatives of the Ashgabat leader to complete the bilateral Russian-Turmen summit meeting with the signing of a large intergovernmental agreement. When preparing for the visit, experts persistently recommended to members of the official Russian delegation: A firm condition for consent to the solicitation of the Turkmen elite must be the presentation of reliable guarantees of protection of the civil rights of the republic's Russian-speaking population. The policy of planned pressure on representatives of nonindigenous nationalities from the sphere of state administration, industry, education, and the Army leadership is just as typical of the Ashgabat regime as it is of the majority of its neighbors. The only difference lies in the much more skillful application of demagogic devices to mask ethnic purges and in the reliable control of the press, which could divulge cases of discrimination as well as the precise nullification of the activity of foreign observation missions. The flow of emigrants from Turkmenistan is steadily increasing all the while. In these conditions to agree to the use of pseudoscientific euphemisms that distort the essence of the problem--such as "regulation of migration flows" or "parity guarantees of assistance to resettlers"--would mean to encourage the outflow of the Russian population, forgiving in advance the future transgressions of President Niyazov's regime. There is no counterflow from Russia to Turkmenistan, and none is anticipated in the foreseeable future, the experts reminded them--this has to do with casting a policy of segregation in civilized form. Nonetheless, the president of Russia, ignoring common sense, agreed to sign an agreement on dual citizenship. And the public exercise in a rare genre of political buffoonery--the ceremony in which Boris Yeltsin was awarded a Turmen passport, ordained "an honored citizen of Turkmenistan," and declared to be the first possessor of dual citizenship--was the logical culmination of the bilateral division of the Ashgabat program. A similar motif promised to become central at the multilateral summit. Specialists in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the administration of the president of the Russian Federation had prepared carefully for consultation on the draft "Convention on Ensuring the Rights of Individuals Belonging to National, Ethnic, Linguistic, Cultural, and Religious Minorities." The list of agreements suggested for discussion at the meeting, as usual, snowballed into almost 30 documents. But the draft convention promised to be perhaps the only one for which one could see a critical practical need and clear-cut political meaning. The briefcase of Andrey Kozyrev, who went to the negotiations within the framework of the first official meeting of the Council of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the entire history of the CIS, contained detailed comments on this draft. "Taking into account the priority significance of this convention for Russia," its authors pointed out, "it would be expedient to work for its adoption with a maximum number of participants and to have it signed even if other states object...." Objections could be expected primarily from the delegations from Ukraine and Uzbekistan, who spoke out especially actively against the article of the draft according to which the agreeing parties would make commitments to "adopt legislative, administrative, and other necessary measures on their territory to prevent attempts at assimilation of minorities against their will...." Arguing this opinion in detail, the experts recommended insisting on the fairness of the Russian position and, if necessary, applying pressure to partners in the negotiations, linking the fate of the national majorities to the prospects for economic and military cooperation within the framework of the CIS. But the chief of Russian diplomacy was either not in the mood or not in his best form. Or perhaps he was too impressed by the atmosphere of touchingly feigned hospitality created by the summit officials for highly placed guests (as distinct from the journalists, whose work was organized, let us note, in a simply disgraceful way). In brief, the convention did not reach the point of being discussed by the "presidential club." Mr. Kozyrev allowed it to be sent "for further work to joint groups of experts" for an indefinite period of time and with unclear prospects. Equally doubtful for the Russian side were the results of negotiations on the economic and military sections of the program. After congratulating Turkmenistan on its full-fledged (and not associated) membership in the economic alliance of the CIS, Viktor Chernomyrdin essentially welcomed the expansion of the group of contenders for a chunk of the meager pie of Russian technical credit. And it would be interesting to know what other result Russia could receive from an economic alliance with a state whose leader announces without special embarrassment at a press conference: "We have stood to gain from entering the CIS. We understand. It is just that we would not want for it to be mandatory for the country to carry out the decisions made there...." Well, of course, that is it in a nutshell.... The diplomatic efforts of Pavel Grachev took an altogether unexpected turn. For example, the discussion about protection of Russian Army contingents in keeping with international norms and about granting them the status of military bases on foreign territory suddenly led to a point where Russia took over the burdensome and dangerous duties of protecting the borders of sovereign Turkmenistan. And the agreement of the minister of defense of the Russian Federation to revise the Collective Security Treaty at the insistence of the delegations from Georgia and Azerbaijan will inevitably bring Russia one step closer to direct participation in two open armed conflicts. CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya, it seems, is vigilantly keeping track of the adherence to the tradition according to which at every press conference that is the culmination of another summit they note the "warm atmosphere of cooperation and mutual understanding" of the participants. And neither did he fail to add the remark that in Ashgabat the agreements were adopted "more unanimously than ever before" this time. It seems that the Russian delegation was at great pains to help the observers describe this conference following the canon of the Bible story. If one wished, this form could even be considered appropriate for Christmas. Not Catholic Christmas, of course--it has nothing to do with this. In the capital of Turkmenistan the two-year anniversary of the birth of the Commonwealth, and, naturally, the breakup of the USSR, was celebrated with pomp. The fate of the CIS at the end of these two years is unenviable. They are not being kind to the Commonwealth. They do not even sympathize with it. They are laughing at it.
