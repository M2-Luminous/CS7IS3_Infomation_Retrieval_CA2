FBIS4-28017 "dreas110__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-010-A Daily Report 8 June 1994 ANNEX Japan MOF Trust Fund Bureau Activities Critiqued MOF Trust Fund Bureau Activities Critiqued 942A0145A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5-9 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0145A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Unattributed article in five installments: "A Close Look at the Trust Fund Bureau"; the last installment is based on an interview with Atsushi Miyawaki, senior economist of the Japan Research Institute; place and date not given] [5 Apr 94 p 7] [Text] The fiscal investment and loan program has been, and is being, used not only for successive countercyclical measures but also to subrogate government budget in the funding of certain activities normally covered under the budget's general account. The Trust Fund Bureau of the Ministry of Finance [MOF], which provides the funds for the fiscal investment program, is a gigantic "government purse" with an asset capacity in excess of 320 trillion yen. Recently, this very Trust Fund Bureau began causing a variety of unsettling problems: the disturbance of the bond market caused by the Trust Fund Bureau's sale of its government bond holdings was a case in point. The rising cost of collecting postal savings, a source of funds for the Trust Fund Bureau, and the swollen flow of funds from the Trust Fund Bureau through government-affiliated financial institutions are further exacerbating economic strains. What follows is an investigation of the problems surrounding the Trust Fund Bureau. The Price of Abusing an "Aladdin's Lamp": Hypertrophy Causing Grating Pains Everywhere "No doubt the MOF is waiting for bond prices to rise (pushing the yield down). As soon as the price goes up, for sure the MOF will move to sell its bond holdings. It is too scary to buy bonds." These are the words being whispered around of late among those dealing with the bond market. Clearance Sales of Government Bonds Rocked the Market What the market is wary of is the Trust Fund Bureau's disposal (selling out) of government bonds with no repurchase provisions. The Trust Fund Bureau gathers funds from postal savings and welfare pension premiums and lends them to such institutions as the Housing Loan Corporation and the Japan Highway Public Corporation. The MOF, which manages the Trust Fund Bureau's fund position, on 14 January decided to sell its bond holdings worth some 900 billion yen in successive increments. The reason for the decision was that, as a result of more than 13 trillion yen the Trust Fund Bureau had poured into institutions such as the Housing Loan Corporation and the Small Business Finance Corporation in conjunction with the four rounds of countercyclical measures put into effect since August 1991, the Trust Fund Bureau's fund position became so critical that the ministry decided the only way to get the Trust Fund Bureau out of the fix was to raise additional funds by selling off its government-bond holdings on the market. The disposal by the Trust Fund Bureau of its government bond holdings began on 21 January. The sale on that day was worth 102.8 billion yen; it was followed by another sale on 4 February which was worth 115.3 billion yen, and by yet another sale worth 86.8 billion yen on 21 February. These sales of government bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau rocked the market severely. The yield on long-term government bonds, which was at the 2.9 percent range early in January, rose sharply to reach above 4 percent at the beginning of March. In the interest of supporting the bond market, the current situation would normally call for a buying-up operation either by the Trust Fund Bureau or by using the National Debt Consolidation Fund; however, sources within the MOF categorically state that "no such action is being considered at all" (words of an official of the Financial Bureau, MOF). The Trust Fund Bureau of course is in no shape to take such an action, but another factor is that even the National Debt Consolidation Fund, too, cannot be of much help because there is a two-year suspension of fixed-rate transfers of funds into the reserves for government bond redemption; "even if they wanted to run a buying operation, they lack the resources for it." The Bank of Japan Frowns at the Trust Fund Bureau Action Not only is the MOF planning no action to support the bond market, it is rather poised to sell at the next appropriate time the remainder of its government bond holdings originally planned for disposal--the remainder worth some 600 billion yen. The sales of government bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau have triggered a sharp rise in long-term interest rates. As a result, the bank's lending rates have begun to rise as well, spawning a fear that all this could once again prove to be a drag on the economy which at last is beginning to show some signs of brightness. It is said that "even the Bank of Japan is frowning at the Trust Fund Bureau's recent moves" (according to a ranking city bank). A dispute arose within the MOF in the fall of 1993. Fumio Inui, chief of the First Fund Planning and Operation Division, Financial Bureau, MOF, who controls the Trust Fund Bureau's affairs, complaining bitterly about the dire fund position of the Trust Fund Bureau, took firm stand against the ministry's Budget Bureau responsible for the preparation of the general-account budget: he told the Budget Bureau that the Trust Fund Bureau "could no longer cooperate with them as actively as it had done before." Over the past years, the Trust Fund Bureau has turned into a handy reservoir of funds which can be tapped into to circumvent shortfalls in the general-account budget whose fiscal condition has become increasingly tight. To be specific, it is the Trust Fund Bureau that has provided funds to the National Railway Settlement Corporation that inherited the old liabilities of the former National Railways; also, it is the Trust Fund Bureau that pitches in with funds to meet any shortfall in local allocation tax revenue which the central government must distribute to local governments. In the final analysis, what enabled the government to somehow muddle through with its countercyclical measures was the availability of a "trump card" at its disposal--i.e., a bold expansion of the fiscal investment plans financed by the Trust Fund Bureau's funds. Public properties and facilities, the benefit of which is widely shared by the people, shall be paid for with the general-account funds, while semi-public facilities such as expressways shall be funded by the Trust Fund Bureau--this guiding principle broke down long ago; it cannot be denied that there has been a tendency by the government to readily make use of the Trust Fund Bureau as the source of "invisible loans" for national and local self-governing entities. The Trust Fund Bureau has been abused like an "Aladdin's lamp." In the background responsible for the abuse is the handy availability of Trust Fund Bureau funds, the utilization of which for a period of less than five years does not even require consent of the Diet. Neither a temporary transfer of Trust Fund Bureau funds into the Special Account for Local Allocation Tax nor a disposal of the Trust Fund Bureau's government-bond holdings is ever reflected in the fiscal investment and loan plan submitted to the Diet. The assets in the Trust Fund Bureau's custody, which totaled less than 100 trillion yen in the 1980's, have ballooned to 321 trillion yen, some of which have been coming in and out of the Trust Fund Bureau without being checked by anybody. But the Trust Fund Bureau's surplus funds have reached the bottom; furthermore, the Trust Fund Bureau is now being hit by a "market backlash" in the form of a sharp drop in bond prices. Information Disclosure Should Be the First Step "The time has come to review the question of the Trust Fund Bureau's `posture as it ought to be,' including the ideal way of fiscal operations." These words advocating reform of the Trust Fund Bureau were spoken by none other than Seiji Kanematsu, chairman of the Fund Operation Council (an advisory body for ministers of finance and of posts and telecommunications). It would not be easy to apply a surgical knife to the Trust Fund Bureau, which is even likened to a house of demons. Would it be wrong to suggest that the first step toward reform should be to promote disclosure of information regarding the Trust Fund Bureau in such terms that can be understood even by ordinary people? [6 Apr 94 p 7] [Text] Disparity Between "Fund Procurement" and "Fund Operation": Contradiction Widens Due to Deregulation of Interest Rates "What you are saying is absolutely no different from the very logic being pursued by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT]." This has been the caustic criticism leveled at (Hiroshi) Nagano, councilor to the MOF's Banking Bureau, every time he made a round of city banks and reginal banks since the middle of February to lay a certain groundwork. Concern of the Private Sector Failed To Be Dispelled The aim of the groundwork has been to gain acceptance by the banks of the MOF's proposal concerning the question of deregulating the interest rates on liquid deposits and savings which can readily be deposited and withdrawn; one of the key points of the proposal reads, "The interest-rate differential between regular postal savings (current rate 1.32 percent) and the ordinary bank deposit (current rate 0.22 percent) shall be maintained at 1.1 percent for the present time." The reason for the MOF's drive to get its proposal through is twofold: First, it would mean a culmination of the deposit rate deregulation effort of 15 years standing; second, the MOF feels obliged to get this matter settled somehow or other because, for one thing, Japan officially promised the United States to put interest-rate deregulation into effect before the end of 1994. Councilor Nagano has sought the banking industry's understanding of the MOF's position as to why the bank deposit cannot be given unduly favorable consideration in the proposed deregulation of interest rates. But the debate between him and the industry has failed to reach a point of agreement. Behind the industry's objection to the MOF's position is a fear that "the rate differential between the ordinary bank deposit and postal savings might further widen and thereby cause a shift of even more funds from one to the other" (words of the planning officer at a leading city bank). As a matter of fact, in fiscal 1993 regular postal savings, contemptuously outdistancing the stagnant ordinary deposit in commercial banks, recorded the highest growth ever. Early in February, an economic research institute affiliated with another major bank completed an "internal use only" report. The report contains a coolheaded analysis of the relationship, prone to be emotionally antagonistic, between the bank and the postal savings; not only does the report give equal airing to the positions of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan and the MOPT on each point at issue, it also attempts to assess the present situation from an objective standpoint. The State's Credit Standing Not Reflected Deserving of particular attention is the portion of the report dealing with the rivalry between the postal savings program and the bank. In reference to postal savings, while the bankers federation calls it "a privileged entity" and even those managing it take a subjective view that "being a government enterprise, it is subject to many restrictions," the report in question coolly points out that "(the level of interest rate on postal savings) does not reflect the state's credit standing." The report takes this position because determination of interest rates on the basis of credit standings is a major principle of the free financial market. Article 3 of the Postal Savings Law stipulates: "The state guarantees the repayment of the money deposited into the postal savings account and the payment of interest on such savings." In a sense, postal savings are a deposit with the highest credit standing within the country. If sound market mechanisms were at work, the common-sense view is that it should suffice to pay low interest to the users of the postal savings system. Historically, however, it has been the other way around. For more than 40 years since April 1952, the rate differential between regular postal savings and ordinary bank deposits has never gone below the 1.0 percent level. This means that "a strange situation from the standpoint of financial common sense" (words of an "old boy" of the MOF Banking Bureau) has been kept in place. Because of the tight fiscal situation of the general account section of the budget, the Trust Fund Bureau is being subjected to ever-increasing demands for funds. As of the end of February 1994, the postal savings system had deposited 181 trillion yen in the Trust Fund Bureau, the sum equivalent to 56 percent of Trust Fund Bureau's total liabilities. The more the role of fiscal investment and loan programs expands, the more necessary it would become to maintain the fund collection power of the postal savings system. For this reason, the interest rate on postal savings cannot be held down too low. The aformentioned MOF's proposal was seen by those of the private-sector financial world as a move "to subjugate the setting of interest rates to the logic of fiscal operations." A big problem the Trust Fund Bureau has is the existence of a disparity between the real interest paid on funds procured (i.e., interest paid on postal savings) and the interest earned from fund operations (i.e., interest earned on fiscal investments). For example, for a period of two years and three months from January 1990, the interest rates on regular postal savings stayed at high levels between 2.16 percent and 3.48 percent, while the fiscal investment interest rate (the same as the deposit rate) remained at 2.0 percent (for a period of more than one month but less than three months). This negative spread surfaces as a deficit in the Postal Savings Special Account. Application of Market Forces Needed The principle of allowing the rates on deposits of accounting officers to change in tandem with the movement of interest rates on the market has been introduced, but this applies only to long-term deposits of seven years or more. The rates on short- and medium-term deposits of less than seven years are still hardly reflective of market interest rates. Some people are saying: "No matter how deregulated the rates on postal savings may be, as long as the interest rates on fiscal investments and on the deposits of accounting officers are kept detached from the movement of market interest rates, the problem will not be resolved. As the deregulation of interest rates progresses, it is possible that the postal savings system will have to bear a higher cost than before in order to collect funds. Furthermore, lending at low rates under the slogan of "policy-guided finance" will further exacerbate the Trust Fund Bureau's contradiction known as a "negative spread." The secretariat of the Committee on Andit in the upper house of the Diet analyzes the situation this way: "The postal savings system is prone to red ink. Its structure is such that it will not be able to raise funds unless the rates on deposits are either set higher or increased on a continuing basis." The postal savings issue, as a point of "entry" into the question of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, is not merely a problem of rivalry with the private-sector financial institutions. Simply discussing the rate differential between postal savings and bank deposits and the marketability of "fixed-amount savings" as a new product will not lead to a fundamental solution. The following is a fair statement: "The situation has reached a point where a new kind of fiscal investment system must be introduced--a system that makes full use of market forces, including the deregulation of interest rates relevant to the Trust Fund Bureau's procurement and investment of funds" (words of a leading official of a long-term credit bank). To the Trust Fund Bureau system, the fiscal investment system, and the postal savings system as a whole, financial deregulation is the biggest Achilles' heel right now. [7 Apr 94 p 7] [Text] Ballooning Lending by "Government Banks": Outdoing the Private Sector Qualitatively and Quantitatively "If given (from the government) as much interest subsidy as 400 billion yen (the amount given to the Housing Loan Corporation), we in the private sector, too, can offer competitive interest rates." With private-sector financial institutions unable to increase their lending activity even if they wanted to, the vice president of a certain city bank, who made the above remarks, looked bitter about the growing volume of housing loans being issued by the Housing Loan Corporation. The Public Sector's Share Exceeds 50 Percent For fiscal 1993, government subsidies given to government-affiliated financial institutions out of the general account funds are estimated to have reached some 560 billion yen. Of the total, the largest portion--400 billion yen--went to the Housing Loan Corporation, followed by more than 100 billion yen to the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance Corporation. In the case of the Housing Loan Corporation, the subsidy it received, if calculated in terms of interest, was equivalent to 0.7 percent. Which means that they were able to reduce their lending interest rate by that much. Similarly, in the case of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance Corporation, the subsidy was equivalent to 1.9 percent of its lending rate. From 11 April on, city banks' housing loans will carry a fixed interest rate of 5.82 percent. Between this and the standard rate (4.05 percent annual) charged by the Housing Loan Corporation, there is a differential of nearly 2 percent. What has happened is that "market forces are not working in the field of housing financing" (a leading official of a ranking city bank). On the strength of their overwhelming advantageous lending terms, government-affiliated financial institutions are doing a ballooning business in making loans. According to Bank of Japan statistics, the government-affiliated financial institutions, comprised of two banks, one of which is Japan Development Bank, and nine finance corporations, including the Housing Loan Corporation, had as of the end of January 1994 outstanding loan balances totaling slightly less than 118 trillion yen, which represented 11-percent growth from a year earlier. During the same period, total lending by all banks nationwide grew only by 0.1 percent. The share of public lending, too, has gradually increased. According to the Bank of Japan's "flow of funds accounts," of the fiscal 1992 growth in combined lending by the private sector and public finance institutions, the share of public lending was more than one half--53 percent to be specific. The share apparently increased even more in fiscal 1993. The share of government-affiliated financial institutions alone was 22 percent, but it has been growing for these past few years. It appears that "public financing, originally meant to play a supporting role only, has assumed the leading role." This is due in part to the increased lending by government-affiliated financial institutions in order to stimulate the economy. Those of the private sector are rebellious--they are complaining: "government-affiliated institutions, whose intrinsic role should be to complement the private sector, have come barging into the field of lending which the private sector is capable of handling." According to a survey by a major bank, more than half of the loans issued by the Japan Development Bank are concentrated on 30 business firms that are among the top loan customers of private-sector financial institutions. Although in form these government-affiliated institutions are still sticking with project financing which is supposed to be handled on a case-by-case basis, they are said to be disproportionately concentrating their lending to "just those big companies whose borrowing needs can be fully accommodated by the private sector as well." Target Criteria for Lending Broadened In order to give preferential treatment to those projects that meet policy objectives, government-affiliated financial institutions have in place a system of "special interest rates" that are lower than the standard rates. This explains why private-sector financing officers are saying that they are "unable to compete with government-affiliated financial institutions when it comes to lending terms." Although it is not disclosed as to what percentage of the lending by government-affiliated financial institutions is at such special rates, the realistic sense of the private sector is that the percentage "is increasing quite a bit." The Japan Development Bank Law was revised in 1972, 1985, and 1991. Each revision led to a broadening of the scope of lending criteria. Lending for alternative energy projects began in 1980 and for improvement of key railways and augmentation of industrial structure in 1987. More recently, a loan program has been initiated for the purpose of promoting energy-saving equipment investment. All this means that government-affiliated financial institutions have become hypertrophied not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. But there are recent indications that some among the government-affiliated financial institutions, whose lending has been rapidly increasing, are leaving some of the fiscal investment funds allocated to them unspent. As a result of the repeated countercyclical measures that significantly expanded the lending limits of government-affiliated financial institutions, some of these institutions are saying: "However much we lend, we seem perpetually unable to fully digest our lending limits" (a leading official of a certain government-affiliated financial institution). According to a survey conducted by financial quarters on the basis of government-affiliated financial institutions' own statements of accounts and audit reports on their statements, the delinquency ratio of the loans issued by these institutions was 0.5 percent as of fiscal 1991. That ratio, though healthy in comparison with the private-sector ratio which had risen to about 3 percent on an average, has been on an uptrend. Specialization in Augmentation of Infrastructure "Given the need to increase public investment so as to digest excess savings, there should be a role to fulfill for fiscal investment agencies," says Hirohiko Okumura, research director of the Nomura Research Institute. According to him, even though Japan's capital flow is bulging with funds from such sources as life insurance and pension programs--the kind of money which ought to be utilized for long-term investment, such funds are being utilized only for short-term investment simply because short-term real interest rates are higher. He also says that the failure to channel the funds, which should be used for repleting infrastructure, to long-term investment is hampering growth of the Japanese economy. Intrinsically, government-affiliated financial institutions are charged with the task of providing funds to such projects which are difficult for private-sector financial institutions to handle. Thus, it seems even reasonable to say that for government-affiliated financial institutions to take the road of specialization in the financing of large-scale infrastructure augmentation projects that preclude competition with the private sector would, in the final analysis, lead to the redressing of the distortians now occurring in the flow of funds. [8 Apr 94 p 7] [Text] Absence of Fund Manager Leads Safety, Effectiveness of Fiscal Investment To Go Askew In his domestic speech delivered on 23 March, Under Secretary of Treasury Summers of the U.S. Government raised the subject of opening up the "assets management" market as an item to be demanded of Japan. Clearly, by "assets management" he was referring to the investment management of public pension funds; it is also clear that he was demanding the lifting of Japan's ban on entrusting its public pension funds to investment advisory firms for management. Mr. Summers' position on this subject is substantially the same as a standing demand of the Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] to the MOF; therefore, it is bound to prove to be a powerful reinforcement to the MHW whose negotiations with the MOF are having tough going. An Annual Profit Margin of 3 Percent The welfare pension and national pension reserve funds are placed in trust with the Trust Fund Bureau, from whom the Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation [PWSPC, which is supervised by the MHW] borrows some of the funds for investment purposes. In other words, the PWSPC is engaged in independent investment activities using the Trust Fund Bureau fund; the amount of money so invested was roughly 19.5 trillion yen as of the end of fiscal 1993. At present, the PWSPC is allowed to consign such investment activities to life insurance companies and trust companies only; however, it is the contention of the MHW and the U.S. Government that the consigness should be expanded to include investment advisory firms. But this independent investment program using public pension funds has been a losing proposition on a continuing basis. Due, among other things, to the falling stock prices, the investment yield has been less than the interest paid on the money borrowed from the Trust Fund Bureau; the program apparently ended fiscal 1993 in the red for the third time in as many years. These investment losses cut into the reserve funds; however, despite such poor performances, the MHW shows no signs of weakening its demand for an expansion of the independent investment program. There is a trial calculation made by the PWSPC. It shows that during the 20-year period from fiscal 1973 to fiscal 1992 the combined value of the prices of and dividends accrued from all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased at an average annual rate of 9.65 percent, while the borrowing interest rate from the Trust Fund Bureau averaged at 6.65 percent. Granted, stock prices fell in some of those years; still, over the long haul, investments in that period should have enjoyed a 3-percent profit margin, mathematically. The PWSPC is confident that "the efficiency of the independent investment program would improve if funds were invested for longer terms and through diversified consigness who would have to compete harder." According to the MHW, due to sharply rising annuity payments there is a probability that by fiscal 2025 the welfare pension insurance premium could balloon to 29.6 percent (to be split 50-50 between the employer and the employee; currently 14.5 percent) of the worker's monthly pay. The MHW is adamant about the merit of the independent investment program, saying that the program's success would add to pension reserve funds and thereby "lessen the burdens on the people." Expansion Conceals Debts But the MOF's position is that "investment in stocks could very well hurt the stability of the pension funds" (the ministry's Financial Bureau). The position reflects the MOF's desire to maintain its influence over the pension funds, but there is more to it than that: the same line of thinking governs the MOF's posture vis-a-vis the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which is also seeking an expansion of its independent investment authority over the postal savings fund. Because postal savings and pension funds must sooner or later be refunded or paid out as benefits, it is only natural to demand that their investment management be safe and secure. But this logic, preached by the Trust Fund Bureau, is being violated by the Trust Fund Bureau itself. A typical example of the Trust Fund Bureau's fund management, which is anything but safe and secure, is the lending to the National Railway Settlement Corporation which inherited the liabilities of the former National Railways. This settlement corporation is saddled with liabilities exceeding 20 trillion yen; yet, because of the difficulty in selling land assets, also inherited from the old National Railways, the corporation must borrow huge sums of money just to make interest payments on debts. For fiscal 1994, the Trust Fund Bureau plans to provide the corporation more than 1.2 trillion yen out of the fiscal investment fund; some are calling this planned funding "additional lending pure and simple, designed to preserve the old debt" (a major city bank). The Trust Fund Bureau is also planning 280 billion yen of fiscal investment fund into the National Forest Service Special Account, which is perpetually in the red, to help repay loans. Meanwhile, nonperforming loans on the books of government-affiliated financial institutions are increasing sharply. If the money tied up in all these fiscal investments by the Trust Fund Bureau cannot be recovered, the resulting losses will have to be covered with the general-account funds. In other words, ultimately it is the people's tax money that must come to the rescue of such losses; in this sense, the Trust Fund Bureau's fiscal investment program is even riskier than the aforementioned independent investment of pension funds. As the fiscal investment program grows to take over more of the funding activities normally covered under the general acccount, the number of agencies receiving such fiscal investments has also increased. At present there are 61 institutions on the receiving end of the fiscal investment program--more than a fourfold increase during these past 40 years; it is not incorrect to say that hidden behind such an easy expansion of this program are national debts. Reorganization of Investment Outlets Essential Looking at it as a whole, the fiscal investment program is structured to operate on a "negative interest margin": On the procurement side, its funds are raised at high interest rates; on the investment side, its funds so raised are lent out through government-affiliated financial institutions at lower interest rates for policy reasons. It is only natural, therefore, that there be a demand for higher investment efficiency to make up for the negative spread; however, as long as the program is devoid of "fund managers" capable of investing the funds safely and profitably, chances are the program will grow even more awry. The Japan Research Institute points out: "To reform the fiscal investment program, investment agencies must be reorganized as the first step." Given the outlook for a declining inflow of money into pension funds, for example, a review of the investment outlets is a must in the interest of curtailing easy-going investments and loans; also, such a review has a bearing on the question of clearly differentiating the role of financial administration and that of fiscal investment. Reorganization and consolidation of the investment outlets is an integral part of the administrative reform itself which is hardly making progress; nevertheless, that is where a surgical knife must be applied if the ailing fiscal investment system is to be saved. [9 Apr 94 p 6] [Text] How should the Trust Fund Bureau, which has grown markedly creaky, be reformed in order to bring it in line with the new era? In search of the answer to this question, we at the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sought the views of senior economist [Atsushi] Miyawaki of the Japan Research Institute, who is conversant with this subject area. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think are the biggest problems relative to the Trust Fund Bureau and its fiscal investment and loan program? [Miyawaki] The Trust Fund Bureau has forgotten the basic fact that its financial resources made up of postal savings and pension insurance premiums are assets of the people. When individuals place their money in trust with an investment agent, they naturally expect the agent to invest the money profitably; also, they are kept informed by the agent as to where and how their money is being invested. This does not obtain in the case of the Trust Fund Bureau, however. The amounts of money allocated to public corporations, some called "Kosha" and others called "Kodan," are made public; however, the details are obscure as to where exactly the postal savings money and pension funds placed in the Trust Fund Bureau's care have ended up. Especially when it comes to short-term use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, the picture is like a "black box": not clear are even such details as the purpose of outlay and the balance between outlay and revenue. Moreover, the Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used increasingly of late to cover budget deficits and for financial juggling between the central government and local jurisdictions or between the treasury and special accounts. For instance, the Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used by government-affiliated financial institutines to make loans which from the beginning can be expected to be irrecoverable to some extent as in the case of the loans issued by the Export-Import Bank of Japan that have taken on more and more of the foreign aid character. Such use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund can hardly be termed as profitable and safe investments. Interest Subsidies to the Private Sector [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But the fiscal investment program has the role of providing funds for those purposes which the private sector cannot accommodate. Isn't there some aspect of the program which cannot be helped even if it violates the principle of profitable investment? [Miyawaki] Indeed there is. But even then, should there be so many fiscal investment agencies as there are at present? One cannot ignore the costs required to operate these agencies and to pay their personnel expenses. For example, the policy objective of providing low-interest loans to home buyers can be fulfilled without the presence of the Housing Loan Corporation. Home buyers seeking loans from the Housing Loan Corporation usually go through the windows of private-sector financial institutions. This being the case, all it takes is to give private-sector financial institutions interest subsidies and let them make low-interest loans using their own funds to individual home buyers. Application of the same interest-subsidy program would make it possible to accommodate the functions of such other government-affiliated financial institutions as the Small Business Finance Corporation, whose rivalry with private-sector institutions has been on the rise. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the Trust Fund Bureau's financial resources will continue to increase satisfactorily in the days ahead? [Miyawaki] That outlook is quite opaque. In the case of pension funds, clearly it will be diminishing. It is the balance between the pension insurance premiums paid in and annuities paid out that is placed in trust with the Trust Fund Bureau; as a result of society's progressive aging, the yearly inflow of premiums to pension funds currently amounting to 5-6 trilion yen is expected to shrink to a mere 1 trillion yen or so by 2010. Thus, the Trust Fund Bureau will necessarily be obliged to rely on postal savings as its only source of funds; however, given the ongoing trend toward financial diregulation, it remains to be seen whether or not the postal savings system will continue to be able to absorb funds in terms more favorable than the private sector's. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How best do you suggest a surgical knife be applied to the Trust Fund Bureau? Introduction of Fiscal-Investment Bonds Would Be Effective [Miyawaki] First of all, the Trust Fund Bureau should stop using its funds for those objectives which can more appropriately be covered by tax money or government bond. Any money used to make up for the deficits incurred by the National Railway Settlement Corporation, the National Forest Service Special Account, etc. is money that will never come back. For medium- and long-term purposes, the Trust Fund Bureau should classify its funding activities into "class-A fiscal investments," which are to be funded with funds recovered from previous investments, and "class-B fiscal investments," which are to be funded with new revenues expected in the future. Regarding the "class-A fiscal investments," funding levels should be reduced to those agencies engaged in such projects which can be handled competitively by the private sector, and should limit all new investment targets to the development of high-risk technologies and the augmentation of life-related infrastructure. As for the "class-B fiscal investments," the Trust Fund Bureau should aim for profitable investments just like life insurance companies and other private-sector institutional investors are doing. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How should the effort proceed to rationalize public corporations and other fiscal investment agencies? [Miyawaki] One idea would be to introduce a scheme whereby all such agencies are to issue fiscal investment bonds as a means to raise their own funds. Under such a scheme, ineffective agencies will only be able to raise funds at a high cost and therefore their very existence will be threatened. In this sense, the principle of competition will be put to work as well under such a scheme. Of course, to those agencies that must perform a social role, the idea of giving them interest subsidies out of the general account funds may be entertained.
