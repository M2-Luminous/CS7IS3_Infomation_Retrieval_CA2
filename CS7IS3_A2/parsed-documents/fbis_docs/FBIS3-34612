As you heard, we now have a signed agreement. Here are some details. The agreement is, in fact, the same one the parties achieved in Davos. It comprises two parts: one addressing the border crossings issue, namely everything pertaining to Jericho, and another addressing the other disputed issues pertaining to Jericho and Gaza. The first, which speaks of crossings, is an eight-page document, and the second, a three-page document, speaks of the other security problems pertaining to Gaza and Jericho, such as traffic axes in Gaza and the size of the Jericho area. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' reply to a question indicates that the size of the Jericho area was not established. What the sides did conclude were the principles governing the establishment of the Jericho size. The size of the Jericho area will be finalized only by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat. [passage omitted] Many issues remain unresolved, including the powers of the Palestinian police and the powers of the Palestinian council. [passage omitted] [Semrik] Udi, are we to understand that the signed document is an agreement in principle on security issues, but not yet a detailed agreement on security issues? [Segal] This is indeed a detailed agreement. Some of the clauses are phrased in great detail. For instance, each clause on the border crossings issue and on the issue of general control are detailed. The crossings issue was the one that threatened to kill the whole deal. Today's document specifies how people will cross the borders, how Palestinians will be inspected in a way that will preserve their dignity. It stipulates that Israel will reserve the right to inspect suspects crossing the borders. All these matters were agreed in detail, but agreement on other issues, such as the size of Jericho, was achieved in principle only. [passage omitted]
