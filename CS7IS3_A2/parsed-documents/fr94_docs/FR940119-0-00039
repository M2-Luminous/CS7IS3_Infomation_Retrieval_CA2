FR940119-0-00039 FR940119-0-00012 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 59 [Docket No. FEMA&hyph;7589] Suspension of Community Eligibility AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule identifies a community, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), that will be suspended on the effective date listed within this rule because of failure to enforce floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives documentation that the community has taken action to bring their floodplain management program into compliance with NFIP requirements prior to the effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the Federal Register . EFFECTIVE DATES: The effective date of each community's suspension is the third date (``Susp.'') listed in the third column of the following tables. ADDRESSES: If you wish to determine whether a particular community was suspended on the suspension date, contact the appropriate FEMA Regional Office or the NFIP servicing contractor. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert F. Shea, Division Director, Program Implementation Division, Mitigation Directorate, 500 C Street, SW., room 417, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;2717. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return, communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq ., unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures. The community listed in this document no longer meets that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations, 44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the community will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, the community may submit the required documentation to bring its floodplain management program in compliance with the NFIP regulatory standards, after this rule is published but prior to the actual suspension date. If the documentation is submitted and approved by FEMA, the community will not be suspended and will continue its eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the community will be published in the Federal Register . In addition, FEMA has identified the special flood hazard areas in the community by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for more than a year, on FEMA's initial flood insurance map of the community as having flood-prone areas (Section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities listed on the date shown in the last column. The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. This community received a 90-day, and two 30-day notifications addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days. National Environmental Policy Act This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage unless an appropriate public body adopts and enforces adequate floodplain management measures. The community listed no longer complies with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community unless it takes remedial action. Regulatory Impact Analysis This rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, February 17, 1981, 3 CFR, 1981 comp., p. 127. No regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Executive Order 12612, Federalism This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October 26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 comp., p. 252. Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195, 3 CFR, 1991 comp., p. 309.
