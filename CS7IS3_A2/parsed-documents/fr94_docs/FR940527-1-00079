FR940527-1-00079 FR940527-1-00014 We reiterate that, to qualify for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, an osteopathic hospital's number of discharges for its cost reporting period that began during FY 1993 would have to be at least 3,000. 3. Retention of Referral Center Status Section 412.96(f) states that each hospital receiving the referral center adjustment is reviewed every 3 years to determine if the hospital continues to meet the criteria for referral center status. To retain status as a referral center, a hospital must meet the criteria for classification as a referral center specified in §412.96 (b)(1) or (b)(2) or (c) for 2 of the last 3 years, or for the current year. A hospital may meet any one of the three sets of criteria for individual years during the 3-year period or the current year. For example, a hospital may meet the two mandatory requirements in §412.96(c)(1) (case-mix index) and (c)(2) (number of discharges) and the optional criterion in paragraph (c)(3) (medical staff) during the first year. During the second or third year, the hospital may meet the criteria under §412.96(b)(1) (rural location and appropriate bed size). A hospital must meet all of the criteria within any one of these three sections of the regulations in order to meet the retention requirement for a given year. That is, it will have to meet all of the criteria of §412.96(b)(1) or §412.96(b)(2) or §412.96(c). For example, if a hospital meets the case-mix index standards in §412.96(c)(1) in years 1 and 3 and the number of discharge standards in §412.96(c)(2) in years 2 and 3, it will not meet the retention criteria. All of the standards would have to be met in the same year. The requirement for triennial review was originally added to the regulations in 1984, to be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 (the end of the first 3 years of the referral center adjustment). However, three statutory moratoriums on the performance of the triennial reviews were enacted by Congress. The third of these moratoriums expires at the end of cost reporting periods that began during FY 1994. (See the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46310) for a detailed explanation of the moratorium and the implementation of the triennial reviews.) With the expiration of the current moratorium, we will begin reviewing each rural referral center's compliance with the triennial review criteria effective with cost reporting periods beginning on and after October 1, 1994. As noted above, although rural referral centers will no longer be paid a higher standardized amount than other rural hospitals, hospitals approved as rural referral centers continue to be entitled to higher disproportionate share payments and continue to receive preferential consideration before the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. Therefore, we believe it is important that only those hospitals that meet the rural referral center triennial review criteria continue to be so classified. Thus, effective with cost reporting periods beginning on and after October 1, 1994, a hospital that has been classified as a referral center for at least 3 years will be subject to the triennial review criteria as discussed below. In accordance with §412.96(f)(2), the review process is limited to the hospital's compliance during the last 3 years. Thus, if a hospital meets the criteria in effect for at least 2 of the last 3 years or if it meets the criteria in effect for the current year (that is, the criteria for FY 1995 outlined above in this section of the preamble), it will retain its status for another 3 years. No hospital is subject to a review until the end of its third full cost reporting period as a referral center. We have constructed the following chart and example to aid hospitals that qualify as referral centers under the criteria in §412.96(c) in projecting whether they will retain their status as a referral center. Under §412.96(f), to qualify for a 3-year extension effective with cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995, a hospital must meet the criteria in §412.96(c) for FY 1995 or it must meet the criteria for 2 of the last 3 years as follows: ␣ 1For the cost reporting period beginning during FY 1Use hospital's case-mix index for FY 1Use the discharges for the hospital's cost reporting period beginning during FY 1Use numerical standards as published in the Federal Register on 1994 1992 1992 September 1, 1993. 1993 1991 1991 September 1, 1992. 1992 1990 1990 August 30, 1991.
