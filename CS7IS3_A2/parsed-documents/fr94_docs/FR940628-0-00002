FR940628-0-00002 FR940628-0-00001 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 1610 Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles; Amendment to Remove Footnotes AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission is amending the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles by removing two footnotes which identify a particular firm as the source for two items of test equipment specified in the standard. The Commission has learned that the firm named in the footnote is not the only source of the equipment used to determine if fabrics and garments comply with the clothing textiles flammability standard. For this reason, the Commission has decided to remove the footnotes. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective on June 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Allen F. Brauninger, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301) 504&hyph;0980. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (16 CFR Part 1610) is applicable to clothing and to textile fabrics intended for use in clothing. This standard prescribes a test to determine whether clothing and fabrics intended for use in clothing are dangerously flammable because of ``rapid and intense burning.'' A. Origin of the Standard The clothing textiles flammability standard was first published by the Department of Commerce in 1953 as a voluntary commercial standard designated ``Flammability of Clothing Textiles, Commercial Standard (CS) 191&hyph;53.'' In the same year, Congress enacted the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 (Pub. L. 83&hyph;88, 67 Stat. 111). As enacted in 1953, and amended in 1954, the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 prohibits the importation, manufacture for sale, or the sale in commerce of any article of wearing apparel, or any fabric used or intended for use in wearing apparel, which is ``so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 specifies that the test in CS 191&hyph;53 shall be used to determine if a fabric or article of wearing apparel is ``so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 placed enforcement authority with the Federal Trade Commission. In 1967, Congress amended the Flammable Fabrics Act to expand its coverage to include products of interior furnishing and wearing apparel made from fabric or related material, and fabric or related material used or intended for use in products of interior furnishing and wearing apparel. The 1967 amendment authorized the Secretary of Commerce to issue flammability standards by rulemaking proceedings. Enforcement responsibility remained with the Federal Trade Commission. The Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended in 1967, is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1191 through 1204. An uncodified savings clause in the 1967 amendment continued the flammability standard for clothing textiles mandated by the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 in effect until such time as it is amended or superseded in accordance with the procedures specified by the 1967 amendment. See section 11 of Pub. L. 90&hyph;189, 81 Stat. 568, December 14, 1967. In 1972, Congress enacted the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq .), which established the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSA also transferred to the Commission the authority formerly held by the Secretary of Commerce to issue and amend flammability standards, and the authority formerly held by the Federal Trade Commission to enforce flammability standards. See 15 U.S.C. 2079(b). In 1975, the Commission codified the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 at 16 CFR Part 1609, and the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles at 16 CFR Part 1610. See 40 FR 59931 (December 30, 1975). The Commission's codification of the flammability standard for clothing textiles included all of the footnotes contained in Commercial Standard 191&hyph;53, as published by the Department of Commerce. B. Firm Named in Footnotes Section 4.2 of CS 191&hyph;53 describes an item of test apparatus called the ``flammability tester'' in the following language: Flammability tester .3The Flammability Tester consists of a draft-proof ventilated chamber enclosing a standard ignition medium, sample rack, and automatic timing device. * * * * * 3This apparatus is manufactured by the United States Testing Co., 1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, N.J. Blue prints of working plans for the manufacture of this apparatus are available, at a nominal charge, from the above-named firm. Section 4.3 of CS 191&hyph;53 described an item of equipment called a ``brushing device.'' A footnote to section 4.3 states: 5This device is manufactured by the United States Testing Co., 1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, N.J. These provisions, including the footnotes, are codified at 16 CFR 1610.4(b) and 1610.4(c)(1). The Commission has received information that similar items of equipment are presently available from several sources. When CS 191&hyph;53 was first published, a need may have existed to name a specific firm as the source for particular items of test equipment specified by the standard. However, because more than one firm now supplies the test equipment, that need no longer exists.
