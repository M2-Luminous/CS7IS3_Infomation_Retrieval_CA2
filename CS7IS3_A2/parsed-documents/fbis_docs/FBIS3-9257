Patriotism, therefore, is measured by expenditure on the military budget. That is why recently in the Yugoslav assembly, not only the Socialists but also experts and politicians from the Democratic Party stated decisively: We shall vote for this proposal for the federal budget only because it is a military one. Fair enough! Things are what they are. Of the planned 1,674 million dinars, 1,264 million dinars, or 75.5 percent, of the budget has been allocated to military requirements. That is the way to go: Our army -- is that not so? -- has always been the surest guarantee for the maintenance of our homeland and its (unknown) borders. However, a few days ago the owner of a private business spoke out, saying that he was no less patriotic than those who proposed the federal budget, but since he was personally contributing a sizable amount to the military budget, he would like to know "what the people will be getting out of the 100,000 soldiers and 100,000 policemen?" After all, the citizens must get something in return, perhaps beatings and more beatings.... Because, God forbid that the authorities could be thinking that it is in the interest of the taxpayers to fill the coffers of the army and the police to the maximum, while at the same time making only minor contributions to the coffers allocated to diplomatic activity, to which the government allocated precisely 39 million dinars. Really. Will it be the generals or the diplomats who will pull us out of the crisis? Taxpayers, particularly owners of private businesses, have begun to ask this out loud. Perhaps in vain. Because this is not the United States, where people pay taxes, but under the motto: "No taxation without representation!"
