FR940711-1-00016 FR940711-1-00003 Alternatively, as discussed in the following section, if the customer under the existing wholesale requirements contract: (1) Gives notice pursuant to the contract, before the end of the three-year transition period, that it will no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling utility, but instead will purchase unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services from the utility in order to reach a different supplier of electric energy; and (2) the transmission services will commence prior to the end of the three-year transition period, the selling utility may file before the end of the three-year transition period a proposal to recover stranded costs through rates for the requested wholesale transmission services. This is the only circumstance under which the Commission will allow utilities to seek wholesale stranded cost recovery through transmission rates. 37 37 We note that the rebuttable presumption we are proposing for contracts with notice provisions, infra, p. 30, also applies in this instance. We clarify further that, under this proposal, in order for utilities to protect themselves against a customer exercising (inside or outside the three-year transition period) a notice of termination provision which takes effect outside of the three-year transition period, utilities must propose to change their existing contracts within the three-year period. However, the rebuttable presumption will apply in this instance as well. Existing requirements contracts are highly variable with respect to exit conditions. While some existing contracts may have explicit exit fee or other stranded cost provisions, many others may be totally silent with respect to exit conditions. Yet others may have notice provisions, but may not be explicit as to stranded cost recovery. If a contract includes an explicit provision for payment of stranded costs or an exit fee, it will be assumed that the parties fully intended the contract to cover the contingency of the buyer leaving the system. Therefore, as a matter of policy announced here, the Commission proposes to reject stranded cost amendments to existing contracts that already contain such provisions. If existing contracts permit renegotiation of existing stranded cost provisions, the parties may renegotiate in accordance with the contract. However, if existing contracts prohibit stranded cost recovery, or explicitly prohibit renegotiation of an existing stranded cost or exit fee provision, or prohibit renegotiation until after the three-year period has expired, the parties will not be required to renegotiate within the three-year period. The Commission invites comments on what other types of contractual provisions, if any, might demonstrate a sufficient ``meeting of the minds'' between parties so that renegotiation should be barred. The Commission also solicits comments on whether to apply these rules regarding existing contracts only to contracts between unaffiliated entities. If a contract does not include an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, but does contain a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the selling utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the period provided for in the notice provision. This presumption will apply when public utilities propose unilateral amendments to requirements contracts, as described above, as well as when public utilities or transmitting utilities seek stranded cost recovery through transmission rates, as described above. The Commission solicits comment on whether the rebuttable presumption should also be applied to any contract entered into after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act, even though such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, or a notice provision. For existing contracts that do not contain specific exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provisions, the Commission proposes to require parties to make a good faith attempt at renegotiation. This is because many of these contracts were negotiated twenty years ago, or more, when the parties likely did not foresee the advent of competition in wholesale generation markets and the ability of transmission-dependent utilities to gain access to their supplier's transmission system to reach other sellers. The Commission recognizes that new requirements contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts may contain contractual features that have heretofore not been included in requirements contracts. Buyers and sellers will seek to protect themselves from contingencies made more likely as a result of increased competition in power markets. The Commission will not impose a preconceived notion of what those contract provisions should look like, and does not necessarily believe that a ``one size fits all'' approach is appropriate.
