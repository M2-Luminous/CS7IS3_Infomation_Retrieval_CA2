Before the beginning of 1994, Macedonia was recognized by Germany, France, Britain, and other European states, which hastened to take this step before Greece assumed the EU presidency. The Foreign Ministry in Skopje reports that so far 27 states have established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, although the documents and communications materials of only 11 states officially refer to "the Republic of Macedonia." The remainder, including the United States, use the term "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," under which the United Nations admitted Macedonia as a member. Bearing in mind that, except for Greece, Macedonia has been recognized by all the Balkan states (including all the other former Yugoslav republics,) the question why the FRY has still not recognized Macedonia remains open. Little is said openly about this issue, but the fact remains that to date no meeting has taken place between a Macedonian and a Serb at which the southern neighbor has failed to ask his northern brother the reason for his continued delay in recognizing Macedonia's independence. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the man with most influence in Yugoslav politics, has not omitted to say at his meetings with Macedonian representatives that Serbia has no claims against its southern neighbor and that nothing prevents Belgrade from recognizing Macedonia, and yet in practice this does not happen. It is natural for Yugoslavia to say that even its own status is not yet settled, because the United Nations is keeping this issue open. Since spring last year, Yugoslavia has not been a full member of the United Nations; it was not expelled from the organization, but it is not entitled to take part in meetings of the UN General Assembly. However, the true reason relates to Greece, which demonstrates very good friendly relations toward the Serbs and always defends Yugoslavia's interests in the international arena. Furthermore, as a member of the EU, Greece has much stronger influence in Europe than Macedonia, whose status has still not been determined. Of course, one should not gloss over the fact that Macedonia has also failed so far to recognize the FRY, which was formed from the two former Yugoslav republic of Serbia and Montenegro. It is evident that there are enough reasons for Belgrade to delay recognizing Macedonia. Accordingly, Yugoslavia will be in no hurry to do so, at least until there is an improvement in the relations between Skopje and Athens.
