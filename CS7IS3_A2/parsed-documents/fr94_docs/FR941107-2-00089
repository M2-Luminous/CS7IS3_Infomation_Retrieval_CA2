OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0034. Title: Application for Construction Permit for Noncommercial Educational Broadcast Station. Form Number: FCC Form 340. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Non-profit institutions. Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 269 responses; 89.38 hours average burden per response; 24,043 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: FCC Form 340 is used to apply for authority to construct a new noncommercial educational AM, FM and TV broadcast station, or to make changes in the existing facilities of such a station. On 9/18/92, the Commission adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) in the matter of Policy Regarding Character Qualifications in Broadcast Licensing which eliminated the requirement that broadcast applicants report pending litigation. The form is being revised to reflect the new policy. The form is also being revised to add a column to the terrain and coverage data for applicants who apply for a noncommercial educational station on a commercial channel. Additionally, a paragraph has been added to the environmental question in the engineering sections of the form to clarify the information needed by the Commission. The data is used by FCC staff to determine whether the applicant meets basic statutory requirements to become a Commission licensee. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27429; Filed 11&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;0l&hyph;F
