The "trigger system," introduced in 1991 to control growth in loans to the industry, has never been put into force. The system will be abandoned under the new financial policy guidelines that the ministry will announce after the government comes out with its new pump-priming package on or after Saturday, the officials said. Abolition of the system is unlikely to rekindle the kind of serious land price inflation that Japan experienced during the years of the inflationary bubble from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the officials said. Loans to the real estate industry by banks and other financial institutions have remained at a low level in recent years due to the economic recession. The Finance Ministry introduced the trigger system in 1991, when it abolished its arrangement for limiting the growth of loans to the real estate industry to less than that of total loans to all industries. The officials said the trigger system will be abolished to help activate land transactions and promote business recovery.
