The task of loading the reactor core fuel assemblies (198 assemblies) is to begin today, 13 October. The objectives of the criticality tests are to load the fuel and achieve initial criticality, and then to perform the initial core configuration. The tests will continue until next June, then the PNC plans to shift into core physical tests, in which the reactivity values of the control rods (which regulate the reactor's output) will be measured.
