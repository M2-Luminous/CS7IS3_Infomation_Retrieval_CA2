The EU issued a statement urging North Korea to comply with its agreement on February 15 to allow inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) full access to North Korean nuclear facilities. "The EU reiterates that prospects for a better relationship with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea would be greatly enhanced if concerns over North Korea's nuclear activities and intentions could be alleviated," it said. The EU also called on North Korea to hold talks with South Korea on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The EU also gave its full backing to the IAEA's efforts to ensure that Pyongyang complies with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and does not pursue development of atomic weapons. The statement followed North Korea's refusal last Monday to continue opening up its nuclear sites to IAEA inspection, and a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement that it was ending a suspension of "peaceful nuclear activities." Four days earlier, on May 31, the United Nations Security Council had urged North Korea to allow a full inspection of its nuclear facilities, and hinted at economic sanctions if the inspections were not allowed.
