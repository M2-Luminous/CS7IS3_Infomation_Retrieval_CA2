Reception is fair. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Center reports from Sarajevo that "this morning just after 0800 the chetniks fired with small arms on members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in the Jewish cemetery area. UNPROFOR immediately returned fire. The aggressor also directed small arms fire at Mijatovica Kosa." Describing the situation in the Bihac region, Mirza Sadikovic describes "yet another hellish night here, with incessant shelling of the defense positions in (Grabez) and Hasin Vrh. After firing hundreds of howitzer shells and mortars, the chetniks attempted an infantry breakthrough at (Vrh), but the 5th Corps' heroic defenders managed to repulse it." He says that "around midnight they [the Serbs] mercilessly shelled the center of Cazin and its outskirts." Summing up the military situation yesterday in its operational zone, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 3rd Corps Press Center says that "it was relatively quiet. The chetniks intensified their small arms fire on the Zavidovici front, and occasionally shelled the defense lines and civilian targets from (Podseljanici), (Podmalovani), and Glavica. They were seen regrouping and bringing in more military hardware, and frequent helicopter flights were also reported on the Mt. Ozren-(Vozuca) route. The chetniks fired several 120-mm mortar and B-1 artillery shells at Bugojno, wounding one child. They also fired five 60-mm mortars at Mala (Oporista) on the defense line toward Teslic." He says that "the cease-fire in central Bosnia was seriously violated last night at 1840 in Vitez, when a group of HVO fighters entered no-man's land near (Ciganluk) and blew up a house. Sporadic provocative fire was registered in this region, particularly around Kruscica, [words indistinct]. As for Gornji Vakuf, the HVO fighters fired several 60-mm and 82-mm mortars. On the other parts of the front, there were absolutely no violations, particularly in the Bilalovac region, where not a single bullet was fired." In his report from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that "over the last 24 hours, the enemy continued to attack the entire front line in the operational zone of Operative Group 2. The chetniks launched their heaviest attacks on the Trebava part of the front. Using heavy artillery support, they attempted an infantry attack toward (Prijeko Brdo) and Lukavica, but the defenders were not taken by surprise. Indeed, a counteroffensive enabled them to extend the front line to our advantage. The chetniks will most certainly try to recapture that territory today." He says that "as for the Doboj front, the chetniks fired 80-mm and 120-mm mortars at the defense lines and at civilian targets in Brijesnica, (Stanic Rijeka), and (Klopotnica). On the Lukavac front, the chetniks fired from Vijenac at residential areas, killing one civilian and wounding three. At the moment of filing this report, the enemy is shelling Gracanica, and the general alarm has been in force since 0635 this morning." The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps reports from Mostar that "the cease-fire is generally being observed here. There are still some provocative bursts of small arms fire and sniper activity on the streets of Mostar, and intersections in the city center. The HVO fighters were somewhat more active on the southern parts of the Mostar area. One 120-mm mortar was fired from the enemy positions, while antiaircraft machine guns were firing sporadically at the defense lines. Negotiations on the exchange of prisoners of war are to continue today in Medjugorje." He says that "overnight and this morning have been quiet."
