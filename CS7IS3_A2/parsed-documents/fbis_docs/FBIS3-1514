This followed a siege on his home on Monday night after earlier running gun battles between Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] cadres, members of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC military wing] and Transkei security forces in Port St Johns. Mr Mposelwa's nephew described how he and his three small daughters huddled in his uncle's home as bullets flew above them in a night of terror. "I was thinking of dying," said a shaken Mr Mongi Hongana. "It's lucky for me I am still alive." Speaking at the Port St Johns police station, where he and his family took refuge early on Tuesday, Mr Hongana said he worked on one of his uncle's smallholdings near the town. Mr Mposelwa, accompanied by several armed bodyguards, fetched him from the farm about 3.30pm on Monday. As they drove through Port St Johns men in a bakkie [pickup truck] opened fire on them and Mr Mposelwa's bodyguards shot back. Mr Hongana, who jumped off the bakkie in terror, made his way through the bush to Mr Mposelwa's house where he was living with his wife Patricia and three daughters. After dusk the house came under heavy fire. He, his wife and their daughters Orienda, 10, Patience, 6, and Unathi, 5, huddled in the dark in a corridor at the back of the house which was not directly exposed to gunfire through windows. Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards were also there, he said. "The children tried to cry, but we said no, no, because we were hiding." Early on Tuesday he ran to neighbours who arranged for the police to fetch him and his family. He did not know where his uncle went, he said. Nor did he know who was responsible for the shooting. He had arrived from East London only three months ago and had devoted his attention to the farm. "Because I'm new here I don't know what is happening," he said. "When I first came here my uncle told me someone wants to kill him." No one in the house returned fire on monday night, he said. The front wall of the house, which is only a few hundred metres from the police station and overlooks the sea, was riddled with bullet marks and plaster was gouged out from bursts of automatic fire. Some bullets had passed through two closed doors and lodged in the wall of the passage where the Honganas, Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards sheltered. In the lounge a charred radiogram stood against one wall, apparently set on fire by a stray bullet. Above it, a melted plastic clock had stopped at 8.43, presumably the time of the attack. A Transkei Defence Force team arrived from Umtata to inspect the scene on Tuesday afternoon. Mr Hongana said he was expecting to be escorted to Umtata by police.
