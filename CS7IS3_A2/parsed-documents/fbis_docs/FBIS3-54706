Assessing the situation in 1993, the Georgian leader mentioned both the negative and positive results of the economic and political development of the republic. Positive results include the end of the civil war in Georgia and the joining of the CIS. Shevardnadze described the joining of the new Commonwealth as one of the most significant events in the life of the republic. Speaking about negative results, he mentioned the tragedy in Abkhazia, the temporary loss of control and jurisdiction over some other cities and districts of Abkhazia, too hasty putting in circulation of the Georgian coupon on the territory of the republic and the deterioraton of the crime situation. According to Shevardnadze, 1994 should become a year of the improvement of the economic situation in Georgia and the CIS in general, whose leaders understand full well that they can resolve the acute economic and other problems only by joint efforts. Shevardnadze is pinning much hope on the restoration of economic relations with the former USSR republics and on the establishment of new economic, political and other relations with the CIS member states. He said in his new year interview that 1994 should witness the end on the basis of justice of the conflict in Abkhazia, which, in his opinion, is guaranteed by the active work of international organisations, the CSCE, and the positive role played by Russia and other countries, which are friendly to Georgia, specifically, the U.S., Germany and so on. He expressed confidence that hundreds of thousands of refugees from Abkhazia, who are now living in other regions of the republic, in Russia and other CIS member states, will be able to return home. He pointed out that 1994 would witness the adoption of a new Georgian constitution. If the new constitution is adopted this year, then parliamentary elections will probably be held in 1994 too. Naturally, he did not mention the date of the elections.
