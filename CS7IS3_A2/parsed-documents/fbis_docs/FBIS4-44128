According to our information, last Wednesday afternoon a National Guard patrol caught red-handed a British military police corporal stationed at the British base at Dhekelia while he was making notes on a topography map in an area next to National Guard minefields west of the British base and south of Pyla village. The British serviceman had a compass in his possession, which he apparently used to locate accurately the exact geographic position of the minefields and the passages through them by enemy forces toward the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. The British serviceman protested his arrest and there was an incident with the national guardsmen. The Englishman was finally arrested by the police. After giving a statement in which he attempted to justify his actions and the annotating of a map, he was released and handed over to the authorities of the British base. The actions of the police action remain inexplicable, however; according to our information, they released the Englishman without the consent of the military authorities and the National Guard General Staff. The Briton's surname is Lee [name published in English]. The police returned the compass and map he was using, and an attempt was made to hush up an event that is considered one of the most serious cases against the security of the Republic of Cyprus in recent years.
