Investment income and unrealized and realized gains or losses will be allocated daily to each class of shares based on the percentage of net assets of the outstanding or dividend eligible shares, as appropriate, in each class of a Fund at the beginning of each day. Operating expenses, which are attributable to all classes, will be allocated daily to each class of shares based on the percentage of the Fund's net assets in each class at the beginning of the day. Expenses that have a greater cost for one class than another ( i.e. , rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and possibly transfer agent fees) will be charged separately to each class. Because of higher ongoing distribution fees and potentially higher transfer agency fees paid by holders of the Deferred Option shares, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Deferred Option shares would be lower than the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares. 7. Class B shares may convert automatically to Class A shares after a specified period of years. In addition, for the purposes of conversion, shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares are also Class B shares, except that they will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time a shareholder's Class B shares, other than those in the sub-account, convert to Class A, a pro rata portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A. 8. Applicants reserve the ability to convert shares of any class to shares of another, consistent with the standards, policies, conditions, and representations set forth in the application regarding the conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares. Such ability to convert shares will be subject to the terms fully disclosed in a Fund's registration statement current at the time of sale, and will be at the relative net asset values of each of the classes. 9. The conversion feature is subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling to the effect that such conversion of shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law, and may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is not available. 10. Applicants anticipate that each class of shares may be exchanged for shares of the same class in another Fund to the extent that the shareholder would have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. The exchange privileges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 11. Applicants expect that the CDSC applicable to Class B shares will vary from 2 percent to 5 percent for redemptions made during the first year after purchase to 1 percent for redemptions made during the fourth year after purchase. The CDSC applicable to Class B shares will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased more than six years prior to their redemption. 12. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption. The CDSC of any particular Fund or class thereof may be higher or lower than that described in the application. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares derived from the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. 13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, next of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.
