FR940811-0-00035 FR940811-0-00016 EPA has determined that it is appropriate to designate an ocean dumping site for dredged materials from San Francisco Bay site now, even if alternatives to ocean dumping should eventually prove to be available, because it appears unlikely that alternative means of managing dredged material will accommodate all of this dredged material that will be generated in the future. As discussed in the Final EIS, there are many substantial obstacles involved with the potential alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged material. As noted, one alternative that is currently being employed is disposal of dredged material within San Francisco Bay itself. Several resource and regulatory agencies, however, have indicated that disposal of dredged material within San Francisco Bay may be endangering the Bay ecosystem, and some of these agencies have suggested or are working towards setting low ceilings on the annual volume of dredged material that may be placed in the Bay. Disposing of dredged materials in upland locations or employing them for various beneficial uses are other alternatives which may prove feasible. Current information, however, which is recited in the Final EIS, suggests that it is unlikely that these alternatives will feasibly accommodate all dredged materials likely to be generated from San Francisco Bay in the future. EPA and several other agencies are currently participating in a comprehensive evaluation of management of dredged materials from San Francisco Bay, known as the ``Long-Term Management Strategy'' (``LTMS''). As part of this LTMS effort, all disposal options, including beneficial reuse, upland, in-bay, and ocean disposal alternatives, are being further evaluated in a separate LTMS Policy EIS/EIR. The LTMS agencies intend to set forth policies for the ongoing development of such alternatives, and for comprehensive management of all such sites, in the Policy EIS/EIR. EPA's site designation decision reflects this LTMS effort. Today, EPA is setting an interim site capacity for the SF&hyph;DODS of six million cubic yards of dredged material per year, which shall be in effect only until December 31, 1996. As the LTMS is completed, EPA will reexamine the appropriate site capacity for the SF&hyph;DODS and will establish in a separate rulemaking a capacity for the SF&hyph;DODS that reflects the LTMS policy. In addition, in all cases (now, and in the future under a comprehensive management plan for the region), the disposition of dredged materials from individual projects will be evaluated by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District on a case-by-case basis and EPA, taking into account all the alternatives available at the time of permitting. Beneficial reuse alternatives will be preferred over ocean disposal whenever they are practicable and would cause less adverse impacts than ocean disposal. The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in detail in the Final EIS: 1. No Action Failure to designate a permanent ocean disposal site pursuant to Section 102 of the MPRSA would have significant negative consequences. First, the continued foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments from various San Francisco Bay dredging projects would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of existing in-Bay or temporary ocean dumping locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404 or MPRSA Section 103. Continued, exclusive reliance on existing in-bay disposal sites would not address concerns about environmental impacts of in-bay disposal, and would not address concerns about economic impacts due to delays and uncertainty associated with limited capacity at these existing sites. Second, the Water Resources Act of 1992 prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been designated by EPA as Section 102 dump sites by the end of 1997. If EPA fails to designate the SF&hyph;DODS by that date, then ocean disposal of dredged materials taken from San Francisco Bay projects will be effectively precluded. 2. Deepwater Alternative Site 3 This site is located approximately 47 nautical miles (87 kilometers) from the Golden Gate in an area where depths range approximately 4,590 to 6,230 feet (1,400 to 1,900 meters). EPA has eliminated this site from further consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Pioneer Canyon and associated hardbottom areas. This site would have greater impacts to benthic organisms than the preferred alternative (Site 5), and would affect relatively scarce hardbottom habitats. 3. Deepwater Alternative Site 4 This site is located approximately 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) from the Golden Gate in an area where depths range approximately from 6,230 to 6,900 feet (1,900 to 2,100 meters). EPA has eliminated this site from further consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Half Moon Bay and its high usage as commercial fishing grounds as compared to Alternative Site 5. This site would also have greater impacts to benthic organisms than the preferred alternative (Site 5). 4. Deepwater Alternative Site 5 (Preferred Alternative) The Final EIS identified this site as the preferred alternative based on comparison to the alternative sites listed above, and to the specific selection criteria listed in 40 CFR 228.6(a). Alternative Site 5 is located furthest from the coast (approximately 49 nautical miles west of the Golden Gate) and in the deepest depth range (approximately 8,200 to 9,840 feet, or 2,500 to 3,000 meters). The 6.5 square nautical mile site represents approximately one percent of the total area encompassing the slope region studied by EPA Region IX. Bathymetric and sediment surveys indicate Alternative Site 5 is located in a depositional area which, because of existing topographic containment features, is likely to retain dredged material which reaches the sea floor. No significant impacts to other resources or amenity areas, such as marine sanctuaries, are expected to result from designation of Alternative Site 5. Existing and potential fisheries resources within Alternative Site 5 are minimal and the site is removed from more important fishing grounds located closer to the other alternative sites. Abundances and biomass of demersal fishes and megafaunal invertebrates, as well as abundances and diversity of infaunal invertebrates, at Alternative Site 5 are lower than those at the other alternative sites. Conservative modeling predicted only localized detectable perturbations following disposal of dredged materials within the disposal site. Therefore, potential impacts to surface and mid-water dwelling organisms, such as seabirds, mammals, and midwater fishes, are expected to be insignificant. Finally, disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and chemical and conventional munitions occurred historically in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5. Disposal within the site has also occurred as part of a Navy MPRSA Section 103 permit approved for up to 1.2 million cubic yards of suitable dredged material. Therefore, designation of this site also minimizes cumulative effects compared to the alternative ocean disposal sites. EPA has determined that Alternative Site 5, identified in the Final EIS as the preferred site, will be the site designated as SF&hyph;DODS in this Final Rule. This site represents the environmentally preferred alternative for designation of a deep ocean disposal site for the San Francisco Bay area. Its selection, along with the specific restrictions on site use adopted and described in this Final Rule, avoids and minimizes environmental harm from ocean disposal of suitable dredged material to the maximum extent practicable. A Record of Decision (ROD) will not be issued as a separate document; instead this Final Rule serves as the ROD for designation of the SF&hyph;DODS.
