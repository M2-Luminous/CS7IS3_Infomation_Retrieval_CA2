Although Bosnian Serb Forces have announced they are withdrawing their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO's ultimatum is still in effect, he said. News reports reaching here said that NATO Air Forces deployed in Italy are conducting training flights in preparation for possible strikes against Serb artillery positions. Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leaders announced that Serb Forces will complete their withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before the NATO ultimatum expires by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 February], or will place them under the control of U.N. peacekeeping forces. In return, the Bosnian Serbs have demanded that Russia send troops into Sarajevo to prevent the Bosnian Moslems from taking advantage of the Serb withdrawal. Reports indicate that Bosnian Moslem Forces have also agreed to hand over their heavy weapons to U.N. peacekeeping forces. Under the NATO ultimatum, artillery must be withdrawn from a 20-kilometer exclusion zone, or put under U.N. control. The Clinton administration has warned the Serbs there will be no extension of the deadline. In New York, Joe Sills, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, said that the removal of Serb heavy weapons was "moving ahead at a very good pace." He said the Moslem Forces were also complying with U.N. demands. It is believed that Serb Forces have about 500 heavy artillery pieces. The Moslem Forces have fewer guns, but more infantry troops.
