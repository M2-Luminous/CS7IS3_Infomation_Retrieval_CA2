Zerdin in Bled; date not given: "You Will Polish the Boots of German and British Officers"] [Text] [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the visit to Slovenia? [Zhirinovskiy] I am. Everything has been in order, peaceful, clean, cultured. The service in the hotel has been good. [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the meetings with the representatives of the Slovene parties? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, we have agreed on cooperation. We signed a joint statement with the Slovene National Party and I have invited them all to the congress of my party on 2 April. Everybody liked this. Generally speaking, you do not have many problems here. For example, the Trieste area used to be controversial, namely, whether Trieste would go to Yugoslavia or to Italy. There were no other conflicts. However, conflicts must be resolved in a peaceful manner, and once they are over, the Slavs will only smile at our conflicts in the past. The problems must be resolved so that Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia will be more compact. [Zerdin] Compact? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, compact and not in pieces. If there will Bosnia-Herzegovinas and Montenegros then there will be endless quarrels and wars there. There should only be three parts: Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia, full stop. And Bulgaria. All foreign armies should leave Yugoslavia. [Zerdin] What about the Muslims? [Zhirinovskiy] There is no Muslim question. Historically speaking, the Muslims are ethnic Croats and Serbs. This is a complex region, anyway. However, this was also the case in France. There used to be the Normans, the Gaelic, and the Bretons there.... And France, which is a peaceful country nowadays, has emerged from all this. This could have also been the case with you, the South Slavs who have had Yugoslavia, but it did not work out. If this must be so then let it be only three parts there: Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia. And not eight pieces. Such a quantity cannot ensure quality. If there are eight countries, there will be wars. [Zerdin] What about Macedonia? [Zhirnovskiy] Macedonia? That is Bulgaria. Actually, the Turkish Thrace, Romanian Dobrogea, Bulgaria, and Macedonia are a sort of unity. [Zerdin] So what should this be, Macedonia or Bulgaria? [Zhirinovskiy] Instead of Bulgaria, it should be named Macedonia. This would be more fair. Serbia should get the Serbian part of the present Macedonia, but otherwise this would be a big country. Alexander the Great, who conquered all of Asia Minor and got all the way to India, was from this area. [Zerdin] What about Russia? [Zhirinovskiy] See, what is Ukraine? It is Russia. [Zerdin] And Czechia and Slovakia? [Zhirinovskiy] Because of the Sudetenland and Moravia, the Czechs are closer to the Germans. Practically speaking, Czechia has no future. Germany will gradually take it over. Bratislava, however, could turn into a center for East European Slavic cooperation. This would be a counterbalance to the West European alliance. Bratislava could be something similar to what Strasbourg and Maastricht are for the Western Europe. Economically, the Slavs could have been stronger than Western Europe. However, they would have to act without ideologies. The entire Western Europe is infected with fascism: Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany. Eastern Europe used to be ailing from communism. Now there is a threat of nationalism. There is killing again and there are wars. This must be stopped. In the 21th century, the arms will speak for the last time against those who will be against democracy. This will be a religious war against the Muslim world. Well, it is already happening. For this reason, I have also written the book -- the Last Push to the South. At the end of the 20th century, there will be no more international wars, however, religious wars will begin. You see, Turkey toward the Caucasus, Azerbaijan against Armenia.... These are religious wars. Here is Tajikistan, and if these wars spread World War II will take place. We are in a situation similar to Europe in 1935. Nobody expected a war then and suddenly it has all started. Now Turkey and Iran can push toward Caucasus, the Turks are penetrating into the Balkans, Iraq in Central Asia, Afghanistan in Tajikistan. You will have pan Islamism, Balkans, Arabs. France and Germany will be destabilized. Finally, Europe will be in a state of war. [Zerdin] Who can stop all this? [Zhirinovskiy] Only Russia. Russia could be a factor of stability. It could stop the process of disintegration of Europe, the Balkans, and central Asia. You see yourselves what has happened after Russia has withdrawn from the Balkans. A war has happened. If Russia helps, war can be prevented. [Zerdin] Slovenia would like to become a NATO member. [Zhirinovskiy] Well, if Slovenia becomes a NATO member it will really be a servant. A servant! You were in the army, weren't you? You know how one has to polish boots. You will polish boots to the German and British officers. NATO will be able to send its troops in Slovenia and you will have to feed a foreign army. Only this and nothing more. Nobody will attack Slovenia, that is true, but it will be occupied by a foreign army. [Zerdin] So what do you propose? [Zhirinovskiy] Neutrality is the best. If you join NATO you will lose everything. Foreign soldiers will idle around and drink in your courtyard, while you will have to work for them.
