"If any state carries out an attack on Ukraine or makes territorial claims on it, the United States will appeal to international organizations such as the United Nations in order to protect Ukraine," the U.S. ambassador noted. Talks on disarmament have been tense in recent months. Their participants concentrated special attention on three issues: Guarantees of Ukraine's security, the forms and amounts of compensation for enriched uranium contained in warheads, and the rendering of technical and economic assistance for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons. Replying to questions from journalists, William Miller stressed that of the $800 million, which the United States will be granting for implementing the program of nuclear disarmament of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, our state will receive $175 million. The United States also pledged to give humanitarian and technical assistance to Ukraine. The ambassador reported that a Ukrainian delegation will be leaving for the United States next week, which would be engaged in issues of coordinating U.S. assistance to Ukraine. At the end of the meeting, William Miller expressed the hope that Russia and other UN member states would adhere to the charter of this organization.
