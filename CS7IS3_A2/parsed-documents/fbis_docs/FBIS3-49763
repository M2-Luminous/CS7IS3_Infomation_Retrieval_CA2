They have despaired of a Western or international position that might have enabled them to recover their territories, or given them the right to self-defense by lifting the arms embargo. Despite the fact that everyone thinks of Sarajevo when speaking of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the central region is considered the heart of the Bosnian state, its principal nerve, and the center of the Muslim republic, after partition, for it has natural resources and strategic sites controlling the roads linking the parts of the country. It was in this very region that Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic enjoys popularity that goes beyond his position as the symbol of the Bosnian Muslims in a unique historical period for them, during which they escaped the knives of the Serbs and Croats. Pictures of him have replaced those of former Yugoslav leader Josip Tito, who just a few months ago still presided over government offices and official institutions, with poems and popular songs praising and singing about him. The speech he gave during his tour through this region a few weeks ago was accorded great importance by the man in the street--in it, he promised that the Bosnian army would soon move from a defense phase to a liberation phase--especially as it coincided with news, spread unofficially and unannounced, about the achievement of military progress on the military fronts with both the Croats and the Serbs. For example, a week never passes without military units of the Bosnian army succeeding in pushing back the Croatian militias, which seem to be suffering from poor conditions, especially in the regions of Kiseljuk, Busovaca, and Vitez, whose city center has now become visible. In recent weeks, Bosnian fighters have made considerable progress around the capital, acknowledged by the official spokesman of the international forces in Sarajevo, though it has not been announced in its official media. Last week, the Serbs began a huge military campaign on several fronts, and met with devastating failure. According to information AL-HAYAH obtained, there is a new attempt to break the siege around the capital, planned for a day and night some months ago, but awaiting the right moment for its implementation. The arms and ammunition crisis is no longer the Bosnian army's worst problem; that is now the lack of the fuel necessary for aid and supply operations, which were halted after the outbreak of war between the Muslims and Croats. It had reached them through Croatian territory, causing them difficult problems, compelling Bosnian soldiers to march on foot from one point to another. In spite of what the Muslims have suffered at Serbian and Croatian hands, there is a large sector of them who still believe that coexistence by the three communities is possible. There are still some Serbs and Croats who hold official posts, and sometimes high office, in these regions. Even so, Serb and Croat citizens living there are in no danger or threat of losing their jobs or homes, or of being rounded up as happened to Muslims in the regions occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias. The trinity of war, hunger, and cold have imposed a high degree of social and economic solidarity on the Bosnian people, among individuals and whole cities. Basic goods and commodities are bartered; Sarajevo, for example, sends flour to the cities of the central region, which in turn send meat to Sarajevo. Some negative social phenomena, such as stealing and moral corruption, have, however, begun to appear on the surface, though they are still less than in other parts of the world afflicted with this kind of war. This vital region of the country has gone through a considerable period of self-sufficiency in terms of foodstuffs, repairing the effects of war imposed by the Serbian militias, and cutting aid routes using the Croatian militias. Some villages are in no need of food aid, which was coming sporadically from the [High] Commission for Refugees and international aid agencies. According to the new redisticting that the Bosnian Government has organized, the district of Zenta has come to include 14 municipalities in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, with a population of about 1 million, the overwhelming majority of whom are Muslims. They include six municipalities either totally or partially occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias. Fuad Dzidic, recently appointed minister of this district by the Bosnian government as part of the system that divided the Muslims' areas into four (with a minister responsible for each), said, "We are proceeding with an ordered plan that we hope to complete to implement self-sufficiency, beginning with grains and vegetables." However, he thinks that the war going on in his region began before the Serbian and Croatian military invasion of it. "Iron and wood industries have been based in this region since the days of communist rule, plus coal and iron mines, causing a great deal of environmental pollution, which has negatively affected the volume of agricultural space in the region." He cited as an example a steel factory, the largest in former Yugoslavia, located in the center of the city of Zenica. It used to produce two million tons annually, without the use of any purifying filters. [passage omitted]
