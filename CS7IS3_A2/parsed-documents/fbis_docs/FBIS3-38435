You just have to reread his State of the Union message to realize this: The White House chief spoke for 55 minutes but he only devoted eight minutes to external questions, and only a few seconds to the former Yugoslavia. This refusal to intervene diplomatically should receive spectacular confirmation in the next few days when the U.S. Administration publishes new presidential directives relating to the participation of U.S. troops in UN operations. These directives will, in fact, have the effect of making it virtually impossible for there to be any U.S. involvement in a UN intervention aimed at restoring rather than maintaining peace (which is the case in Bosnia) [passage omitted] This is a far cry from Bill Clinton's election promise to place a military rapid deployment force at the United Nations' disposal. This is the exact opposite. The new presidential directive will in fact simply be a list of pretexts for refusing any participation in UN operations deemed not in keeping with American national interest. In the opposite case, as formerly in the Gulf War, it can be expected that the initiative for the operation will not be taken by the United Nations but by Washington, with the United Nations then only serving as a screen. The announcement of this new policy will be welcomed by American public opinion and by Congress: The pictures of GI bodies being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu are still present in everybody's memory and highlight this illusion of a war without innocent victims, in which only the "bad guys" die, which ensured the media success of the confrontation with Saddam Husayn. But how can anybody forget that George Bush had launched his country into the Somali operation largely to make his voters forget the terrible pictures coming out of the former Yugoslavia? Why should Bill Clinton be spared a dilemma which is as old as America? Although the the rejection of old European wrongdoings, which founded the creation of the United States, carries within it a large dose of isolationism, the puritanism and messianism which go with it carry within them the seed of interventionism. The U.S. President has so far managed to reconcile the two tendencies: Officially, at least, it is by moralism and a sense of justice that he justifies his refusal to get his hands dirty in Bosnia and give his backing in principle to a plan to partition this former Yugoslav Republic. The victims, he says referring to the Muslims, have the right to defend themselves. The conflict in Bosnia, he also hints, does not threaten any American interest. In so doing, he is gambling on a continuation of the war, from which justice would emerge. Unfortunately, there is a strong chance that he will lose his bet: Of course, the outcome of the fighting is at present favorable to the Muslims. But major victories will inevitably provoke a Serbian counteroffensive, which is already being planned, and the official entry of the Croatian Army into Bosnia. The 12,000 Blue Helmets deployed in Bosnia will merely prevent the war going round in circles, and their withdrawal will be inevitable. The internationalization of the conflict will then be even closer because it will become infinitely more difficult to curb Slav and Muslim solidarities: Russia is much more active in its diplomatic defense of the Serbian positions, whereas China will place an increasingly high price on its right of veto within the Security Council, and many Muslim countries will consider the support (not only moral, according to some Western intelligence services) given by the Americans to the Bosnian Muslims as the go-ahead for increased intervention.
