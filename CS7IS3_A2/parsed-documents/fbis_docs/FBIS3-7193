Phanot, who claimed that the nuclear option was safe, said the government should decide soon because nuclear power plants take 10 years to complete. "We have to get prepared for so many things," he said, citing lack of expertise as an example. Compared with fossil fuels, nuclear power is clean. It doesn't release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Phanot said. Current resources such as lignite and water are becoming scarcer and consequently will become more expensive, he said. "Nuclear power is the most suitable energy for Thailand," Phanot said. With cooperation from Canadian experts, he said the association is studying technology regarding the disposal of radioactive waste. The association is also coordinating with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand to train new people.
