Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kosikov told reporters on Friday that Yeltsin will see the doctors who operated on his back hurt when the plane made an emergency landing. "I cannot say whether it will be a consultation or a gesture of gratitude to them", Kostikov said. The doctors had examined the Russian president in Moscow last September. Kostikov said that in Barcelona Yeltsin also plans to visit Olympic sites.
