The king is expected to visit Kim Il-song in connection with Kim's 82-year birthday on April 15, an embassy spokesman said. The king will probably also go over the results of his recent six-month treatment for cancer, he said. It was not immediately clear if Sihanouk would attempt to exert any influence over North Korea to allow full inspections of its suspected nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Interference in IAEA inspections in March led to a U.N. Security Council statement urging North Korea to accept further inspections and continue dialogue on the issue. Sihanouk is expected to travel in his own royal airplane and will leave Pyongyang and return to Cambodia next Friday by way of Beijing, the spokesman said. The king resumed his official duties Thursday when he met with a Chinese leader, his first official meeting since undergoing cancer treatment in Beijing last October. Sihanouk met with Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans on Friday. The spokesman said Sihanouk has "nearly completely recovered."
