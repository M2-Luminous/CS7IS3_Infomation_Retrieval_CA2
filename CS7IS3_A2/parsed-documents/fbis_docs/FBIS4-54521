A statement says that two armored vehicle platoons of the Nordic battalion were involved in the attack in which nine people were killed and five wounded on the Serbian side. The main headquarters has received reports that Nordic officers received 500,000 German marks for the UNPROFOR armored-mechanized and artillery support for Muslim infantry. The statement, issued today by Chief of Staff Manojlo Milovanovic on behalf of the main headquarters, reads: On 30 April UNPROFOR launched their first ground assault on positions of the Srpska republic army and Serb territory in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Early yesterday morning the Muslim forces launched a strong, well-organized artillery and infantry attack from the demarcation lines around Kalesija, Kladanj, and Olovo, in the Tuzla area. The attack on Vis hill, the Srpska republic army's closest position to Tuzla airport, was particularly strong, with the objective of provoking a heavy Serb response against the airport, which would then be used to force NATO into issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons to 20 km from Tuzla and Dubrave airport. Two armored vehicles from the Nordic battalion deployed in the Tuzla area also took part in the attack against the Serbian positions and territory. Colonel Bosne himself, the deputy UNPROFOR chief of staff for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, has admitted that this unit fired 74 shells. We have found out that the Muslims have paid 500,000 German marks to one of the Nordic battalion commanders for support for the Muslim infantry by UNPROFOR armored vehicles and artillery units. They paid 5,000 German marks for each armored vehicle that took part in the attack and 1,000 marks for each artillery shell fired. According to unofficial reports, UNPROFOR is currently investigating the involvement of its ground forces in the Muslim offensive. The following are the names of the casualties caused by the first ground attack by UNPROFOR against the Serbian positions, in which armoured vehicles and Leopard tanks were used: Milic Mara (1927), Radivojevic Ruza (1950), Krstic Mira (1976), Stupar Ljubisa (1955), Radojcic Ljubisa (1968), Petrovic Zoran (1963), Zepinic Milisav (1954), Vukovic Zoran (1964), and Brkic Branko (1948). Milic Danica, Radivojevic Djoko, Todic Mirko, Tripic Milko, and Pavic Dragan were wounded. This UNPROFOR attack is the best confirmation that the authorities and the army of the republic of Srpska were justified when they earlier opposed the deployment of tanks and other heavy offensive weapons in the Tuzla area. At the same time, this is a proof of open and biased involvement of the UN peace forces on the Muslim side. This casts serious doubt on their peace mission and, objectively speaking, will lead to the internationalization of the war in this region. Under the international law on warfare, the republic of Srpska army has the right to return fire on the attacker's forces, regardless of where their positions are. However, the republic of Srpska army will not respond on this occasion, in the belief that UNPROFOR's attack is the action of an irresponsible officer who is probably involved in the above-mentioned money deals with the Muslims, the statement says.
