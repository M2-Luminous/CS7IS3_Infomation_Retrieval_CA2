We want to use experience gained in this field by Poland, a country much more advanced in improving the legal system, management and the utilization of natural resources, Yuriy Kostenko said. He added that the Ukrainian side is counting on Polish experience in the creation of an environment monitoring system and the prevention of the transfer of dangerous wastes. "Ukraine, like Poland, has become the target place where Western Europe and especially Germany dispose their wastes.'' Minister Zelichowski, at whose invitation Yuriy Kostenko arrived in Poland, said that the cooperation with Ukraine--started in 1990-- has been going smoothly. Chief environment protection inspector Andrzej Walewski reported that so far attempts at smuggling about 37 tons of dangerous wastes from Germany to Ukraine have been foiled. The Polish side has several times informed the Ukrainian side about such attempts and about taking preventive measures. He added that the Polish side has not allowed to transfer to Poland about 30 tons of dangerous wastes from Ukraine.
