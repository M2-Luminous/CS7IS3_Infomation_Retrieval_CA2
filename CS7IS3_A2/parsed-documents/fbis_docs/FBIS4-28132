Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: This shows that the Japanese Government is intending to avoid a full-scale inquiry into the case and adequate compensations for it and to hush up the heinous crimes of the past in a crafty manner. The crimes committed in drafting "comfort women", a grave human rights abuse, are not a matter which can be solved merely by establishing a "fund". When the former "comfort women" demanded compensations, they did not mean a few amount of money. Their demand is that the Japanese Government should make a full investigation into the Japanese imperialists' brutalities in the past and make a sincere apology for them and make adequate compensations as a material token of their will not to repeat such past. Whatever amount of money the Japanese Government may pay them, it can never wipe off the disgrace and heal the wounds of their past sufferings. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are going to put a show of solving the criminal case through the establishment of a "fund". This only reveals their brazen-faced nature, and it is an insult to the victimized "comfort women" and survivors. The Japanese Government can never evade a judgement by history. The Japanese authorities must know this clearly and behave properly.
