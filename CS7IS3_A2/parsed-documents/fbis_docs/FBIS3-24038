Tell me please, what does the minister of finance and the ministry headed by her work on so intensively? [Melnic] It so happened that the adoption of documents that are highly significant for the economy, business life, and the social sphere occurred at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. These are entire packages of solutions associated with the introduction of a national currency, amendments to laws, and the introduction of excise taxes. Some of them have already been published in the press in the form of edicts of the president of Moldova, and the rest are still being worked on. Unfortunately, the Parliament did not complete its law-creating activities, and we have to look for a way out of the situation. The economy must work, and the budget must be replenished through both production and taxes. Some of the taxes--on real estate, natural resources, bank profits, and insurance operations--are already operational. A number of laws--on the value-added tax, on local taxes--have been developed and are being considered by the Parliament and the government. Apparently, they will also be enacted by a presidential edict in order to be subsequently submitted to the new Parliament to be discussed and adopted. All of them will become components of the state tax system. In this manner, we are trying to lay the foundation of a tax system that would be in line with the conditions of a market economy and would make it possible to make mutual relations between the state and producers, entrepreneurs, and the population stable. At present, the view exists that our tax system is oppressive, although international experts evaluate it as being reasonable. Thus, in the year 1993 the total amount of tax revenues, including the social fund, is expected to reach 11-12 percent of the gross national product. In 1991, it stood at 38 percent, and in the current year 1994--15-18 percent. Therefore, a stable tax system is emerging here, and it is beginning to regulate the process of capital flows and to secure a balance of sectors and areas of entrepreneurial activities. [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, you have referred to the value-added tax. It will affect primarily those to whom we attach hopes for overcoming the crisis--the producers. A lot depends on what this tax will be. [Melnic] Indeed, this is one of the key aspects, and not just here, but in the CIS countries--after all, we have all come out of the same economic system. For now, the value-added tax is not changing. It should be coordinated with all economic partners. Unfortunately, this issue was removed from the agenda at a meeting in Ashgabat, because an agreement on the uniform rate of the value-added tax in the process of switching to world-market prices on 1 January 1994 and on arrangements for its collection could not be reached. It is not advantageous for the republics to add this tax to the world-market prices for raw materials, because in this case the cost of manufactured goods will be higher than world prices. This means that products will be noncompetitive from the start. A balanced approach is required of us in this instance. [Koretskiy] So have we been importing and exporting products at world-market prices from New Year's day on? [Melnic] The issue of world-market prices has been resolved. In the process, we succeeded in defending the interests of the republic. For example, Russia tried to secure the setting of world-market prices only for the products that are quoted on the world market, i.e. oil, electricity, metal, timber. In this case, it will turn out that nobody needs our tomatoes, even at a negotiated price. We believe that the right of all CIS countries to use world-market prices in settlements among themselves is unshakeable. This is a complicated problem.... However, I would like to go back to your first question and say that the Ministry of Finance has done a great volume of work to come up with funds for the additional social protection of the low-income strata of the population. You know that an edict on the minimum wage has been issued, and that it is built on a differentiated approach to various groups of the population. This is associated with the sharp growth of expenditures for energy resources. For example, the expenditure of funds for heating comes to 15-17 lei per person. Meanwhile, the growth of the average wage is falling behind considerably. [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, this begs the natural question: Why do wages never keep up with expenditures? Our readers are asking in their letters and telephone calls: How is one to survive in the future, given that a consumer basket costs 80-100 lei, whereas the minimum salary comes to 13 lei? [Melnic] I would like to note that the welfare of the people does not hinge on edicts to raise wages. Wage increases immediately entail quite a tangle of closely intertwined economic, financial, and political problems. We have put the state budget together based on the average monthly salary of 15 lei, aiming at smooth quarterly salary raises. Any abrupt leap amounts to an impulse for inflationary processes and the growth of prices. For our part, we are trying as best we can to contain these processes which affect the population adversely. There have been certain shortcomings in the policy of remunerations for labor and social welfare. We should inform the population in advance about the expected price increases, the rate of inflation, and wage increases. However, we must also talk about something else. I have here on my desk data on the average monthly salary for November 1993. For the employees of state structures, it came to 63.4 lei, transportation employees--58.7 lei, industry personnel--84.2 lei, and the employees of the agrarian complex (kolkhozes, sovkhozes)--35.5 lei. This does not include payments in kind. Therefore, a judgment cannot be formed solely on the basis of the size of the minimum wage. Still, our social fund is very weak. The priority task of both our government and Parliament and those of the future is to reinforce it, so that the people will feel confident. The people should be protected. [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, what is your assessment of last year? [Melnic] It was a difficult year, but during the year we succeeded in the most important endeavor--to keep the peace. Not everything has yet been settled in mutual relations with the Dniester area, and the time has come to take measures to resolve this issue. I think that the new Parliament will be up to that. Here is another favorable aspect: During the year, our production smoothly and inconspicuously discontinued its fall and stabilized, and on some scores we even have increases. We succeeded in limiting expenditures and containing the growth of prices compared to other CIS countries. We avoided a crisis in the budget system and, you will recall, there were no delays in the payment of wages and funding for expenditures as we had had before. The volume of work for our ministry was simply tremendous. After all, the budget was approved thrice in one year. Besides, the state succeeded in settling its balance of payments, and now we can make provisions for financial reserve and conduct negotiations about credit. The state budget for 1993 was implemented by 104.3 percent on the revenue side, and the republic budget--by 101.4 percent. [Koretskiy] Is it really that everything was good, and no mistakes or miscalculations of any kind were allowed to occur? [Melnic] Unfortunately, as early as the beginning of the year, the government failed correctly to allocate capital investment. Later, in the middle of the year, we were forced to "freeze" 600 facilities under construction. We were not always able correctly to project the rate of inflation, which was mainly dictated by leaps in the prices for energy resources. We did not manage to do many things, because of the absence of a legislative base. As I have said before, we are now making up for it by way of presidential edicts, so that reforms will not get bogged down. There were miscalculations, indeed. For example, we did not succeed in fully restoring the system for managing the state sector on a new, market foundation. It is known that the old system has been completely destroyed. An owner should manage his property; otherwise, the threat of losing this property will arise. After all, in the process of privatization the state will retain about 65 percent of the property, and it is necessary to manage it wisely in order for the state to be a guarantor of welfare and the effectiveness of operation of its enterprises on an equal footing with other owners. It is also necessary to streamline the system of remunerations for labor, in order to avoid the tremendous imbalance whereby at one enterprise they make 20 lei and at another, 200 lei, with no regard for labor productivity. For the state sector, we should make the procedures for the distribution of profits between accumulation and consumption more rigid, so that enterprises will use their profits for production purposes, investment, and incentives for production, rather than just wages. It is possible that we will have to limit wages, say, to the level of 25 times the minimum wage, that is, set a limit for remunerations for labor. For example, such restrictions apply in countries such as Japan and Switzerland. These measures will become acutely necessary if the economic forms of affecting consumption produce no results. [Koretskiy] What were the successes of the year? [Melnic] Certainly, the adoption of a national currency, although we did not succeed in including the entire republic. The Ministry of Finance has always come out for settling relations with the Dniester area prior to the introduction of the national currency. A great many problems will now develop. After all, the people have not severed family, business, or production relations, and for that reason all of them are now experiencing great inconvenience. The inconvenience is associated with elementary payments for all services, deliveries, and purchases. It appears to me that the authorities of Tiraspol should take some measures so that the leu will circulate similarly in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova, although for them this is also a political issue. After all, they cannot live on ration cards forever. The currency should work, and should bring the people closer together. Last year, we also succeeded in preparing a draft budget for 1994 and in getting it approved ahead of time, prior to 1 January 1994. I will say frankly that the employees of our ministry and I are very happy about this fact, because a budget approved before the beginning of the year (for the first time in the last three years) means stability for all producers, consumers, and the social infrastructure. It is already clear which taxes will be levied, where profits will go, and how much will have to be withheld and for what. It is possible that the budget for the second half of the year will have to be updated. Everything will depend on the size of emission, the growth of prices, and inflation. However, I will stress that everything depends on ourselves, on the rate of production, all the more so because the Ministry of Finance will not receive credit from the National Bank of Moldova this year. We should cover the deficit in full by issuing securities and receiving foreign credit. In general, international credit, support from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Governments of the Russian Federation and Romania were very helpful in overcoming the economic crisis caused by the war and the drought. With this credit, the government purchased grain, seeds, fertilizer, spare parts, fuel, and medicines. The production and social spheres were supported out of them. [Koretskiy] Perhaps, as a former banker and the current minister of finance, you, Claudia Vasilyevna, know the saying about credit which is as old as the hills: You take someone else's, and you give back yours. How are we going to settle for the debt? Are we not taking on too much credit? [Melnic] Of course, it would be better to do without credit. However, this is not possible in the environment of a transitional economy. After all, our state, just like the rest of the CIS countries, is insolvent. Meanwhile, we need to live, work, turn out products, and buy goods. You will seek credit whether you like it or not. The terms on which it is received are another matter. The government has done a lot of work in this area, so that these outlays will be used wisely and that the consequence of their use will not place a heavy burden on our children. I will say that a memorandum on the economic policy of the state has been signed for 1994. It has been discussed with international experts and gained approval. Therefore, our economic policy has been found correct. In December, the IMF resolved to grant us credit in the form of a stand-by facility which opens certain prospects in Moldova's relationship with the rest of the world. We now need to support production in every way possible, give incentives to producers and the structures working to benefit them. This is a way out of the situation and a guarantee for the repayment of credit. Why import when it is possible to produce here, locally, with material, tax, financial, and credit support? This means an increase in production, an abundance of goods, new jobs, and the growth of exports. In this case, it will be easier to settle for credit. [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, allow me to familiarize you with one of the numerous letters received by our newspaper and addressed to the government of which you are a member. In the letter, a reader complains: "The impoverishment of the people progresses year after year. For years, the people set aside their savings at the most reliable bank, the Savings Bank, only to be left high and dry now. Through the effort of our rulers, our savings have turned to dust. At present, one cannot buy a funeral shroud with them, let alone ensure a decent funeral for himself...." [Melnic] I must note that these accusations are not leveled at the real culprits, and I will explain why. The shock therapy of 1991 blew the savings of the people away like a whirlwind. The Government of the USSR and our Moldovan Government had a hand in it. Until 1 January 1992, about 5 billion rubles [R] were borrowed from the Savings Bank of Moldova with a view to covering the deficit of the Union budget. By now, this debt has been fully paid by the government. All arrears on various compensation payments have also been paid in full. The Ministry of Finance has also paid in full the value of the state securities of the former USSR. Therefore, all of our relationships with the deposits of the population have been completed. I believe that indexation should be performed out of the profits of the Savings Bank, in keeping with the Law on Indexation. It is the savings banks that administer profits rather than the state. They charge 200-270 percent in interest rates on credit, and pay next to nothing to the depositors. They, the depositors, should demand appropriate payments and indexation directly from the Savings Bank. [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you are the only female minister of the government. Tell us how you handle this burden of responsibilities. [Melnic] This is not a job for a woman. You are busy 16-18 hours a day, and then you have a family and children! In addition, you take work home every evening in order to manage, and there are no days off.... One needs nerves of steel and health to endure this. I have endured because I continuously got support from my male colleagues. I will say frankly that on occasion I have abused the fact that I am a woman in resolving significant issues of principle. However, this is no way out anyway. I hope that a man will come to this position who will have enough willpower, persistence, and experience to implement the financial stabilization policy. [Koretskiy] Should this be interpreted to say that you are completing your political career? [Melnic] I have never considered myself a politician. Considering myself a specialist--indeed, and then a specialist of the old school, for whom the words of a song, "Think about the motherland first, and about yourself next" is the creed of life. I came to this position contrary to my own wishes and the wishes of my loved ones, and solely on the condition that there would be no more war, and that the government of national accord would not allow this nightmare to occur. Despite all the difficulties, this has been a happy and interesting period in my life. Together with the staff of the Ministry of Finance, who are capable of moving mountains, we have managed to accomplish a lot, and this is gratifying.
