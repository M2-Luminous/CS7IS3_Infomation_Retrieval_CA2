Let's Fight!'"] [Text] "In someone's pocket," "unfit for work" -- all kinds of descriptions, mainly unflattering, were being applied, long before the session, to the lower chamber of the new parliament, for which politicians and political scientists are not predicting a long life. What do the deputies themselves think? In the break I approached Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc. It was a mystery to me why Grigoriy Alekseyevich had decided to run for the Duma at all, and so I asked him: Do you believe that parliamentarianism is possible in Russia, after the shootout at the Supreme Soviet? [Yavlinskiy] First, I think it is necessary, and as for whether it is possible or not, let us try once again to find out in practice. Second, after the situation we found ourselves in after 3-4 October, there was simply no alternative to holding elections -- in any form, even with all the shortcomings, which, of course, we knew about. Third, the Duma will have done its job if it acts as a Constituent Assembly, and that is its main mission. It must approve two things that are fundamental for Russia: electoral laws and an electoral code, and it simply must prepare Russia for elections of a real parliament and a president, and for elections of local organs of power. This is essential. [Garifullina] And how long will the Duma be able to exist? Is it possible that a conflict could break out between the new paerliament and the president? [Yavlinskiy] One would wish to avoid that. But the fact is that the Constitution today is structured in such a way that the president possesses full power. Therefore the Duma apparently has virtually no areas where it overlaps with the president. But at the same time the president bears full responsibility for what happens in the country. The Duma was elected for a short term -- only two years. Well, I don't know.... I would not wish to make pessimistic predictions. But if you think that after it is dissolved the next Duma will be better, I have grave doubts of that. The majority of my voters did not participate in the vote, because the attitude to the elections themselves was negative, people did not have confidence in how they were organized, how they were called, how they were conducted, who supervised them. That was inevitable: When an authoritarian regime holds elections, it holds them in order to strengthen itself. But this is our road and we must follow it. We have a chance. Let's fight!
