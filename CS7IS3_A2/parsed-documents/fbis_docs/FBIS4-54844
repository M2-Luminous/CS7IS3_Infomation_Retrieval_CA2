At the convention, four declarations were issued that will become IDS program material and in which the main IDS regionalist orientations are listed. It is clear from the text of the declarations that the IDS has taken a new, clearer, and more open course toward the accomplishment of the autonomy of Istria. We talked about this with the party president Ivan Jakovcic. [Ivankovic] Why was the Fifth IDS Convention a special convention? [Jakovcic] Because the regular ones are held every two years, and this one was programmatic. The IDS has adopted many important documents relating to our specific political aim. The most important thing is that it was a dignified meeting of people who hold similar views and who want good for our state. Those who expected a spectacular development of events at this convention, and who, even before it took place, threatened Istria with the army and police, are now politically defeated in this area. This Is Not Autonomism [Ivankovic] Many will say that the declarations you have adopted (on Istria being a European region, on the autonomous County of Istria, on the democratization of the Republic of Croatia, and on the regional organization of the Republic of Croatia) display clear and evident autonomism. [Jakovcic] This has nothing to do with autonomism, because autonomism is a concept of political activities aimed at breaking up a state, whereas we are building Croatia and proposing a new vision of Croatia to the citizens of Croatia. If Croatia were organized through its historical regions of Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia and Baranja, Medjimurje, Zagorje, Lika, and so on, it would be completely normal if these regions had a certain status. Some regions could have autonomy, and some could have other statuses, instead of what the Croatian authorities have, judging by indications, agreed to, which is the confederalization of Croatia, and which it has been forced into because it was incapable of forming a different territorial organization. The autonomy of the individual, a group, a town, region, or municipality is something that is based on subsidiarity, which is the basis of Christian democracy. Those who wish to call themselves a Christian democratic party in Croatia do not in fact understand what it means. [Ivankovic] One gets the impression that, by adopting the declarations, you have achieved what you had not dared even put into the suspended Statute. What is the formal and legal significance of these documents? [Jakovcic] The declarations are the expression of our political wishes, of our will; they are the expression of what we intend to achieve through the institutions of the system. There are no possibilities and there is no need for the IDS to proclaim anything or do anything independently as long as the democratic system is in power. As long as the Croatian Parliament, the government, and the president are functioning, there will be democratic institutes, which are what goals should be achieved through. This is the direction our proposals for constitutional laws, built on the basis of these declarations, follow. We have observed the democratic procedure. Naturally, our proposals for constitutional laws will be put on the agenda of the Croatian Parliament only when the majority in the Croatian Parliament is behind our proposal. Therefore, with these documents we followed what we presented to President Tudjman at Brijuni late last summer, except now the highest IDS group stands behind them. The Constitution Once and Now... [Ivankovic] These documents now state in writing your demands for a region, not county, for legislative power, most of the direct revenue.... [Jakovcic] Naturally. These proposals ensue from two basic postulates -- getting to know about the European organization and the desire to organize Croatia after the model of Austrian and Italian regions, which is still far from the achievements of the German and Swiss types of federalism. The most beautiful caryatid of this idea is based on [Stjepan] Radic's treatment of Croatian counties, on his text of the Constitution dating from the early Twenties, in which he anticipates the counties to, I quote, "pass regulations that have the validity of laws." We must oppose those who now want to suspend Radic's positions! [Ivankovic] However, everything you are demanding contradicts the existing Croatian Constitution. [Jakovcic] The declarations we have adopted do not have this Croatian Constitution as a starting point. Our task, as the task of any other political party, is to fight for the achievement of our political aims in a democratic way. On the other hand, a change of the Constitution and the laws is to be expected, and this is our political aim, but it is not the only one. We are also asking for the change of the super-presidential political system; we want a parliamentary system in which the parliament and the government will have autonomy. We Want Early Elections [Ivankovic] It would be difficult to expect that your party will ever be in power in Croatia, except maybe in a coalition. Have you discussed these programmatic wishes with possible party partners in Croatia, and have they supported them? [Jakovcic] We have recently witnessed a great stratification in the political life of Croatia, especially over the past few weeks. The balance of political power is changing rapidly; stratification has occured in literally all Croatian political parties. Evidently it is necessary to consider early elections. I am sure that they will facilitate a different balance of power in the Croatian Parliament, which will provide the opportunity for the IDS to get closer to participating in the central state authorities! This is our aim and our wish. As far as the disposition of political parties regarding our political program is concerned, I must say that it is to be expected that our ideas will not be welcomed with open arms. However, the achieving of political aims is also a result of compromise and interests, of the balance of powers at the appropriate moment. [Ivankovic] Could it be concluded that this new course coincides with the crisis at the top of Croatian politics? [Jakovcic] No! The interpretations that say we want to strike at the moment the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is weak are wrong. We were supposed to adopt these documents at the party convention in February, in Pazin, but we were not able to do so due to the events in our party. We convened this one a month and a half ago. [Ivankovic] One of the declarations mentions a territorial expansion of Istria. You state that Opatija, Cres, Mali Losinj, Matulji, Moscenicka Draga, and other towns also belong to you. [Jakovcic] This is our well-known political position. It is not surprising, as our party is in power in that area; it is certainly also because of that part of our program that we gained the trust of the people there. If a referendum were to be held in these areas, they would certainly join the County of Istria, and it is our duty to let them express their positions, if nothing else. Naturally, nothing will be done by force, as was the case with the territorial organization of Croatia, when these regions were left out of the territory of our county exclusively because the people were against the HDZ, the local HDZ. [Ivankovic] Would you explain the position stated in the declarations that a referendum is more valid than the decisions made by the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia? [Jakovcic] Take the confederation, which is a topical issue, for instance. It is unacceptable to the IDS that a decision on, say, joining a confederation with any state is made in parliament. That has to be the result of a referendum. A Referendum for Changes [Ivankovic] This position on referendums does not relate to Istria then? [Jakovcic] No, it would not mean that, for instance, a referendum in Istria would be more powerful than the decisions made by the Croatian Parliament. But, while we are on the subject of a referendum in Istria, I believe that referendums should be held when there is a wish for change, rather than imposing something. This does not only relate to Istria, but to the whole of Croatia. [Ivankovic] There have been estimates that this is the most severe crisis in the relations between Istria and the central authorities ever. [Jakovcic] I would not say this was the most severe crisis; the issue is only the continuity of the politics toward Istria that has now started to show its cards, having stated that it can consolidate its positions in Istria with the police and army, which is crazy! Except for the raised voice, there is nothing new there. The fact is that the reputation of Croatian leadership is at present the worst since we have had the multiparty system! [Ivankovic] How do you think things will develop regarding the suspension of the Statute of the County of Istria? [Jakovcic] It is difficult to predict, as circumstances change very quickly, and the judiciary in Croatia is obviously not independent. Ivic Pasalic's statement that "judges should implement the state policies" is a clear indication of that. The Statute may be suspended, but it will not change the policies of the IDS, the County Assembly, and, least of all, of our people. [Ivankovic] Is the statute unconstitutional or not? [Jakovcic] Absolutely not! It would be fair if those who have been trying to have it suspended return it, so it can be seen if there is anything that could perhaps be altered. Regardless of that, I am sure we will be able to prove that our statute complies with the Constitution and the laws. [Ivankovic] Is there a danger of a commission being appointed in Istria, thus blocking the local authorities and introducing a kind of "state of emergency"? [Jakovcic] If that were to happen, it would represent the definite end of the politics that subsists on conflicts anyway, and as it gets difficult to find enemies, they are now found in Istria. The appointment of the Council for Istria and the announcement of the suspension of our statute happening at the same time is no coincidence. The party in power wants to mitigate its own crisis through the media, and is therefore now trying to concentrate everything on Istria. Osimo Is Out of Date [Ivankovic] Does it not seem to you now, after President Tudjman asked that more people be appointed to the Council for Istria, that his approach is more flexible? [Jakovcic] This move was made at the moment it became clear that the Council could fall apart, which would have been a great discredit to those who founded the Council. If the task of the Council was presenting the positions of the IDS and the citizens of Istria to the president of the Republic, it would be acceptable. However, that is evidently not the case. [Ivankovic] You have now stated in the documents what you had only talked about before, which is that Istria is left with only two-thirds of the direct revenue, while one third goes to the state. [Jakovcic] That is the political position in principle, to establish exactly what the direct revenue is, which would be in accordance with the authorizations. The state would thus have the basic attributes of statehood, which each region would have to finance, and the regions would have a financial base. It is really absurd that towns now have much greater budgets than the counties they are in. [Ivankovic] What is your interpretation of the political situation in Italy and the demands regarding our territory? [Jakovcic] There are neofascists everywhere. The Serbs have them -- they want Greater Serbia; there are those who talk of a banner on the Romanija, and then there are those who say that Istria and Dalmatia are Italian. I am sure that the new Italian Government will not consider these ideas of changing the borders. At any rate, the IDS will be the first to oppose any possibility of changing the borders, as every change of borders in Istria always had a tragic end. [Ivankovic] What about the annexes to the Osimo Accords? [Jakovcic] They are simply necessary, as the Accords are out of date. Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy should start constructive talks. I would like to ask the authorities to include us, who have a direct interest in it, in the process. [Box 1, p 5] Istria as a European Region [Ivankovic] One of the declarations you have adopted is the Declaration on Istria as a European Region, consisting of Croatian municipalities, three Slovenian ones, and one Italian. You have proposed that Porec be the center of the region. [Jakovcic] The concept of the organization of the European region is similar to those of which there are about 40 in the European Union, and it was drawn up with the hope that Croatia and Slovenia aspire to the European Union. This final draft of the declaration shows that no one here wants either an Istrian Republic or state, as is said in the accusations of the neofascists in Croatia, but that we want the free movement of people, capital, and ideas on the territory where it has always worked. I hope that it will be met with understanding in the Croatian, Slovene, and Italian Parliaments. When Croatia is accepted at the Council of Europe, we will present this as a clear demand. [Box 2, p 5] Demilitarization [Ivankovic] You have demanded that Istria be a demilitarized zone. [Jakovcic] Our position that ladies in print pants rather than uniformed soldiers should walk around Istria is well known. This is not possible to regulate at present due to the semiwar situation our state is in, but of Istria it is both an objective need and a possibility. We would like to remind those who say we are asking for this because the Istrians do not want to serve in the Croatian Army and participate in safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of Croatia, that even the highest officials of the Ministry of Defense have established that the degree of positive response to mobilization in Croatia was by far the highest in Istria, and that our boys behave in a highly disciplined way at the frontlines.
