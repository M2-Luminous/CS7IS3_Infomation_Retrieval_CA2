FR940119-1-00002 FR940119-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Part 273 [Amendment No. 351] Food Stamp Program_Distribution of Employment and Training Performance-Based Funds AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: State agencies that are responsible for administering the Food Stamp Program are required to operate the Food Stamp Employment and Training (E&T) program. To assist in the operation of their E&T programs, the State agencies receive a Federal E&T grant, a portion of which is distributed on the basis of each State agency's performance in serving the target population. This rule proposes to freeze the performance-based grants at the level the State agencies received in Fiscal Year 1993, for two years from promulgation of this rule in final form. The Department is proposing this action because of statutory amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, made by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (December 13, 1991). DATES: Comments must be received by March 21, 1994 to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Ellen Henigan, Supervisor, Work Programs Section, Program Development Division, Food Stamp Program, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22302. Comments may also be sent via fax to the attention of Ms. Henigan at (703) 305&hyph;2454. All written comments will be open for public inspection during regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) at 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA, Room 718. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Questions regarding this rulemaking should be addressed to Ms. Henigan at the above address or by telephone at (703) 305&hyph;2762. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule is issued in conformance with E.O. 12866. Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.551. For reasons set forth in the final rule related Notice(s) of 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). Christopher J. Martin, Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this action does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencies will be the most affected because they administer the Program and the rule will affect the performance-based funding levels for each State agency. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
