An National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] spokesman said there had been no shooting overnight. Five people died and more than 40 were wounded in Tuesday's running battles between the two groups. The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], which demanded the withdrawal of the NPKF by 5 PM on Tuesday, was sticking to their demand despite the political settlement reached on Tuesday for the IFP's participation in next week's election. IFP Transvaal Political Director Themba Khoza said the NPKF must be removed "as quickly as possible" and replaced with the Internal Stability Unit. "This is a confrontational situation, they definitely have to remove the NPKF." The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday cancelled their planned "Operation Access" tour of East Rand townships "due to the excessive violence and unrest". The IEC established "Operation Access" to help those parties promote their election manifestos in townships that feel they cannot campaign freely.
