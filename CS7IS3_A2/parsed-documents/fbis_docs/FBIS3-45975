During the talks, Haller said: Switzerland and China are far apart geographically and have different cultural backgrounds. Therefore, it is very important for their parliaments to conduct exchanges. Haller had visited China in 1976. She said: Despite its huge population, China has satisfied the needs of its people for clothing, food, shelter, and transportation; it has achieved fruitful results in social security. She expressed her admiration for the tremendous achievements scored by China. Qiao Shi briefed Speaker Haller on China's economic development. Qiao Shi said: China's rural economic reform has brought tremendous changes to the countryside. Subsequent urban reform also promoted fast urban economic development and yielded great results. He indicated: It is possible that China will realize, ahead of schedule, the strategic objective of economic development it aims to achieve by the turn of the century. He said: China will deepen reform nationwide and open wider to the outside world. Qiao Shi said emphatically: Only by maintaining stability at home and safeguarding peace internationally can China develop its economy and its people enjoy more political and economic freedoms. To maintain political stability, China still needs to strengthen its legal system.
