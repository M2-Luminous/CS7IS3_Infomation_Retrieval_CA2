Arroyo and C. Raygoza] [Text] The Mexpetrol S.A. Group is on the verge of purchasing a refinery located in Cuba's Cienfuegos Province, sources close to the negotiations told the FINANCIAL SATELLITE NEWS SERVICE (FINSAT). Mexpetrol authorities have declined to comment on the report and have referred questions on the matter to Mexican Petroleum (Pemex), which owns 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock. In turn, the Pemex public relations office would only say: "This is a sensitive issue, and we have been instructed to deal with it cautiously." Meanwhile, National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomex) officials said: "Cuba and business Mexico conducts with the Caribbean island are sensitive issues in light of our country's current relations with the United States." Bancomex is another government partner of Mexpetrol, holding 5 percent of Mexpetrol stock. According to information supplied by officials familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity, "one of the stumbling blocks to concluding the talks is that the Cuban authorities are asking a very high price for some installations that have obsolete technology"; these officials refused to give specific amounts. The refinery in question has a 60,000 barrel per day [bpd] heavy crude processing capacity, which is similar to the capacity of Pemex's Maya refinery. Industry sources place its value between $15 and $200 million [figures as published]. The U.S. publication "The Latin American Energy Alert" which circulates in North America has disclosed that Mexpetrol authorities met with Cuban authorities in Havana in February to discuss the possible purchase. It appears the refinery currently operates at half of its installed capacity by producing 60,000 bpd [as published]. According to the publication, the Cuban Government will sell the Cienfuegos refinery in exchange for Mexpetrol's promise to release part of the refined production to the island for internal use. Once refined, the remaining crude would be exported and marketed in Mexico. The Cienfuegos refinery was designed with Soviet technology. It previously processed Venezuelan crude when Venezuela sold its products to the then-Soviet Union, and from this fact it is assumed heavy crude will continue to be processed at the refinery. Currently, Pemex hold 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock while Bancomex and the Mexican Petroleum Institue hold 5 percent apiece. The rest of the stock is held by the Mexican construction companies Protexa, Bufete Industrial, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, and Equipo Petroleros Nacionales. Up until last year the Lanzagorta group held 13 percent of Mexpetrol stock, but at the beginning of 1993 it sold its holdings and withdrew from the company. Before now, this has never been officially reported.
