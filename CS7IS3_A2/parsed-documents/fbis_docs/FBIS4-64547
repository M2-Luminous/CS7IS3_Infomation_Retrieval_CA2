She said: Nobody should be involved in scenarios set up to protect the damaged interests of certain business circles. Ciller stressed that on behalf of the people, the government will break the chains around the economy with the same determination it has been displaying in defeating terrorism. Addressing a True Path Party [TPP] meeting today, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, the TPP leader, pointed out that the economic problems were not caused by the present government. We set out on our path with determination, she said, in order to solve the problems we inherited. The prime minister said that taking excessive loans and then taking loans to pay the interest on the original loans was one of the reasons for the problem. She explained that during its last term, the ANAP [Motherland Party] government was using 3,000-percent short-term advance loans yearly and that the public deficit was at a record level. She then discussed the incorrect foreign exchange rate policy pursued since 1987. [Begin Ciller recording] It is an economic rule that in order to keep the foreign exchange rate low, you must raise interest rates to very high levels. However, this is an incorrect policy. If you keep the foreign exchange rate so low, you get a lot of foreign exchange in the country. You then take that foreign exchange, change it, buy government bonds, make a tax-free profit on the artificially raised interest rate, and take that money out of the country again. Those who did that went to banks abroad, deposited their gains, and took 100 percent or 200 percent in loans. They brought those loans and foreign exchange into the country again, changed them into Turkish money, and bought government bonds again. They then took their tax-free profits out of the country again. This has been going on since 1987. This was the vicious circle we had to break. [end recording] Ciller explained that had the low foreign exchange rate and high interest rate policy been pursued further, the public sector would have collapsed in 1995. She said: We would have had to take loans at high interest rates in order to keep the foreign exchange rate low. The taxes would all have gone toward paying interest. We would have reached a point in 1995 where we would have had no money for anything else -- not for education, not for investment, and not for the salaries of the civil servants. The TPP leader pointed out that the import-export deficit was another reason why her government had to break the vicious circle. [Begin Ciller recording] Our decision to break this vicious circle was not to the liking of certain circles who used to make that sort of deal, who had brought $12 billion into the country in that way, and who were waiting to take it out with the interest. In fact, those circles are now waging a major struggle. They are traitors. I am saying this openly. [applause] They are traitors, because if this vicious circle is not broken, the bill will have to be paid by the people. Who is going to pay for the interest? Who is going to pay for the bill of this foreign exchange rate, given the large deficit between imports and exports? Today, the honorable leader of the Motherland Party was caught red-handed. He was caught red-handed. [applause] Mr. Mesut Yilmaz is saying that business circles want him to topple this government. What business circles are these? Are they patriotic, medium-size business circles that were not involved in these deals, did not incur losses, and then did not come crying for help? No, they are not. Are they small business circles? No. Are they the villagers? No. Are they the shopkeepers? No. Are they our workers and civil servants? No, they are not. Who are they? They are those whose interests were damaged. [passage omitted] The leader of the TPP is not the leader of the happy few. [applause] The leader of this party is not elected by a group of people outside parliament. This party has held its congresses. It held two congresses during the past year. It also participated in elections. Those circles who could not make Mesut Yilmaz prime minister, despite all the treason and all their intensive efforts, are now trying to circumvent the parliament in undemocratic ways. Nobody should even try, because the TPP, which has waged a democratic struggle throughout its history, will never allow that. [end recording] Ciller stressed that given the composition of the parliament, no government can be formed without the TPP. She said that the TPP leader was not elected by an extraparliamentary minority group but by the people's delegates at the party congress. [Begin Ciller recording] Nobody should declare himself above parliament. Nobody should even try to carry out a minority coup. Nobody should be involved in scenarios set up undemocratically and outside parliament to establish a so-called government of technocrats or some such thing. This will only serve to protect the damaged interests of certain business circles. Nobody should make false threats in order to achieve that. [applause] [passage omitted] [end recording]
