Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, arrived in Baku and held talks with President Geydar Aliyev the day before yesterday. It has been reported that Aliyev and Kazimirov argued rigorously in their six-hour talks in camera. It has also been reported that no calls were transferred to their meeting. Several sources have said that Vladimir Kazimirov adopted a hard line approach and outlined Russia's determination to deploy troops in Daghlyk Karabakh, noting that Moscow will do whatever is necessary to achieve its objective. However, they quoted President Aliyev reacting to Kazimirov as follows: "Russia cannot deploy its troops in Azerbaijan by itself. They will have to tread over my dead body first. Russia's troops can be deployed within the framework of an international force, which the CSCE will establish." Kazimirov shuttled between the presidential palace and the parliament yesterday. He held talks with Speaker of the National Assembly Resul Guliyev and Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov for five hours. It has been reported that heated exchanges took place in that meeting. Guliyev and Kazimirov were received by Aliyev in the evening. Kazimirov has had intensive talks in Baku during the past three days. However, the reluctance of the officials to make a disclosure and the measures they have taken to avoid the correspondents have drawn attention. In view of that, the correspondents have been unable to establish the changes Kazimirov may have proposed in Russia's peace plan on Karabakh. The latest reports said that Azerbaijan objected to Russia deploying its troops in Daghlyk Karabakh by itself and insisted that an international force be deployed in that region. It has been reported that Kazimirov will travel from Baku to Yerevan to hold talks with the Armenian officials. He will then return to Azerbaijan.
