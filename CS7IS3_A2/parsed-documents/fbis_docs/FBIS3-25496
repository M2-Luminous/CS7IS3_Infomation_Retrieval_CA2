Doonan] [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela's intimations that Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was responsible for the weekend massacre in Natal encouraged further violence, the IFP said on Monday [21 February]. Mr Mandela on Sunday said Saturday's killing of 15 ANC supporters in Creighton was the result of Natal leaders' irresponsible talk urging resistance to the April elections. IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said on Monday Mr Mandela's response, "far from subduing inflamed passions, encourages a violent counter response to avenge the mass slaying". "For a man of his perceived stature, we find it highly unfortunate that he succumbs to apportioning blame before allowing law enforcement agencies to determine culpability." The IFP appealed to all political leaders to "consider their words and rhetoric very carefully during this time of great upheaval and uncertainty". Mr Tillet expressed his party's condolences to the families of the victins. The IFP has always subscribed to the philosophy that an eye for an eye makes the entire world blind, he said.
