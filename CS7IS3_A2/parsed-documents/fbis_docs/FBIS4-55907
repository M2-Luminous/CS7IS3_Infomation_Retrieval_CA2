As reported by Croatian radio, Croat civilians were also banned from entering or leaving Vares. The local Bosnian Croat army command requsted mediation of the United Nations peacekeepers (UNPROFOR), said the radio. Vares, a mining town which had a majority Croat population before the war, was seized by the Moslem army last autumn. Around 10,000 Croats expelled from the town have sought shelter in the territory of the Serb republic, the state of the Bosnian Serbs. The relations between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems have become tense on the terrain and the number of incidents is growing while the leaderships of the two Bosnian ethnic communities are preparing a formal proclamation of a new, Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia on May 30. The agreement on forming a Moslem-Croat federation was reached under strong pressure of the United States. For a whole year before their abrupt reconciliation in march, the two sides were engaged in bloody fighting for territories with mixed population in the central and southern parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
