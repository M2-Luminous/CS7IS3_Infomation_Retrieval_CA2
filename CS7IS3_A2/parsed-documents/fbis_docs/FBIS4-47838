They have been invited to submit a tender to supply Britain's Royal Air Force with Rooivalk [red falcon] choppers, a signal that the arms embargo may soon be lifted. Marinus Wijnbeek reports: After about 20 years the second South African Air Force flight to Britain, in as many weeks, is preparing to leave from Waterkloof Air Force base, and in its hold is Denel's Rooivalk attack helicopter. Fitting the large aircraft into Hercules is an engineering feat all by itself. Rooivalk will be demonstrated at the coming air show at (Middlewallop) in Britain. Since December last year the weapons systems have undergone intensive tests. The aircraft has a chin- mounted canon and it is also fitted with the Kentron ZT-3 antitank missile. It is these tank killing properties and its very modern technology that resulted in the invitation to submit the bid in Britain. The aircraft can operate under all weather conditions in virtually any region of the world. Six other contenders from the USA and Europe have also entered helicopters. If successful 91 Rooivalk aircraft will be exported to the UK.
