Such a law could help the government in shifting the country away from a centrally planned economy, said an official with the State Administration for Industry & Commerce. China already has a law against unfair competition, which took effect in December, but the government acknowledges that it is not strong enough to suppress monopolistic practices, said Ma Yanling, an official of the administration's Economic Checking Department. China's drive to build a market oriented economic system requires a legal structure to plug loopholes that allow fake products, false advertising, giveaway sales and contract kickbacks, she added. The expected law against monopolistic practices is also in step with the country's efforts to restructure its business system to conform with fair-trade rules set down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which it hopes to rejoin. The government intends the new law to ban regional restrictive business practices and unfair restraint of trade by public utilities such as cooking gas and electrical supply companies. But, Ma noted, it will be at least another year before such a law gets final approval from the National People's Congress (NPC). To prepare for drafting the legislation, legal officials are busily consulting foreign experts, especially those in developed countries. Chinese efforts to draw on foreign experience and insight regarding laws against unfair competition were spotlighted by two major international seminars last month in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The United Nations' Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD) and the State Administration for Industry & Commerce jointly sponsored the seminars with more than 150 participants from Chinese and foreign agencies. They were intended to provide an opportunity for Chinese legal officials to exchange their experiences on the implementation of the anti-unfair competition law. They also were expected to help Chinese officials learn from foreign experiences in preparation for drafting the law against monopolies, said Wang Zhifang, another official with the State Administration for Industry & Commerce. Besides the United Nations officials, German and British officials also participated in the seminars, which were the first international meetings of their kind jointly sponsored by the UN and the administration. Gan Guoping, Vice-Minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, told the meetings that the government was keen to strengthen co-operation with the UN and foreign legal officials to tighten restrictions against unfair competitive and restrictive business practices. China will carry on the campaign against unfair competition and will work out new laws banning trade monopolies in its bids to bring about an orderly transition from central planning to a socialist market-oriented economy, he added. Realization of this ambition requires closer co-operation and a frequent exchanges with foreign legal institutions, Gan noted. According to official sources, illegal lotteries to promote sales, kickbacks in awarding contracts and regional restrictions on businesses designed to protect local industries are still widespread in China.
