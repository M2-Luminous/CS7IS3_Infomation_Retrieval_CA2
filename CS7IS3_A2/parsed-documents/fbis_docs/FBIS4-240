This comes amid reports that neo-Nazi sympathisers from Europe -- and possibly including battle-hardened Bosnian snipers fresh from the Yugoslavian war -- are entering the country to assist the local right-wing. Two weeks ago, German right-winger Mr. Thomas Kunst, 32, was shot dead in a firefight with police near Welbekend. Mr. Stephan Rays, 26, Mr. Horst Klenz, 57, and German Mr. Alex Nedelnein were later arrested. The men were apparently invited to South Africa by the right-wing. In the March 14 edition of an international news magazine, a Bosnian sniper is quoted as saying they feared revenge attacks after the war. "They are hiring men like us in South Africa," said the man, identified only as Pipo. Other local reports, quoting anonymous right-wing sources, claim that foreign mercenaries are already in the country.
