He also insisted there had been no change in Government policy over Bosnia. He ridiculed the idea that he and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had been overruled by the Prime Minister in agreeing to the ultimatum on air strikes to protect Sarajevo. Mr Rifkind was speaking after the NATO allies served a 10-day notice on the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo that air strikes would be launched on behalf of the UN unless they withdrew. The ultimatum, following 12 hours of talks in Brussels, paved the way for the first military action in NATO's history. It was reinfoced by President Clinton who said: "NATO is now set to act. Anyone, anyone, shelling Sarajevo must recognise this fact and be prepared to deal with the consequences. "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," he told a White House briefing. Sarajevo was quiet overnight, apart from isolated bursts of small arms and machinegun fire. A ceasefire in the city, negotiated by the British commander of United Nations peacekeeping forces, Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, was due to take effect by noon (1100 GMT). The NATO ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed consideration of all military and political implications for the West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of weaponry to UN forces. It also threatens air strikes immediately if any shelling resumes in the wake of last weekend's street market massacre which killed 68 civilians. One effect of the ultimatum in Sarajevo was a promise by the Bosnian Serb army last night to withdraw its big guns from around the city. Mr Rifkind stressed that the UN had not taken sides against the Serbs and that the ultimatum to stop firing around Sarajevo applied to the Bosnian government forces as well. He said Britain and France already provided most of the UN forces in Bosnia. But he added: "There is clearly a possibility that the UN may require some extra forces in order to monitor the ceasfire between the Muslims and the Serbs in Sarajevo. "We obviously would want to see what other countries are doing, who was pulling their weight and who wasn't. That would have to be the basis of any future position." He admitted the situation in Bosnia was now dangerous for British forces, but added: "It has been dangerous throughout." He said: "The objective is to make the Serbs carry out their promise and if they carry out their promise there will not be any air strikes," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He denied British Government policy over Bosnia had changed, after initial emphasis on supplying humanitarian aid and not getting involved in a civil war. "What we have accepted right from the very beginning is that there are ways in which the use of military force can reduce suffering in Bosnia." The soldiers had prevented atrocities just by their presence, he said. "What we agreed yesterday was an extension of that because what we are anxious to do is to end the kind of atrocity we saw in Sarajevo last weekend." Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision will not endanger three key goals: - The continuation of humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of Sarajevo. - The maintenance of the peace process. - The containment of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former Yugoslavia. Lord Owen, peace negotiator on behalf of the European Union, said today: "The Bosnian Serbs told us before the artillery shell dropped in the market place so tragically on Saturday, that they were ready for what is called a `Sarajevo first' policy of UN administration and demilitarisation. "So I think there is a fairly good chance this agreement will now stick." The three warring factions in Bosnia -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- will be holding more talks on Geneva today to try to find a negotiated peace.
