(SNARK) -- The highest danger faced by Georgia today is radicalization of political forces in the republic, declared at a press-conference today Zurab Zhvania, the general secretary of the most influential party Georgian Civil Union. He spoke against all kinds of "street actions" as forms of political struggle. Representative of the party, founded by Eduard Shevardnadze's initiative, stated that demonstrations and meetings may ultimately result in creation of absolutely different forces which may attempt to revive old communist principles in the country. Therefore the oppositional parties and the Civil Union have to join their efforts in construction of a free and powerful Georgia, emphasized Zurab Zhvania.
