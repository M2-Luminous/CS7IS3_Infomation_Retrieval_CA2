This justifies the establishment of a second batch of nuclear power stations in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as being relatively safe, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the State Seismological Bureau Mr. Fang Zhangshun said in an interview with this agency. The southern area of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan suffered from fewer earthquakes than North China and Taiwan even though they are situated on a seismic belt and quakes measuring more than seven on the Richter scale have rocked Quanzhou in Fujian and Xiongzhou in Hainan on several occasions in the distant past. Quakes which have hit southeast China have mostly been of small magnitude and of short duration. The selection of sites for the setting up of nuclear power stations is in line with international practice and the geological structure of potential sites. A nuclear power station must be seated directly in bedrock, meaning no establishment of a nuclear power station within a radius of five kilometres of an active fault. Anti-quake facilities for nuclear power stations are constructed with reference to the greatest precautions to cope with the biggest quake which could possibly occur within a period of some 10,000 years. The standard in the Mainland is much higher than that in Japan and Taiwan where nuclear power stations are mushrooming. China will spend ten years on safety assessment and anti-quake work on its major nuclear power station projects, according to Mr. Fang. A quake measuring six on the Richter scale will not be likely to cause great damage or casualties in economically-developed areas after a period of ten years. The second nuclear power station in Guangdong will also probably be built at Daya Bay while a third one is likely to be located at Yangjiang, another city in Guangdong. A nuclear power station in Fujian will be constructed either in Huian County or Changle County while a second nuclear power plant in Zhejiang will be most likely situated at Sanmen. Jiangxi, Shandong and Hainan are now working towards the establishment of nuclear power stations, having feasibility studies already passed.
