Olesk, together with a representative of the Estonian Armed Forces in the town, Colonel Raul Luks, and the government's special representative Juri Tikk met with an audience of about 300 Paldiski residents. Participants in the meeting adopted a resolution in which they welcomed the government's move to register a new the town's legal residents. "At the same time they say Paldiski shouldn't be subordinated to the town of Keila for any period of time," Olesk said today. The minister said it was unrealistic to hold early elections in Paldiski. Estonia left Paldiski out of the list before last fall's local elections, because of the large number of Russian military remaining there, as well as for refusal by the local Russian police office there to turn over the files of legal residents' and car registers. Olesk said it was cheaper to put Paldiski under the authority of Keila than to set up a temporary governor's office in the town itself. The government approved the plan to put Paldiski under Keila's municipal government on Feb. 15. The temporary scheme of governing is to remain effective until local elections are held in Paldiski.
