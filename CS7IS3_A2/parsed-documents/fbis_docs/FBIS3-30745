If they do not reach a compromise, the Krajina political scene could turn into a merciless struggle between the two enemy camps. The continuation of the media campaign against Babic, also supported by television reporters and politicians from the Socialist Party of Serbia, points to this possibility. According to the method used so far, public opinion is being prepared for the message that Babic is to blame for a parliamentary crisis that could happen if his party does not support the personnel changes proposed by President Martic. A coalition between Babic's Socialist Democratic Party (SDS) of Krajina with 30 seats in parliament, and the Radical Party with 16 is the only one that could possibly achieve the simple majority of 84 representatives. The creation of this coalition was announced before the election by both Babic and the Radical Party. After the second election round, Babic's supporters had the feeling, however, that the Radical Party did not keep it's promise to vote for Babic in the election, so that there is now suspicion about this coalition. Lazar Macura, a SDS Krajina representative, said in a statement for BORBA that he could not assess the behavior of the Radical Party members in the election in general, but that "it seemed to him that not everybody voted for Babic." Who Will Be the Prime Minister? "Babic and Vojislav Seselj agreed on the coalition, and I do not believe that they will change their attitude, especially because the Radical Party wants to have one leadership, so that there will be no postion of party chairman for Krajina. On the other hand, it is also possible that some members of parliament might change to some other party, but this cannot lead to an imbalance of power," Macura says. In his opinion, it is quite logical that Martic propose a new prime minister from the SDS Krajina. Asked what he thinks about opinions that this function could be offered to Djordje Bjegovic, the present prime minister, or to Borislav Mikelic, Macura answered that Krajina Socialist Party members cannot nominate the new prime minister since they only have 6 seats in parliament. He added that Mikelic should have better "run as a member of parliament to see what the people think of him." President Martic avoided answering this question in the news conference held in Knin on Friday [28 January 1994], stating that "consultations with representatives of the parties are under way." He can count on the support of the Socialist Party and of the 15 SDS members of parliament who support the idea of united Serbian countries. As far as the eight independent members of parliament are concerned, some of them allegedly support Martic, and some Babic. Apart from that, even if he gets the votes of eight members from two small parties, he will not have the necessary majority in parliament. Martic offering Babic the position of the prime minister and giving him the authority to form the new government in order to soothe passions has also been considered. It would be interesting if the man who was anathematized in the election campaign and almost declared an enemy of the nation became prime minister. It is very questionable, however, whether Babic would accept this offer. Between Pale and Belgrade There are also similar considerations among the inhabitants of Knin. A quick opinion poll carried out in the streets of Knin proved that most of the people believe that "everything will hopefully be fine." Young people avoid making comments on the election. Some people alluded to worries over their personal safety if they made comments on the election. Martic's supporters speak the language recognizable from Sarajevo Radio and Television, whereas Babic's supporters cannot explain the turn in the election results. The attitude that "everything will hopefully be fine" is understandable in the present situation, which is difficult not only because of the exhausting three-year war, but also because of the present threats from Zagreb and because of political partitions in Krajina. Apart from that, there are -- for simple people -- inexplicable measures from Belgrade (the Geneva agreement between Tudjman and Milosevic) and Pale (the announcement that the Serbs who live in the areas up to the Una River will be united first; the regions up to the Kupa River will follow later). Mitar Vujnovic, a 40-year-old man from the vicinity of Knin, says that "in the end, people always say what they want" and that "nothing can be decided without the people." Lazar Macura thinks, however, that political divisions have been imposed and sees the Geneva agreement as the "old Yugoslav syndrome" of making agreements "behind somebody's back," which harms Krajina. Between the hope that "everything will hopefully be fine" and the suspicions, there remains the question of why Belgrade supported Martic. Both Babic and Martic supported the idea that all Serbian countries should unite and that the president of this newly established state should be Slobodan Milosevic. The only difference is that Martic would call this new state "Serbia, that is to say Yugoslavia," and Babic exclusively Serbia. Other election messages, which referred to defense, the economy, stamping out crime and so forth, remained at the level of the usual election phrases. Babic was presented in the campaign as the man who "only thinks of how to reach power" and who intends to "give Krajina back to Croatia," whereas Martic was given the aura of the unifier and of the most responsible man for the defense of Krajina (as if there was no Krajina Army). Obstinate and Subordinate Experts on Krajina think that Martic's support from Belgrade resulted from Babic's obstinacy (in his relation to Milosevic) and from Martic's subordination to Milosevic's influence (it must not be forgotten that Martic is inclined to the Communist Party-Movement for Yugoslavia). These interpretations will soon be checked. It is indicative that Vladislav Jovanovic, the minister of foreign affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, announced talks with his Hungarian colleague, Mr. Geza Jeszenszky. He also expressed the hope that the oil pipeline through Croatia would be opened soon, an issue that could be solved in talks between the representatives of Croatia and Krajina "after the agreement on an absolute cease-fire" is signed. Does this mean that Minister Jovanovic already knows that such an agreement will be signed soon, in spite of the impediment that could not be removed so far -- that the Croatian forces withdraw from the occupied Krajina areas. Martic cited this problem in his first address. Croatia has not agreed to this condition so far, but, in spite of that, the joint declaration was signed in Geneva and it was announced that the oil pipeline and the highway between Zagreb and Belgrade, which both run through Krajina, would be reopened. This means that Martic is already being tested. Should there be a crisis in connection with forming the government and with the work of parliament, he could make use of the constitutional power he has as president, especially in a state of war. Apart from the considerable influence he has on the police, Martic has additionally obtained the position of the supreme commander of the Krajina Army, where he has already announced "quality changes." [Box, p 12] Conflict With Karadzic Lazar Macura claims that he has never said that Radovan Karadzic is a foreign citizen, stating that this allegation comes from Sarajevo Radio and Television, which misinterpreted his statement that "it is sad that Mr. Karadzic joined the election campaign in Banija [part of Krajina] walking in company of Mr. Mile Paspalj." Macura adds that Paspalj got the least votes in the election in Glina. He also denies the stories that the police of the Republic of Serbian Krajina took away his passport and threw him off the bus because of this statement, so that he had to wait for a train in order to return to Knin. [Box, p 12] Unitary SDS The SDS leadership wants to neutralize the importance and the influence of the party through renewed attempts to create a unitary SDS before the Krajina Parliament is formed. The SDS Main Committee agreed in principal with the creation of a unitary SDS, on condition, however, that the election is completed and the new leadership in Krajina is constituted.
