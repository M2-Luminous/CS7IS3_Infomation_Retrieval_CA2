(?In this regard), as a simple voter, (Assa Ovono) cannot appeal for the annulment of the entire 5 December 1993 poll. Considering--in the case of the other plaintiffs--that Article 2 of the Constitution sanctions the principle of indivisibility of the Republic and that Article 3 reaffirms that the national sovereignty belongs to the people and that they exercise it directly through referendum or election in accordance with the principle of multiparty democracy and indirectly through the constitutional institutions, while Article 7 warns that any act threatening the Republic entity, unity, secularity of the state, sovereignty, and independence constitute a high treason crime punished by the law; considering that following the announcement of the results of the 5 December 1993 by the minister of territorial administration, Paul Mba Abessole self-proclaimed president of the Gabonese Republic, that on the same day he appointed a prime minister, namely Pierre Andre Kombila, and that they deliberately placed themselves in illegality, thus ignoring the existence of the Constitution and therefore the institutions legally put in place; and considering that as a result of their belonging to these so-called Republican institutions, the plaintiffs have incessantly, ostensibly, and on a daily basis carried out acts that make a section of the people consider them as legitimate authorities, and that these acts threaten the unity of the state and national sovereign, there is reason to reject their appeals. We therefore decide: Article 1. The appeal for annulment of the results of the 5 December 1993 poll filed by (Assa Ovono) is not receivable. Article 2. Also declared nonreceivable are the appeals filed at the same time by Paul Mba Abessole, Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe, Peierre-Claver Maganga-Oussavou, Jean-Pierre Lemboumba Lepandou, Jules Aristide Bourdes Ogoulinguende, Alexandre Sambat, Leon Boyendou, Marc Saturnin Ma-Nguema, (Simon Oyono Aba), Leon Mebiane Mba, and (Divoungui) Article 3. The results of the 5 December 1993 poll proclaimed on 13 December 1993 by the Constitutional Court have been confirmed.
