It appears they have become familiar with the situation and are nonchalant despite the bomb attacks recently made on the residences of the Interior Minister and an opposition party leader. An attack made recently on a locomotive traveling on the southern rail line only succeeded in terrorizing the train crew. The people of the South have now become so familiar with the bombings that as opposed to feeling that they are living in the shadow of fear it is quite to the contrary. If there were no bombings it would be beyond the realms of normality. Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut seems unperturbed by the bomb attack directed at his home, saying he would not allow the attacks to intimidate him wherever they may occur. Despite this statement, the bombings are a genuine cause of concern for Chuan Likphai's coalition government. No matter what group is responsible for the attacks, if they are allowed to continue unabated, they are bound to undermine the confidence of the people in the government's ability to maintain law and order. If apathy is allowed to set in, when considering the attitudes of the citizens of the country and the government to the bombings, there would seem to be little hope of locating those responsible and stamping out the attacks for good. One confounding factor in the bombing issue is that the identity of the group responsible for the attacks is unknown and no demands have been made. At this time the attacks would seem to be pointless. It is possible that Gen Chawalit believes he has received up-to- date information from his advisers on the issue but there is one point he may have failed to consider. The group responsible for the bombings may be politically motivated with an ultimate intention of causing political chaos and disruption in the nation. Recent reports that foreign terrorist groups planned to attack the Israeli embassy in Bangkok were probably unconnected to the bombing incidents that have already been carried out in the capital, as attacks on local politician's homes are unlikely to gain anything for Middle Eastern terrorist groups, who would seem to be the most likely perpetrators of any such attack on the embassy. Let's consider the probable intentions of the group responsible for the bombings: A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to maintain stability. To increase pressure on the government at a time when parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible this could lead to the dissolution of parliament. Prior political forces in the country might be able to return to power in this way. If the government is left alone to carry out its duties unhindered, the chances of any forces of the past returning to power would diminish. Some observers say the planting of the bombs can clearly be seen as the dying throes of a spent political force but these are few and far between. They can be narrowed down into two categories -- democratic and dictatorial. Democratic political parties, or those who profess to be, come in several forms. Power swings to and fro depending on the opinions of the electorate during general elections. Before the formation of the National Peace Keeping Council (NPKC), the Chatchai administration maintained a grip on power. Coming from self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom to successfully defend himself against allegations of corruption, former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan's Chat Thai Party failed to get reelected in the last general election. Chat Thai have now been relegated to assume the role of opposition party, but are eagerly waiting in the wings for a final banana skin to bring down the government for good. All the opposition parties will have an opportunity to return to power, courtesy of the democracy system which necessitates the holding of free general elections. Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts to pressure the government. Their use of criticism during parliamentary sessions is usually adequate. Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the suspicions of those investigating the bombings. Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of political power are the most deserving for the focus of suspicion as they have the most to gain. With the democracy system now firmly in place they are unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to seize power again. It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an impression of competence. The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a good place to begin investigations although some observers have said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks. Does Gen Chawalit know who the culprits are?
