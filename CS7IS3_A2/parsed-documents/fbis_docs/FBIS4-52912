The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday came up with criticism of Kim's remarks while the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) quickly refuted the charges. "Kim made inappropriate remarks at an improper time," said DLP chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki in a meeting of party leaders. Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia- Pacific Region, asserted at the National Press Club in Washington that President Bill Clinton has to send former President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as an envoy and invite North Korean leader Kim Il-song to the United States in an effort to resolve the North's nuclear issue. "Worries are that the remarks, in the long run, could trigger chaos in our government's policy toward North Korea," Yi, former head of unification policy, noted. Party spokesman Pak Pom-chin saw Kim's comment as nonfulfillment of his promise to stay away from political affairs for good. "Although Chairman Kim referred to an international political issue, his remarks are affecting domestic politics," Pak said. Party chief policy coordinator Pak Nam-chi said it doesn't make sense to send a famous human rights campaigner (Carter) to an inhumane country (North Korea) as an emissary. Another DLP official said he can't but suspect that there is a political purpose behind Kim's proposal for the Clinton-Kim meeting, given that Chairman Kim knows Kim Il-song has "acrophobia." "Chairman Kim should clarify his position on whether he will come back to the center stage of politics or will leave the political community," the official said. The DLP criticism, however, immediately met with a backlash from opposition DP lawmakers, most of whom are followers of Kim, the former presidential candidate of the DP. DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said in a statement that Chairman Kim's remarks on the nuclear issue have drawn favorable responses from international communities as well as from domestic media. "But it is regretful that only the DLP has responded emotionally and overreacted to the comments," Pak said. The spokesman also said unification matters should be handled by the government as the DLP has pointed out, but the government should guarantee free research activities and announcements on the issue by individuals or groups. DP lawmaker Namkung Chin expressed displeasure with what he said was the DLP's sensitive reaction, saying that Chairman Kim made such a proposal with a true desire to serve the people after he inaugurated the foundation for world peace and national unification. The inter-party confrontation was sparked amid subduing tensions after the DLP dismissed the chief party spokesman last week with regard to his criticism of Kim. The former spokesman charged that Kim was behind the political deadlock between the ruling and opposition parties over the controversial Sangmudae political fund scandal, creating an outcry from opposition lawmakers.
