Only one week after the harsh statement by the Albanian Foreign Ministry condemning the murder of a young Albanian by Greek border guards, many Albanian refugees expelled in the last few days tell of inhuman crimes committed against them. After an interruption in the mistreatment and mass expulsions of Albanians, the Greek authorities embarked on a new "cleanup" campaign on 29 March. Most of the 1,600 Albanians returned on that day -- at a time when the average number of returnees amounts to 200 refugees per day -- have testified to the Albanian border authorities that they were tortured and even obscenely baited. The statement by the Human Rights Union deputy in the Albanian parliament on 30 March, protesting against the police who, according to him, prevented the [Greek] minority from celebrating 25 March, the anniversary of the Greek Revolution of 1821, has compounded the most recent Greek-Albanian incident. About 1,000 refugees returned at the Kapshtice border crossing immediately on reaching Albanian soil spoke of previously unheard-of crimes. This contingent had fallen prey to the special police of Kostouri, in whose cells more than 30 refugees were kept for four or five days without food of any kind. The most chilling tales include cases of the rape of Albanian girls by Greek soldiers, even before the eyes of other men who were in detention alongside them. Meanwhile, other victims of this terror confirmed at the border other cases of extreme torture such as the use of electric shocks on their bodies. The contingent returned on 29 March also confirmed to the Albanian authorities that they had left dozens of other mistreated Albanians at Kostouri, one of them in serious condition. The baiting of the Greek soldiers with the words, "Whose is Macedonia?" often involved beatings with rubber truncheons. Drachmas and food were also confiscated, and passports with valid visas for their bearers were also torn up. This raises once again tensions between Albania and Greece at the very time when matters appeared to be reverting to normal. Greece's turn as EU chairman and the recent visit of high-level Greek Foreign Ministry officials to Tirana had given new positive signals not only for interstate relations but also for the delicate problem of Albanian emigrants and the regulation of their status in Greece.
