Iliescu noted that the Greek position on FYROM appears to be correct, adding that his country is not against the existence of FYROM. He said he hopes Greek-FYROM differences will be overcome through a dialogue. Iliescu added that no Balkan country--including Turkey of course--should participate in the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. The Greek prime minister and the Romanian president described bilateral relations as warm and constructive and stressed the two countries' willingness to strengthen relations in the political, economic, and social spheres. Papandreou referred to the ancient ties of friendship that link the two countries and added that Greece will do everything it can to help Romania in approaches to the European Union.
