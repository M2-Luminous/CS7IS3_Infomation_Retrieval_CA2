FBIS4-53044 "dreas095__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-095-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Asahi Glass Develops Product With Foreign Firms Asahi Glass Develops Product With Foreign Firms 942A0203A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Apr 94 p 10--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0203A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Asahi Glass has jointly developed with English and French engineering companies a new method for using reinforced glass in external walls of buildings. Several sheets of two-meter-square plate glass are suspended by wire tied by special fittings that incorporate a bearing mechanism, and a special feature is that it appears to be one sheet of glass since there are no sash frames. It is different from regular plate glass at the company, and they will push sales to design offices via three engineering subsidiaries. Estimates are for sales of 2 billion yen the first year and 10 billion yen after five years. It will be put on sale starting the 11th under the product name of "Ten Point." It was jointly developed with "Ove Arup" of England and "RFR" of France. Special fittings are installed in saucer-shaped holes opened in the four corners of 12-mm thick reinforced glass and the glass is tied together. A bearing mechanism is incorporated in the special fitting, forming a structure that will absorb glass "flexure" generated by wind and earthquakes. The special fittings are tied by stainless wire, which is bundled and fastened to a post. The basic technology was developed by Peter Rice who is the director in charge of technology at Ove, and Asahi Glass introduced the technology four years ago, matching it to Japanese specifications such as no water leakage. It is said that it will not be destroyed even by an earthquake in the class of the Great Kanto Earthquake.
