The United States, pointing out that construction bid rigging symbolizes the closure of the Japanese market, has pressured Japan to change the conventional tender system. On 18 January, the cabinet announced an action program aimed at revamping the current tender system for the public works projects after endorsing it. That day, Obayashi Construction Company, a major general contractor, came under investigation and it can be said that the investigation indicates anew the need to revamp the current tender system for public works projects. The action program, that has been worked out on the basis of Central Construction Deliberation Council recommendations, is a summary of ways for overhauling the current tender system and at the same time, an answer to the United States. The action program's key point is that more than 4.5 million SDR (special drawing rights: approximately 700 million yen) worth of public works projects to be implemented directly by the central government and more than 15 million SDR (approximately 2 billion yen) worth of public works projects to be implemented directly by government-invested organizations, and prefectural and municipal governments will be subject to an open competition tender system. About 20 percent of the public works projects, whose orders are to be placed by the central government, will be open to foreign firms. The action program, that is in tune with international rules, has been accepted by the United States. Although the action program will be applied to large-scale public works projects for the time being, the government has formally announced that it will adopt the open competition tender system next year. The announcement is a step forward. The United States, which has set 20 January as a deadline for slapping sanctions on Japan unless Japan takes satisfactory measures to open its construction market, should now withdraw the planned sanctions against Japan. Needless to say, the action program is no more than a framework to make biddings transparent and open the Japanese construction market. To make the reform effective, it is important for the central and local governments to work to operate the action program fairly and flesh it out. A majority of the public works projects implemented by the central and local governments still remain subject to the conventional designated bid system and it is necessary to take actions to improve the system. There is no need to point out that the construction community should drastically reform their consciousness to rid them of the traditional bid rigging structure. It is also indispensable to carry out political reform and urge bureaucrats to strictly restrain from getting jobs in construction, firms that they oversee. The Fair Trade Commission has the responsibility to rigorously enforce the Antimonopoly Law. We hope that U.S. and other foreign firms will work to gain access to the Japanese construction market by fully using a new tender system. Free competition will serve to hold down the costs of Japan's public works projects that are higher than those in other nations. U.S. firms, which are ahead of other foreign firms in such software as designing and consultants, are interested in gaining access to them. The action program makes it mandatory that the central government and public corporations planning to implement more than 450,000 SDR worth of public works projects, and local governments planning to implement more than 1.5 million SDR worth of public works projects, offer an opening tender for designs and consultants. The number of orders for the designing and consultants will be very limited because in Japan, government offices in charge of placing the orders are staffed with many technocrats who are assigned to design and manage the public works projects. This phenomenon has forced the technocrats to seek free technical know-how from the private sector, thereby paving the way for them to forge a collusive relationship. Now that the private sector has come to have better technology than the government has in many areas, the government should leave the software area to competition among firms. This is compatible with the administrative reform policy and will bring about the effect of adopting state-of-art technology for the public works projects. Construction friction between Japan and the United States will undoubtedly recur unless the Construction Ministry transforms itself from the current business ministry into a policymaking ministry. The ministry should reform its function on its own, not by external pressure.
