They were warmly welcomed by military district leaders Pan Zhaomin and Fu Bingyao as well as the broad masses of officers and men. On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the autonomous regional people's congress Standing Committee, the autonomous regional people's government, the autonomous regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 15.8 million people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, Abulaidi Amudurexiti extended cordial greetings to the headquarters, the Political Department, and Logistics Department of the Xinjiang Military District, as well as to all officers and men of the People's Liberation Army and their families stationed north and south of the Tian Shan and along the border defense front. Abulaidi Amudurexiti stated: Under the guidance of both Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the past year was one in which we comprehensively carried out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. During the year we seized the opportunities to deepen reform; open up wider to the outside world; and bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development as well as overall progress in society. These achievements resulted from the correct guidance provided by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission as well as from the concerted efforts made by people and soldiers of all nationalities who share a common fate. Troops stationed in Xinjiang have participated in and supported local economic construction, contributed to their second home town, and promoted the social stability and prosperity of the autonomous region. People of all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget their contributions. Fu Bingyao, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, said: Over the past year, party committees and people's governments at all levels, as well as people of all nationalities in the autonomous region, have actively supported army building, regarded the military as a great wall and soldiers a part of their family, and tried every possible means to overcome difficulties for army units. Their efforts have played an important role in helping army units and organs victoriously accomplish various missions. In the coming year, army units and organs within this military district will continue to follow the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in order to make efforts in strengthening the army's construction in all fields and its combat readiness so as to provide a powerful security guarantee for Xinjiang's reform, opening up, and modernization. Leading cadres -- including Jin Yunhui, Xie Fuping, Feng Dazhen, and (Simayi Maihesuti) -- participated in this greeting activity.
