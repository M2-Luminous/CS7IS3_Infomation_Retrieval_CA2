FR941205-0-00135 FR941205-0-00027 New Technologies_Comments were received asking the Agency to evaluate and develop methods based on new technologies, such as bioassay, ELISA, and capillary electrophoresis. The Agency continues to incorporate new technologies in methods, and appreciates the many articles that were sent to draw attention to new technologies. In the last twenty years, the Agency has aided the development of the mass spectrometer into a powerful and routine analytical instrument. With suggestions from the laboratory community (56 FR 3550, January 30, 1991), the Agency moved from packed to capillary column gas chromatographic technology, and expects to adopt innovative procedures and instruments in future methods. In the 1993 proposal, EPA invited public suggestions that EPA might consider approving in this rule or in a later rulemaking. This invitation was not meant to imply that new methods or method modifications submitted as suggestions would or could bypass requirements that are specified at 40 CFR 141.27. Some commenters expressed interest in having their method or instrumentation included in EPA-approved methods. EPA suggests that these commenters submit their data to EPA's Alternative Test Procedures (ATP) program for evaluation. A method or instrument can be considered for approval by EPA after it has received a favorable evaluation under the ATP program. A protocol for submitting ATP data is available from EPA (EPA, 1993c). V. Availability and Sources for Methods Information Commenters requested help in obtaining copies of analytical methods cited in drinking water rules. Sources of all approved methods are contained in the References section of this rule. These methods are available for review but not distribution at the EPA Drinking Water Docket (MC 4101), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. For access to the docket material, please call (202) 260&hyph;3027 between 9 am and 3:30 pm, EST, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. EPA only stocks or distributes copies of methods published by EPA. All other methods must be obtained from the publisher. Sources (with addresses) for all approved methods are cited at 40 CFR Parts 141 and 143, and in the References section of today's rule. Most EPA methods and the document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods, may be purchased from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. The toll-free number is: (800) 553&hyph;6847, local: (703) 487&hyph;4650. Refer to the drinking water rules or the References section of this rule to obtain the NTIS order number and purchase information, or contact the Safe Drinking Water hotline. The hotline operates from 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The toll-free number is (800) 426&hyph;4791. EPA Methods 504.1, 508.1 and 525.2 are not published in an NTIS manual. These methods may be obtained directly from EPA, Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH 45268; the phone number is (513) 569&hyph;7586. Since Methods 150.1 (pH), 150.2 (pH) and 245.2 (mercury) are published in ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' (EPA, 1983a), owners of this EPA manual do not need to reorder these methods. EPA believes most laboratories will need only the more recently published or approved methods that are listed in today's rule. These methods (or manuals) are as follows. Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods, October 1994, NTIS PB95&hyph;104766; EPA Method 508.1, ``Determination of Chlorinated Pesticides, Herbicides, and Organohalides in Water Using Liquid-Solid Extraction and Electron Capture Gas Chromatography'', October 1994; EPA Method 100.2, ``Determination of Asbestos Structures over 10 m m in Length in Drinking Water'', June 1994, NTIS PB94&hyph; 201902; ``Methods for the Determination of Metals in Environmental Samples_Supplement I'', May 1994, NTIS PB94&hyph;184942; EPA Method 525.2, ``Determination of Organic Compounds in Drinking Water by Liquid-Solid Extraction in Capillary Column Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry'', March 1994; EPA Method 504.1, ``1,2-Dibromoethane (EDB), 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), and 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (123TCP) in Water by Microextraction and Gas Chromatography'', 1993; ``Methods for the Determination of Inorganic Substances in Environmental Samples'', August 1993, NTIS PB91&hyph;231498; ``Methods for the Determination of Organic Compounds in Drinking Water_Supplement II,'' August 1992, NTIS PB92&hyph; 207703; Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 18th Edition Supplement, 1994; Colisure, Millipore Corp., 1994; and GLI Method 2, ``Turbidity'', Great Lakes Instruments, Inc., November 2, 1992. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) annually reprints all of the methods contained in the Annual Book of ASTM Methods , even methods that have not been editorially or technically revised. Thus, it is permissible to use any edition that contains the EPA-approved version of the compliance method. EPA notes that Orion Method 601 ``Standard Method of Test for Nitrate in Drinking Water'', which is equivalent to SM 4500&hyph;NO 3 ^D (APHA, 1992), is identical to Orion Method WeWWG/5880. Method WeWWG/5880 is approved for nitrate analysis. ATI Orion republished the method in 1994 and renumbered it as 601, because the 1985 manual ``Orion Guide to Water and Wastewater Analysis'', which contained WeWWG/5880, is no longer available. In today's rule EPA cites WeWWG/5880 as 601 at 40 CFR 141.23(k)(1). VI. Regulation Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
