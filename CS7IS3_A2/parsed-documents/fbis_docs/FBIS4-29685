For example, there have been new moves for holding a South-North summit. In this connection, the government has indicated that it "welcomes" as stated by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa such developments. Considering that future developments are still unpredictable, however, the government plans to keep a wary eye on new developments, such as how North Korea may respond to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) call for inspections of its nuclear facilities. At the same time, the government plans to maintain closer ties with the United States and the ROK. The ROK and the DPRK have reached an agreement on holding a South-North summit, with ROK President Kim Yong-sam accepting DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for holding a summit meeting. Regarding this summit, a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "That is excellent. Originally, President Kim Yong-sam had called for such a summit ever since his inauguration, but it never came about because North Korea kept insisting on holding talks with the United States only." This is how MOFA views the situation. Regarding the flexible stance the DPRK is now showing, MOFA has analyzed that with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter acting practically as a special envoy in a series of high-level talks with President Kim Il-song, "North Korea's dignity has been preserved," (according to a government source). The government believes that should a South-North summit meeting be held, the ROK Government is expected to press North Korea to live up to the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which came into effect in February 1992 when the two countries were pursuing a policy of mutual harmony. Talks are also expected to be held regarding wiping out mutual distrust. In some quarters of the Japanese Government, however, there are deep-rooted feelings of distrust toward North Korea since the latter has been noted to shift between hardline and flexible stances in the past. Therefore, some government officials are not necessarily optimistic about future developments. Rather, they plan to remain calm and keep a wary eye on how the situation may develop. The government places particular emphasis on the outcome of working-level meetings to be held as early as 20 June for working out details in preparation for the third round of the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. This is because the government expects that aside from negotiations conducted by Carter at the private level, there will be a considerable exchange of opinions on such issues as nuclear inspections at the government level. Moreover, the government is concerned about views that the United States may decide not to pursue questioning North Korea on its suspected nuclear developments in the past. A top government official has said: "The U.S. Government has explained to us that it does not intend to drop past issues at all." Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada has said: "Past issues cannot be dropped." The government thus plans to confirm U.S. intentions during talks with the U.S. Government.
