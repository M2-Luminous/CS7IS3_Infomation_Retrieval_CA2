But as soon as the Surrey lorry driver pulled out of the factory gates near Malaga, Spanish police officers descended on him. They asked him to open the container he had just picked up, pounced on the concrete bollards and started to break them up with crowbars and pickaxes. Inside they found two and a half tons of cannabis--with a street value of Â£7 million. Roy Clarke was arrested for smuggling Spain's biggest ever haul of drugs. He has now been in Malaga prison for nearly four months awaiting trial. But he says he is innocent, arguing that he knows nothing about the contents of the bollards. His British employers say they received instructions for this job from a third party, who has disappeared. Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer with Fair Trials Abroad says: "There is no way Roy Clarke could be guilty. It would be impossible for him to see the drugs; and he was clearly not involved in the planning because he didn't know he was going to take this load until the day he picked it up. The faxes confirmed that. But the police wanted an arrest. This is a typical case of a lorry driver who never had a chance." Roy Clarke is not the only one. The Foreign Office knows of nine cases of lorry drivers charged with smuggling drugs. David Higginbottom, general secretary of the United Road Transport Union says: "We're only now seeing the tip of the iceberg. It's a big problem now and it's set to get bigger. Drivers are being treated as scapegoats. John Barber, a driver from Wales, was stopped on the Franco-Spanish border on September 30 last year. His load of tangerines, heading for Britain, was found to contain 240 kilos of cannabis resin. Although he said it was nothing to do with him and he had not been present when the load was packed, he was arrested and put into Bayonne prison for three months. He was eventually freed on a technicality, but French customs have impounded his truck and, unable to make a living, he has been declared bankrupt and is about to lose his house. His MP [expansion not given] Cynog Dafis campaigned for his release because, he says: "I've known John Barber for a long time. He's transparently honest." Roy Clarke's MP, Sir Archibald Hamilton, who has written to the Spanish Justice Minister about his case, points out that the real villains are elsewhere. "Clearly the people who are much more guilty are those who loaded the pipes on to the lorry. The driver is the easiest person to get hold of, but this is an incomplete way to smash up the drugs ring." Drivers say they cannot be held responsible for their loads because they cannot be certain what they contain. "Our job is to get the stuff from A to B," says Stephen Murray, who has been driving trucks around Europe for six years. "It's impossible to check what's in the container--they're either sealed or packed so tightly that you can't see in." David Higginbottom of the URTU [expansion not given] says: "Drivers are like postmen. Nobody would ever dream of arresting a postman who delivered a package containing drugs. A driver has no more idea what's inside his truck than a postman has what's inside a letter." Since European integration made movement around the Continent free and easy, police and customs officials have become increasingly concerned about the traffic of drugs by road. National forces have co-operated more closely to clamp down on it. The crackdown has led to more arrests and the number of Britons being held on drugs charges in the rest of the Continent jumped from 604 in 1992-93 to 753 in 1993-94. But the problem, according to campaigners, is that the police are not just being conscientious, they are being over-zealous. "I'm perfectly aware that in nine out of 10 cases the people are guilty," says Mr Jakobi of Fair Trials Abroad. "But I'm becoming increasingly aware of cases where they're not." Lorry drivers are not the only victims of the crackdown. Car passengers have been made to answer for the contents of a car they do not own. Stephen Jakobi has 11 such cases in France alone. Raymond Bickley, 50, a travel agent from Brighton, was released on bail last week after 18 months in jail. He was travelling as a passenger on his way back from a business trip to Torremolinos in Spain when customs officers in St Malo found 45 kilos of cannabis in the car. "I was guilty only of being naive," he says. Janet Johnston, director of the charity Prisoners Abroad, says: "Hardened drug smugglers are out to sell a product. They're always looking for new ways to get through and they don't care who gets into trouble so long as it's not them. At the same time, the police are really sharpening up." The problem seems set to increase. "Drugs are emotive," says Stephen Jakobi. "But if you're wrongly accused, it doesn't matter what you're innocent of--what's important is that you're not guilty."
