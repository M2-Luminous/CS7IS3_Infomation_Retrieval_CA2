"We are preparing an operation that will surprise the world," al-Hajj Hasan Huballah told AFP. Israel devastated a Hizballah training base in the Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley of eastern Lebanon on June 2, killing 32 trainees and prompting retaliatory rocket attacks. Huballah said the Katyusha rockets, which fell harmlessly on northern Israel, were not a riposte. He expected further Israeli military operations and "assassinations" of Hizballah leaders as part of a US campaign to crush opposition to Arab-Israeli peace talks. "We're passing through a very dangerous phase. "There is an American plot aimed at liquidating all those who oppose the Middle East peace process and Israel has been charged with carrying it out," Huballah said. But Hizballah leaders had taken strict measures to preempt any attack. "Senior leaders have moved out of their homes, changed cars and their daily routine," he said. The air raid came less than two weeks after Israeli airborne commandos kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, a Muslim guerrilla chief with close links to Hizballah, from his home in the al-Biqa'. Israel hopes al-Dirani will supply key information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986. Lebanon branded the abduction and the air raid acts of piracy and protested to the United Nations. It also vowed not to disarm Hizballah until Israel dismantled its self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon. The Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH, quoting Lebanese officials, reported Saturday that the United States submitted an Israeli warning to the Lebanese authorities. Israel would attack Lebanon if Hizballah carried out its threat to launch suicide-operations against Israeli interests around the world, according to the report.
