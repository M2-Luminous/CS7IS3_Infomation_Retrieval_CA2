The company was founded about 30 years ago in South America and imports chemicals for the paint and pharmaceutical industries, among others. According to the chief of the Colombian National Police, General Octavio Vargas Silva, many of what Holanda Colombia considers to be legal customers are essentially dummy companies which exist merely to lend illegal transactions a legal appearance on paper. The Colombian police have had their suspicions about Holanda Colombia's services for several years. Five years ago, General Miguel Antonio Padilla, who was chief of police at the time, said on Netherlands television that the Netherlands chemical industry was one of the main suppliers to the cocaine barons. The evidence lies in the packaging, the barrels, and the route followed, said General Padilla at the time. He did not wish to name names because the inquiry had still not been concluded. Concrete steps against the Netherlands-Colombian company were taken on 10 March this year, when operation "Volatile" was launched (the name was chosen because of the volatile substances in question). The National Council for Narcotic Drugs, which has to give its approval to companies trading in substances that can be of use to drug dealers, withdrew the licence it had issued to Holanda Colombia. The police then raided the company's eight plants spread throughout the country. In Mosquera, Medellin, Baranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Cartagena, and Ibaque a total of 1,753 tonnes of chemicals were confiscated. The excuse for this was the fact that the company had made a delivery to another company that supposedly lacked the required authorization. In a second incident, a quantity of methyl ethyl ketone [MEK] was supposedly ordered by one company and paid for by another. In the meantime, claims company spokesman Takkenberg, both incidents have been cleared up. "The authorization had indeed been withdrawn from the first company. But when we made the delivery in February the authorization was still valid. In the second case, both companies did indeed possess the required papers." At a press conference the day after the operation, General Octavio Vargas Silva announced that the Colombian police had "dealt a serious blow" to this sector of the drug trade. The police report specified the haul in kg. The list ranges from ether and sodium to thinner and toluene. The semifinished product coca paste, made of leaves of the coca plant, and refined cocaine can be produced using various chemicals. MEK is the big favorite of the drug dealers. According to an investigation carried out by the DEA, the American anti-drug department, 90 percent of the cocaine encountered in the United States contains this substance. Holanda Colombia's warehouses contained 941,704 kilos of MEK. However, according to H. Bolhuis, the Netherlands director of industrial development at Holanda Colombia, the fact that the police throw several chemicals together shows that they are ill-informed. The trained chemist points out that the list even included hydrochloric acid, as if the drug trade was interested in that. Bolhuis works at a small, but modern factory in Mosquera, a town where the industrial belt begins behind the colonial square. With its concrete and angular glass dome, the factory is of a design that one might formerly have expected more in the Hoofddorp business park than on a sandy path in the Colombian savannah. The chemist fervently hopes that the entire affair can be dealt with quickly and "amicably." The fact that the public prosecutor has not yet charged the company and its staff members after a period of three months, strengthens his conviction in this respect. In Colombia, the prosecutor has 180 days to make a decision as to whether to proceed with a legal investigation. The company has protested to the judge at the withdrawal of its authorization to deal in strategic substances. The British director of Holanda Colombia, G. Bromich, adds that 90 percent of the Colombian chemical industry is being supplied by his company. The chemical substance MEK accounts for a maximum of 4 percent of the company's sales, and is, he claimed, also sold by major companies such as Exxon and Shell. According to Bromich, the company is probably the leading seller of filled barrels in Colombia, which is supposedly why so many of the company's barrels had been found in cocaine laboratories. The police file on Holanda Colombia contains a pile of color photographs including data and place names that provide convincing proof of this. The pictures are barely distinguishable. A luxurious green forest, a cane shelter, and underneath it row upon row of green barrels bearing the initials HC--Holanda Colombia--in white. The pictures show improvised small-scale cocaine factories that were closed down by the army or the police during the past years. Nine times out of 10, Holanda Colombia barrels were found there, sometimes brand new ones. The barrels could be stolen, or the chemicals transferred to the barrels, concede the Colombian experts involved in the anti-drugs war in Bogota. However, they claim that this is just one theory, and that "100,000 liters is too large a quantity to be explained away like that."
