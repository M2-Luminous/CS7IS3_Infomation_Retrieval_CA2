The message says the South Korean puppet authorities are hell bent on the deceptive propaganda to bring over fellow countrymen in Sakhalin, acting in the guise of "humanitarianism", in an insidious attempt to lay an anti-DPRK "foundation" in the Far Eastern region by winning them over and foment discord and consciousness of confrontation within the nation and thereby perpetuate division of the country and block the compatriots from advancing toward national reunification. The South Korean authorities must renounce at once their anti- national, anti-reunification scheme to settle the issue of Korean residents in Sakhalin and other regions of the former Soviet Union with some money through conspiracy and tieup with the Japanese Government, and the Japanese authorities must no longer do acts obstructive to an independent reunification of Korea, it demands.
