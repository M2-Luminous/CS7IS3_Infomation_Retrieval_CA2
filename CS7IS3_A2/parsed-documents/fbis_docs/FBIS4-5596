FBIS4-5596 "dreas070_d_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 South Korea President Consolidates Authority Over Military President Consolidates Authority Over Military 942C0046A Seoul SIN TONG-A in Korean Dec 93 pp 224-237 942C0046A Seoul SIN TONG-A Korean CSO [Text] At the video rental in the basement store of the public service center of the National Defense Ministry, Yongsan-ku, Seoul, the most popular videotape lately is "A Few Good Men." The title of the tape, they say, was derived from the advertising tagline to recruit Marines in the United States. Though three copies of the tape were imported last August, it is so popular among the soldiers serving at the National Defense Ministry that no one can borrow it without making a reservation. The significance of the tape is that young officers attack the faults committed by a commander stubbornly loyal to his fatherland. It may perhaps be natural that such a story interests the officers of this country. Since the new government, the Korean military is realizing more changes and reforms than any other group. The military which endures the intense criticism of the people due to the dishonorable work done by some of their predecessors under presidents of the military cliques over the last thirty years, bears a burden to change into a military which will receive the people's love and confidence. In these days of reform, what position is the military taking? In the nine months of Kim Yong-sam government, how much reform of the military has been carried out and which way is it going? Is it really succeeding? It is no exaggeration to say that the aim of the military reform by the new goverment is to remove the Hanahoe. Last 8 March, President Kim Yong-sam suddenly dismissed Kim Chin-yong, the Army Chief of the General Staff, and So Won-su, the Defense Security Commander. Last 18 October, he conducted the promotions of army corps and division commanders and of rear admiral and major general classes of the Navy and Air Force, as well as personnel changes of key positions in the National Defense Ministry. With this, his military reshuffle was finished. In addition, President Kim carried out a second military reshuffle including the dismissal of Kim To-yun, the Defense Security Commander, and about 30 executive officers of brigadier general, colonel and lieutenant colonel classes, thus establishing a royal governing structure both in name and reality. With this, the military clique, which had lasted for thirteen years from the beginning of the 1980 Fifth Republic through the Sixth Republic, collapsed and a new military clique was formed. Of the three- and four-star generals of the entire army, only five including General Kim Chae-chang (18th term graduate of the Military Academy; only the number of the term will be written hereinafter), Deputy Commander of the Combined Forces and Vice-Admiral Yim Chung-rin (16th term graduate of the Naval Academy) the Marine Corps Commandant, etc., were promoted by the former President No Tae-u at the end of last year. The rest of the generals were all promoted by President Kim with the regular personnel changes this fall. But all generals of Hanahoe, except for one, could not be promoted. According to the Army authority, Hanahoe's members number about 120 and are 20th- to 36th-term graduates of the Military Academy. The only general still in active service and who is prior to the 20th term graduates is Kim Chae-chang. From a list of generals published confidentially by the National Defense Ministry at the beginning of every year, the following members of Hanahoe were expunged for various reasons and registered on the list of veterans: Kim Chin-yong (Military Academy), Cho Nam-pung (18th term), Ku Chang-hoe (ex-Third Army Commander), So Wan-su (19th term, ex-Defense Security Commander), An Byong-ho (20th term, ex-Army Capital Garrison Commander), Yi Chung-sok (21st term, ex-Operation Department Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), So Chung-il (23d term, ex-21st Division Commander), etc. Keeping Hanahoe at a distance was already somewhat expected when major class officers were promoted last August. At that time, twelve members of the Aljahoe who are 41st term graduates of the Military Academy were not even registered on the list of those eligible for promotion. So when lieutenant colonel and colonel class officers were promoted, 37th-term graduates of Aljahoe and 32d-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded. Even when 43 officers were promoted to brigadier general, eight 27th-term and three 26th-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded. These are not all of Hanahoe's problems. Immediately after that, though four lieutenant generals (corps commanders) and 16 major generals (11 division commanders and 5 others) were promoted, none from Hanahoe could be promoted. In the personnel changes of generals, members of Hanahoe had to leave even their leisurely posts, not to mention the important posts. Nine lieutenants and major generals of Hanahoe were ordered to leave their posts and await discharge or were not assigned to any posts. Three generals, Lieutenant General Kim Chung-hon (18th term) director of the Military Academy, Major General An Kwang-yol (20th term) director of the Installation Bureau of the National Defense Ministry, and Major General Choe Ki-hong (22d term) policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry were ordered to leave their posts and wait for further action at the Headquarters of the Army. Lieutenant General Yi Taek-hyong (19th term) Strategy Planning Department chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Kim Sang-chun, Operation Department chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have also informally decided to leave their posts and wait for further action at the Headquarters of the Army. Lieutenant General Kim Chung-bae (20th term) Third Corps commander, Song Tok-son, 11th Corps commander, Major General Choe Seung-woo (21st term) chief of staff of the Education Headquarters, and Major General Yo Myong-hyon (21st term) chief of staff of the Second Army, four in all, were appointed to Policy Committees of the Army Headquarters. The posts of Policy Committees are leisurely ones that are given to officers expected to be discharged. Members of Hanahoe who took charge of main army divisions near the capital, including Major General Chong Chong-taek (23d term) Capital Mechanized Division commander, Son Su-tae, 30th Division commander, and Pak Yong-il, Third Division commander, were also transferred to less important posts of vice-corps commander seven months before the end of their two-year terms. Now no one of Hanahoe has an important post in the Army. The chief secretary of the Army Chief of Staff, 30th and 33d Brigade commanders of the Capital Garrison Command, the Personnel Staff of the Army Headquarters, the key posts of the ranger-commando force and the Defense Security Command are filled with officers other than members of Hanahoe or graduates of the Military Academy. Last 3 November for the first time after President Kim took office, Kim Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff, had an exclusive talk with the president where it is said that he was given directions to "from next year, select and assign members of Hanahoe." But many people say that members of Hanahoe have suffered such unfavorable treatment that they could not make a comeback. Various kinds of reactions came out from people inside and outside of the Army on the perfect purge of Hanahoe. General A: "Hanahoe was a curse on our Army. For the unity and harmony of the Army, even its roots must be eradicated. You must bear in mind that members of Hanahoe survived the the Yun Pil-yong event carried out in the 12 December coup and the 17 May Kwangju event." Colonel B: "I recognize the abuse of Hanahoe. But it is also wrong that even colonels and lieutenant colonels of the club are excluded in promotions, solely on the basis of being registered on the membership list of Hanahoe. After the 13 April 1987 Constitution protection measure, as instructed by Ko Myong-sung, the then Defense Security commander, many majors and lieutenant colonels became members of Hanahoe to protect the regime, regardless of their own will, didn't they?" Lieutentant C: "I will, as a member of Hanahoe, willingly submit to such unfavorable treatment. It is, though, too unreasonable that only because seniors, juniors, and companions of mine are on good terms with Hanahoe members, they are looked upon coldly and treated unfavorably." Reserve General D: "If the goverment wants to purge Hanahoe members, it should discharge them all at once from service or leave them alone. If it transfers them to leisurely posts a few months after it had assigned them to key posts, it will merely cause the Army to agitate. If the current of the times is like this, it should treat all members by the same standard and free them from dissatisfaction and uneasiness." Who will be the new influential group to take over the posts of Hanahoe? Although the influential group to replace Hanahoe, which held the Army for ten years, hasn't formed yet, it is clear that one is rapidly forming. In the process of forming a new military clique under the new government, another significant factor is the rapid collapse of the TK [Taegu North Kyongsang Province] group. Although five member of the TK group were promoted to brigadier generals this year as last year, not one of the group was included in the promotion of 16 major generals including 11 division commanders. The four generals promoted to corps commanders were all non-TK group -- three from Seoul and one from South Kyongsang Province. After the new government began, the TK group collapsed. Instead officers from Pusan and South Kyongsang Province (PK), the areas producing the most members of the influential group, rose remarkably to the surface. Of the promoted brigadier generals, 14 are from PK -- 12 from South Kyongsang Province and two from Pusan -- four more than last year. Of the promoted lieutenant generals, Yi Yu-so (20th term) 7th Corps commander is from Kyongnam High School of Pusan. Of the promoted major generals, Kim Pan-kyu (24th term) 55th Division Commander and Cho Yong-rae (177th-term graduate of the military officer training center) Third Division commander, are from South Kyongsang Province. Kim Hui-sang (24th term) newly appointed Capital Mechanized Division commander is from Kojang, South Kyongsang Province, the same place as Chong Chung-wuk, Secretary of Diplomacy and Security of the Blue House. Rear Admiral Chun To-bong (35th-term graduate of the Naval Officer Training Center) deputy chief of Personnel Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Admiral Kim Mu-Ung (21st-term graduate of the Naval Academy) are also from PK. Because Major General Kim Pan-kyu and Brigadier General Sin Hye-kwon are from Koje Island, the native place of President Kim, they attract more public attention. Moreover, it is believed that because Major General Kim was President Kim's junior in Kyongnam High School and Brigadier General Sin was the Operations Staff of Corps exercising the jurisdiction over Koje Island, this would have favorably affected their promotions. The fact that PK has not only risen significantly in numbers but also holds important posts has attracted public attention. Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun (3d-term ROTC graduate, the promotion to a major general is expected next 1 January), unexpectedly appointed to the post of Defense Security Command last 21 October, is from Hamyang, South Kyongsang Province, and ex-Sixth Division Commander Han Sung-ui (22d term) recently appointed to the post of policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry, who graduated from Pusan High School, is from Sanjong, South Kyongsang Province. Another distinctive feature of the last personnel changes is that large numbers of graduates of Kyongbok High School of Seoul are taking posts in the Army and the new government. As the graduates of the Kyongbok High School including Kim Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff went up into higher classes, the Blue House and those close to the President might have exercised their influence over the promotions. Persons well informed of the military believe Mr. K., a younger person graduated from Kyongbok High School, who is known to serve near the president and has an important effect upon the personnel changes in the government, and Minister K, etc., would have exercised directly or indirectly their influence over the last military personnel changes. Of the Kyongbok High School graduates, there are Kim Hoe-sang, ex-national defense secretary of the Blue House and Hong Sun-ho (4th-term ROTC graduate, ex-chief of planning security of the Army Headquarters) Fifth-Division commander and President Kim's junior in the philosophy department of Seoul University. Chang Chong-kil (21st-term graduate of the Naval Academy) ex-Fifth Battle Corps commander of the Navy, and Choe Yong-hwan (15th-term graduate of the Air Force Academy) Tenth Battle Flying Corps commander of the Air Force are also graduates of the same school. It is said that Minister K, an influential person in the government, widely associates with all sorts and classes of people and also has a wide acquaintance in the military from which to collect information. It is said that he put forth his opinion on the military personnel changes to President Kim. Considering these facts, the current influential persons in Korea's new military world are mainly from Pusan and South Kyongsang Province regions and graduates of Kyongbok High School. A remarkable point is that not as many graduates of Kyongnam High School, President Kim's old school, have been appointed to important posts as other school graduates. It is known that of the Kyongnam High School graduates, there is actually no general higher than three stars in active service. Although General Ku Chang-hoe, the Third Army Commander, was in active service up until the beginning of this year, he was discharged from service last April. Brigadier General Yi Hyang-su (21st term, Intelligence School Director) and Brigadier General Kim Sang-yol (discharge expected next January) are in active service, but both were excluded in the promotion to major generals. Besides Major General Chon Sang-bae (22d term, chief of Intelligence Staff of the Army Headquarters), Major General An Song-yong (23d term, 17th Division commander), Major General Kim Pan-kyu (24th term) who was appointed to the post of division commander recently, Brigadier General Pak No-sok (24th term) chief secretary of the Army Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier General Pak Man-taek (26th term) are all graduates of Kyongnam High School. None of the Kyongnam High School graduates of the 25th through 27th terms of the Military Academy are in active service. In the Marine Corps, there is Rear Admiral Chon To-bong. A field grade officer, a graduate of Kyongnam High School, said, "This is the case because Kyongnam High School graduates mainly entered the medical and business worlds, while many Pusan High School graduates launched into the bureaucratic world. Even if Kyongnam High School graduates did join the military world, they could not keep company with President Kim because of his long time association with the opposition party." On the other hand, Pusan and Kyongbuk High Schools produced large numbers of influential persons during the Fifth and Sixth Republics. They include General Un Yong-nam, Third Army commander, Major General Han Sung-ui (22d term) newly appointed policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry, and Major General Yi Ui-se (22d term) national defense secretary of the National Security Planning Agency in the important posts. Since the new government was established, the power of Kyongbuk High School graduates is diminishing. So Wan-su, defense security commander, was already ruined. Major General Choe Ki-hong (22d term) was ordered to leave his post and wait for further action at Army Headquarters. Major Sin Chong (20th term) is in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Major General Ku Tae-to (21st term) and Brigadier General Choe Tong-Chin (25th term, aide of the Minister) are in the National Defense Ministry. Brigadier General Chong Su-song (202d-term graduate of the Military Officer Training Center) is in the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters. These are all low-profile posts. The Seoul High School graduates who once built up a large area of influence in the military also seem to have decreased in numbers as compared with the past. Lieutenant General Kim Chok (21st term) chief of the Operations Department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was appointed to the First Corps Commander this time, and Lieutenant General Kim Sang-chun (19th term) are both graduates of Seoul High School. Besides them, Yi Yon-rin, Chief of Planning and Management Office, and Yi Chung-hyong, first assistant minister, who hold the important posts in the National Defense Ministry as reserve officers, are also Seoul High School graduates. On the other hand, graduates of Kyonggi High School are advancing by leaps and bounds. Among them are: To Il-kyu, Army Capital garrison commander, Yi Ho-sung, chief of planning staff of the Army Headquarters, Pak Yong-ok (21st term) expected military attache to the Korean Embassy in the United States, and Yi Sang-hui (26th term) who was promoted to a brigadier general this time and is serving in the Defense Secretary's office of the Blue House. And there are many graduates of Songdong High School of Seoul who hold important posts. They are Yi Chong-nam (21st term) defense secretary of the Blue House, and Yi Sok-bok (21st term) deputy chief of staff of the Combined Forces, and Lieutenant General Yi Kyu-hwan who was appointed to the post of Third Corps commander. Of the graduates of Chaeil High School of Kwangju, there are Lieutenant General Kim Tong-sin, Captial Corps commander, Major General An Taek-sun in the Air Force, and Yi So-yong (20th term graduate of the Naval Academy) the First Fleet commander. Colonels Kim Chang-su and Kwon An-to were promoted to brigadier generals most recently, attracting public attention. In the past, the influential military men held important posts in three commands: the Capital Garrison Command, the Defense Security Command, and Ranger Command. But after the civil government began, posts affecting politics tend to be regarded with great importance. With the conception of important posts changing, the military men being trusted by the ministers or the Blue House are holding such posts. The chief of the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters who in the past exercised his enormous influence over personnel changes is also now less popular, military men estimate. Some say that receiving enormous bribes in connection with military construction while in office as Seventh Division Commander, Yim Chong-sop's (22d term, chief of personnel staff) actions contributed to the decline in the post's popularity. Accordingly, the important posts in the military are said to be the Policy Office chief and policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministy, the national defense secretary of the Blue House and minister aides, etc. In less than one year after being transferred to the post of First Corps commander after serving as policy planning officer, General Cho Song-tae (20th term) returned to the post of Policy Office Chief of the National Defense Ministry. Graduated from Taejon Middle School and the high school attached to the Education College of Seoul, he had been selected by Yi Chong-ku, national defense minister to be policy planning officer. He is said to have carried out his duties so well as to please the then Vice-Minister Kwon Yong-hae. As Major General Choe Ki-hong had been dismissed from the post of policy planning officer by reason of his membership in Hanahoe, his classmate Han Sung-ui, Sixth Division commander, was appointed to the post. Han Sung-ui who is from Sanchong, South Kyongsang Province, and graduated from Pusan High School, served as a professor of English at the Military Academy and had been with the Combined Forces Command. It is the selection of Yi Chong-nam, the national defense secretary of the Blue House, that attracted the public eye more than any other personnel changes at this time. As an artillery man, Major General Yi Chong-nam did not distinguish himself and was passed up twice for promotion to brigadier general. After he served as an evaluation and management officer and operations coordination officer of the National Defense Ministry, he was promoted to a major general last year and was appointed to the post of the national defense secretary of the Blue House this time. In the middle of the 1970's when Chong Sung-hwa, ex-Army chief of the General Staff, served as a Third Corps commander and president of the Military Academy, Major General Yi served as his chief secretary. A person in the political circles who is known to advise the president about military affairs since President Kim took office said, "President Kim sometimes says he owes General Chong Sung-hwa a great debt of gratitude. It is because General Chong made speeches of support for him during the 1987 presidential election campaign. Selecting Major General Yi could be said to be President Kim's way of repaying General Chong for his kindness." Besides this reason, it was also a consideration that Major General Yi is the most informed about the Yulgok Program which amounts to about 30 percent of the entire national defense budget. In the past, the presidential security service chief discharged from military service generally advised the president about military affairs. But as the national defense secretary takes charge of such duties, this position might have been raised from a brigadier general to a major general rank in order to expand his range of authority. The duties of the minister's aide are to assist the minister from 8 AM when the minister shows up at the office to 6 or 7 PM. The aide, who leads about 20 staff members including colonel-class officers in charge of administration, protocol and overseas, etc., must assist in even the slightest movement by the national defense minister, by being in touch at all times with the Blue House and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. There are even times when he should write a letter of resignation for the minister and then entreat him to withdraw the resignation. The aide should be able to handle such difficult problems well. Therefore, he, more than anyone, has to be in harmony with the minister. Choe Tong-chin (25th term, brigadier general) a newly appointed aide is said to have conducted these duties well while in the office of the chief of staff of the Army Capital Garrison Command. It appears that coming from the same hometown (Kyongju) as the minister has allowed him to enjoy his confidence. Interference in the military personnel changes by the Blue House is no less than it has been in the past, according to persons well informed with the military. It is said that the Blue House gathers information about high-ranking generals through another channel, a search the Defense Security Command did in the past. Through the channel, which field-grade officers as well as generals use, various opinions on military affairs are transmitted to the Blue House, a source said. It is said that Mr. P., an influential person of the Blue House, plays an important role in military affairs. Because his duties are to run errands for President Kim, his role could be said to be a natural one. But when Kim To-yun, ex-commander of the Defense Security, who was appointed by President Kim, was suddenly replaced by Yim Chae-mun, chief of staff of the Defense Security Command, last 21 October, Mr. P. is said to have played a major role. Because at the time the government only said that "(Kim, ex-commander of the Defense Security) resigned for personal reasons" regarding his replacement as the commander of the Defense Security, the real reasons were not known until now. But, informed persons say, it is certain that Mr. P. interfered in these affairs. While the Blue House prohibits any exclusive talks between the president and the commander of the Defense Security since the new government began, it has obtained information on the military's thoughts (especially those of Hanahoe) through the national defense minister and separately through the managing staffs of the Defense Security Command, they say. It is because information obtained through official channels was in many cases different from that obtained through unofficial lines, especially, of the Hanahoe's thoughts which the Blue House has given deep thought to, information obtained through official channels tend to have less value. Accordingly, Mr. P. and Mr. H., another influential person in the Blue House, found the situation to be unusual and made a recommendation to the president to replace the defense security commander. "It is well known that since President Kim was in opposition, he surely has operated multiple information channels. This is for keeping `checks and balances'. Although the president initially trusted in the information from official channels as much as can be, he realized it often differed from information from unofficial lines. Thus he decided to change the official channel. Because he could not change the minister who was in charge of the official channel, he eventually had no choice but to dismiss the defense security commander who was a faithful staff officer to Minister Kwon," said a person well informed on the military and the Blue House. "By changing the defense security commander, the president intended not only to secure the support of the government by the Army but to check the arbitrary actions of ministers and the chiefs of the general staff of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and anyone else," he added. It is known to have been Mr. P. who, in compliance with the president's intention, looked for a successor to the post of defense security commander. Although Mr. P. called Major General K. (serving at the National Defense Ministry) and Major General L. (serving at the Army Headquarters), both of whom are 22d-term graduates of the Military Academy and classmates of Commander Kim, to the Blue House and asked them to take the post, they both reportedly declined the offer. Eventually Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun, chief of the staff of the Defense Security Command, was selected. The ex-Commander Kim did not know he was being replaced even two days before. On 19 October, when the ex-commander stopped in at the U.S. Army heliport at Yongsan on his way to the main operations meeting at Kyeryongdae, he was said to have been comforted by some colleague generals for his not being promoted to a major general in the previous day's promotion changes. That is, needless to say, because of the silence kept by the Blue House which is well known for President Kim's ability to guard secrets better than the military. The next day after Yim, the newly appointed commander of the defense security, who is the 3d-term graduate of the ROTC and is keen and punctual like his nickname of `German soldier', took office, he visited President Kim with Mr. Pak Kwan-yong, chief secretary of the Blue House also attending. At that time, the commander was said to have been instructed by President Kim to keep special watch on unusual movements of Hanahoe members and of graduates of the Military Academy and report to the Blue House of any unusual occurrences. This meant the system of the defense security commander's direct report to the president was renewed. Therefore, Yim's authority seems to have been expanded beyond that of ex-Commander Kim. The system of direct reports to the president even on the problems of the national defense minister who is second to the president on military affairs, was established, related persons analyzed. As if he put such instructions into practice, five days after taking office, he conducted personnel changes in the command, relieving many Military Academy graduates of their posts. Transferred to the Defense Security Command in 1967 as a first lieutenant, Commander Yim is a competent intelligence officer who has mainly served at the Second (intelligence section, abolished in the last March reorganization) and Third (anti-Communist section) Sections. Under the Fifth Republic, he deeply intervened in campus activities and made perfectly logical statements even at the countermeasure meetings of the related organizations. This style of his came in sight even in his first personnel changes. He appointed officers other than the Military Academy graduates to all of the important posts in the command -- Brigadier General Song Tae-song (17th-term graduate of the Air Force Academy, ex-section chief of the Defense Security Command) to the post of chief of staff, Colonel Pak Hyo-chun (military officer training center graduate, ex-Masan Detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security Command) to the post of first section chief (in charge of security) and Colonel Cho Chong-ho (4th-term graduate of the ROTC, ex-Materials and Data Management Office chief) to the post of the 100th Detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security in the National Defense Ministry. On the other hand, he ordered two generals, Brigadier General Choe Chae-rim (23d-term graduate) ex-detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security in the National Defense Ministry and Brigadier General Song Hwa-yong (24th-term graduate) ex-detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security in the Army Headquarters, three colonels graduated from the Military Academy including No Tok-ho (31st-term graduate, ex-detachment deputy commanding officer of the Defense Security in the Army Headquarters), and four senior colonels including Kim Hyon (military officer training center graduate), to return to Army Headquarters. These are not all of the structure reductions of the Defense Security Command. The Defense Security Command which made a large-scale reform from the end of last March to the beginning of April is undergoing a second reform under Commander Yim's leadership. At the beginning of November, the commander discharged from service or returned to their original units several lieutenant colonels who had served in the command or other detachments across the country. The same measures are expected to be taken soon with officers below major in rank. This year the command cut 703 persons from its establishment, down from 6,047 to 5,324. The command first planned to gradually reduce approximately 400 more personnel by 1997, but the reduction was carried out far sooner than expected. After the new government began, the command dissolved 61 small forces of the defense secretary which had been secretly run and annexed them into their higher units. And it abolished the intelligence section which was denounced for illegal intervention in politics and inspections of civilians, and instead established a new Materials and Data Management Office, reorganized and reduced the structure from four sections and three offices to three sections and four offices. The 1994 command's budget was cut 14.4 percent from this year's, from 37.5 billion to 32.1 billion won. A budget area especially hard hit was the reduction of 1.8 billion won for intelligence activities. This fact leads us to believe that the operation of the command is being reduced. As to the role and status of the Defense Security Command which had been the most powerful organization in the military during the Fifth and Sixth Republics, differences of opinions are likely. After Commander Yim Chae-mun's structure began, the commanding officers of the command enjoyed the confidence of the Blue House, but the general personnel are more demoralized than ever. Driving out the Military Academy graduates in the command seems to be a primary factor contributing to rising complications between the Military Academy graduates and other officers. A defense security officer graduated from the Military Academy spoke frankly, "Officers in the command can be promoted only if they serve in the headquarters, not in its subordinate units. But in the second reform of the command, many officers from the Military Academy were forced to return to their units or to transfer to its subordinate units. What does this mean except that they should be discharged from service? Although I was frequently misunderstood and disliked while working as a secret agent in the past, I have not regretted taking this job as much as I do these days." Minister Kwon Yong-hae is leading the military reform which focuses on driving out Hanahoe and reducing the structure of the Defense Security Command. (Most military men say that the word `change' is more appropriate than `reform'.) Then how long will his power really last? What is the source of the power, and in what manner is it being exercised? It is a firm opinion that his leadership of the military is derived from the confidence of President Kim. First, the President's confidence of Minister Kwon is known to be immense. This seems to be a result of Minister Kwon's loyalty combined with President Kim's tendency to believe in trustworthy men to the end. According to some in the Blue House, recently President Kim's view of Minister Kwon is beginning to change. Of course, his confidence in Minister Kwon has not yet diminished. But until a little while ago, the president's philosophy was to rely mainly on the minister for military control, but this is said to be gradually changing. This is exemplified by events such as the sudden dismissal of Kim To-yun, ex-defense security commander, the new commander's direct report to the Blue House, and an exclusive talk with Kim Tong-chin, the Army Chief of the General Staff (3 November). As stated before, the president, through changing the defense security commander, is going to check the expanding power of Minister Kwon and will enjoy more of the minister's loyalty and the military brains. But, some analyze, the change of defense security commander may cause Minister Kwon to remain long in office. It is said to be because the president has become confident of his control of the military and has no man equal to Minister Kwon. In other words, the president is said to have a plan to check Hanahoe and the Military Academy graduates through the defense security commander, one who has not graduated from the Military Academy, and to carry forward the second reform of the military -- the reasonable execution of the national defense budget and the establishment of the future military system through Minister Kwon's loyal work. But Minister Kwon will know his duty well as a National Defense Minister. It is just that he should take care of the Army and help them perform their duties faithfully, as President Kim promised, in observance of Armed Forces Day held in the drill ground field at Kyeryongdae last 1 October, that he trusted firmly in his Army and would take the lead in enhancing their honor and dignity. The military's discontentment with Minister Kwon up to this point seems to stem from the minister's inability to adequately protect them from outside influences such as the Blue House and the political world. A colonel serving in the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, "Everybody will recognize that although the minister is only an ex-major general, he conducts business better and thinks more rationally than an ex-general. But I think the minister is an official man who has many problems to settle politically rather than administratively. The minister did not handle with a firmly subjective view the Hanahoe, the persons involved in the 12 December incident, the absurd personnel changes, and the absurdity of the Yulgok Program. The minister's personal problems such as his brother Kwon Yong-ho's accepting bribes from a military goods supplier and the bad rumors related to the Yulgok Program during his tenure as vice-minister should no longer be targets of criticism. It is urgent to prevent unrest in the military and to stabilize them. I think this should be the most important consideration in evaluating the minister." The chiefs of the general staff of the three armed services have also changed significantly from the past. In short, they are trying to read the minds of the minister and members of the Blue House. They report to the minister all the military affairs which in the past they could settle on their own. They leave Kyeryongdae and stay in Seoul about two days a week. Amid the circumstances, the fact that President Kim had an exclusive talk with the Army Chief of the General Staff Kim for the first time last 3 November is a big change. Similar talks are expected to occur with the heads of the Navy and Air Force. Minister Kwon may be sorry to see this happen. But, many people think these talks are desirable because it will allow for "the checks and balances" of the military power. Minister Kwon is known as a man with many strengths such as a glib tongue, perfectly logical thinking power, and a profound knowledge. On the other hand, he has some weak points. The most obvious is that he does not have many reliable people around him. According to people well acquainted with him, he had no opportunities to make many friends around him, overpowered by the Hanahoe's influence in the past. So he readily hired persons with whom he had worked once or twice and in many cases, they failed. A typical case is Yim Chong-sop, the chief of the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters, who was relieved of his post on a charge of accepting a bribe in connection with a military construction project last 8 November. Major General Yim had won Minister Kwon's confidence during his service as an artillery regimental commander under Minister Kwon, the then Sixth Division commander. So, Yim had been appointed to the post of chief of the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters to succeed Major General Choe Sung-u (21st-term graduate) who was relieved of this post last April by reason of his membership in the Hanahoe. Last 2 October, citing the special statement of Minister Kwon, the National Defense Ministry vowed that "The Army shall be reborn, as one which will enjoy the people's love and confidence and carry out its original duty faithfully." "At one time, the Army strayed from its mission of serving public interest and justice because some groups gave priority to regionalism, kinship, or other interests." It reflected on itself. "The Army itself also committed bad acts by expecting or fostering in secret uncommon human relations." Within a month after the promotions and personnel changes of the Army generals were completed and the wrong-doings of suspected key post generals were exposed, some soldiers said, "Another special statement by the minister should be made." According to many soldiers, they do not see any changes in the military from the past -- the military feels uneasy and even the right of command, which is the most important factor in the Army, seems unsettled. This is caused mainly by the frequent personnel changes made without any firm standard. Even this year, due to three or four sudden personnel changes, in addition to the periodical one, soldiers say they feel uneasy and discontented with the changes, and that sudden changes are dangerous and has caused the military to be discouraged. Some say, "Even if they are discharged from service, it should be with honor and justice" or "Soldiers discharged from the service with grudges against the military could possibly be uneasy for the military." With the frequent personnel changes by the new government, the commanders of the Defense Security, the Army Education and the Capital Corps have all changed three or four times this year. They ask how stable can commands of units be under such circumstances. Officers point this out because the reforms of the military have been made impromptu, without any program. Most officers do not want the military to be the subject of politicians' experimentation. According to Professor Hong Tu-sung (Sociology) of Seoul University, last September, "the influence of the military on our politics" is 4.85 percent, sharply down from 12.6 percent in June 1990 and 32.3 percent in 1988. In the year 2000, less than 1.5 percent, the lowest of the power elite groups, is expected. The competitive rate of next year's applicant for entrance to the Military Academy is a bit more than 4 to 1, less than that of the average year, the lowest since the academy opened. Those of the Naval and Air Force Academies are also, though a little higher than the Military Academy, unprecedentedly low. The factors which will give a sense of crisis to the military group are drawing near more remarkably than ever. Under such circumstances, next year's national defense budget is 10,490 billion won, a 9.6 percent increase over the previous year, and will be more than 10 trillion won for the first time in history. In the budget, operational and maintenance expenses are 7,035.7 billion won, an 11.7 percent increase, but the build-up expenses of new war potential show a decrease of 79 percent over the previous year. Some people fear the day will come when such an enormous budget will be entrusted to deteriorated career soldiers. Military experts say that from now on, the government should reduce the operational and maintenance expenses and divert these funds to the modernization and specialization of the military and the maintenance of superior manpower, and that in order to reduce the operational and maintenance expenses, the government should first largely unify duplicate structures in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and liquidate nonurgent units. Mr. Chi Man-won (51), a commentator on the military, said, "If the government gets rid of nonessential units and structures in the military, it could save more than 100,000 military personnel. As a result the government could save much in the national defense budget. If it commits these soldiers to the industrial areas, it could get an increase of more than three trillion won of gross national product a year." Many soldiers say that only if President Kim lets the ordinary soldiers serve in the military peacefully with honor and high morale after driving out political soldiers, will his reform of the military succeed. If done so, nobody will object to the notion that "the military could secure the freedom and rights of the people and be the wheel of the cart that is loaded with the happiness and prosperity of the people," as President Kim said in observance of Armed Forces Day.
