Mr. Pelletreau, a politician considered familiar with the affairs of Iran and that of the Middle East, during yesterday's press conference, by using such terms as Iran's ambitions for seeking regional domination and the use of terrorist approaches, tried to announce to other regional countries, through the mass media, the U.S. leaders' message of friendship and loyalty in defending the regional countries against the likely threat of Iran. Of course, the U.S. under secretary of State for Middle Eastern affairs, in line with the task entrusted to him, also did not leave the point unsaid that his country continues to call for pressure and economic sanctions against Iran by the U.S.'s allies in Europe and other pro-Western countries. He stressed that the U.S. believes that this trend should continue until such time as Iran alters its policies and turns into a good neighbor in the Persian Gulf. What the U.S. under secretary of state has said is neither new nor a new development in the U.S.'s outlook toward Iran, since, according to political analysts, it is not the first time that U.S. leaders are explaining their policies with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran; they have done so on various occasions and under certain specific conditions in the past as well. Despite this, Mr. Robert Pelletreau's explicit remarks in Abu Dhabi, in an overall assessment should be considered as indicative of the sensitivity U.S. leaders have always shown over the determining role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf region; a region that is extremely vital for the U.S. and its regional interests. It is beyond doubt that seasoned American politicians are well aware of the reality that the Islamic Republic of Iran has achieved substantial progress in its political, economic, and cultural ties with its neighbors, especially in Central Asia and in the Persian Gulf region. Obviously these ties have not been shaped on the basis of Iran's fear in the region, rather, as has been clearly stated by the leaders of those countries, these ties are selective and are aimed at realizing joint bilateral interests with deep understanding of the need for the enhancement of regional ties for preserving peace and stability in the region. Therefore, it is not unusual to see that the U.S. leaders, by using such terms as domination, threat for the region, or by warning the neighbors not to have close ties with Iran, try to justify the sale of more arms to the regional countries. Mr. Pelletreau also seems to have a short memory as, during his remarks in Abu Dhabi, he overlooked the point that, in his earlier report in March 1994, which was submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives following the failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Iran on the international scene, he had described the Iranian Government as a permanent reality, adding that he was prepared to hold talks with Iranian officials on disputed issues.
