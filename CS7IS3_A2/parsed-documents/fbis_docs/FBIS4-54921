The text of the law is on the desk of the president of the Republic, and the deadline for Arpad Goncz to make a decision concerning the law is 2 April. Constitutional lawyers informed us that constitutional and professional problems arose in connection with law No. 8955. During the four-year term of the Hungarian National Assembly, perhaps the most and the loudest discussion surrounded the issue whether society must be purged of former secret agents, i.e., how could one filter out informers of the former regime from among individuals in important positions. The annals record two major cases: The envelope calvary of the Smallholder Jozsef Torgyan, and the case of Istvan Csurka, former vice chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], currently copresident of the Hungarian Life and Truth Party [MIEP], who "made himself transparent" before the public in a way which one could call a masterstroke of dramatic art. After the wrangle of arguments and counterarguments, in the beginning of March, parliament finally passed the III/III law, the preamble of which contains the following: "The National Assembly" acted "in order to enhance the purity of the democratic political order." The opinion arose among constitutional lawyers that the text of the law is problematic for several reasons. In their opinion, the first large group of problems concerns discrimination. Namely, Paragraph 70/A of the Constitution forbids any kind of discrimination between one person and another. The Constitutional Court explained in several decisions that one must examine in an objective and subjective context whether forbidden discrimination is present. In view of this, the law becomes a constitutional problem, because it does not apply to the entire network of secret agents, only to individuals in the network of the III/III Department. According to experts, the selection of the group of individuals to be scrutinized presents a problem as well. For instance, the different treatment of church officials and the control of individuals employed by private employers is disputable. The problem with including universities is that in terms of the law on higher education they are regarded as autonomous public service institutions, and state-owned businesses are not even part of the political order, because in them the state is present not as a state organ, and not as an instance of the state's sovereignty, but rather as one of the owners in a market economy. From the point of view of professionality and constitutionality it is problematic that the law places the examination in the hands of a three-member committee consisting of judges, acting not in the capacity of judges, who are allowed to utilize "any legal evidence." At the same time the process is closed, which results in the lack of legal guarantees. It is problematic that if these are not court proceedings, how can evidence that is applicable in court proceedings be utilized in a legal way. Beyond the legal status of the members of the committee, their decision, which is actually a sentence, is also debatable. It is to be feared that objectivity will be hampered if the committee's activity is centered on the Interior Ministry, which submits the material for examination, and lawyers also consider it absurd if following the decision charges must be brought against the ministry. The experts noted as a grave constitutional problem that the right to appeal to a court is excluded. The Constitution lists among basic human rights the right of any defendant to request that his case "be decided by a lawfully established independent and neutral court in a just and open trial." Personal rights are absolute rights. They are not subject to the statute of limitations. And if the above-mentioned committee comes to the negative conclusion that the individual under examination has a "past" which is subject to the law on informers, and orders him to resign from his office or position, then it is restricting two fundamental rights. The first one is the fundamental right of citizens to serve in a public office, or to exercise their free choice of work and profession, and the second one is the fundamental right of citizens to human dignity, and within it, to a good reputation. Lawyers see the essential internal contradiction of the III/III law in the fact that its enforceability and practicality is debatable. Today one is justified in asking whether the lists are genuine or manipulated.
