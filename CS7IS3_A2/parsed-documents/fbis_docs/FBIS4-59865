About 6,000 lawyers gathered at the Bar Association's headquarters in central Cairo. Riot police intervened with tear-gas as the demonstrators neared the gates to start their march. The lawyers, who had assured the protest would be peaceful, were forced back into the grounds. Most of Egypt's 180,000 lawyers went on strike Sunday. They are protesting the death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani on April 27, a day after he was detained for allegedly acting as a go-between for jailed Moslem extremists and their contacts abroad. He was a defence lawyer for Moslem fundamentalist spiritual leader Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman and other members of Islamic groups fighting to overthrow the government. Last week, the Prosecutor General's Office issued a preliminary report by legal medical experts concluding he had been tortured to death. But, the Interior Ministry insisted he died of an asthma attack. The Lawyers' Association described Madani's death as "premeditated murder," and the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights also charged he died of torture.
