Golubeva; under the "Dossier" rubric of the "Utro" program; place and date not given] [Text] This is the first time a scientific and practical conference being held in our country on individual, public, and state security and the Russian special services is open to the press. A speech by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], made it clear the FCS has completed its reform for the time being and has begun functioning. The FCS's role must grow in combating organized crime and its politization, terrorism, and political extremism. Apart from purely counterintelligence activities, also put forth were the goals of protecting state and commercial secrets as well as a certain amount of protection for private enterprises participating in the national economy. By the way, a representative of the Foreign Intelligence Service announced that the question was being examined of channeling information beneficial for the country's economy to commercial structures. A concept of national security has not been formed in our country. While the national interests of the USSR were often obstructed, whether as a concession to its allies' interests or in order to fight its opponents, today Russia can have both allies, competitors, and opponents. However, our national interests must be free from ideology. Today there is an opinion in the West that Russia cannot undertake peacekeeping missions in conflict zones bordering the territory of the CIS; supposedly this will be indicative of imperial deportment. However, Russia is a member of the UN and can carry out this mission under UN aegis. Second, who outlines the limits of the United States' national interests? However, this is rhetorical. Let us talk about individual security with Andrey Petrovich Bykov, deputy director of the Russian FCS. By the way, confidential sources told me that Andrey Petrovich, who is a doctor of technical sciences, is also one of the leading experts on defusing homemade, non-standard explosive devices of previously unknown configurations. [Begin recording] [Golubeva] The subject is individual, public, and state security and the special services. For the first time, the individual is placed at the forefront . [Bykov] That is because while we have always discussed state security as a conceptual problem of guaranteeing the security of the Soviet Union, today, as we shift to the building of a new rule-of- law democratic society, and since we are about to join the world community, we all must observe world standards; that includes the special services. All international documents, as well as the human rights declaration, view individual security as the first priority. It is not completely understood yet how individual security can be achieved in our changing state. [Golubeva] What is your opinion? [Bykov] I cannot fully answer this question either. It is precisely the goal of today's conference to develop conceptual and pragmatic approaches to the everyday activities of the special services--and the FCS among them--which would allow us to solve this problem of individual, public, and state security and the legal activity of the Russian special services. We can issue statements on guaranteeing individual security, but we still have not developed the mechanism for it. After all, there are a lot of problems here-- information, personal, physical, and economic security of the individual. There are no legal documents today which would fully define the aspects of this huge problem, which is not only a state problem but one of the individual and society, of every one of us. Using a rather vulgar expression, I would even call it street security, among other things. [Golubeva] How long will it take to develop the mechanisms for protecting the individual in our society? [Bykov] I am a very pragmatic person, so I will refrain from categorical prognosis because the country's situation today is fairly unstable; the financial, banking, and credit system is very unbalanced; and these issues determine to a large extent the implementation of all the prerequisites, without which it is impossible to talk about personal security. [Golubeva] Are positive relations emerging today between the FCS and the government and deputies? [Bykov] The government, State Duma, and Federal Assembly reachs an understanding on all principle questions. The same applies to the government structure and the president's administration. We are corrected on certain issues. This is probably an inevitable process, and reaching an accord is always a result of work achieved by both sides. [Golubeva] Do you have the right to make corrections? [Bykov] Well, we present our proposals. [Golubeva] Can you confirm these numbers: There were 135,000 staffers in the Federal Counterintelligence Service until the last reform; there are 75,000 today. [Bykov] Yes, that is correct. [Golubeva] Has there been any change in relations between the Russian and U.S. special services following the Ames affair? [Bykov] We have witnessed no changes yet in those areas in which we cooperate with the U.S. special services. Our contacts in fighting international terrorism, the drug trade, and the arms trade continue at the same level as before. After all, we cooperate with the German special services even though we recently exposed their agent. There is no contradiction. [Golubeva] Is there any hope the names of the 20 identified spies who worked against Russia will be made known to the public? [Bykov] When the situation is ripe, we will relate it all in detail. You understand, they did not work in a vacuum, and every case branches off extensively, so it is not proper to tell everything at once. [Golubeva] My "Dossier" rubric features six of them; 14 remain. [Bykov] The time will probably come when all 14 of them feature in your file. [Golubeva] Thank you. [end recording]
