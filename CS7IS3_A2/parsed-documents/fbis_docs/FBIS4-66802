This is the situation we find today between Somen Mitra and Mamata Bandapadhyay. Disunity within the Congress (I) is routine news. Unity is the exeption. This is important in the case of Somen, Congress's elected president [in Bengal] and Mamata, Congress's most popular leader [in Bengal]. They have been at odds with each other for years and are only now talking of unity. Five years ago, Somen Mitra never dreamed that he, the general, would have a lieutenant named Mamata. Times change, however, and he has survived [while opposing Mamata] only due to others standing beside him. Many of those, however, who stood beside him, have gone their separate paths. At that time also, Somen and Mamata had not intensely clashed. Their rivalry has grown in its intensity. So what has happened to cause them to sound a unity theme? The answer lies in Delhi. Somen's writ ran out in April. Congress's working committee in Delhi made a decision that state organizational leadership will be determined by Narasimha Rao. Now both Somen and Mamata want to be seen by Delhi as guiding a unified Bengal Congress. One seeks to hold onto the reigns of power while the other, who saw it slip away two years ago, wants to appear disciplined in the effort to gain power. So both have adopted the same strategies though their factions remain intact. The stategy works only on paper. [passage omitted on meetings in Delhi] If Somen and Mamata really want to work out their differences, they do not need Delhi's help. They can give Bengal Congress a new face. This unity, however, will elude them. Those who with Somen, opposed Mamata, will not allow unity, forming a new faction if necessary. By resigning from his post as State Party Vice-President, Subrata Mukherjee has done just that. Mamata will also lose many in her faction by standing with Somen. Neither wants to take this huge risk too far. It is not just this state's Congress party which experiences disunity. In fact, if we open our eyes, we will see its like this most everywhere. In Tamil Nadu, G. K. Mupaner and Ram Murti, A.K. Anthony and Karunakaran in Kerala as well as Vijay Baskar Reddy and Raj Shekhar in Andhra Pradesh all have competing factions. So do Madhav Singh Solanki and Prabodh Rabhal in Gujarat, Sharad Pawar and Shankar Rao Chavan in Maharashtra and Arjun Singh and Vidhya Charan Shukla in Madhya Pradesh. Even Jagannath Mishra and Sitaram Keshari of Bihar and Tripura's Sudhir Mazumdar and Samiranjan Barman have factions. At times, factional fighting in these regions is more severe than that in Bengal. Congress' image in states ruled by the Left Front or by Janata Dal factions is decidedly worse. But factionalism is not the cause of losing elections. Bengal serves as the perfect example of this. The constant fighting and hair-pulling [backstabbing] between leaders is what loses elections. This is hard to prove with statistics. It is arithmitic which argues against Congress winning elections in Bengal, not factionalism. Jyoti Basu and the CPM [Communist Party India-Marxist] have won four consecutive elections due to arithmitic being in their favor. [passage omitted on election results] Congress sees an opportunity before it now. Somen and Mamata each have the ability to confront the leftists as Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh have at the national level. But they will not take this path. They proved this by not challenging CPM over the state budget and by not being vocal over Dunkel [Signing of the GATT Treaty], allowing CPM to claim whatever it wanted. Somen Mitra, instead spent all of his energy fighting Youth Congress leader Mamata Bandhapadhyay. Maybe this is why Delhi is now beginning to coerce unity.
