Written by Huang Qifan, the article says that Deng Xiaoping was the originator of the policy of opening the Pudong New Area to the outside world and turning it into a development zone. After inspecting Shanghai and returning to Beijing in early 1990, the article reveals, Deng told leaders of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) that although he had retired, he still had to remind them of the importance of the development of the Pudong area. In April 1990 the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the country's supreme governing bodies, officially announced an important decision on the opening up and development of the Pudong area, listing it as a national focal point of the country's opening and development projects in the following ten years. Deng pointed out that the opening up of Shanghai would bring about great changes to the Chang Jiang Delta, the Chang Jiang Valley and even the whole country. After listening to a report about the work of the development of the Pudong area delivered by Zhu Rongji, then mayor of Shanghai, in February 1991, Deng said, "Finance is important. It is the core of a modern economy. If financial work is done well it will be easy to get everything done well. Shanghai used to be a banking center, where various currencies could be exchanged freely. It is necessary to return to this practice. China's hope for occupying an international position in finance should first be pinned on Shanghai." Following Deng's instructions, Shanghai has given priority to finance in the development of the Pudong area. In the past three years 38 new domestic and overseas financial enterprises have been set up in Shanghai. The total deposits in the banks in Pudong have reached 25 billion yuan, while the banks' loans have amounted to 24 billion yuan -- about 12 times the figures for 1990. Meanwhile, the stock market, and insurance and other financial businesses have developed rapidly, thus greatly promoting the development of various industries such as construction and commerce. Deng also showed great concern about the development of infrastructure and high-tech industries in the Pudong New Area. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of building several bridges over the Huangpu River in the area and the importance of focusing funds on construction projects in the power, communications and other infrastructural sectors. Besides, he pointed out that quick economic development depended on science, technology and education. A breakthrough in the field of high-technology will bring about the development of many industries, he noted. The article also discloses that in the past few years Deng has given many instructions on development of the Pudong area. He once urged Shanghai people to further broaden their minds, be bolder and quicken their pace in the opening up and development of the Pudong area. Last year in Shanghai Deng called on Shanghai people to continue to make efforts, overcome difficulties and strive for further achievements. The article lists various achievements Shanghai has made in opening up and developing the Pudong area, and says that Deng's strategic policies have been carried out in the course of this opening up and development.
