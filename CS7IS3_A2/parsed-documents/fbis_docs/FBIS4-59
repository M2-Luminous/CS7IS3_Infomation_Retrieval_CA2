FBIS4-59 "drafr062_c_94003" DAILY REPORTS April Reports FBIS-AFR-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Reacts to State of Emergency Declaration IFP Reacts to State of Emergency Declaration Buthelezi Views Action as `Invasion' MB3103103294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1023 GMT 31 Mar 94 MB3103103294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [31 March] the imposition of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu would be perceived as an invasion and would render free and fair elections impossible. He said the declaration of an emergency proved the constitutional process was flawed, adding it marked another "chapter of oppression". Troops pouring into kwaZulu would be seen as an "invasion". "We'll see it as an invasion especially if... soldiers and army tanks will be rolling in here. It looks like an invasion... as if we're being forced by the barrel of a gun." Interviewed at a Durban hotel after a telephone conversation with State President F.W. de Klerk, who announced the state of emergency on Tuesday [as received] morning, a solemn Mr Buthelezi said he was "not happy with it at all". "I would understand his actions if he... considered postponing elections for a month or so," said Mr Buthelezi. "I can't see how elections can be free and fair under a state of emergency." "I told (Mr de Klerk) it was embarrassing," he said, explaining he was surprised at the declaration before next week's summit meeting between himself, Mr de Klerk, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. "It's sort of humiliating. People won't understand it on the ground," he said. "I believe tanks will be rolling in, coming from all over," he added. Mr Buthelezi said the emergency appeared to be a "form of duress for those of us who don't want to participate". "I think this vindicates the point the IFP made: that the constitutional process was flawed... that's why we could not get our people to participate (in elections). "Everything that has happened completely justifies our stance and it vindicates us."
