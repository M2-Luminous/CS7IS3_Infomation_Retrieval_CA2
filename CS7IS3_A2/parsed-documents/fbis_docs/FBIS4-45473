[passage omitted] Drugs: Taking Action Where They Are Produced In addition, just as he had lengthy discussions on the drugs problems with President Clinton during his visit to Paris last week, Jacques Chirac argued for a "right of intervention at the initiative of the United Nations and under UN control" which would have the aim of destroying crops in the producer countries. "These initiatives should be taken in agreement with the countries concerned, who are seeing a growing consumption of drugs inside their own borders, while making provision for compensating the farmers," the Rally for the Republic president explained. "Aside from prevention and repression," he explained, "action should be taken at the site of production," adding that this production, and especially that of hard drugs, is increasing in a dramatic way, "with the consequences with which we are familiar for individuals, and especially for young people, and also for the spread of AIDS. We also know the effect on wars, because it is the money from drugs which enables the purchase of weapons which are ever cheaper and which are then used to fight all kinds of ethnic confrontations. Finally, it is drugs which finance terrorism. If nothing is done, we will witness the destabilization of the whole world." Jacques Chirac, who, in agreement with Bill Clinton, has decided to set up a working group to study the means of eradicating the scourge, intends to continue his awareness campaign. "This naturally depends on a mobilization of the United Nations without which," he said, "nothing can be done on this scale, and in close liaison with the Americans, who consume almost half of the world production."
