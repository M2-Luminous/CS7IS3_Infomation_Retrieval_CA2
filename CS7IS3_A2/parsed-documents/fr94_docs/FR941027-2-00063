SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established an Advisory Committee Information Hotline (the hotline) using a voice-mail telephone system. The hotline provides the public with access to the most current information available on FDA advisory committee meetings. The advisory committee hotline, which will disseminate current information and information updates, can be accessed by dialing a toll free number. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donna M. Combs, Committee Management Office (HFA&hyph;306), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;2765. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Advisory Committee Information Hotline can be accessed by dialing 1&hyph;800&hyph;741&hyph;8138 or 301&hyph;443&hyph;0572. Each advisory committee is assigned a 5-digit number. This 5-digit number will appear in each individual notice of meeting. The hotline will enable the public to obtain information about a particular advisory committee by using the committee's 5-digit number. Information in the hotline is preliminary and may change before a meeting is actually held. The hotline will be updated when such changes are made. The following is a list of each advisory committee's 5-digit number to be used when accessing the hotline: 1Committee Name 1Number OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER ␣ Board of Tea Experts 12601 National Task Force on AIDS Drug Development 12602 Science Board to the Food and Drug Administration 12603 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH (CBER)(All CBER committees use the same 5-digit number) ␣ Allergenic Products Advisory Committee 12388 Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee 12388 Blood Products Advisory Committee 12388 Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee 12388 CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH ␣ Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee 12529 Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee 12530 Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee 12531 Arthritis Advisory Committee 12532 Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee 12533 Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee 12534 Drug Abuse Advisory Committee 12535 Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee 12536 Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee 12537 Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee 12538 Generic Drugs Advisory Committee 12539 Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee 12540 Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee 12541 Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee 12542 Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee 12543 Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee 12544 Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee 12545 CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND APPLIED NUTRITION ␣ Food Advisory Committee 10564 CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH ␣ Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee 12398 National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee 12397 Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee 12399 Medical Devices Advisory Committee ␣ Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices Panel 12624 Circulatory System Devices Panel 12625 Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel 12514 Dental Products Panel 12518 Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices Panel 12522 Gastroenterology-Urology Devices Panel 12523 General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel 12519 General Hospital and Personal Use Devices Panel 12520 Hematology and Pathology Devices Panel 12515 Immunology Devices Panel 12516 Microbiology Devices Panel 12517 Neurological Devices Panel 12513 Obstetrics-Gynecology Devices Panel 12524 Ophthalmic Devices Panel 12396 Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel 12521 Radiological Devices Panel 12526 CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE ␣ Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee 12546 NATIONAL CENTER FOR TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH ␣ Ranch Hand Advisory Committee 12560 Science Advisory Board to the National Center for Toxicological Research 12559 The hotline will provide the most recent information available on upcoming advisory committee meetings, guidance for making an oral presentation during the open public hearing portion, and procedures on obtaining copies of transcripts of advisory committee meetings. Because the hotline will communicate the most current information available about any particular advisory committee meeting, the establishment of this system will provide interested parties with timely and equal access to such information. The hotline should also conserve agency resources by reducing the current volume of inquires individual FDA offices and employees must handle concerning advisory committee schedules and procedures.
