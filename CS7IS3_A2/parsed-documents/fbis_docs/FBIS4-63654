Our correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko, reports. [passage omitted] [Naumenko] Considering the large number of complex problems facing the Ukrainian people today that demand urgent solutions, the president of Ukraine had to answer many questions. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, a question from Ukrainian Radio. I would not like to talk about serious issues on this festive day, but obviously everyone's thoughts today go to Crimea. How will you comment on the further course of developments? [Kravchuk] We made this decision: As soon as the Crimean Parliament revokes the law it passed, the Supreme Council will also suspend its' resolution. Thus, it is all up to the Supreme Council of Crimea. Once it revokes the law, the Supreme Council of Ukraine will revoke its respective resolution. I hope that the delegation formed by the Supreme Council of Crimea will arrive in Kiev and, I hope, we will find a solution, but the solution must go one way: No change in the status, no change in Ukraine's territorial integrity. Within the framework of this process, the process of finding mutual understanding, there should be no change in status and territorial integrity. If this is taken as a point of reference, we will find any, I stress, any solution. But integrity and statehood is the bottom line, which nobody is allowed to cross. [words indistinct] [Correspondent] Do you think the Crimean Parliament has gone too far in its claims against Ukraine's territorial integrity? [Kravchuk] I think, wherever it has gone it will return. Because such will be the necessary legal action taken by Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. I am informed that our foreign minister has addressed the world, explaining our stance, and that our stance has been met with full support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. The world has recognized Ukraine, recognized our right and our stance. Incidentally, this is confirmed by the foreign minister [words indistinct]. Russia is not disputing the issue of our territorial integrity. This is understandable -- that it cannot dispute what has been recognized by the entire world and endorsed in the treaty between Russia and Ukraine of 1990, and in the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. [Correspondent] Do you think that, unfortunately, our colleagues, journalists from Ostankino television company, are being somewhat aggressive in their constant...I don't even know what to call it.... [Kravchuk] I hope we don't have to pay attention to Ostankino, and this would be our best step; but despite its being so, I don't know what to call it [word indistinct] is being worked up. Also, by the way, if one is to blame someone for something, I don't want to generalize, then one must recall the coverage of the Transdniester events, the coverage of the (Karabakh) events, the coverage of the events in Georgia, Abkhazia, and now even in Ukraine and Crimea, all this coverage can be described as one thing: Conscious instigation of confrontation between the people. If this is the goal of Ostankino or of those behind it, this goal may be reached in Ostankino's view, but not in the view of the people who do not believe it, who, I am sure, have stopped believing these untruths.
