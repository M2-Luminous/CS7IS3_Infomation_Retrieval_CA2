In what observers said Tuesday is likely to be a stormy session, the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) will have to decide its differences, with the pro- and anti-Koirala camps still at loggerheads. The prime minister is also expected to push for a change in party rules to allow him to hold two posts -- prime minister and party president -- which would give him control, they said. Internal problems aside, the government also faces a renewed threat of public protests from the opposition Nepal Communist Party-ULited Marxist and Leninist. Rebel NC MPs are also threatening to vote against an important financial bill unless Koirala resigns.
