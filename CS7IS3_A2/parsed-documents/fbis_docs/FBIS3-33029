Indeed, the long-standing ties that bind us to the United States must be carefully maintained and advanced, mostly because the treaties that will make the Panama Canal entirely our responsibility will soon go into effect. Now would not be the most appropriate time for any cooling of the relations we have maintained from the birth of our Republic to date. In addition, any shift on our part against the northern nation would prompt an immediate reaction from the U.S. side that could only bring negative consequences for us. On the other hand, Japan is a major canal user, not to mention the fact that we are linked to them by a treaty on alternatives to the Canal, whether it leans toward the construction of a sea level canal or a third set of locks. A cooling of our many ties with such an important ally that also maintains immense commercial relations with our country would not be advisable for us, either. Circumstances such as those mentioned above demand from our government, mainly our Foreign Ministry, a cautious, intelligent, and evenhanded attitude to conduct our relations with the two nations as if on a razor's edge. Otherwise we would run the risk of leaning too heavily on one side to the detriment of the other, which would really mean acting against ourselves.
