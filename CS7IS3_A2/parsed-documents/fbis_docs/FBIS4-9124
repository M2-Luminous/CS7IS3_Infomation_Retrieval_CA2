FBIS4-9124 "dreeu077_k_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 CROATIA HDZ Splits; Anti-Tudjman Members Form Party HDZ Splits; Anti-Tudjman Members Form Party LD2004180194 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 1300 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004180194 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] A news conference was held today in the European House in Zagreb by Stipe Mesic, the Croatian Assembly speaker, and Josip Manolic, the speaker of its Chamber of Counties, on behalf of the promotional board of a new political party, the Croatian Independent Democrats [Hrvatski Nezavisni Demokrati]. This promotional board has already been joined, they said, by 17 deputies from the two assembly chambers from the ranks of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. They cited the impossibility of influencing the articulation of party and state policies within Croatia's ruling party, the HDZ, as their reason behind the creation of the new party. These policies are in a state of crisis because, as they say, they are not discussed by the party's leadership since all decisions, they say, are taken by only one man. We were trying to initiate, within the HDZ, a debate on the fundamental issues of democracy and the law-governed state, and particularly on HDZ policies toward Bosnia- Herzegovina but we were denied this, Manolic, Mesic and their fellow-members Slavko Degoricija, Pavao Tomislav Duka, and Perica Juric explained. This is why, they said, they are going to convene the founding assembly of the Croatian Independent Democrats as early as this month. We are deliberately aiming to bring about a polarization within the HDZ, Mesic and Manolic added. We do not intend to join the ranks of opposition parties. We want to cooperate with all parties, including even the HDZ. We support the government of Nikica Valentic while we reserve the right to criticize him for having no articulate program for Croatia's development, and for the implementation of privatization and denationalization. We want the government to govern in keeping with the constitutional principle of triple division of power, Stipe Mesic and Josip Manolic said at their news conference.
