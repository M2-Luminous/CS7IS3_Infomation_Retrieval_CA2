An ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent begins by saying that the recent amnesty decision to release the putschists points to it being a plot between parliament and government. "You know", Shumeyko replies, "I could not see any sign of a plot. If you want to speak about this, however, then Russia told the whole world that it would build a law-based state and that there would, at long last, be a division of powers in Russia into legislative, executive, and legal powers. Each branch of power has its own prerogatives. It so happened that the Duma declared an amnesty, and it did so according to the law. If you look at Article 103 of the Constitution, it is there in black and white." Shumeyko goes on to define amnesty as the release of criminals from punishment and says that the legislative body adopted the role of the court. He says: "Whatever my attitude may be to the Lefortovo inmates, I believe that they treated them incorrectly. Still, there had to be a trial, and the court decided. Then there was an amnesty. Now it turns out that, some people say, that once the inmates acknowledged the amnesty and left prison they admitted they were guilty and admitted they were criminals. They admitted they were guilty of everything that happened. That is one point of view. The other point of view says no. They were innocent. They should be released." Shumeyko says it is a good that people have different views, so long as it is according to the law. He adds that what has happened is over, and we must see what happens next. A SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko about budget allocations to the agrarian sector in the first quarter. Shumeyko says that this matter was discussed in the Federal Council, and they arrived at a figure of 7 trillion rubles. He adds that it is a matter of choosing the right path between high inflation and supporting commodity producers and says that the latter must be supported. A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks Shumeyko whether Aleksandr Rutskoy, now that he is free, has information that may be used against some of the present leaders, including Shumeyko himself. Shumeyko says he does not think that Rutskoy has any secret information. It is the same old story, he says, when some people fabricate charges for personal gain. Dolgov interjects that a commercial bank bought up documents containing materials that compromised Shumeyko. Shumeyko says he has never signed any document that could be interpreted as corruption. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent then asks Shumeyko what he has gained from recent moves in his career. Shumeyko replies that he and his predecessor, Ruslan Khasbulatov, had different opinions on many issues. He says he believes that more than half the laws adopted by the previous Supreme Soviet were of a political nature and that this merely hindered the progress of the reforms. A ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent asks if the Federation Council would overturn the amnesty decision if it had the power. Shumeyko says he believes that it would. He says he is against the amnesty decision as a politician and chairman. An IZVESTIYA correspondent asks about the technicalities with regard to Procurator General Kazannik's resignation. Shumeyko says: "The Federation Council is not in session at the moment. The next session will be on 15 March. It happened like this: Procurator General Kazannik resigned. The president--on the basis of Kazannik's resignation statement--wrote out his instruction, or edict. He wrote that he had received Kazannik's resignation and that he would go to the Federation Council with a proposal to release Kazannik and to appoint Ilyushenko to the office. "I received this letter from the president. During the recess between sessions, I said that there was no procedural norm, so I signed the instruction. I do not have the right to make the decision. I do not have the right to decide for the whole Federation Council. Therefore, the instruction literally said the following: until examination of the question of the resignation/appointment by the Federation Council, in accordance with Article 102 of the Constitution, to agree with the president's proposal to entrust the execution of duties to Ilyushenko. In other words, this is until 15 March. On 15 March, all these official letters of the president will be submitted, and we will examine them in the proper manner. We will adopt a decision then, or we will not adopt a decision." Shumeyko continues by elaborating on the importance of the struggle against crime and, hence, the importance of making the correct decision over the post of procurator general. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA asks if Russia is not in a dangerous position now with a new Duma in place and the possibility of further confrontation. Shumeyko says he does not see any confrontation between the powers at present. He adds that time will tell how matters develop, but the main thing is that proper laws are adopted and are accepted by the people. He says he believes that everything can be solved politically. A LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks when there will be another October this year--alluding to a statement by Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. Shumeyko retorts that it will be in October, according to the calendar. He says he takes these statements with a grain of salt. Answering a question from a Radio Rossii correspondent about the make-up of the parliament and the different factions, Shumeyko says that while there may be great differences in the Duma, there are no such factional divisions in the Federation Council. He adds that all deputies are equal and, therefore, it will come to decisions more quickly. A Radio Svoboda correspondents asks what Shumeyko thinks the next round of presidential elections in 1996 will look like, whether it will be a Zhirinovskiy-Rutskoy or Chernomyrdin-Rutskoy-Zhirinovskiy clash. Shumeyko says he does not like predictions, and it will be up to the people to decide who their president will be. He add that he does not believe the formulas Radio Svoboda has presented will in fact emerge. He says that the thing to remember is that the institution of the presidency is still a young one in Russia; it is still emerging and needs to be consolidated. Shumeyko then answers a question from PRAVDA about the state of the media's finances. He says it is obviously a good thing if the country has well-established papers, and PRAVDA has a special place in the country's life. He adds that a reduction in taxes would help the press. Dolgov asks about television, and Shumeyko replies that television also needs funds. He adds that as long as television is owned by the state it is part of the budget. He says that television, in general, is in need of investment. The ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent cites an article in THE FINANCIAL TIMES about vast sums of cash going out of the country and then asks what Shumeyko is going to do about corruption in the Federation Council. Shumeyko talks about the need for foreign investment. He adds that there is not such a big problem with regard to corruption. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks if Shumeyko intends to elevate the status of the Interparliamentary Assembly. Shumeyko says he does, particularly when it comes to tackling issues in areas like Karabakh and others with a Russian-speaking population. He says that a plenary session will be held on 17-19 March and that all justice ministers and chairmen of arbitration courts will be invited to debate a Russian civic code. He adds that a social code also needs to be worked out. The SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko how inflation and extra cash to Agroprom can be balanced. He then asks how far Shumeyko is prepared to go to avoid extreme inflation. Shumeyko replies that inflation can be curbed as long as the money goes to the right areas and the agro-industrial complex is one. Shumeyko closes by giving brief answers to questions. He says he is not planning to run for president at the next election and believes it would be good for Russia if Yeltsin were to hold office again. He says only fascist newspapers will be closed down.
