If one side has no such will there will be no agreement. So what is this comedy for?," Polish Ambassador to Lithuania Jan Widacki said at a press conference after Lithuania had suspended signing a TV agreement with Poland. Director of the Broadcasting Centre of the Lithuanian TV Petras Uzpelkis said in the Lithuanian TV main news bulletin on Tuesday that the Polish side extorted its visit to Lithuania while the truth is it was invited by the Lithuanians and Uzpelkis participated himself in the preparations, Widacki said. Uzpelkis tried to explain on TV why he had stopped an agreement while he said to a Polish delegation to Vilnius that it was not his decision. There is no conflict between the Polish TV and the Baltic Television, that are to broadcast their programmes on the same channel, as it was announced in Lithuanian press. The board of the Lithuanian Television and the Ministry of Communications are partners for the Polish side and they can decide about TV broadcasting in Lithuania, the Polish ambassador added. He concluded that such a treatment of the Polish delegation does not make Lithuania a reliable partner. Both sides lose when the agreement is not signed.
