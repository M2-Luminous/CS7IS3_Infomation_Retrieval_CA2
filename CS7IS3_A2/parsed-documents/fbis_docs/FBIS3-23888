And if one pays attention to the circumstance that all the other contenders, who are less well-known in Russia (for example, the republic's assistant procurator general, Karimsultan Kokorokhoyev, or the former sovkhoz director Magomed Mankiyev, who gathered 20,000 voter signatures each during the election campaign), and in Nazran they are perceived more as "extras," then Aushev's gesture on the eve of the elections to the republic parliament and the voting on the construction of the Republic of Ingushetia was most likely not meant for the Ingush people, who are bravely risking being left without a shepherd, at all, but for Moscow. The more so since it is offering plenty of occasion for such "gesticulation": As far as we know Aushev's conditions--when speaking in favor of unwavering implementation of the president's December edict on returning refugees and forced resettlers from Prigorodnyy Rayon to North Ossetia and demanding in this connection an immediate replacement of the head of the temporary administration on the territories of the Republic of South Ossetia and the Republic of Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoy--are still unsatisfactory. Just as, incidentally, a year hence a zero result also characterizes the process of the return of the Ingush refugees to North Ossetia, which created a wave of expectations regarding General Aushev's election as president of Ingushetia. Aushev's pre-election "coquetry" was thus provoked. And it would seem that many a president could envy Aushev: Not all of them can, like the Ingush leader, boast of such a reliable "rear" made up of their citizens. And although the president is saying these days that the republic leaders, including himself, are "figures of the transitional period," and Ingushetia needs new politicians who can adapt to new conditions, it should have dawned on Moscow before all others (including Nazran) that the "familiar" Aushev is more convenient than any "new adapted politician," trying with the enthusiasm of a beginner to solve the problems of the conflict zone. If even now it is not at all simple to apply "federal sanctions" against one Aushev has accused of sabotaging the president's edict--President of South Ossetia Galazov--the head of the temporary administration could very well become "small change," the more so since the loyalty and stability of Ingushetia regulated by Aushev is worth something. According to information from Nazran, in spite of the absence of Aushev's name on the list of contenders for the post of president, the gathering of signatures for him is continuing (about 100,000 have already been gathered), and throughout the republic--they said in the permanent mission of the Republic of Ingushetia in Moscow--there are to be rallies at which only one name will be on Ingush lips--Aushev.
