He said he has collected evidence of this during his two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Ray was talking to newspersons in New Delhi. He said the evidence collected relates to the foreign mercenaries in Kashmir, foreign arms and ammunition seized, and the location of camps where the Pakistan authorities have been training terrorists. The ambassador said approximately 44,000 Hindus, Sikh, and Muslim families have fled the valley because of the militant activities. Mr. Ray said the delivery of more F-16 aircraft to Islamabad by Washington will not reduce tension in South Asia nor will it promote any dialogue between India and Pakistan. He warned the United States that if it does not desist from this course, the arms race in the subcontinent will be fueled.
