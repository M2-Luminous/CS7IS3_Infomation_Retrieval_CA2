Ministry officials said the Foreign Ministry has always accepted the VMDK as the legitimate representative of Hungarians in Vojvodina. In this spirit leaders of the Foreign Ministry held talks with the VMDK delegations in Hungary, and in the course of official and unofficial visits to Yugoslavia. The Foreign Ministry and the Hungarian diplomatic corps has done much to make the problems of Vojvodina Hungarians known in the world, mainly in the international organisations trying to settle the South Slav crisis. Hungarian foreign affairs leaders, including Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, State Secretaries Andras Kelemen and Janos Martonyi, firmly supported the VMDK during their visits to Yugoslavia in the past years, agreeing to appear at events organised by the VMDK, and backing the VMDK publicly. Hungarian foreign affairs leaders continually pressed for the VMDK to be accepted as a political negotiating side by Yugoslav partners, and for negotiating the issues they raised. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has also provided concrete financial support to the activity of the Vox Humana Humanitarian Service, set up with encouragement from the VMDK. Alongside the VMDK, Hungary helped ease the winter hardship for Vojvodina Hungarians, Foreign Ministry officials told MTI.
