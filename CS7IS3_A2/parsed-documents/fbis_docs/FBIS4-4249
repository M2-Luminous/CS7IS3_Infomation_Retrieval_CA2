The forum made it clear from the beginning that stabilizing agriculture and rural areas is viewed as a basic condition for the smooth implementation of various major reform measures; for the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; and for creating a good economic environment and a stable social environment. Agriculture and Rural Areas Affect Overall Situation Five months ago, in October 1993, the central leadership convened a rural work meeting and announced 12 major policies, which were widely welcomed by millions of peasants and grass-roots cadres. The meeting played an important role in stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. But problems in agriculture were not totally solved. Shortly after the important meeting, something happened: Prices of grain and oil increased in the south, and the tendency spread from the south to the north and to the whole country. Increases in grain and oil prices triggered increases in the price of foodstuffs, vegetables, daily necessities, services, and industrial goods, thus, causing a sense of uneasiness among urban and rural residents. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council detected the situation promptly and adopted decisive measures. Various localities swiftly transferred grain and oil to check rising prices, quickly stabilizing the situation and ushering in a safe and sound Spring Festival. This increase in grain and oil prices occurred after a bumper harvest. Outsiders were puzzled, and insiders viewed it as an alarm. So what is the warning given by the alarm? The warning, in the final analysis, is that we should never "despise agriculture." The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to agriculture and stability in the rural areas. In early March, a national meeting on development and helping the poor was convened in Beijing, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered a speech. When he came to the importance of agriculture, he frankly said that grain must maintain three kinds of stability and two kinds of balance: stability of farmland under grain, stability of output, and stability of stock, and a balance of total quantity and balance among the regions. General Secretary Jiang stressed: Grain is a special commodity which has a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as being a strategic material which affects social stability. Party committees and governments of various levels must always pay close attention to grain, which is a big issue that has a bearing on the overall situation. His speech revealed the importance attached by the party and the country to stabilizing the overall situation, while stable grain production and supplies are a guarantee for stabilizing the overall situation. This is a long way from just talking generally about the status and role of grain. Before this, at the end of January, the central leadership held a national work meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain and oil to unify understanding, sum up lessons and experiences, and adopt measures to increase supplies of farm and sideline products to ensure market supplies and price stability. At present, the central leadership has convened a work meeting on rural areas once again, as well as many other meetings to repeatedly stress the stability of agriculture and the rural areas. Some people ask: Is there a problem in this area? But it does not seem so, for the overall economic situation is quite good! The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are displaying great foresight and are proceeding from the overall situation; they see a big problem in economic operations. Regarding Industry as Superior to Agriculture Is Indeed a Cause for Worry It is true that we have had bumper harvests over the past several years. Last year was another year of bumper harvests, a year in which, except for cotton and sugar, output of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and aquatic products all increased. The annual grain output exceeded 900 billion jin, a historical record. The bumper harvests and economic prosperity in rural areas have created conducive conditions for the sustained development of the whole national economy, and this is visible to all. Why must we worry about such good conditions? Is it because of the panic buying of grain and oil and price increases last winter? But they have subsided since then! Outsiders have calmed down, but insiders have not been able to do so. There are indeed some agricultural production problems in our country's rural areas that cannot be neglected, and among them some are very acute: First, paddy rice output in the south has decreased; second, cotton output in the north keeps dropping; and third, peasants' incomes are increasing slowly while food prices are increasing rather rapidly. Through the phenomenon of decreasing grain and cotton output, we may see that new conditions and new problems have arisen in agricultural production, the rural economy, and social development, and if they are not solved promptly, they could affect the overall situation. Farmland under grain and cotton in some provinces and regions has decreased, and output has dropped. Growing grain is not as good as running industry and commerce, economic returns are low, peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain and cotton has decreased, and farmland has become idle. In particular, some developed regions in the south have developed their economies, but their grain output has dropped, and people in some "lands of plenty" have no rice to eat. The economic pattern where historically "grain is transferred from the south to the north" is being replaced by a pattern where "grain is transferred from the north to the south." Heaven is not to blame for shrinking cotton production in the north and grain in the south: it is a problem caused by humans. And this human problem is manifested mainly by "regarding industry as superior to agriculture" in many localities. "It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep." They offer lip service when they say they attach importance to agriculture; they take action when they say they attach importance to industry and commerce. Good farmland has been used to build factories or has been closed for "development." The eating away of agricultural resources, inadequate agricultural inputs, and so on are not individual phenomena. We may say that looking down on agriculture has already become a very acute and general phenomenon in current social and economic life. A certain viewpoint has become very popular in many economically developed regions, that is, in the market economy, so long as they become rich first and have money in their hands, they do not have to worry about a lack of grain. At a national grain trading fair last year, a majority of the grain was bought and taken away by provinces in the south, and 80 percent of the grain was corn. People in the south mainly eat rice, and corn can only serve as feed when they buy it and bring it back and cannot alleviate the shortage of badly needed "cooking rice." This is a lesson for people who dream about "transferring grain from the north to the south" and relying on others to grow grain for them. There are also some people who think that if the domestic market is unreliable, we can rely on the international market, and that so long as we have hard currency in our hands, we do not have to worry about having nowhere to buy grain. Experts warn that this is not a way out either. Last year, rice exports worldwide were about 28 billion jin, which is 80 percent of the annual rice output of Jiangsu Province. Can this small quantity of rice meet the urgent needs of a big country such as China? Also, we have to consider that grain is an international strategic material and relying on foreign countries means being controlled by others. Grain is a problem which must be solved by our own efforts! One Magic Weapon To Stabilize Prices Decreasing cotton output in the north and grain output in the south have taken place against a background of consistently high inflation, and the two phenomena have a mutual cause and results and intensify each other. This situation once again reminds the people of the country that agriculture is the basis of the national economy, that stability in the rural areas is the basis of the stability of society in the whole country, and that the status of agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants has a bearing on the national economy, the people's livelihood, and the stability of the overall situation. This year is a crucial year of reform, and both reform and development need a more relaxed environment. But the price index has stayed at a relatively high level for two consecutive years and this is not a relaxed environment. In light of this situation, Premier Li Peng made a speech at the national work meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain and oil, expressing the party and government's concern. Premier Li Peng said that large price increases are not good for either reform or development. Maintaining social stability is a prerequisite for deepening reform and promoting development, whereas properly doing "shopping basket" work and grain, cotton, and oil work is of great significance to maintaining social stability. This year is a year in which our country's economic system reform will take an important step forward. Smoothly carrying out the reform requires social stability and stability in the minds of the people. Big price increases will disturb the people's minds and cause social instability, affect the smooth process of reform, and have an adverse impact on the overall development situation of the national economy. Therefore, controlling inflation has become an important duty for the government this year and has been written into the Government Work Report. How can inflation be controlled? Economists think that first, we must strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets, and second, implement tight financial and monetary policies. These two measures have already been implemented, but it will not be easy to control this year's price index within 10 percent. Is there any other good measure. Yes. One good measure is to steadily develop agriculture and increase supplies of farm products. At the end of the 1970's, we began reform in the rural areas; as a result, agricultural output increased year after year, rural and urban markets were extremely busy, and reform in the urban areas became imminent. In the second half of 1989, in order to curb inflation, the national economy entered a three-year period of rectification and improvement; because of bumper harvests in consecutive years, the sustained development of the rural economy was possible, and the national economy then changed to a pattern of rapid growth, with the growth rate exceeding 13 percent for two consecutive years. Historical experience shows that in a populous country as big as ours, the supply of farm products always has a bearing on the overall situation. For example, 70 percent of the light industrial products in our country need farm products as raw materials. When there is a shortage in the supply of farm products, and thus a rapid increase in their prices, this triggers inflation. Therefore, to stabilize prices in the market, we must proceed from grasping the supply of farm products. A majority of people in our country's rural and urban areas have relatively low incomes, and they spend most of their money on daily consumer goods. Prices of grain, oil, and foodstuffs directly affect their lives. Therefore, grasping the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" are effective measures to check inflation. When there is an abundant supply of farm products, people feel at ease, and the country is then peaceful.
