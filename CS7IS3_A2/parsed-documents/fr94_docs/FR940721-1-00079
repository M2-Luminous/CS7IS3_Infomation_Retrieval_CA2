FR940721-1-00079 FR940721-1-00015 II. Description of Proposed Exemptions In considering whether to exempt additional class I devices from premarket notification, FDA focused on whether notification for the type of device is unnecessary for the protection of the public health. For the devices proposed in this document to be exempted from premarket notification, FDA has concluded that notification is unnecessary primarily for the following reasons: (1) The device does not have a significant history of false or misleading claims or of risks associated with inherent characteristics of the device, such as device design or materials. When making these determinations, FDA generally has considered the frequency, persistence, cause, or seriousness of such claims or risks, as well as other factors deemed relevant. (2) In general, the following factors apply: (a) Characteristics of the device necessary for its safe and effective performance are well established; (b) anticipated changes in the device that could affect safety and effectiveness will either: (i) Be readily detectable by users by visual examination or other means, such as routine testing, before causing harm, e.g., testing of a clinical laboratory reagent with positive and negative controls; or (ii) not materially increase the risk of injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffective treatment; and (c) any changes in the device would not be likely to result in a change in the device's classification. FDA has made the determinations described above based on its knowledge of the device, including past experience and relevant reports or studies on device performance. If FDA has concerns only about certain types of changes to a particular class I device, the agency may grant a limited exemption from premarket notification for that generic type of device. A limited exemption will specify the types of changes to the device for which manufacturers are required to submit a premarket notification. For example, FDA may exempt a device from the requirement of premarket notification except when a manufacturer intends to use a different material. FDA advises manufacturers that an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification is not an exemption from any of the other general controls, including current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), unless explicitly stated. Indeed, FDA's decision to propose 510(k) exemptions for these devices is based, in part, on the fact that compliance with CGMP's will help insure product quality. FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification for a generic type of class I device will be based upon the existing and reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every change or modification of a class I device exempt from premarket notification requirements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification are still required to submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing a device or delivering it for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution when: (1) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use before May 28, 1976, or the device is intended for a use different from the intended use of the preamendments device to which it has been determined to be substantially equivalent; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use instead of use by health care professionals; or (2) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than used by the device before May 28, 1976; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology. Such changes or modifications to class I devices that are exempt from premarket notification would mean the exemption would no longer apply. Changes or modifications to devices that are not exempt from premarket notification requirements under any regulation must undergo a more comprehensive assessment to determine the impact of the change or modification on the device's safety and effectiveness. FDA intends to develop guidance clarifying when a change or modification to a device requires submission of a premarket notification as defined in 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3). On the dates listed, FDA published final regulations classifying, among others, the devices listed below. When FDA classified these devices, the agency did not propose exempting them from the requirement of premarket notification. Based on the analysis described above, FDA has now determined that premarket notification with respect to the devices listed below is unnecessary for the protection of the public health and will not advance FDA's public health mission. This approach is consistent with the recommendation in the May 1993 report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, entitled ``Less Than the Sum of its Parts Reforms Needed in the Organization, Management, and Resources of The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.'' Earlier this year, the Office of Device Evaluation undertook a risk assessment of all devices in order to ensure the proper allocation of resources in the review process. All of the class I devices listed below were placed in Tier I, the category of devices which have a minimal inherent risk and whose review focuses upon intended use. A number of class II devices were also included in the Tier I evaluation process. FDA intends to consider proposing exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification for these devices. In the near future, FDA believes that exempting these devices from premarket notification will allow the agency to better use its available resources to protect the public health. FDA is proposing to exempt from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations, the 164 generic type of class I devices listed in Table 2 below:
