He held informal discussions with them and wished all ACFIC members a Happy Chinese New Year. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the discussions. ACFIC Honorary Chairman Wang Guangying, Honorary Vice Chairman Sun Fuling, Chairman Jing Shuping, Vice Chairmen Zhu Wenju and Hu Deping, and Executive Chairman Sun Anping [1327 1344 1627] reported on the ACFIC's involvement in government affairs, its commercial activities and operations, its development of overseas contacts, and its operations in "uniting, helping, guiding, and educating" representatives of non-publicly owned businesses. They also spoke about problems which the ACFIC must resolve immediately. During the discussions, Li Ruihuan fully endorsed the great deal of work the ACFIC accomplished last year. He pointed out: Ensuring the coexistence of all sectors of the economy, with the publicly- owned sector the mainstay, has been a major policy pursued by the party since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee as well as an important element of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Over the past decade or so, this policy has played an active role in developing the economy, helping the market to flourish, improving living standards, and creating jobs. He said: At present, under the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the prospects for developing the privately owned sectors of the economy are very good. Of course, we are faced with new situations and problems. He hoped that ACFIC cadres would emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, go deep into the realities of life, boldly explore, and integrate theory with the practical situation to study these new situations and problems and contribute to the development of privately-owned sectors of the economy. After the discussions, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and others inspected the offices of ACFIC organs to gain a better idea of their working and living situations. ACFIC Vice Chairman Jiang Minkuan presided over the discussions. Vice Chairmen Zhang Xuwu, Huan Yushan [2719 3768 3790], Liu Minxue, Chen Jinxin, Qi Jingfa [7871 2529 4099], Wang Zhiguo, and Liu Yimin [0491 0001 3046] as well as advisers including Li Ding, Huang Liangchen, and Ye Baoshan attended the discussions.
