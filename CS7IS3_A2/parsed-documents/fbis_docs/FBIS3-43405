Raul Domingos said Renamo's withdrawal from the Chiramba and Magunde assembly points was an indication that food supplies are not being taken into account by the international community. He noted that Renamo soldiers could go without basic facilities at their bases, but not in assembly points. Domingos urged the international community to take into account the question of food and clothing for Renamo forces. He said the situation is serious and demanded that the international community should intervene immediately to prevent situations likely to endanger the peace process. He added that everything will be done to see to it that those who abandon the assembly points will return as soon as possible, though this depends on better logistical conditions.
