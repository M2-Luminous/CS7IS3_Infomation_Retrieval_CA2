FR940919-2-00116 FR940919-2-00046 Using a computer model allowed the Team to assess the impact of changing from one process to another. Although the model did not generate an actual visual simulation of either the current or the redesigned process, the model did generate comparative data about the relative impact of specific features and expected performance. The sections that follow provide key comparative information regarding overall processing times and employee work investment based on the model results. Overall Processing Times Under the redesigned process, the time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a final initial decision will be reduced from an average of 155 days (as cited in the OWA study) to less than 40 days. Available employees will be able to process a greater number of claims and devote more time to each claimant, thus providing more personalized service. The time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a hearing decision will be reduced from an average of a year and a half (as cited in the OWA study) to approximately 5 months.
