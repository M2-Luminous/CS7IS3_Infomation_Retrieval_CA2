Water Pollution Impacts The proposed standards are expected to have no impact on water pollution because waterborne coatings are not required to meet the proposed emission limitations. However, the Agency requests comment on whether this assessment is correct and whether or not an expansion of the use of waterborne finishes and associated cleanup operations, in response to the NESHAP, would impact water discharge from wood furniture manufacturing plants. 3. Solid Waste Impacts The only impact of the proposed standards on solid waste is a potential decrease resulting from the limitation on conventional air spray guns. Conventional air spray guns have a lower transfer efficiency, resulting in more overspray than other types of spray application equipment. With the use of more efficient application equipment, overspray, and the amount of waste solids generated from this overspray, is reduced. Due to the uncertainties in trying to quantify this reduction, no estimate of the reduction in solid waste has been made. B. Energy Impacts The proposed standards are not expected to impact energy usage by the industry. As with the secondary air pollution impacts, there may be some impact on energy usage if some facilities choose to use control devices to meet the proposed standards. However, these impacts have not been estimated because facilities are likely to meet the proposed standards through the use of reformulated material. C. Economic Impacts The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the requirements imposed on the wood furniture industry by this proposed rule. Since the economic impact analysis was completed, the proposed standards have changed. The cost impacts presented in IV.D reflect the changes in the proposed standards, but the economic impacts presented here are based on different cost impacts. The economic impact analysis is based on a total industry-wide capital investment of $13,335,900, an annual cost of $16,801,200, and a cost effectiveness of $578/Mg ($525/ton). Because the cost impact of the proposed standards is lower than those used for the economic impact analysis, the economic impacts presented here are expected to be greater than the actual economic impact. In performing the economic impact analysis potential price, output, employment, closure, and secondary effects on affected segments of the wood furniture industry were assessed using a market model of supply and demand for this industry. Potential small business impacts were also examined. The economic impact analysis assessed the economic impacts of the proposed rule on the household, cabinet, and commercial segments of the wood furniture industry. Estimated market price increases from the proposed rule are small, 0.07 percent or less in each of the three segments. Estimated reductions in market output are also relatively small ranging from 0.03 percent in the commercial segment to 0.20 percent in the household segment. Total employment losses were estimated at 720 or approximately 0.22 percent of total industry employment. Most of these estimated losses (570) occur in the household furniture sector. Of the more than 700 operations expected to be directly impacted, three were predicted to close due to implementation of this rule. The dollar value of total wood furniture imports was estimated to increase by 0.43 percent, reflecting both increased volume and higher prices. Potential small business impacts were predicted to be minimal. Results from the economic impact and regulatory flexibility analyses indicate that smaller plants will not be systematically impacted more severely than larger operations. Moreover, the vast majority of small operations, which will not be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule, may benefit, to some extent, from slightly increased wood furniture prices. D. Cost Impacts For existing major sources, the proposed standards are estimated to result in a total industry-wide capital investment of $7,046,600. This cost includes the capital cost of equipment required to achieve compliance with the proposed standards. The annual cost associated with the proposed standards is $15,279,600. This cost includes the capital cost of control (annualized, assuming a 7-percent interest rate and a 10-year equipment life), annual operating cost including the additional cost of using reformulated materials, worker training, increased labor, and annual compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting costs. The annual control cost is approximately $10,779,600 and the annual compliance, recordkeeping and reporting cost is approximately $4,500,000. The associated cost effectiveness of the proposed standards is $513/Mg ($466/ton).
