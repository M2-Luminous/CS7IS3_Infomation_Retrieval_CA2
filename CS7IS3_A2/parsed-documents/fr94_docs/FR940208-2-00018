FR940208-2-00018 FR940208-2-00013 [Docket No. MT88&hyph;12&hyph;007] El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Tariff Filing February 2, 1994. Take notice that on January 25, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing, pursuant to part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act and in compliance with the Commission's Order on Standards of Conduct issued December 23, 1993 (December 23 Order) at Docket No. MG88&hyph;17&hyph;001, et al., a revised tariff sheet to its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A. In light of the Commission's interpretation of an ``operating employee'' in Order No. 497&hyph;E, issued simultaneously with the December 23 Order, El Paso stated that its tendered revised tariff sheet reflects that El Paso and EPGM have no ``shared operating employees.'' El Paso requested the Commission accept the tendered revised tariff sheet for filing and permit it to become effective thirty (30) days from the date of the instant filing. El Paso stated that copies of the filing were served upon all parties of record at Docket No. MG88&hyph;17&hyph;000, and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
