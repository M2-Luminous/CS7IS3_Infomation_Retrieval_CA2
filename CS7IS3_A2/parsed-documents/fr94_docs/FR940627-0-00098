FR940627-0-00098 FR940627-0-00017 Harold St. John (1978) described Cyanea grimesiana ssp. obatae based upon a specimen collected by John K. Obata in the Kaluaa Gulch of the Waianae Mountains, Oahu, in 1965. St. John named the subspecies in honor of its discoverer. Cyanea grimesiana ssp. obatae , a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), is a shrub, usually unbranched, growing from 3.3 to 10.5 ft (1 to 3.2 m) tall. Its leaves are 10.5 to 23 in. (27 to 58 cm) long by 5.5 to 12.5 in. (14 to 32 cm) wide and are deeply cut into 9 to 12 lobes per side. The plant usually has small prickles on its stem and leaves. Clusters of 6 to 12 stalked flowers arise from the leaf axils. Sepals are fused to the ovary forming a cup 0.3 to 0.6 in. (0.7 to 1.6 cm) long with small, narrow, triangular lobes at the tips. The petals are purplish or greenish to yellow-white, often washed or striped with magenta, and are about 2 to 3 in. (5.5 to 8 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) wide. Fruits are elliptical orange berries, 0.7 to 1.2 in. (1.8 to 3 cm) long. This subspecies can be distinguished from the other two subspecies by its short, narrow, calyx lobes which are not fused or overlapping (Lammers 1990, St. John 1978). Historically, C. grimesiana ssp. obatae is known from the southern Waianae Mountains from Puu Hapapa to Kaaikukai (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1992a1 to 1992a6, Lammers 1990), a distance of about 4 mi (6.5 km). This taxon is known to be extant in Kaluaa Gulch, but may also still exist in Ekahanui and North Palawai Gulches. All populations are on privately owned land (HHP 1992a2, 1992a4, 1992a6; Joel Lau, The Nature Conservancy, Steve Perlman, National Tropical Botanical Garden, and Loyal Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comms., 1993). Five plants are known from the Kaluaa population and as many as 13 plants may be found in the other 2 populations (J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992, 1993), though these populations have not been seen in the last 10 years. C. grimesiana ssp. obatae typically grows on steep, moist, shaded slopes in diverse mesic to wet forests at an elevation of 1,800 to 2,200 ft (550 to 670 m) (HHP 1992a2, Lammers 1990). Associated plants include both native and introduced species such as Pipturus albidus (mamaki), Charpentiera (papala), Claoxylon sandwicense (po'ola), Pisonia (papala kepau), Acacia koa (koa), Aleurites moluccana (kukui), Cyanea membranacea (haha), and various fern taxa (HHP 1992a2). The major threats to C. grimesiana ssp. obatae are competition from alien plants such as Clidemia hirta (Koster's curse) and Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry), predation of seeds or fruits by introduced slugs, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of extant individuals (HHP 1992a2; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Habitat degradation by feral pigs is a potential threat (HHP 1992a2). Donald L. Topping discovered Diellia unisora growing on a shaded, mossy bank in Pohakea Pass, Waianae Mountains, Oahu, in 1932. It was first reported and illustrated by Frances Smith (1934) who believed it to be a specimen of D. pumila , although she pointed out several differences between that species and the Topping specimen. Warren H. Wagner, Jr., believing that the plant discovered by Topping merited specific recognition, described the new species, giving it the specific epithet unisora in reference to the usually single, marginal spore-producing body (Wagner 1951). Diellia unisora , in the fern family Polypodiaceae, grows from a slender, erect rhizome (underground stem), 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3 cm) tall and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) in diameter, which is covered with the bases of the leaf stalks and a few small black scales. Stalks of the fronds are black and shiny, and about 0.8 to 2 in. (2 to 5 cm) long. The fronds are linear, 3 to 12 in. (8 to 30 cm) tall by 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3 cm) broad, with 20 to 35 pinnae (leaflets) per side, and gradually narrowing towards the apex. The pinnae are usually strongly asymmetrical in outline, unequally triangular, with mostly entire (smooth) margins. There usually is a single marginal sorus (the spore-producing body) running along the upper margin of the underside of the pinna. This species is distinguished from others in the genus by a rhizome completely covered by the persisting bases of the leaf stalks, and few, very small scales, by sori mostly confined to the upper pinnae margins, and by delicate fronds gradually and symmetrically narrowing toward the apex (Wagner 1951, 1952). Historically, D. unisora was known from steep, grassy, rocky slopes on the western side of the Waianae Mountains, Oahu (HHP 1992b1 to 1992b4; Wagner 1951, 1952). This species is known to be extant in three areas of the southern Waianae Mountains_South Ekahanui Gulch, Palawai Gulch, and the Pualii-Napepeiauolelo Ridge (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). The three known populations, which are on Lualualei Naval Reservation and on privately owned land, are scattered over a distance of about 2 mi (3 km), and contain approximately 705 to 755 individuals (Center for Plant Conservation 1992; HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1993). Diellia unisora is a terrestrial fern which typically grows in deep shade or open understory in dryland forest at an elevation of 1,750 to 2,500 ft (530 to 760 m) (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). Associated species include koa, Christmas berry, Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), and Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohi'a), and a mixture of alien and native grasses, forbs, and shrubs (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). The major threat to D. unisora is competition from alien plant taxa (Christmas berry, Melinus minutiflora (molasses grass), Passiflora suberosa (huehue haole), and (strawberry guava). Habitat degradation by feral pigs is a potential threat (HHP 1992b2, 1992b4).
