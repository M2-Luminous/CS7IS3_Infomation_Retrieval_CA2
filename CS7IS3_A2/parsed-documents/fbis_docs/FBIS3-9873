According to information from the Presidential Chancellery, Walesa will make a decision on this matter this afternoon. Asked about the situation if the president refuses to sign the law, director Zbigniew Boniuszko, of the Finance Ministry, said it would be more dangerous for the economy than not signing the budget law. [passage omitted] In an interview for PAP granted this morning, President Walesa was asked if he would sign the budget. He answered: [Begin Walesa recording] Apart from everything else, I regard myself as a responsible politician, and I do everything to make sure that the prosperity of the country is a priority. Assuming I do not sign the budget, I would not sign it knowing that the coalition would pull it through. Someone could say, you are irresponsible, what are all these games for, you are not serious enough for the president. I want to draw attention and initiate a discussion. From now on, I want society to be taken seriously, to think differently, even about the budget. The budget is only for one year. To start with, it is clear it will be amended. There is no doubt about it; everyone is saying so. What is more important--this budget, the purpose of which is to start certain economic processes in Poland, or the nation? [end recording]
