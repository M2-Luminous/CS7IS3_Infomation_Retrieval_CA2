Of the 10.3 million in Hungary, approximately one million people belong to an ethnic or national minority group. The law covers those groups which have lived for a minimum of one century in Hungary, and have at least 1,000 citizens declaring themselves members of a particular minority. Under the law, national and ethnic minorities in Hungary may set up their own local bodies of self-administration in villages, towns and the districts of Budapest, as well as a national body of self- administration, whose members are to be elected from local representatives. The size and scope of authority of a local minority administration depends on the proportion of minority representatives in its locality. If over half of the members in a local administration represent a minority, it can be turned entirely into a minority government. If at least 30 percent of the local representatives come from a minority group, they can form their own minority government within the local one, with limited authority. If minority representatives make up less than 30 percent of a local government, the minority government has to be elected separately, at the request of at least 100 citizens in villages, and of 500 citizens in towns. Minority local administrations may decide on issues that directly affect them, and on the allocation of educational and cultural subsidies. Their consent is needed for the appointment of leaders for local minority institutions. They may start businesses, call tenders, grant scholarships, and summon the competent authorities in cases affecting minorities. The law also provides for minorities without representatives to elect a local minority spokesperson. The local elections due this autumn will be the first to include minorities, whose national self-administration body is expected to be established before the end of the year. This body will make independent decisions on setting up and running educational and cultural institutions, and the scheduling of minority programmes on radio and television. It will participate in the professional supervision of minority education and assess legal measures that affect minorities. An ombudsman is expected to be elected in 1994, to represent the interests of minorities in Parliament. Of the 12 national minorities, only eight can realize their right of self-administration, due to the low density of their population in certain localities. Those obtaining this right are the Greek, Croatian, German, Romanian, Ruthenian, Serbian, Slovak and Slovenian minorities. Of the 600 Hungarian settlements with an option for establishing some form of local government for minorities, 200 wish to set up their own bodies. (In Hungary, there are 3,100 settlements.) The 220,000-strong German minority, living in over 400 settlements, intends to form 130 representative bodies; the 110,000-strong Slovak minority in only 20-30 of the 105 they live in; the 70-90,000-strong Croatian community in 10-20 of their 50 settlements; the 25-40,000-strong Romanian community in 5-10 settlements out of their 30-35; the 5,000-strong Serb minority in all of its six settlements; the 5,000-strong Slovenian population in every one of its seven villages; the 3,000-strong Ruthenian minority in one or two out of their ten; while the 3-5,000-strong Greek community, which is scattered, has only one village with enough citizens to form a local body. (All data included in the article were taken from the latest assessments of national minority alliances.)
