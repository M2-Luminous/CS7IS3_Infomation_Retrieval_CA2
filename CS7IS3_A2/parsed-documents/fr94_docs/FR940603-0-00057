FR940603-0-00057 FR940603-0-00025 The general water flow is counter-clockwise, running from the Gulf of Maine south into the western half of CCB, over to eastern CCB, and back into the Gulf of Maine through the channel between the north end of Cape Cod (Race Point) and the southeast end of Stellwagen Bank, a submarine bank that lies just north of Cape Cod. Flow within the bay is driven by density gradients caused by freshwater river run-off from the Gulf of Maine (Franks and Anderson, 1992a, 1992b; Geyer et al., 1992) and by a predominantly westerly wind. Thermal stratification occurs in the bay during the summer months. Surface water temperatures typically range from 0 to 19 ○C throughout the year. Salinity is fairly stable at around 31&hyph;32 parts per thousand. Much of the bottom is comprised of unconsolidated sediments, with finer sediments occurring in the deeper waters (Davis, 1984). In shallow areas, or where there is sufficient current, sediments tend to be coarser. Northern right whales were ``rediscovered'' in the CCB in the early 1950s. Right whales have been seen in Massachusetts waters in most months (Watkins and Schevill, 1982; Schevill, Watkins and Moore, 1986; Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986; Hamilton and Mayo, 1990). However, most sightings occurred between February and May, with peak abundance in late March (Mayo, 1993). Schevill, Watkins and Moore (1986) reported 764 sightings of right whales between 1955 and 1981 in CCB. More than 70 whales were seen in one day in 1970. Hamilton and Mayo (1990) reported 2,643 sightings of 113 individual right whales in Massachusetts waters, with a concentration in the eastern part of CCB. A number of right whales, including cow-calf pairs, remained in CCB and Massachusetts Bay during the summers of 1986 and 1987. This was attributed to atypically dense concentrations of C. finmarchicus in those years, and low abundances of sandlance, Ammodytes spp., a planktivorous finfish that also preys on copepods and may be competing with right whales for copepod prey during recent years (Payne et al., 1990). The late-winter/early spring zooplankton fauna of CCB consists primarily of copepods, represented predominantly by two species, Arcartia clausi and A. tonsa. Samples taken in the daytime indicated greater densities of copepods at greater depths. The copepod C. finmarchicus is found throughout inshore CCB waters at densities of 100 individuals per cubic meter from April through June (Mayo and Marx, 1990). However, Mayo and Marx (1990) found that the density of surface zooplankton samples collected in the path of feeding right whales during mid-winter was significantly higher than for the samples taken where whales were absent (median = 3,904 organisms/m3). The threshhold value below which feeding by northern right whales is not likely to occur in CCB is approximately 1,000 organisms/m3 (Mayo and Marx, 1990). Although year-to-year variation in the composition of zooplankton was found, feeding right whales were associated with patches of zooplankton that were dominated by C. finmarchicus, P. minutus, C. spp. and by cirripede (barnacle) larvae. These authors suggested that, after arrival in CCB when prey is at a maximum (or at least at a consistently acceptable level), the whales select the densest patches of copepods (Mayo and Marx, 1990). Calving and Nursery Habitat of Northern Right Whales Cape Cod Bay: Schevill, Watkins and Moore (1986) reported 21 sightings of small calves in 12 of the 26 years of their CCB study, including two calves that may have been born in CCB. Therefore, the CCB may occasionally serve as a calving area, but it is more recognized for being a nursery habitat for calves that enter into the area after being born most likely in, or near, the SEUS. Mead (1986) identified Massachusetts waters as second only to the SEUS for documented right whale calf sightings. Hamilton and Mayo (1990) observed a total of 30 calves between 1979 and 1987, associated with 21 mothers. Schevill, Watkins and Moore (1986) and Hamilton and Mayo (1990) documented observations of mating behavior and nursing in CCB. Southeast United States (SEUS): The coastal waters off Georgia and northern Florida (the area described as the SEUS) average about 30 m in depth with a maximum depth of about 60 m. The deepest waters occur along the coast of Florida, just south of Cape Canaveral. Seasonal water temperatures and salinity for this area are higher than in northern waters. This is a transition area separating subtropical from the more temperate southeastern marine communities. Large, cyclic changes in abundance and dominance of plankton species occur seasonally and annually. Annual variation may be so great that short-term monitoring studies may not be sensitive enough to assess the temporal variability of the plankton community. The recorded preferred food of the northern right whale, C. finmarchicus, does not occur in these waters, and the area is not considered a foraging area for northern right whales. Between 1989&hyph;1992, 31 calves were observed within the SEUS, representing 76 percent of the total number of calves (n = 41) reported from the North Atlantic during that period (Kraus et al., 1993). The calving season extends from late November through early March with an observed peak in January. The 30 ’ blocks of latitude within the SEUS having the greatest density of adult and juvenile right whales occurred in waters from Brunswick, GA to Jacksonville Beach, FL (Kraus et al., 1993). The presence of females with calves was primarily limited to the coastal waters between 27 ○30 ’ and 32 ○00 ’N latitudes. This is consistent with distributions reported by Kraus and Kenney (1991) using historical sighting data through 1989. Since 1980, 153 northern right whales have been individually identified from surveys conducted in SEUS waters. This represents 48 percent of the known northern right whale population of 319 whales. During this period, 125 of the right whales observed in the SEUS have also been sexed using criteria described in Kraus et al. (1993). Of the 96 adults observed, 91 were females, one was a male, and the sex of the remaining four was not determined. These 91 females represent 74 percent of all the photo-identified females who have been reproductively active since 1980. The observed frequency of occurrence of females in the SEUS is significantly greater than the expected 1:1 sex ratio characteristic of the overall population. This demonstrates that the population is segregated by sex at this time of the year, and that the SEUS is used predominantly by females, and females with calves, although several juvenile males have also been observed in recent years. Based on the number of calves and females with calves in the SEUS since 1980, Kraus et al. (1993) consider the SEUS as the primary calving area for the population.
