He made detailed inquiries about enterprises' production and operation, technical transformation, reforms, and so on. He also issued instructions on accelerating the pace of industrial development. Ruan Chongwu pointed out: At present, funding remains the primary problem facing industrial production. Since the beginning of this year, there has been a tight money supply for enterprises in general. In particular, they have faced difficulties in obtaining circulating funds. To solve the funding problem, the key lies in inviting foreign investments. Departments in charge of industry and enterprises must exert great efforts to make use of foreign capital. With regard to making use of foreign capital, we can invigorate our original capital through equity transactions. Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Our province's industrial technical level is low, and our industrial scale is small. To develop our industry, we must carry out large projects, especially those projects that can make full use of our province's strong points in natural resources -- such as oil refining; the petrochemical industry; the building materials industry, which includes ceramics, glass, cement, and bricks; as well as tropical crops; and the aquatic products processing industry. These projects promise high hopes of success. As long as we succeed in carrying out these large projects, our industry can be pushed to new heights. As long as our products are marketable, we can promote these projects. In particular, there is a big market for natural drinks. On the one hand, we must develop new products on a large scale. On the other, we must improve packaging. The problem of funds arising in the new, large projects also can be solved by inviting foreign investment and by making use of foreign capital. As for enterprise reform, Ruan Chongwu stressed: The pace of enterprise reform must be accelerated. In state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to actively promote reform in the corporation system, with the emphasis on the system of limited-liability shareholding companies. This is the key to transforming the operational mechanisms of enterprises and enhancing their vigor. While carrying out enterprise reform, we must thoroughly solve the problems of enterprises' leadership mechanisms, efficiency, and contributions to society. It is very important to choose managers and factory directors well. Government departments must standardize their conduct and refrain from exercising excessive control over enterprises or interfering too much in own their affairs. The Industrial Department and a sugar plant held a meeting to discuss the way to separate the surplus labor force from the plant. It was good and necessary to do so. In conclusion, Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Without exception, enterprises in Hainan -- whether they are covered by the provincial budget or belong to any ownership system -- are treated equally. The provincial industrial department is the unit responsible for all industries in the province. It must serve all industrial enterprises so as to jointly promote the great development of Hainan's industry.
