Balladur's Minister of European Affairs Alain Lemassoure warned the Serbs that, if they continued with their "parody of a trial" of the 11, Paris would regard the affair as a war crime. The 11 members of the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) group have been held since April 8 at the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica and deny the smuggling allegations. The Bosnian Serbs have just extended their detention for a month pending trial and say the detainees could face up to 15 years in prison. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here Wednesday that he hoped to obtain the men's release. "We hope that through negotiation we can find a way to free the hostages," he said after a 45-minute meeting with Balladur. Balladur assured French National Assembly deputies the government was "using all the means it can" to obtain its nationals' release. He decried that the aid workers were being "held hostage in the most cynical fashion". The French premier also told parliament the time was approaching when France would have to consider if there was any point in continuing her presence in Bosnia if the "Great Powers" and the warring factions were not ready to take appropriate action to resolve the conflict. Foreign Ministers from Europe, the United States and Russia are due to hold a meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva.
