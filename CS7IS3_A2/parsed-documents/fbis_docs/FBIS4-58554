He said that India, with the help of its agents, is creating an atmosphere of fear and terror through the shooting incidents in Karachi and Hyderabad when Pakistan is engaged in drawing the whole world's attention to the Kashmir issue. However, I would like to make it clear that the Pakistan People's Party government under the leadership of Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto is committed to eliminating all types of terrorism. The chief minister said this while addressing the people on the situation in Karachi on television on the evening of 3 May. He said that 22 people, including a woman and a child, have been killed so far in the disturbances during the last four days. More than one and a half dozen policemen and more than 150 innocent citizens have also been injured and 70 vehicles have been burned. The chief minister said that all this is being done with the intention to cripple Pakistan's industry by making it economically and industrially weak and to weaken Pakistan's stand on Kashmir. India is carrying out daily propaganda over Zee TV that human rights are beng violated in Sindh. MQM leader Altaf Hussain has also joined this propaganda. Leading a lavish life in London, he made statements saying that his eyes are shedding tears of blood over the recent incidents in Karachi. The chief minister said that this is a conspiracy not to divide Sindh but Pakistan. He said that cases against Altaf Hussain were filed by his own allies, meaning, the previous government, and the operation in Sindh was also launched during the same period, which brought relief and peace to the people of Karachi. However, conspiracies were hatched to attack the Army men. The chief minister said that these persons are harming their own people. We had offered them the opportunity to join the government in the interest of the province and the country. Responsible persons in the MQM leadership who want to join us in the development of Karachi are being held hostage by terrorist elements in the leadership. I am obliged to financially assist the families whose members have been killed by the terrorists. Owners whose buses and vehicles were burned or properties destroyed or damaged should submit their claims. They will be compensated. I call upon the people not to allow the society being held hostage in the hands of criminal elements. In the conclusion, the chief minister said that he shares the grief of those who lost relatives in the incidents and added that in no case, the criminals will be condoned.
