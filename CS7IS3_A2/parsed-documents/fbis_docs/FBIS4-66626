What the accused had done was read to their students Islamist tracts threatening reprisals against women not wearing the veil. What is it that immediately strikes one upon hearing that report by the APS? Only one thing: the fact that those principals are being prosecuted. Because except for that act of public salubrity, what could be more banal in today's schools than the daily passing on of Islamist ideology? The constant hammering by a good many teachers, backed by the reactionary and archaic content of school curricula and the collusion, complicity, or abdication of public authorities, parents, and teachers not part of the Islamist movement, has become a basic given in Algerian schools. Not a day passes without every child in Algeria being held hostage by that fascism, which has, with impunity, taken over the national education sector as a squatter. The fact that four school principals are now being taken to court for disseminating subversive tracts is the thing that is surprising. It also sets a precedent for which the credit should probably go to parents who have complained. But should it make us forget that the schools in this republic are working relentlessly on behalf of obscurantist ideology and its reactionary plan for society? Should it make us forget that schools have become a formidable, powerful, and public tool of Islamist extremism, whether dissolved or legal? Should it make us forget that thousands upon thousands of teachers are devoting all their class time to hateful, vehement, and antipatriotic speeches of a nature to harm the national interest without being disturbed in any way, thus benefiting from the power of the fait accompli? The fact is that bringing the four "teachers" from Tlemcen before the correctional court alerts us once again to a truism: Algerian public schools are no longer anything but a big national "zawiyah" creating an "anti-November" and "antifatherland" spirit. As such, they are in imperative need of an urgent top-to-bottom overhaul. To realize the urgency of that need, one must first become aware that, in the words of the late President Boudiaf, "the schools are a disaster area." After he made that remark, Algerians, or at least the most vigilant of them, learned that of the 7,428 prisoners in the security centers, 1,224 were teachers. That shows the extent of the moral violations being committed against defenseless schoolchildren. We can bet that those figures, alarming as they are, are only the tip of the iceberg. The veil is gradually being lifted from a disaster whose extent is advancing inexorably, like a nightmare. At the start of 1993, 315 terrorist teachers had been counted, 250 of them had been arrested, and 52 others were still being sought. The Algerian school system is corrupt from the elementary to the university level. But there is no limit to the horrors. We thought it had been reached, for example, with the terrorist academic and computer scientist in Constantine whose leader was an amir involved in the black market. But now the security services are giving us a glimpse of the incredible depth of the disaster: lycee students in their junior and senior years were recently arrested in the governorate of Alger. They were involved in terrorist acts and belonged to armed groups. The teachers are being emulated. Any pupil, any parent, and any teacher hostile to fascism can bear interminable witness to all the acts of violence and the violations being encouraged or tolerated in cowardly fashion, as the case may be, in the schools. Intimidation and threats are used to force women and girls to wear the veil, grades are used as blackmail to ensure compliance with a dress code and an ostentatious display of bigotry, the youngest pupils in particular are being subjected to psychological trauma, parents' associations and the FNTE [expansion not given] are being infiltrated, and so on. Every kind of charlatanism goes unpunished. So why should we be surprised when lycee students in Constantine try to kill their teacher? Considering all the abysses facing us today, surprise is reserved for other things. Redha Malek, unwittingly and unwillingly, may have provided us with proof of that when he congratulated lycee students in Rouiba for rescuing their teacher from a kidnapping attempt. In an escalation of the horror, and in accordance with predictable and infernal logic, the schools, after first producing fundamentalism and directly encouraging violence, are now becoming the hostages of terrorism. About 30 teachers have been murdered and about 60 schools set on fire. More than ever, the schools are being held hostage by that terrorism and by the pusillanimity of the authorities, who are hemming and hawing and letting things slide. But how can anyone believe that on this crucial and basic issue, the national school system will ever be straightened out by a Ministry of Education which, when it was considering a reform in 1993, planned to include the very people responsible for the disaster in the discussions? Civil society has certainly realized its responsibility for this disaster and its duty to act. Operation "Schoolbag" is set to take place on 16 April. That date has been proclaimed the Day of Knowledge. Will it be reappropriated in the interest of progress?
