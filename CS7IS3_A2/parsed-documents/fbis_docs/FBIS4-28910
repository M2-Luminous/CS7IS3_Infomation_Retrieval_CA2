The export-oriented economy of South Korea, a colony dependent on foreign capital and wriggling in a bog of the crisis of stagnation, has begun to shake to its very foundation due to the instability of the situation, the report said, and went on: First of all, foreign capital investment in South Korea has dwindled and phenomena of its withdrawal increased as the apprehensions of war heightened. According to data, foreign businesses took 610 million dollars out of South Korea in March and 490 million dollars in April. South Korean stock prices dropped sharply. Foreign businesses now are more interested in selling stocks en masse than buying them in the South Korean stock market as the rumor of war spread. They took away 114.2 million dollars in the period from March 1 to 8. Subsequently, the South Korean securities market prices slumped. The issue of securities has almort come to a suspension as the prices of securities of South Korean businesses rapidly dropped in external securities markets, too, owing to the perceived crisis of war. An increasing number of flight of capital have been witnessed among the rich since the rumour of "crisis of a war in July or August" by the United States and the Kim Yong-sam belligerent group was set afloat from the beginning of the year. According to the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation February 26, the number of those who left South Korea when the situation was tense totalled over 427,300 till February 19, or 107,000 more than in the same period last year. They have secured their fabulous property through the purchase of houses and immovables, depositing, etc. abroad. Foreign exporters are hesitating to ship export goods to South Korea because of the unstable South Korean situation caused by the rumour of a crisis of war. In addition, the rich are reluctant to invest and do not deposit money in banks, with the result that colossal funds accounting for 40 percent of the gross national product are kept idle. Thus, the withdrawal of foreign capital, paralyzed securities market, flight on capital, thriving underground economy and other phenomena caused by the crisis of war are driving the South Korean economy to the worst phase.
