Also included in the specific problem areas cited by Kadin's President Aburizal Bakrie were the legal and illegal levies on investment licenses, a "weak" industrial structure, and "less than skillful" businessmen. One of Aburizal's suggestions was for businessmen to establish marketing offices overseas. Kadin's president also pointed out that it can no longer be assumed that low wages and an abundance of natural resources are sufficient to make Indonesia competitive against countries such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka. Aburizal hopes that there will be "greater transparency" on the part of the government and that it will formulate deregulations and tariffs with a view toward competitiveness and less government intervention.
