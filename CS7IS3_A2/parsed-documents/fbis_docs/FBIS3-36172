During these sessions, the final composition of these committees was determined, and there were also discussions about the paramount questions which the upper chamber's deputies will soon be addressing. A chairman of the Committee for Security and Defense Questions was also elected. This was Petr Shirshov. Compared to some of the other committees, this one is not particularly large. It comprises only 18 people, one of whom is a woman. The committee members represent practically all of Russia's regions, including the eight Far Eastern regions. It is to be noted that the committee's deputy chairman is a seaman, Captain First Rank Petr Premyak, who is also chairman of Kamchatka Supreme Soviet of People's Deputies. The committee also comprises many former and "active" servicemen. For example, readers are quite familiar with Committee Member Ruslan Aushev who basically needs no introduction. Other committee members are just as well known -- Maritime Kray Administration Head Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, and also defense industry lobbyist Petr Romanov who ran for the post of deputy chairman of the upper chamber.
