Let us now hear what President Alija Izetbegovic and Yasushi Akashi had to say following their second meeting this evening. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just completed the second round of talks with Mr. Akashi and his aides, including General Rose and General Cot, and a number of other aides, seven or eight of them. The gist is that we will agree to a cease-fire in the Sarajevo region under the irrevocable condition that the Serb side withdraws its heavy artillery from around the city that they use to kill the population. As far as I was told, and it is my understanding, the Serb side refuses to accept this, but wants some kind of soft monitoring or something of that kind, which will not stop them from pounding the town again. We will not accept this. I asked Akashi to explain how else can they [the Serbs] explain their insistence on keeping the artillery on the hills around the city but for a desire to kill the people whenever they wish. For, it is obvious that such actions have no military importance and serve to threaten the civilian population of the city. I am convinced that out of the people killed so far, 99 percent were civilians, the civilian population of the city which, as you know, includes 1,300 children and a very small number of soldiers. In other words, they have no military reason to keep their artillery there. The talks will resume tomorrow. We will insist on the withdrawal of their artillery and on placing it under effective supervision. Whether the other side will accept this I do not know, but we will tell the world about it. The world must learn what the artillery means, what its task is. I repeat, its task is exclusively to blackmail the town and to kill its civilian population. They want to keep the town dead, for as long as there is artillery above the town we cannot open our schools, shops, and people cannot go about their business in a normal way. This is more or less our stand. I think that they [UNPROFOR] can find out [who committed the carnage] but they are playing the game of not wanting to offend the other side, they avoid saying so. There is reliable evidence that the shell was fired from Donji Biosak. Our experts have established this as has UNPROFOR, but it refuses to present it as evidence. In other words, from deep behind Serb lines. They most probably want to leave enough room for maneuver to avoid taking any action that will tie them down. What can be said with certainty -- and I think our and their experts have come to the same conclusion, but they [UNPROFOR] refuse to say so -- is that understandably, the shell came from Serb positions. In any case, all of the million shells that have destroyed the city, originated from the same positions. Why should this one be an exception? [end recording] [Akashi -- announcer-read] Ladies and gentlemen, since this morning I have continued my efforts with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and the Serb side, and with the Bosnian Presidency again to achieve a total and immediate cease-fire. I regret to say that these talks have not resulted in an agreement. We will have to resume efforts to find a solution acceptable to both sides. One of the main differences is that the Bosnian Government wants the Serb artillery and heavy weapons deployed around Sarajevo to be withdrawn and to be placed under UNPROFOR supervision. This is not acceptable to the Serbs, as they put it. I put forward some of my own ideas but no agreement was possible. Who do you think is responsible for the failure of the talks? I do not wish to blame any of the sides, but I want to stress that I will continue to talk until a solution acceptable to both sides is reached. The Serbs insist that regardless of its nature, the agreement on Sarajevo should be the first step toward reaching an agreement on the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is one of their conditions.
