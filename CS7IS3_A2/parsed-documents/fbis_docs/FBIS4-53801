He said the revision of the Foreign Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) will be made in this autumn's National Assembly session. Through the FCIA revision, the government hopes to eliminate or ease rules that hindered the FDI inflow. Many expatriate businessmen have criticized the act for being too restrictive toward foreign investors. The act, which was passed in 1966, was revised eight times in the past but has been criticized as being revised piecemeal and mostly under foreign pressure. This time, the government seeks to rewrite the act "voluntarily" to be more friendly to foreign businessmen, a Ministry of Finance official said. The minister acknowledged that despite efforts, Korea could not make drastic improvements for foreign businessmen due to "domestic- oriented factors." But Korea can no longer delay its plan to improve the FDI climate. Minister Hong said Korea should improve its foreign direct investment system to levels prevailing in Western OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.
