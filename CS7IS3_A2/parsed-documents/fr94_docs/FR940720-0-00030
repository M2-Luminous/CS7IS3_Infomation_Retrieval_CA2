FR940720-0-00030 FR940720-0-00001 Footnote 1 of 10 CFR 171.16(d) is amended to provide for waiver of the annual fees for those materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage only licenses before October 1, 1993, and permanently ceased licensed activities entirely by September 30, 1993. All other licensees and approval holders who held a license or approval on October 1, 1993 are subject to the FY 1994 annual fees. Section 171.19‚ê£Payment This section is revised to give credit for partial payments made by certain licensees in FY 1994 toward their FY 1994 annual fees. The NRC anticipates that the first, second, and third quarterly payments for FY 1994 will have been made by operating power reactor licensees and some materials licensees before the final rule is effective. Therefore, NRC will credit payments received for those three quarters toward the total annual fee to be assessed. The NRC will adjust the fourth quarterly bill in order to recover the full amount of the revised annual fee or to make refunds, as necessary. As in FY 1993, payment of the annual fee is due on the effective date of the rule and interest accrues from the effective date of the rule. However, interest will be waived if payment is received within 30 days from the effective date of the rule. During the past three years many licensees have indicated that although they held a valid NRC license authorizing the possession and use of special nuclear, source, or byproduct material, they were in fact either not using the material to conduct operations or had disposed of the material and no longer needed the license. In responding to licensees about this matter, the NRC has stated that annual fees are assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. Whether or not a licensee is actually conducting operations using the material is a matter of licensee discretion. The NRC cannot control whether a licensee elects to possess and use radioactive material once it receives a license from the NRC. Therefore, the NRC reemphasizes that the annual fee will be assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. To remove any uncertainty, the NRC issued minor clarifying amendments to 10 CFR 171.16, footnotes 1 and 7 on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38700). V. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental impact assessment has been prepared for the final regulation. VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
