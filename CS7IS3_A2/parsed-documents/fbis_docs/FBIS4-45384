Arad added that "there are about 200,000 casual drug users, of which 27,000 are high school students, and about 30,000 drug addicts." He noted that "about four metric tons of heroin, five metric tons of hashish, and 500 kg of cocaine are consumed in Israel every year." Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 June reports that Tel Aviv police detectives "uncovered a crate containing three metric tons of hashish soles, estimated at 30 million shekels. This is the largest drug shipment ever smuggled into Israel. Our police affairs correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i reports that the hashish arrived at the port of Ashdod from the Far East aboard the Zim Tokyo. Detectives waited for over a month to see who would come to release the crate from customs, but when nobody turned up the crate was pried open and the hashish packages were found inside. No suspects have yet been arrested." Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 8 June, in a page 14 report by David Rudge, states that Galilee District Police yesterday arrested two suspected drug dealers and seized "two sacks containing 50 kg of hashish and a nylon bag containing a kilo of heroin" "worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the streets." The capture was made after a "large-scale operation, involving members of the special Lebanese border unit and plainclothes officers."
