We are, therefore, making the following remarks. 1. The dissemination of this large amount of news, most often at odds with reality, persistently ignores our constitutional rights contained in Articles 15, 20, 21, and 29 of the National Constitution. We have not waived those rights, and we will defend ourselves by using the instruments provided by law. 2. The essence of a democratic state of law is based on the fundamental rights of the individual. These pillars of democracy cannot be resigned or renounced. One such right is the right to information contained in Article 20 of the Constitution in its two major aspects: the right to inform and the right to be informed. We respect this important and universal principle, and we defend its historic and political raison d'etre. There can be no doubt that we have always greatly respected, as we shall continue to do, the oral, written, and television media, because of the convictions imparted to us by our academic and political background. 3. A free press, so cherished by democracy, must act responsibly (Article 20, second paragraph of the Constitution). The parameters of this responsibility are described in the Constitution. The right to information loses primacy when it clashes with individual rights; therefore, it must be exercised truthfully and impartially (Article 20, first paragraph) so these rights will not be damaged. 4. Most recently, all news reports on the antidrug campaign and the seizure of prohibited substances that create physical or psychological dependency have been accompanied by three references that have become a standard and mandatory feature: 4a. Ownership of the cargo seized, no matter where these substances were found in Colombia or elsewhere, is attributed to the "Cali Cartel." 4b. It is stated that the Cali Cartel is an organization created and run by the undersigned. 4c. The article is illustrated with photos of the undersigned, depending on the desired magnitude of the impact. We dispute all of the above: there is no proof to support the constant linkage of our names with the criminal deeds reported in the news. Even worse, it can be corroborated by the news accounts themselves that the reported events have no connection to us, and our names, photos, and images were used improperly only to give color, illustrate, and capture the attention of the listener, reader, or viewer. 5. Neither of the undersigned has ever been convicted in Colombia or in any other country of the crime of drug trafficking. We have borne the legal proceedings against us both here and abroad with dignity, decorum, and respect for justice. 6. According to our Constitution, those who bear great responsibility to ensure the community's respect for the Constitution, that is, the National Government, particularly the Office of the Prosecutor General and the Office of the Attorney General, and what is known as the fourth estate (the media), must perform their duties and uphold the principle of the citizens' equality before the law (Article 13 of the Constitution). Therefore, it is clear that the guarantee of the presumption of innocence contained in Article 29 of the Constitution protects us, and no one can incriminate us, especially publicly. This is illegal when no charges have been proven against us in any court, nor has our guilt been established by a definitive court ruling (Article 29 of the Constitution and Article 2 of the Criminal Procedures Code), the only judgment that a state of law accepts. Otherwise, we may at some time take legal action. Because of our respect for the law, when any of the media has proof of criminal activity on our part, including a definitive conviction, we will not oppose publication of that information with whatever publicity the media consider appropriate. But until that happens, we demand that our constitutional rights be respected and observed, by virtue of our status as Colombian citizens.
