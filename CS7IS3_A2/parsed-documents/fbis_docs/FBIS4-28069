Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the assurance was given by Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut when they met in Cairo last Wednesday. They are attending the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) in the Egyptian capital. He told BERNAMA when contacted by telephone from here Friday that Prince Sirivut expressed regret over the bombing incident at the embassy and said that the incident would not recur. On May 19, a hand grenade was thrown into the embassy compound by unidentified persons. No casualties were reported in the incident, the first act of violence against the embassy since the United Nations-supervised general election there last May. Abdullah thanked Sirivut, who is also Cambodia's foreign minister, and the police for the swift action taken following the bombing, the motive of which was unknown. Cambodian authorities also gave security protection to the embassy staff. Abdullah said foreign ministers of ASEAN countries attending the meeting held an informal meeting to discuss preparations for the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting and Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) in Bangkok next month. The informal meeting was attended by all foreign ministers of ASEAN except Ali Alatas of Indonesia who was indisposed.
