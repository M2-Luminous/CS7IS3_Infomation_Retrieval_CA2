During the meeting, the two sides reviewed developments in the Palestinian cause and the ongoing peace march in the region. [Begin Habash recording] Naturally, the Palestinian issue, in particular, is a basic issue. It was very important to me to explain the PFLP's stand on the entire course of the settlement. In fact, I felt that I benefited very much from the prime minister's views during this meeting because I listened to the official Jordanian viewpoint on the course of the settlement. I actually expressed much concern about the continuation of positive relations between the PFLP and Jordan on the basis that whatever the differences, the basic focus should be on the need to achieve the Palestinian national program -- the program toward achieving repatriation and self-determination and establishing the Palestinian state. I confidently felt that Jordan's regime, under the leadership of his majesty the king, will continue to be of great support to our cause. [end recording]
