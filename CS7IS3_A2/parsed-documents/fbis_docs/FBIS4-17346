Opening up new land, conquering it by war. I am not a professor of history and I am not about to deliver a lecture on how Russia's lands increased and which czar was more notable than others in this matter. I am more interested in the motive for this movement. At a recent banquet, a representative of the Ukrainian "Rukh" explained it all, in my presence, in terms of the Russians' genetic aggressiveness. That is what he thinks. What I think is that the crux of the matter lies in the sense of self-preservation of a great people. For this reason, military-strategic questions have been in the forefront for every emperor. First security, life -- and then all the rest. And therefore -- push the borders back as far as possible, build fortresses to greet the enemy on the distant approaches. Best of all, rely on the sea, on maritime borders, and have as few land borders as possible. Russia had no alternative. Too much territory, too much wealth. Too many people who were upset by that wealth. The Tatar-Mongol yoke, the Turks, the French, the Germans, and all the other dribs and drabs.... The red monarch Stalin was not born bloodthirsty. In the late twenties he was the perplexed leader of a vast peasant state with indigenous industry, and therefore with a poorly armed army and an administrative apparatus disintegrating under the influence of the NEP [new economic policy]. Stalin realized that Russia has no right to be weak, otherwise it will get eaten up, and that in order to have thousands of planes and tanks, you need plants, plants, and more plants.... Plus roads and mines. And all this in a matter of a few years. History did not allow decades. There were no foreign credits, the treasury was empty after the wars and troubles. What was to be done? And how could you get the peasant to part with his yard and his cow and go off to the city to push trolleys? Pay him millions? There were no millions.... So he chose the simple and terrible path for which, in human terms, he cannot be forgiven, the path of Peter the Great, Catherine, Ivan the Terrible. But the other scenario -- the plan of Hitler's Ostministerium -- also envisaged nothing cheerful for Russia in the event of its defeat. We now have the same situation that Stalin had in the late twenties. Economic collapse, an empty treasury, the loss of the outlying lands. But we do not need savage repression, we are not in a hurry as Stalin was, because we do not fear foreign enemies as Stalin did. We have nuclear missiles and other kinds of all-out weapons. We are much calmer today than then. We do not now need to hold on to certain territories for military-strategic purposes, we do not need to keep tens of millions of breadwinners under arms. The army today is first and foremost sophisticated technical facilities and up-to-date infrastructure. And of course it is a pity to leave Europe and the Baltic -- after all, we used to keep the very best things there (once again, by old habit, we were thinking in terms of striking at the enemy on the distant approaches). Airfields, bases, depots -- all this cost billions. Because of this we got paid 200 rubles all our lives and were packed into communal apartments. But in politics, lamenting what is past or passing is a waste of time. You have to think about the present and future. It is a total paradox that the present situation offers the unexpected prospect of a fourth and fifth push [brosok]. If in August 1991 the Communist Party -- the backbone of the system -- collapsed, in December 1991 the artificial construct of the state of "equal republics" fell apart, and in October 1993 the soviets were smashed, in the near future two more decisive blows must be struck while the autocratic power still has the initiative: It is necessary to "close down" the autonomous republics, oblasts, etc., and immediately to bring back guberniyas, headed by governors. With no debate about it. Quickly and firmly, under an appropriate edict, bring those sovereign presidents who are reluctant to become governors to dachas outside Moscow for a "little chat." Let them take a rest, eat plenty of sour cream, watch television, only do not let them leave the grounds of the dacha...for their own safety. When they come out in a couple of years, it will be another country. And without a single drop of blood spilled. And the names of the guberniyas would be strictly on territorial principles -- for instance, Kazan Guberniya, not the Tatar Guberniya. Because if one nationality is incorporated in the name, the other nationalities are, so to speak, guests, living from day to day. The restoration of the guberniyas within Russia's borders as of January 1992 is the fourth blow. This blow must be struck quickly, and the Federation Council should be called the Senate or something like that, and forget about that federation as if it was just a bad dream. After the fourth blow, the fifth. The "former" republics rejoin Russia as guberniyas -- Nikolayev, Odessa, Minsk, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Bukhara guberniyas.... Once again this must be done quickly and sharply, against a background of sharp destabilization of the situation in the "near-abroad" (I cannot avoid using this idiotic term) and the use of propaganda on a massive scale, since television broadcasting is in Moscow's hands. At the moment the initiative is in Moscow's hands too, and we must not delay or waste time talking. The best memorial to those who died at the White House is not shoot-outs, but the re-creation of a great state, an empire, on the 1900 model. I know I will be accused of nationalism and extremism again. As usual. As it was two and a half years ago, when I ran in the presidential election with the slogan "I will defend Russians and the small peoples." At that time they called me a chauvinist. But now even Kozyrev is defending (only verbally, as yet) the Russians in the Baltic region. Where now are the Democratic Russia supporters with their panhuman values? Where now is the Democratic Russia appeal to the regions to "take as much sovereignty as you can carry"? It is embarrassing even to mention it now. And that inappropriate conversion, which I always criticized. And the cleansing of Moscow and other Russian cities of criminal southerners? Whose idea, in a watered-down form, has Mayor Luzhkov begun to implement? Gleb Yakunin's, Lev Ponomarev's? Galina Starovoytova's -- the deputy from Armenia? Who was the first in the entire country to start talking about guberniyas and the pernicious nature of the Sakharov draft constitution, whereby dozens of appanage principalities would appear in Russia? At that time the Democratic Russia supporters idolized Sakharov, now they keep quiet. They have realized that Sakharov's ideas are the way to wall-to-wall local wars. And people will remind me about the vodka, too. I was not only talking about cheap vodka, but about vodka and tobacco as exclusively state revenue. No imports of tobacco or alcohol, production only at state plants under state medical control, for sale exclusively at state stores and at firm (I emphasize, firm) prices. Low prices, so as to stop the manufacture of hooch. Only a fool or a CIA agent could give away the state's revenue from alcohol and cigarettes to foreigners who supply all kinds of muck in pretty bottles and packs. And then that fool or agent comes crying to us that there is no money for doctors' wages, for long-term investments, for road building. True, there is not. You yourself gave that revenue away. Tobacco, vodka, sugar, and wool should be managed exclusively by the state. It is the state's money, treasury money. Plus the railroads. They are also sacred, the state's. That is what I was talking about. Yet they made me into the "great friend of alcoholics" (although alcoholics are part of our society too). Shall we in any case define what kind of society we are creating? Will there be rich people in that society? Certainly. Will we have a redistribution every five years, take various things away from people? No. We are not a proletarian party. Will we recognize private initiative and private ownership? Yes, of course. Will we let pensioners or children with no parents die of starvation? Never. A grant, a roof over their head, a medical examination, free bread and free milk should be found for the most unfortunate. That is socialism. But we will have our own brand of socialism, not Swedish and not Belgian, but our own, national, homespun, hempen socialism, laced with communal, corporative psychology and smelling of footcloths. With a big role for the state and civil servants. Gaydar wants to build a small -- compact, as he puts it -- state. How can that be? We have to build roads, feed the North, maintain a big army and security, develop new technologies and fundamental science. Who will provide the money for this? The young wolves. Those who, when the Law on Cooperatives came out, rolled up their pants and ran off after money and the chance to establish themselves. Those who took their computers everywhere, and then "made their way up" on nonferrous metals and foreign junk. I am like them myself. At the dawn of perestroyka I started my own thing -- in politics, whereas they did it in business. I traveled that path from the bottom -- from little groups huddled in dubious apartments, to victory in the parliamentary elections in Russia. They went from a small cooperative or currency speculation to reputable firms. I will help these boys. I will not stifle them with taxes. I will allow them to have weapons to ward off the gangsters. I will make the state protect them, and, most important, I will give them serious business -- not spirits or vodka or chocolate, but the exploitation of large mineral deposits and the construction of large plants. Chubays' distribution of property to his own will be stopped. It will all be honest and simple. If you have the money, go buy a plant or a hotel, if you don't have the money, save up. And everything openly, by auction. And every day a report showing how much money the budget has received from privatization. Can you imagine what sums the sale of facilities like the VDNKh [Exhibition of National Economic Achievements] or the Kosmos Hotel in Moscow could yield? Trillions. Where are those trillions? In Chubays' dacha? It is time military industry was privatized. And the young wolves given a share. And then they will understand why we need a new aircraft carrier or combat helicopter. And they will stop worrying about customs dues on "Rasputin" vodka. Foreign policy must also serve the young wolves. Take the case of Georgia. What we should have done was to take away Abkhazia (at the Abkhaz' request, naturally, and under a treaty with Georgia itself, which will agree to anything just now) and settle Russian entrepreneurs, officers, and those Vorkuta miners on the coast, give them each a hectare of land, and let them build houses, swim in the sea, and eat oranges. The Abkhaz would have been very pleased. They would know: Since there are Russians here, the people from Tbilisi will not poke their noses in (or if they do, we will show them). Yet instead of these heavenly places, we are cramming our boys into godforsaken corners of Russia. In general, the bureaucratic, red-tape mechanism of access to resources (from the leasing of nonresidential premises to the exploitation of natural reserves) must be smashed. Only open auctions, dealing not with individual facilities, but everything -- real estate in cities, enterprises' fixed assets, monetary and natural resources. Central Bank credits -- also by auction. No special-purpose credits. If all this is done, lease payments will immediately become many times cheaper and the interest rate on credits will fall. If the Central Bank rate falls to 30-40 percent, there will be long-term investments, which we need. The only downside is that the bureaucrats will lose their bribes. Well, they can go to hell. The structural policy must consist of identifying areas of production that are competitive on the world market (petrochemicals, the gas industry, the aerospace sector, weapons, etc.) and investing sufficient resources there. In these "special zones" there should be a concessionary tax regime. Elsewhere we will tighten up, but here we will give as much as necessary. The government must compile a list of 200-300 priority facilities for investment on the basis of existing production units. And the money must be given not directly, but through stable commercial banks and structures which can subsequently be held accountable for the money. The problem of overcoming the production recession is a problem of the population's effective demand. The rich alone will not create demand for Russian industry -- they prefer imports. But the collapse of the consumer market could be halted by creating a system of consumer credit, indexation of the population's Savings Bank investments, and special-purpose bonds. During the election campaign, when I proposed compensation for losses resulting from price liberalization and the indexation of savings, all the "democratic" newspapers started laying into me, accusing me of wild schemes and demagoguery. But why, I ask you, is it not possible to index-link savings by issuing people with bonds -- state loan certificates with a term of 5-10 years (at 20-30 percent annual interest) -- and creating a system of depositing these bonds in commercial banks in order to obtain consumer credit. That would not lead to additional monetary emission, it would only change the structure of existing credit investments. But, I will be frank, the wisest economic plans will collapse when there is no elementary order, when instead of hard work people can steal with impunity, when there is no authority, when bribery controls everything. Therefore I will start from scratch. I will ask 20-year-old Akhmet, who is driving around Moscow in a Mercedes 600, what he actually does day after day. I will soon fire the militiaman who, peering at a deputy's card, states baldly: "The Duma is not my boss." And when billions are stolen by means of banking manipulations, I will simply have people shot. Civil servants must get on with their work for the set time -- from nine to six. Janitors must sweep the streets. The trains must run on time. Doorway lamps must work. It is elementary. If it does not happen, someone will answer to me for it with his head. Here I will act not like an economic theorist, but like a pragmatic Russian. And as a pragmatic Russian, I would not allow the newspapers, while the president is alive, seriously to discuss possible ways of removing him and to "select" his replacements. Those newspapers would quickly be discovered to have unpaid telephone bills amounting to a couple of million dollars, and their telephones would be cut off for nonpayment. And then there would be a fine of 100 million rubles for using the kettles. And maybe as a result people would realize that it is unseemly, while daddy is present, to share out his legacy. By the way, about daddy. His friends and colleagues are already quietly discounting him. Hints to the same effect are coming from the west, he has played his part, they say, look for a new one. They even sent the Government Inspector -- grandpa Nixon. I will tell you, as a pragmatic Russian -- they are writing Yeltsin off too soon. Boris Nikolayevich is an absolutely mystical figure. They have buried him -- politically and physically -- dozens of times. And dozens of times he has risen from the dead. He did not drown in the river on Nikolina Gora, or get smashed up in a plane, or die in an air crash. He won two putsches and outwitted and outplayed Gorbachev. Look what a party he smashed! He is just like a hero from a Russian folk tale. Did any of those who were present at the Central Committee plenum in 1987 and who wanted Yeltsin, ever think that they were looking at a future president? Yeltsin conducts politics not by Friedman's schemes, but by intuition. And that is why you cannot stop him by logic. Like me. We are both mystics. By the laws of logic, I also could not have won the parliamentary elections or come third in 1991. Therefore, among the candidates for the new presidency, Yeltsin is my most threatening rival. The others are village teachers and little boys from the capital's special schools. If Yeltsin, to whom it fell to make the first three pushes, also makes the fourth and the fifth, his chances will increase immeasurably. He will become the czar-father. Let me remind you: The fourth push is the revival of guberniyas within Russia's present borders. The fifth is the restoration of Russia within the USSR's borders on the guberniya principle, without republics as intermediaries. And then it is not far to the sixth push -- to the south, to the Indian Ocean. But that one is my chance, my mission.
