The Defense Ministry's shortage of cash is now affecting the holy of holy's, the Army and Navy, and their combat training. The development of up-to-date armaments and equipment is also being curtailed. [Tkachenko] This is the state's missile test range at Plesetsk. Our latest and most powerful missile, the Topol, is being tested here. The testing of these missiles may have to be substantially curtailed because of the shortage of finance. If this happens, the combat readiness of missile forces could be impaired because, unlike many other units of the Russian Army, the missile troops are on duty 24 hours a day. The upkeep of our nuclear missile shield is comparable with the running of a modern nuclear power station. The strategic missile forces, which consume less than seven percent of the overall defense budget--a modest sum in quantitative terms, are a very important argument that is always present in the background at all talks with leading foreign countries. At the moment Russia's intercontinental Topols are flying reliably and hitting their targets. Will they be turned, like their predecessors, the SS-20s, into [word indistinct] heaps of metal? Will Russia continue to be a great power or will it turn into a banana republic? Today this does not depend on the missile troops but on the politicians.
