FR941021-1-00056 FR941021-1-00009 Blood Pressure, Second-Class The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure second-class medical certificate applicants not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $1.8 million in primary testing costs and $0.7 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 32 persons who would be denied, totalling $2.5 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.7 million. The projected benefits of this provision were based on the review of the related NTSB accident records. For second-class (commercial pilots), only one general aviation accident was found where hypertension or stroke was specifically listed as the cause. That accident caused one death and destroyed one aircraft. Based on that accident, commercial pilot accidents related to hypertension or stroke are projected over the forecast period to equal: (1) .14 deaths per year valued at $350,000 and (2) .14 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $10,920, totalling $360,920 annually. In addition to the directly attributable pathologies, high blood pressure is also an associated risk factor for other pathologies including cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. The exact impact of the proposed rule on preventing accidents from these related diseases is not known but the FAA estimates that the magnitude of associated-disease accident costs that would be averted by the proposed amendment is at least equal to 5 percent of the projected costs attributable to second-class cardiovascular accidents. Such potential benefits would total $342,964 per year. The combined (direct and associated risk disease) potential benefits of the proposed second-class blood pressure amendment over the ten-year study period are expected to total $7.0 million, with a 1993 present value of $4.9 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 35 percent effectiveness level ($1.7 million cost / $4.9 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial. Blood Pressure, Third-Class The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure of all applicants for third-class medical certificates not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $2.8 million in primary testing costs and $1.0 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 48 persons who would be denied, totalling $3.8 million, with 1993 present value of $2.7 million. The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records for the period 1982 through 1989. For third-class certificate holders, 6 general aviation accidents were found where hypertension or stroke was specifically listed as the cause. In the absence of this proposal, third-class accidents related to hypertension or stroke are projected to equal .75 deaths per year valued at $1,875,000, .5 serious injuries per year valued at $320,000, .13 minor injuries per year valued at $299, and .75 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $58,500, totalling $2.3 million per year. Over the ten-year study period, the potential benefits would equal $22.5 million, with a 1993 present value of $15.8 million. Similar to the proposal for second-class, the proposed third-class blood pressure standard would also reduce those accidents caused by the secondary pathologies where high blood pressure is an associated risk factor. However, the magnitude of accidents directly caused by hypertension and stroke in third-class pilots is so large that an estimate of these secondary benefits is unnecessary. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 17 percent effectiveness level ($2.7 million cost / $15.8 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial. Cholesterol, First-Class The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for first-class medical certificates age 50 and over would be tested and would be subject to a standard of 300 milligrams per deciliter. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $3.4 million in primary testing costs and $2.0 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 81 persons who would be denied, totalling $5.4 million, with a 1993 present value of $3.7 million.
