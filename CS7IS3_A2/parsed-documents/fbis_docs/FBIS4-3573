In the book, 12 passages directly discuss the "image" of our country and nation. Through these discussions, we may clearly see that the issue of the "image" of our country and nation is an important element in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's many theoretical viewpoints and major strategic decisions. It is related to "two revolutions," the "three-stage" strategic objective, the "one center, two basic points" conception, the theory of socialism and patriotism, contemporary China in the nineties, and the future China in the 21st century. I. There Are Three Significant Changes in China's "Image" in Modern History, at Present, and in the Fifties of the 21st Century Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions of the "image" of our country and nation had an unusual viewpoint. That is, proceeding from the basic position and viewpoint of dialectical and historical materialism, he closely linked the molding of and the change in the image of our country and nation with the revolutionary cause led by our party. In his eyes, the point that "revolution is for emancipating the productive forces" can, in a certain sense, find more concrete expression in the point that revolution is for changing the "image" of our country and nation. Proceeding from this basic viewpoint, Comrade Deng Xiaoping held that three major changes of revolutionary significance have occurred or will occur in China's image in modern history, at present, and in the fifties of the 21st century. The establishment of the PRC was the first "change in China's image," and this event showed that "the Chinese people stood up." In 1984, when meeting a visiting delegation of Hong Kong businessmen and some Hong Kong celebrities, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "For more than a century after the Opium War, foreigners looked down on Chinese people and humiliated Chinese people. Since the founding of the PRC, China's image has changed." In April 1987, he pointed out more concretely: "Since the founding of the PRC, China's features have indeed been changed," and this mainly found expression in the fact that "the Chinese people had stood up." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that this was a significant event. For a country "remaining in a humble position in the world over more than a century" after the Opium War, this was certainly a fundamental and historic change in the image of the country and nation. Being a revolutionary of the older generation who was an eyewitness and personal participant in this change, Comrade Deng Xiaoping was always full of deep feelings and indignation when mentioning this change. He pointed out: "China became a semifeudal and semicolonial society after the Opium war, and Chinese people became well-known in the world as the 'sick man of East Asia.'" Up to the founding of the PRC, "more than 10 foreign powers bullied China, and the first was Britain. Earlier than that, Portugal forcibly leased China's territory of Macao. Japan and Czarist Russia, including the Soviet Union for a certain period, gained the greatest benefit from China." "In history, Japan owes China the largest debt." "Tens of millions of Chinese people were killed by the Japanese." Czarist Russia seized the largest area of territory from China, "the Chinese territory occupied by Czarist Russia through unequal treaties exceeded 1.5 million square km." So, why could the Chinese people stand up? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It was not Chiang Kai-shek but the Communist Party and socialism who enabled the Chinese people to stand up." He also stressed: "China's current image was not created by the former Qing Government, nor by the Beiyang Warlords, nor by Chiang and his son. It was the PRC that changed China's image." This revealed the true reason for the tremendous historic changes in this nation which experienced untold disasters. In the first third of this century, when the CPC had just mounted the stage of history in China, the country was being carved up; the Chinese nation was being humiliated and bullied; the warlords were fighting each other and causing a chaotic situation; and foreign enemies were driving straight in to invade our country. The CPC, which mastered the truth of Marxism and fought indomitably, united the whole Chinese nation to win victory in the new democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "In the past, we carried out the new democratic revolution; after the founding of the PRC, we carried out the land reform and also carried out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce. We thus laid the socialist economic base. That was a great revolution, and the revolution lasted more than 30 years." That is to say, the first successful "image" change of our country and our nation in modern history was linked with the first CPC-led revolution, which was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. The revolution was one for "selecting a doctrine [zhu yi 0031 5030]." Relying on our people, we selected Marxism and scientific socialism; and this rescued China, changed China's conditions, and changed the image of the country and the nation. The "new revolution" (or second revolution), comprising reform, opening up, and modernization, led by our party "changed China's image" for the second time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the image of our country changed." The second "image change" was mainly reflected in the fact that "China became more active" and "the economy was developed"; moreover, in the changeable international situation, China "stood firm" like an unshakable rock. From the first image change, which found expression in the fact that "the Chinese people stood up," to the second image change, which found expression in the fact that "China's socialism stood firm," the process not only reflected the in-depth advances of the Chinese revolution, but also showed that the Chinese Communists more broadly and deeply changed China's "image." Why did our country and nation still face the issue of the second "image" change? The reasons can be found in two aspects. On the one hand, the first revolution in our country just solved the issue of "rescuing China." Only by overthrowing the three big mountains that oppressed the Chinese people could the Chinese people stand up. After the task of "rescuing China" was fulfilled, "developing China" became the main issue. On the other hand, we underwent many twists and turns on the issue of "developing China." As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out when summing up the positive and negative experience since the founding of the PRC, the twists and turns were mainly reflected in the fact that "after the establishment of the socialist economic base, we did not formulate policies for creating favorable conditions for the development of the productive forces over many years. The productive forces in society developed slowly; the people's material and cultural lives were not properly improved; and the state could not shake off the condition of poverty and backwardness. This state of affairs forced us to carry out reform. The general principle was to uphold four things. The issue was how to uphold these things. Should we maintain the policies that could not enable us to shake off poverty and backwardness or should we select good policies on the basis of adhering to the four cardinal principles so that the social productive forces could be developed faster? The reform after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was aimed at selecting such good policies." These remarks accurately answered why it was necessary to carry out the second revolution of reform, opening up, and modernization after the victory of the first revolution in our country; and also correspondingly answered why it was necessary for our country and nation to change the "image" for the second time. If the victory of the first revolution in our country was linked with the correct selection of the "doctrine," then the great successes in the second revolution were related to the correct selection of the "policies." In the late eighties and early nineties, socialism with Chinese characteristics could "stand firm" in the changeable international situation, and the fundamental reason was that after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal, our party carried out the second revolution through reselecting policies and rebuilding the institutional structure. The so-called "policy reselection" means the "formulation of new political, economic, and social policies" and a series of other "new principles and policies. The central point was to change from taking class struggle as the key link to taking the development of productive forces as the central task, from being closed to opening up, and from staying in a rut to carrying out reform." The new policies were effective in bringing about the rapid development of the socialist social productive forces in our country. The comprehensive national strength of our country grew to a new level, and the people's living standards were markedly enhanced. Therefore, the policies were supported by the vast majority of the Chinese people. "The people have their personal experience, and their eyes are discerning. In the past, they could not have enough food and clothing; today, they can have not only enough food and clothing, but also modern household appliances. The people are glad." As the first revolution led by our party profoundly changed China's "image," the second revolution led by our party also brought about great changes in the "features" of our country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping often described the new changes in the "image" of our country and nation in a delighted tone and style and expressed the same feelings as the people. For example, he said: "In the more than five years after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, very good changes indeed occurred. The image of our country has changed, and this has been discerned by our people and also noticed by the international community." "The people's livelihood has indeed been improved," "the nation has become more prosperous, and is enjoying higher international prestige." "The features of the whole country are greatly different," and there is a "prosperous scene" everywhere. The people are "faring better year after year." He summed up all such changes by saying that "reform and opening up have actually invigorated China." The invigoration was reflected in all aspects, not only in the ideological aspect, but also in the economic, social, political, and cultural aspects. Invigoration brought about greater dynamism, and dynamism ensures the continuation of life. In the middle of next century, when China achieves the third-stage strategic objective of modernization, China's "image" will undergo the third change, which will be marked by the fact that the Chinese nation will "stand steadfastly among other nations of the world" with a brand-new image of "prosperity, powerfulness, democracy, and civilization." After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping often told people about the bright prospects for China in the middle of next century. He said: "From 1981 to the end of this century, the economy will be quadrupled in 20 years and will reach the level of being comparatively well-off. That is, the annual per capita GNP will increase to $800 to $1,000. On the basis of this achievement, it will increase to $4,000 in another 50 years. What does that mean? That is to say, by the middle of next century, we will reach the level of an intermediately developed country." "It will be a significant matter that a country with a population of 1.5 billion people reaches the level of an intermediately developed country." "It will be extremely unusual if our country is built into an intermediately developed country in a period of 100 years from the founding of the PRC." The revolutionary of the older generation, who had reached an advanced age, always directed his eyes toward the middle of the 21st century. This showed that he was always considering what kind of China should be brought into the 21st century. As mentioned above, the 19th century witnessed China's decline; the 20th century recorded the Chinese nation's struggle for regeneration; while the 21st century will mark the Chinese nation's reinvigoration and prosperity. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed: "Now, people say that marked changes are occurring in China. I told some foreign guests that the current changes are just minor changes. Quadrupling production and reaching the level of being comparatively well-off will just be an intermediate change. The major change will come when we approach the level of a developed nation in the world by the middle of next century." He summarized the essence of the third "image" change, which is of far-reaching significance, in our country and our nation by saying that "since the Chinese people have the ability to stand up, they will certainly have the ability to stand firm among other nations of the world." Thus, we can clearly see that the three changes of great significance in China's "image" in modern history, at present, and in the fifties of the 21st century are mainly reflected in "standing up [zhan qi lai 4541 6386 0171]," "standing firm [zhan zhu le 4541 0145 0055]," and "standing steadfastly among others [kui ran yi li 8354 3544 1473 4539]." This is the general "image" designed by the "chief architect" for our country and nation according to the objective law that governs historical development. II. The Five "Images" With Distinct Chinese Characteristics That China Will Show to the World at Present and in the Future Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only designed the general "image" of our country and nation, but also carefully designed the concrete "image" of contemporary China and future China. The concrete "image" designs fully express his scientific theories and strategic conceptions. Therefore, understanding these concrete "images" will also help us better master the scientific system of his theories. In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concrete designs, contemporary China and future China will mainly show five "images" to the world: First, China "will give an image of reform and opening up to the international community and to the people." This was repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping after the political storm at the turn of spring and summer in 1989. He mentioned this sometimes from the angle of the leading body and sometimes from the angle of leaving an impression with people at home and abroad. For example, he said: "It is necessary to organize a central leading body with the image of reform and opening up so that the people can set their minds at rest." "China must have a leading collective with an image of reform and opening up." He also stressed that China "should give an image of reform and opening up to the international community and to the people, and this is of great importance." It should be pointed out that his remarks were all uttered for the purpose of "giving a political explanation," so they were of unusual significance. Why did China have to always maintain the "image" of reform and opening up? Comrade Deng Xiaoping first considered this according to the state interests and the people's interests. He pointed out that with regard to the general orientation and the major policy of reform and opening up, "the international community was worried that we might backtrack from this" and "the people were worried that we might change this." Therefore, "we should do a number of things to show that our policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged and that we shall further open up more broadly." "It is necessary to give expression to reform and opening up, to large-scale opening up." "There should be opening up on a larger scale than before." "The banner of opening up must be unfurled." Thus, we shall not only "make the people set their minds at rest," but also eliminate various misgivings and conjectures in the international community. In addition, Comrade Xiaoping stressed that China must maintain the "image" of reform and opening according to the viewpoint of acting according to the objective laws. As compared with the period of the Eighth CPC Congress, our party now much more profoundly understands the laws governing socialist construction in our country. For example, we are now aware that "reform is China's second revolution"; "persistently carrying out reform and continuing opening up is a move that determines China's destiny"; "reform and opening up is the only way to develop China's productive forces"; "without upholding socialism, without reform and opening, and without improving the people's livelihood, there will only be a blind alley." All this represents our awareness of the objective regularity. Respecting the objective laws, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly told the whole party that "reform and opening up is a fundamental principle that must not be given up"; "even if there is trouble [feng bo 7364 3134] or big trouble in the future, reform must still be continued; otherwise, there will be no way out in the next decade"; "reform and opening should still be advocated, and should be advocated for several decades"; "an important point is that China must not be turned back into a closed country"; "we must never return to the previous course and stifle the economy"; "if we backtracked to the previous course, we would just return to the condition of poverty and backwardness." He also summarized all this, which represents the understanding of the objective regularity that can be expressed in innumerable words, into two phrases. That is, "carrying out reform without indulging in controversy, and opening up without closing the door." Second, it is necessary to strive to create the "image" of an "economic power." This is also a point that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is always concerned about and has repeatedly stressed. He said many times: "China is a big country and also a small country. Being a big country, it has a huge population and vast territory; being a small country, it remains a developing country and remains rather poor." "China is a small country in real terms and is also a big country in real terms; China is one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council," and this shows that China "is now a political power." "The PRC will become an economic power in not too long a period." The so-called "economic power" means that we shall enhance our comprehensive national strength, "turn a poor China into a comparatively well-off China" and "turn a backward China into a developed China" so that we can "solve the issue of poverty among 1 billion people and solve the development issue of 1 billion people" and can prove the superiority of socialism with facts. When turmoil occurred in some countries, Comrade Deng Xiaoping cool-headedly pointed out: "When these countries were bogged down in turmoil, China was really planning the realization of the second quadrupling, and this was another success of socialism. If we basically realize modernization by the fifties of next century, then we can more definitely announce socialism's successfulness." Of course, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also repeatedly stressed that while creating an "economic power," we do not intend to seek hegemony; instead, we shall fulfill our duties. "We are bearing our responsibilities, and we should be responsible to the one-fifth of the world's population and enable them to live better by developing the economy." He warned us: "Do not boast, we should be more modest as our country is becoming more developed." "China does not seek hegemony now, and will not seek hegemony after it becomes developed in the future." "If China, with a population of 1 billion, does not adhere to a policy of peace, does not oppose hegemonism, or even pursues hegemonism as its economy becomes developed, that would be a disaster for the world and would be retrogression in history." Third, it is necessary to "give an image of stability and unity to the international community and to people at home." Therefore, we repeatedly stressed the need to establish the image of stability and unity, and this is first of all based on historical experience. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We should let foreigners see that China is stable. If the country is made chaotic and disintegrated, will there still be any hope? In the past, the imperialists bullied us because our nation was just like a sheet of loose sand." Second, stressing stability and unity is also based on the lesson drawn from the negative experience in reality. At present, some countries in the world are bogged down in endless turmoil and civil war, and we learn a lesson from their negative experience and we know that a nation cannot make advances in turmoil, and development is possible only in a stable environment. At present, "China is situated in the process of economic development and in this period attention must be concentrated on economic development." "In order to realize the four modernizations in China and to free China from poverty and backwardness, we must have a political situation of unity and stability and must ensure that construction is being conducted in an orderly way under effective leadership. Any trouble in society may prevent us from concentrating on economic construction." If there are demonstrations, debates, and big posters in the streets from time to time, people will not be able to concentrate their energy on construction. Moreover, if any trouble and unrest occur in society, the domestic situation will become unstable, and "foreign funds will not come into our country. We should more strictly exercise control in this regard. This will not affect foreign investment; on the contrary, foreign investors will become more confident." In this sense, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "We handled a number of people who advocated liberalization and violated the criminal law several years ago. China's image was not harmed; instead, our reputation is getting better day by day." Stability and unity includes the two aspects of stability and unity. Stability [an ding 1344 1353] is a matter in society as a whole, and this is sometimes also called steadiness [wen ding 4489 1353]. In this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping uttered a lot of remarks. For example, he said: "It is necessary to issue a signal to show that no turmoil is allowed in China." "Stability is an overwhelming requirement." He also said: "We must eliminate all factors that oppose our taking, and obstruct us from taking, the socialist road and all factors that may cause chaos or even turmoil for China." As for unity, this is mainly a matter within the decisionmaking body and within the leadership, especially the central leading core. Comrade Deng Xiaoping stated seriously that in China, "the most important thing is to maintain a united leading core." "As long as no problem occurs in this link, China will be as stable as the Tai Shan. The international community will not look down on us, and more and more people will come to China to make investment." "As long as the leading collective is united and insists on reform and opening up, even if we develop stably for several decades, China will still undergo a fundamental change." We should give deep thought to all these earnest instructions. Fourth, it is necessary to keep the image of developing the two civilizations in a well-coordinated way. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's designing of the image of our country and nation was comprehensive. He said that the superiority of socialism should be brought into play in all aspects, and required that we "should not only boost economic development, but should also improve public order and public conduct." Only when the two civilizations surpass capitalist society can this be called socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to this basic point of view, he not only deeply hated the phenomena that smeared the national dignity and personal dignity, slurred the "image" of socialism and the "image" of our country and nation, but also repeatedly demanded that the whole party adopt severe measures to suppress and prevent such phenomena. He stressed the need to continuously "eliminate various ugly and evil phenomena" and "resolutely resist and eliminate the phenomena of corruption." The phenomena of greed, corruption, and unfairness and such things as drug-consumption, prostitution, and economic crime must not be allowed to exist and spread in China. Our youngsters must not be captured by bourgeois ideology. He pointed out in a clear-cut way that "spiritual pollution must not be allowed on the front of ideology," and "the situation in which young people are being influenced by the decadent culture of the Western bourgeoisie must not be tolerated any longer." He stressed that efforts should be made to develop spiritual civilization and to foster a new generation of socialist people "with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education, and a sense of discipline." In view of the situation of "paying attention only to material civilization while neglecting spiritual civilization" before the 4 June Incident, he repeatedly stressed the need to "promote both civilizations at the same time by doing effective work [liang shou zhua liang shou dou yao ying 0357 2087 2119 0357 2087 6757 6008 4289]." Fifth, it is necessary to "safeguard our image of being independent and being unafraid of evil spirits [bu xin xie bu pa gui 0008 0207 6723 0008 1830 7607]." Comrade Deng Xiaoping mentioned this point as a basic principle for China's foreign policy, and took it as our nation's lofty aspiration. He repeatedly mentioned that being independent and self-reliant is our foothold in the past, at present, and in the future. He also stressed that China is now a poor country, but why can it hold the position of a pole in the multipolar pattern of the world? Because we do not act according to other peoples' orders and do not sit on other people's chariots; instead, we are an independent country. "Why do we say that we are independent? Because we insist on the socialist road with Chinese characteristics." Persisting in independence and self-determination is closely linked with the position of opposing hegemonism and power politics. In the late eighties and early nineties, there was a furious countercurrent in the world, and the imperialist Western world tried to force us to give up socialism and slide into the capitalist road through peaceful evolution, thus finally subjecting ourselves to the rule of international monopoly capital. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out sternly out of a sense of justice: "Now, we must resist the countercurrent with a clear-cut attitude." "China can never be intimidated." "Those who try to interfere with us and threaten us will eventually fail. The Chinese people have self-confidence, and a sense of inferiority will get us nowhere. In the past, our nation felt itself inferior for more than a century, and stood up under the leadership of the CPC. The huge monster is rather frightening, we Chinese people are not afraid of it." "The Chinese people are not afraid of being isolated and will not be frightened by evil spirits." "In the world, China is the nation that is the least afraid of isolation, blockades, and sanctions." He required of the whole party and the entire people throughout the country that "we must not be weak." It was against such a background that Comrade Deng Xiaoping called for "keeping the image of being independent and being unafraid of evil spirits." During the past years, the sanctions imposed by the West on our country have been broken through, and this fully demonstrated the power of our policy of being independent and being unafraid of evil spirits. In the future, we must continue to pass on the fearless national spirit from generation to generation as the mental force of our nation, and should safeguard our nation's independence and continue to be unafraid of evil spirits, external pressure, and threats at any time, thus making indomitable efforts to reinvigorate our great nation.
