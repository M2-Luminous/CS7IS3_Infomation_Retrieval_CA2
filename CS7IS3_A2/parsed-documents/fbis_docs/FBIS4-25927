On 10 June, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] decided to suspend its assistance to the DPRK [chao xian 2600 7639], and the United States and others advocated economic and military sanctions. The DPRK reacted strongly to this. On 13 June, it announced it would immediately withdraw from the IAEA. The Korean nuclear issue is long-standing. After the Gulf war, the United States, using its satellite photos as proof, said that it suspected there were facilities in the DPRK's Yongbyon district, about 100 km north of Pyongyang, used for the development of nuclear weapons, claiming inspections of the DPRK's nuclear facilities must be carried out. The DPRK repeatedly declared that it had no intention to produce nuclear weapons nor did it have the capability to do so. At the same time, it accused the United States of deploying nuclear weapons to the ROK [han guo 7281 0948] to threaten its security. The two sides have since become antagonistic toward each other. Only later, after the DPRK and the ROK signed the "Joint Declaration on Denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula" and the DPRK signed a nuclear safety agreement with the IAEA and agreed to accept inspections, did the tense atmosphere on the peninsula somewhat ease. During the period between May 1992 and February last year, the DPRK received unscheduled nuclear inspections from the IAEA on six occasions. However, the two sides disagreed on the targets and inspection results. In February last year, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution to carry out mandatory "special inspections" on the DPRK's nuclear facilities. At the same time, the United States and the ROK resumed their joint military exercise, "Team Spirit," which had been suspended in 1992. In light of this, the DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 its withdrawal from the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]," which it had joined at the end of 1985. The situation on the peninsula thus became tense again. Under these circumstances, the United States held two rounds of vice foreign ministerial talks with the DPRK and made promises on the question of assisting the DPRK in remodeling its nuclear facilities. The DPRK subsequently announced that it would not withdraw from the "NPT" for the time being. During their talks, both sides agreed to hold a third round of talks within two months to discuss settlement of the nuclear issue and improvement of bilateral relations. However, because of differences over a number of issues between the two sides, the third round of talks were not held. It was not until the last 10 days of February this year did the DPRK reach a compromise with the IAEA and the United States: The DPRK agrees to receive inspections of its seven nuclear facilities; the South and North resume contact on the exchange of special envoys; the United States and the ROK agree to stop this year's joint military exercise; and the United States agrees to hold the third high-level talks with the DPRK. At the same time, the United States also put forward two conditions, namely the IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities be acceptable to all parties and the South and North realize the exchange of special envoys. After these two conditions were essentially met, the situation on the peninsula became further eased. As a result, there was another inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by the IAEA in early March this year. However, the IAEA was not satisfied with the inspection results, which led to the sharpening of differences among the concerned parties. During the last 10 days of April, the DPRK told the IAEA that it wanted to replace the fuel rods in its five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and invited it to send personnel to the site to supervise the replacement. However, while expressing a cautious welcome, the IAEA again set preconditions, asking the DPRK to accept its all-out inspection of its nuclear facilities and operation process. The DPRK did not accept this demand. In early May, after the IAEA indicated that it would not send personnel to the DPRK to supervise the replacement, the DPRK went ahead and replaced the nuclear fuel rods by itself. The IAEA held that the DPRK's action made it impossible to determine whether the plutonium produced by the nuclear reactor had been diverted for other uses. The DPRK, on the other hand, stressed that its replacement of the nuclear fuel rods was monitored by the IAEA's monitoring device installed at its nuclear reactor and waste facilities, and that its replacement method fully preserved the technical possibility for later measurements. The serious difference over this issue between the IAEA and the DPRK has drastically chilled the eased atmosphere on the peninsula. In wake of the IAEA's recent announcement that it would suspend its assistance, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement saying the DPRK deems all IAEA resolutions null and void; that it will not accept continuous nuclear safety inspection, which it accepted when it was placed under special status; and that it again declared that it regards UN sanctions as a declaration of war against the DPRK. The origin and development of the Korean nuclear issue shows that the issue can only be resolved through sincere dialogue by all parties concerned; sanctions and confrontation can only aggravate the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.
