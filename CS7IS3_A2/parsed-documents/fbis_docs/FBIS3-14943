In an interview with Interfax on Monday, he said such a judgment was the prerogative of the CC as a whole and that being only one of its members he had no authority to consider or discuss it with the press on his own. At the same time, Zorkin said that away from judgments, any parliamentary act was mandatory for execution unless rescinded in a proper way. In his view, the noise over the amnesty resolution only helped fuel confrontation. Zorkin said that in a civilized country, any official regardless of rank could have been sacked if he had opposed a mass media law in public. But in Russia, he said, "parliamentary acts are immediately pilloried by those who are called upon to hold them sacred and execute them at once".
