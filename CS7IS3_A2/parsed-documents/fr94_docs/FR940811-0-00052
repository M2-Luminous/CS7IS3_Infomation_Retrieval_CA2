FR940811-0-00052 FR940811-0-00019 It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). EPA believes that any impact that this amendment will have on the regulated community will serve only to provide relief from otherwise applicable regulations, and will therefore limit the negative economic impact associated with the regulations previously promulgated under Section 604. An examination of the impacts on small entities was discussed in the final rule (58 FR 65018). That final rule assessed the impact the rule may have on small entities. A separate regulatory impact analysis accompanied the final rule and is contained in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;50. I certify that this amendment to the accelerated phaseout rule will not have any additional negative economic impacts on any small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act Any information collection requirements in a rule must be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Because no additional informational collection requirements are required by this amendment, EPA has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this rulemaking and no new Information Collection Request document has been prepared.
