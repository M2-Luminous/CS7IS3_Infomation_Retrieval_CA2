The authors of this legislation -- members of the Georgian parliament's legal commission -- today commented on this document during a press conference in Tbilisi. Journalists were told that the adoption of the new law was dictated by two factors. Firstly, the Georgian law enforcement bodies are now unable to ensure the protection and safety of every citizen and his home. Secondly, the republic is, literally speaking, flooded with weapons, and the new law will allow the authorities to control them to some extent and to regulate the production, sale, and storage of pistols and revolvers. Georgia will apparently draw on Russia's weapon-making potential, primarily on the Tula and Izhevsk plants, famous for their top-quality pistols and revolvers. At the same time, the law allows the Georgian Government to issue licences to legal persons not only to purchase and sale wholesale consignments of short-barrel weapons, but also to manufacture them. All the citizens of Georgia, upon reaching the age of 18, will be entitled to purchase and possess weapons if they are able-bodied, sane, not addicted to drugs or alcohol, and "socially reliable," i.e. normally disposed towards neighbours and the society as a whole. However, the law regulates the calibre and barrel length of the weapons, as well as their other tactical-technical characteristics. The organisers of the press conference assured the journalists that all the necessary regulatory enactments would be ready before 15 May, which is rather dubious, of course.
