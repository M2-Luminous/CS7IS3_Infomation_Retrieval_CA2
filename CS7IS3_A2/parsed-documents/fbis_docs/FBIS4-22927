Pavlov Institute. It established the specific neurohumoral factors capable, if injected to intact animals, of inducing motor disorders similar to those of the donor. There factors became known that the postural asymmetry factors (FPA) present in the cerebrospinal fluid (TsSZh). Special studies reveal that the postural asymmetry factor activity is blocked by a high-molecular peptide factor referred to as the inactivation factor (FI). The role of the specific brain peptide factors in the pathogenesis of, and compensation for, neurological disorders and the outlook for using them in the nervous disease treatment are investigated, and a new method is proposed on the basis of the experimental and theoretical work of Institute personnel (which have been issued patent No. 365 on 11 May 89 by the State Committee on Inventions and Discoveries). The method is based on using the donor liquor from patients who have convalesced well. To this end, the clinical effectiveness of the proposed method was examined using a contingent of patients with rather severe disorders; the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with a good recovery history was used as the donor liquor. The conclusion is drawn that liquor therapy is a promising treatment method for some disorders and that the hypothesis that the ligands search for the liquor of own receptors can be confirmed. It is noted that basic research into the molecular-chemical mechanisms of pathogenetic and compensatory brain processes make it possible not only to widen the scope of theoretical notions in the field of neuropathology but also to use them effectively in clinical practices.
