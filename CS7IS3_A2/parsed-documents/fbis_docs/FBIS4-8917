The letter unfortunately vindicates our decision to reexamine our relations with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], Karadzic said at a news conference in Pale, adding that the Serbian soldiers need to know clearly whether UNPROFOR is an enemy or not. "We most seriously suggest to the United Nations that it make the security zones as secure as possible, demilitarize them, and prevent the Muslims from attacking Serbian positions from the protected zones. But, if they want to wage a war we will defend ourselves in every possible way," Karadzic said. Asked what he expects from Russia, Karadzic said he still does not know whether Butrus-Ghali's letter will go through the UN Security Council at all or not, nor what decision will be passed. "In any case we rely on our own resources and we are ready and convinced that we can defend ourselves," Karadzic stressed. Most questions related to the situation in and around Gorazde. Karadzic repeated several times that the Serbian forces will not occupy the town center of Gorazde. "We could have done it, but we want to make Gorazde a protected zone. This means that it has to be demilitarized and that peacekeeping forces should be deployed -- in order to separate the forces -- in a 3-km zone on the left bank, which is the Muslim part," the RS president said, adding that this could be implemented, as far as the Serbs are concerned, as early as today. "The left bank [of the Drina] is much more peaceful than Muslim radio and their radio hams are reporting. They are dramatizing the situation with the intention of provoking a reaction by the international community, while at the same time Muslim forces are attacking us on the right bank, launching infantry attacks using boats," Karadzic said, adding that he is receiving reports on the situation in Gorazde every hour. The Muslims, however, do not want to stop firing, Karadzic added. He said that he hopes that the Serbs will this evening establish a cease-fire and that the Muslims will have to accept this. He rejected accusations that the Serbs are to blame for the "catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gorazde and the attacks on civilian targets." Representatives of international organizations in Gorazde are misinforming the public under pressure from the Muslim forces, the RS president said, and pointed out that the state leadership of the RS is maintaining contacts with Yasushi Akashi and the political sector of UNPROFOR. "We only want to protect ourselves against Muslim attacks from the protected zones, and if the United Nations does not want to do this, we will make Gorazde into a safe zone," Karadzic said. Commenting on a statement made yesterday by Alija Izetbegovic that the Muslims would go for "everything or nothing," because the Serbs had gone for everything or nothing and that they would "gain nothing", Karadzic said: "The Serbs most definitely did not go for nothing, but did not go for everything either. We went for what is ours, to defend our interests. If the Muslims decide to go for everything or nothing, the international community must adopt an attitude toward that." Dwelling on a remark made by special Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin, Karadzic said that Churkin is a very good diplomat. "We have recently been under the same pressure and I think that this remark came as a result of an emotional reaction. I think we can forget that," Karadzic said.
