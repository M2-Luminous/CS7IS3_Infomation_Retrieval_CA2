FBIS3-11736 "drlat058_c_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 MEXICO Roundup of Domestic Reaction to Assassination PA2403202494 PA2403202494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reactions within Mexico to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, which occurred on 23 March in Tijuana, Baja California. A report by Mabel Montoya indicates that the PRI's future has become uncertain following Colosio's assassination. According to the law, the party's National Executive Committee has the authority to hold another extraordinary convention to select a new candidate. Political analysts are saying it is too early to discuss this issue because the assassination has caused considerable consternation within the Mexican community and people are hesitant to mention possible candidates. The country's eight remaining parties have unanimously condemned the assassination and have suspended their campaigns until the situation normalizes. Meanwhile, Popular Socialist Party candidate Marcela Lombardo has accused the conservatives of promoting incidents like Colosio's assassination to hinder Mexico's "return to the path of the revolution." Mexican business representatives have pointed out that the assassination is the result of efforts to destabilize the country, and warn that it may disrupt Mexico's political life. Political commentators are saying that Colosio's death will have repercussions in every sphere of the country's political and economic life, affecting its stability and credibility.

They say, however, that it may slow down the flow of foreign investments, which is one of the main requirements of NAFTA. Our sources said the assassination will cause a panic in the stock market, which will stabilize once a new candidate is chosen. They add that if the PRI loses the elections, NAFTA will not be threatened by the opposition parties, which have said they will not annul it but will modify it. However, if instability increases, NAFTA opponents in the United States may request a revision of the agreement or even its annulment. Some experts believe the exchange rate may also decrease due to a lack of investments. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1922 GMT 24 Mar 94)
