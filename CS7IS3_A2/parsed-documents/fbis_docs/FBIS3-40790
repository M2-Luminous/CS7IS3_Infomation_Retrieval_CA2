Singapore is understood to have shown interest in the PTA, named Lakshya, which has been jointly produced by the Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Rajendra Radar, with a C3-I (command control communication and intelligence) configuration, is undergoing trials and is scheduled to be set for induction by the end of next year. The LCA is scheduled to roll out in March 1995 and test flown for the first time at Bangalore in June 1996. From the defence point of view, the air show proved to be a lacklustre affair with a token aircraft representation of two Mirage 2000C, multi-role fighters of the French Air Force. Neither Russia, which is India's largest source of defence equipment and military aircraft, nor the United States or any other western country had flown in any type of defence aircraft for either air or static display. For example, there was neither the much promised Russian Su 27 long-range interceptor nor either of the U.S. multi-role F-15/F-16 multirole aircraft. The only other military aircraft for static and air display was the heavy lift Transol transport aircraft, also belonging to the French Air Force. Even the Indian Air Force was not adequately represented at the air show providing for merely fly-pasts of two types of fighters--the Jaguar and MiG 29, and three types of choppers--Cheetah, Chetak and the Mi-8. The air display was inaugurated by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul. The Indian Navy was more effectively represented by a magnificent air display of the Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) capable Sea Harrier of British origin and the Ka-28, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter of Russian origin. The Navy even managed a fly-past of the impressive long-bodied TU 142 long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft of Russian origin. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited displayed a variety of both indigenously developed and foreign collaborated helicopters and fighter and transport aircraft. The Army and air force version of the HAL manufactured Advance Light Helicopter (ALH) provided both a fly-past and air display. However, the only modern aircraft that formed part of the HAL's static display inventory was the Jaguar, a deep penetration strike aircraft (DPSA) of British origin. The others were the Indian-manufactured Kiran jet trainer, the HPT 32 basic trainer, the German origined Dornier 228 transport aircraft, the phased-out Gnat and Marut fighters, and the Chetak light helicopter. The most dynamic and heart-stopping performance in the otherwise unimpressive air display was that of the Mirage 2000C flown by French Air Force pilots. The mid-air combat manoeuvre by the fighter version of the Mirage 2000C left the public and defense officials gaping. The manoeuvres involved the French pilot stretching himself up to 9g in side and vertical combat manoeuvres and over -2g in an outward combat manoeuvre. The other static display of interest was a full-scale mock-up of the upgraded version of the MiG 21 (bis) redesignated as the MiG-21-93. However, the aircraft has the same engine and air frame although its avionics, weapon delivery system and weaponry are comparable with the state-of-the-art MiG-29 air superiority interceptor. Interestingly, the Israeli Aircraft Industry (IAI) had set up a mock-up display of an upgraded cockpit of a MiG-21 (bis), redesignated the MiG-21-2000, in its indoor stall fitted with an avionics and weapon systems claiming to be even more superior to the Russian package.
