Formally, membership applications have been submitted only by Albania and Lithuania; the efforts of the Vysegrad Group, which are equally firm, have been confined to diplomacy. Poland's stand on this issue, which is today unequivocal and firm, gradually evolved. At the beginning of the democratic transformations, when the Warsaw Pact was still in place, Poland's efforts focused mainly on the difficult negotiations of confirming the borders with the unifying Germany. Soon afterward, during his visit to the Federal Republic of Germany, President Lech Walesa proposed establishing an eastern NATO in our part of Europe. Also the defense minister in the Olszewski government made an unequivocal statement on Poland's need to ensure security by joining NATO. The Suchocka government considered this to be its strategic goal; the Waldemar Pawlak cabinet seems to continue this policy. Last summer, when Boris Yeltsin assured Lech Walesa that Russia Would Not Stop Poland from implementing this goal, it seemed that all we had to do was wait for an invitation from the other side. The situation, however, was aggravated by a change in Moscow's stance, especially by recent statements of Russian politicians. Their overtones awakened fears of a new Yalta. Last week's interviews given by Lech Walesa to the Western press and television prove Poland's determination. In an interview for the Italian daily LA STAMPA, the president cautioned against the menace of a new confrontation between the East and the West in a cold-war style. "The East European states must be admitted to the West European Union and NATO; otherwise, Russia will seek to regain its influences in this region," he said. In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, he criticized the American plan of "Partnership for Peace," saying that it is excellent, but after 50 years of communism it does not fit the present reality. He said that the West needs us, and not we need the West, and he added that it is a great mistake to leave a vacuum after overthrowing the communist system, because it may Awaken Demons "We cannot speak about a partnership, because for the time being, there is no partnership to be seen; there is Russia, which is threatening; there is the West, which is scared; finally, in the middle there is us, who are saying: There is nothing to be afraid of; all that needs to be done is only increase physically and technically Eastern Europe's resources," stated the president in an interview for the American television network ITN, the German ARD, and the UPI Agency. In the latter interview the president informed that NATO and the West "are actually governed by Yeltsin." The definite majority of the Polish political parties, despite earlier subtleties concerning Poland's integration with NATO, see this as a possibility for gaining security guarantees for Poland. This is a result of political developments in Russia as well as a lack of a clear response of the West. Politicians both of the left side and of the right side of the political scene fear the same: "I can see two dangers: First, the reviving Russian nationalism; second, the lack of understanding in the West for the role of Poland in the system of European security," admits Romuald Szeremietiew, chairman of the Movement for the Republic [RdR]. "We should be worried by the inability to predict what will happen behind our eastern border. It is still unclear What Is Actually Going On There Also our Western partners do not have a full understanding for our affairs, as a result of which our situation is similar to being suspended in a vacuum, to some kind of a "gray zone," says Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance. In the election campaign the left was rather reserved in its opinions concerning integration with NATO. Today Szmajdzinski points to the necessity of changing the nature of this organization and Poland's need to seek security in a future system of European security; he also concedes that in the past four years Polish diplomacy has been expressing Polish state interests very well. He believes, however, that our relations with the East were neglected at that time, which is now bearing fruit. Piotr Nowina-Konopka of the Democratic Union [UD] is afraid of chaos in the area of the former Soviet Union, which may ricochet and hit us. "I am also alarmed by the crisis of European identity. The West simply does not have an idea as to how to organize the world after the Berlin wall collapsed." These words of the UD politician are also supported by Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party. He adds one more danger: Economic Nationalism "For us the situation in the east will be relatively stable -- if Yeltsin remains president. If he were forced to step down, the advocates of an imperial policy would have a greater say. The center of Europe would not be a quiet place also if any authoritarian options were to be employed. Even though our goal is still membership in NATO, it is clear that they do not want us there in the present formula -- we are not a very attractive partner," adds Piechocinski. Romuald Szeremietiew thought that our dowry and a strong argument for developing our relations with NATO and the West would be the fact of building the Vysegrad treaty, showing that the states that are part of it are taking care of their security themselves. The RdR leader says that it is bad that one state after another departs from this way of thinking; he calls this a silly matter. He thinks highly of recent efforts of the president and Minister Andrzej Olechowski. "I am satisfied with the fact that everyone is unanimous in saying that we must join NATO. I wish that political forces of both the right and the left wing would be able to Define the Canon of the Interests of the State of Poland. This should not be affected in any way by changes of governments or any political quarrels," he adds. Only the Christian-Democratic Union [ZChN] is not in the unanimous choir of political parties; it claims that Poland should be a member of various kinds of European structures, but it must be done in line with the rules of partnership. "We cannot be treated as a poor relative," says ZChN Deputy Chairman Ryszard Czarnecki. He says that the prospect of Poland's joining NATO is rather remote. "The evaluation of our participation in the organization depends on what roles we would be supposed to fulfill in it." "The role of a sanitary cordon, or that of a bulwark, is not really what we want. Now, knocking on NATO's windows, which other parties are doing, is embarrassing and we will not take part in that," says Czarnecki.
