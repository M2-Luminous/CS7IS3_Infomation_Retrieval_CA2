The embassy last week presented a note of protest to the Foreign Ministry concerning Ozolas' statements in the Vilnius-based LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper. The lawmaker accused Jan Widacki, Polish ambassador to Lithuania, of "organizing active polonization" in Lithuania and called him "a Polish security employee." The Polish embassy announced on Tuesday [8 March] that the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry expressed regret about the lawmaker's statements. At a press conference Wednesday, Ozolas said he will meet Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys to discuss the incident. In Ozolas' words, Polish newspapers wrote about Widacki's previous career. The lawmaker said he has documents to prove that the ambassador lectured in a Polish school of security officers. Hence, Ozolas said, it is possible to maintain that Widacki worked for the Polish security. The Lithuanian lawmaker said he will hand over these documents to Jurgis Jurgelis, head of the Lithuanian National Security Service. Ozolas said the policy of the Lithuanian Government is surprising because Lithuania consents to the appointment of foreign ambassadors without paying any attention to their past. The lawmaker said the recently appointed Belarusian ambassador is a former employee of the KGB. "I understand the interest of Belarus and Poland to appoint ambassadors who have experience of work in security systems, but I do not understand Lithuania's position."
