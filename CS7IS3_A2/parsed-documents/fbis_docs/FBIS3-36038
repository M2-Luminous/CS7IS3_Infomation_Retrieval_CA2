The editing commission made 173 amendments to the draft. Two amendments were made by the Russian president. He proposed that the upper chamber should take into account, when voting, the total number of Federation Council members (178 under the constitution) and not the number of elected legislators (171) if the chamber votes on such decisions as release from the posts of upper chamber speaker and his depties as well as elections of members of upper chamber committees. The presidential amendments were turned down. The Federation Council continues discussing the draft regulations, and, to all appearances, the debate will take the rest of the day.
