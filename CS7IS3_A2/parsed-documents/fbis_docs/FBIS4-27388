As an initial step, regulation of the floor space and number of foreign automobile sales outlets will be removed and restrictions on foreign car advertisement lifted in the foreseeable future. A government trade official said on Tuesday the government would also positively mull lowering automobile import tariffs and refix other taxes on imported vehicles. A comprehensive motor market opening plan will be prepared shortly through consultations among relevant offices so that it could be presented to U.S. negotiators at a Korea-U.S. economic council meeting slated for June 22 in the United States. The official noted that originally control of the floor space and number of foreign automobile sales outlets is set to be removed completely in January 1996 under the five-year investment opening plan made public last year. "But, we have tentatively agreed to move up the time of the removal to the most possible extent in view of the U.S. demand for the opening of the automobile market," he said. However, conflicting views have been aired among offices as to the issue of whether to reduce automobile tariffs and readjust other taxes on imported vehicles, the official added.
