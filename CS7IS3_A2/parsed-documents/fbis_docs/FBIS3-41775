Can It Be Avoided?''; first paragraph is boldface IZVESTIYA introduction] [Text] According to the most restrained World Health Organization forecasts, if prevention is not significantly intensified, at least 30-40 million men, women, and children throughout the entire planet will be infected with HIV by the year 2000. At a Riga meeting of health and finance ministers from 35 European countries that was organized by the European regional office of the World Health Organization, the latest statistics regarding development of the AIDS epidemic in the region were made public. Among the East European countries, Romania heads the sad list of number of recorded cases per 100,000 population. Following after it are Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, a number of countries, and only then the Russian Federation. Not long ago, our specialists in communicable diseases even expressed cautious optimism regarding the slow development of events. ``In Southern Asia,'' said Michael Merson, director of the World Health Organization's global program for fighting AIDS, ``the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift paces as in Africa at the end of the 1970s. A half million inhabitants of Asia are now infected. And six years ago the number of those known to be infected was in the single digits. This happened largely because of the naive assumption that people in Asia are immune to AIDS. If all possible measures are not taken now, a tragedy may play out in Central and East European.'' On the basis of other countries' experience, a silent, hidden epidemic initially proceeds for about 10 years. Then comes an overt epidemic, where infections and patients are recorded every hour of every day. It has been emphasized that if resources are not invested in preventing HIV infection now, the subsequent swift development of events will be simply impossible to manage. As Luxemburg's Minister of Health has put it, ``Pay now or pay later.'' Specialists from the World Bank participated in the meeting, which was called ``Investments in Health Protection.'' They are now working out a decision regarding how much money to invest in preventing HIV infection. Doctor Antonio Campos, the World Bank's chief specialist in health care investment, stated, ``Expenditures to prevent AIDS are not at all unprofitable. On the contrary, they are among the most profitable types of capital investments that the world community can make. The point is that on this very day, the epidemic is incapacitating the young and most capable members of society. According to today's estimates, direct health care costs in connection with AIDS in 1992 totaled $5 billion throughout the world. If the indirect costs of the epidemic are taken into account, that figure must be multiplied by 10. And that still does not include the economic losses.'' The future largely depends on today's efforts. In development of the epidemic, East European is lagging 5-6 years. And it is especially important that this time be used effectively because the economies of most countries in the region are not in the best condition. What kind of resources must be invested in preventing an epidemic in Central and East European? About $248 million is needed to provide the public with condoms and market them. The costs of treating patients amount to about $151 million. Measures regarding ``sex industry'' workers and their clients will cost about $48 million. Public health education in schools will cost a bit less, about $46 million. Among other items of expenditure, the following should be noted: preventing in-hospital infection ($25 million); running a mass media campaign ($15 million); guaranteeing the safety of blood and blood products; preventing infection among drug addicts, and developing national programs. These are approximate figures. Participating in the meeting were the Baltic countries, Russia, and virtually all other states of the CIS -- Ukraine, Byelarus, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Ilona Kikbush [transliteration], a department director of the World Health Organization, said that for the first time, physicians and financial experts were discussing the problems of AIDS together. This was dictated by the very logic of life: In keeping society healthy, the medical community is far from the sole and main player. Experts from Switzerland and England talked about their interesting experience. There is a very strong preconceived opinion that it is impossible to affect anything connected with sexual bias. Switzerland's experience says otherwise. As a result of an active campaign, 60 percent of the country's young people use condoms (only one third of that amount did previously). The campaign in the Swiss mass media was run under the slogan: Be faithful to your partner or to a condom. There is a popular picture postcard where a condom is, please forgive me, in place of the sun. Perhaps this material will seem frivolous to someone. The life of several generations is at risk, however. It is therefore necessary to have open and frank talks with children and youths, so that this is not interpreted as bawdiness. There is the opinion that early teaching of knowledge about sex life education in schools will push children to very early sex. On the contrary, in reality, children and adolescents with whom sex has been seriously discussed are in no hurry to begin swimming in the ``sea of love.'' Among children who have been prepared, there is a decrease in the number of adolescent pregnancies and in the number of HIV infections. Who knows, perhaps, the infected child who drew himself and wrote ``I'm infected...Hug me, I am not dangerous!'' may have been born that way out of someone's fear of explaining the consequences of unsafe sex...The drawing has become a popular banner in many countries. The meeting participants erected a small column on one of Riga's streets. It was made of stones with the names of people from different countries who have died of AIDS. A stone commemorating the event was also laid alongside the Domskiy Cathedral. The following reminder was sounded again and again in the speeches of the delegates from the different countries: No one form of sexual behavior should be considered criminal. Not one of those persons infected or ill should be subjected to ostracism and discrimination. The meeting participants approved a document entitled the ``Riga Initiative.'' It is a call for active action and a program of special measures to prevent an AIDS epidemic in Central and East European in 1993-1996. The document pays serious attention to protecting the dignity of infected and ill persons, adhering to the principles of physicians' ethics, and complete confidentiality of tests and treatment.
