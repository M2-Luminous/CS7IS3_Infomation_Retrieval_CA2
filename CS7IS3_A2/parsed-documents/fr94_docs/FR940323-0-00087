FR940323-0-00087 FR940323-0-00022 Wednesday March 23, 1994 Part VI Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rules Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 56␣/␣Wednesday, March 23, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC41 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reclassification of the Sacramento River Winter-Run Chinook Salmon From Threatened to Endangered Status AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Service is reclassifying the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) from threatened to endangered status. This measure, required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), reflects a final determination of endangered status by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction for the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Jamie Rappaport Clark, Chief, Division of Endangered Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Mail Stop 452, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358&hyph;2171). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, is responsible for the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. Under section 4(a)(2)(A) of the Act, NMFS must decide whether a species under its jurisdiction should be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is responsible for the actual addition of a species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 50 CFR 17.11(h). NMFS published its determination of endangered status for the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon on January 4, 1994 (59 FR 440). Accordingly, the FWS is revising the status of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon from threatened to endangered on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Because this action of the FWS is nondiscretionary, and in view of the public comment period provided by NMFS on the proposed reclassification (June 19, 1992; 57 FR 27416), the FWS finds that good cause exists to omit the notice and public comment procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and to make this action effective on March 23, 1994.
