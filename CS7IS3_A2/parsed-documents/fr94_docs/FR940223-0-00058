FR940223-0-00058 FR940223-0-00022 Definitions Business PMCPs A business PMCPs is defined as any entity involved in the interstate transportation of passengers; the transportation provided is in the furtherance of the entity's commercial purpose, which is not for-hire transportation; and the transportation is not available to the general public. The FHWA believes that any business entity transporting people should meet the same minimum safety requirements as those businesses involved in the private transportation of property. Therefore, these carriers must comply with the entire body of the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping. These carriers need not comply with the road and written test requirements of part 391, since these requirements are essentially met by acquiring a CDL with proper bus endorsements. In addition, these carriers need not comply with the fuel system requirements of ยง393.67, provided the carrier's commercial motor vehicle fuel systems have been maintained and meet the original manufacturer's standards. Nonbusiness PMCPs A nonbusiness PMCPs is any entity involved in the interstate transportation of passengers, other than for-hire, and does not meet the definition of a business PMCPs. These carriers will be subject to parts 383, 385 (requiring a Motor Carrier Identification Report), 390, 391 (excluding subpart H and recordkeeping requirements), 392, 393 (excluding fuel systems that have been maintained and meet the original manufacturer's standards), 395 (excluding the recordkeeping requirements), and 396 (excluding the recordkeeping requirements). Churches, civic associations, scouts, and other charitable institutions that may purchase or lease buses for sponsored activities are included in this category. The special treatment afforded nonbusiness carriers is not to relieve churches or civic associations from compliance with any of the safety regulations when these carriers arrange tours for the public at large and charge a fee with the intent to make a profit. In this instance, nonbusiness carriers are in fact performing transportation services as for-hire carriers. When engaged in chartering operations, the transportation service is the primary activity of the organization and such charter service is not incidental to the non-transportation purposes of the organization. Such activities are and will continue to be treated as for-hire transportation of passengers, subject to all the FMCSRs. Driver and Carrier Requirements Business PMCPs These carriers must meet all of the driver recordkeeping requirements in part 391, except for the road and written test requirements, which are essentially met by acquiring a CDL with proper bus endorsements. This recordkeeping requirement includes maintaining all documents required in a driver qualification file and drug testing documentation. These carriers must also comply with the recordkeeping requirements in part 395 regarding drivers' records of duty status. Consistent with past FHWA practice, a one-time exemption for currently employed drivers is provided in this rulemaking. The recordkeeping requirements, including application for employment (ยง391.21), investigation and inquiries (ยง391.23), and notifications of previous employment (ยง383.35), will not apply to those drivers regularly employed by a motor carrier prior to July 1, 1994 and for as long as the person continues to be regularly employed as a driver for that motor carrier. Nonbusiness PMCPs Nonbusiness PMCPs must comply with the driving and on-duty hours limitation contained in part 395. The costs associated with requiring record retention by these motor carriers, who operate sporadically, would outweigh the benefits and, accordingly, the FHWA will not impose the recordkeeping requirements of part 395 on these carriers. It is recognized that some individuals who volunteer to drive for their church or civic organization may also drive for other motor carriers and in that capacity are required to maintain a record of duty status (driver logs). All on-duty and driving time, performed in a volunteer capacity by an individual who is otherwise regularly employed as a commercial driver, for a nonbusiness PMCP must be recorded on the records of duty-status submitted to that driver's regularly employing motor carrier. On duty and driving time for those drivers regularly employed must be considered in determining whether the driver has adequate time to drive as a volunteer, and vice-versa. The FHWA believes this requirement is necessary to ensure that a fatigued driver is not permitted or required to drive beyond the hours of service limits. These carriers are not required to have their drivers medically examined and do not have to maintain the records required in parts 391, 395 and 396. Drug and Alcohol Testing Nonbusiness PMCPs are not subject to the current drug testing requirements found in 49 CFR part 391. However, business PMCPs are subject to those regulations. Under a final rule published in the Federal Register on February 15, 1994, the FHWA announced new drug and alcohol testing rules. These rules were issued in response to the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and will require that all operators of CMVs subject to the CDL requirements, be tested for controlled substances and alcohol. Both business and nonbusiness PMCPs will be subject to these rules.
