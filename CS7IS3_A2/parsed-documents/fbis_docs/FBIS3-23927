By most modest estimates, at least six participants have been involved in it: the city of Bodaybo administration, the Irkutsk Oblast administration, the Lenzoloto AO [joint-stock company], Roskomdragmet [Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones], Roskomnedr [Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources], and the Australian company Star Technology System. Nevertheless, there is hope that one of the largest gold deposits in the world will be under development soon: Lenzoloto AO General Director Valentin Avlov proposed to set up a privately held joint-stock company especially for the development of Sukhoy Log. During the general director's visit to Moscow, which he completed yesterday, he succeeded in obtaining preliminary approval from federal authorities for the creation of the joint-stock company. Sukhoy Log is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in the world (estimated reserves--1,000 tonnes). It is located in the vicinity of the city of Bodaybo in Irkutsk Oblast. Let us recall the history of the conflict: The conversion of Lenzoloto PO [industrial association] into Lenzoloto AO proceeded in keeping with the government decision dated 9 April 1992. In the text of the document things were not made clear regarding the participation of foreign capital, as well as Lenzoloto AO's succession rights to "use of land and other natural resources," which are in conflict with legislative acts adopted later--in particular, the law on mineral resources. Therefore, Roskomnedr does not recognize as legitimate Lenzoloto's license to develop the Sukhoy Log deposit. All materials on the subject were recently submitted for consideration to the Ministry of Justice. If the ministry finds Lenzoloto's license illegitimate, the deposit will be put up for bid. Another violation was committed in signing the agreement in keeping with which the Australian company will begin financing of development after geological information on Sukhoy Log deposit is declassified. Last week a state commission of the presidential administration's control administration worked in Bodaybo. As the commission's head, control administration department chief Aleksandr Lapenkov, put it, "removing the 'secret' designation is a very serious matter, and it is unclear who will take responsibility for it, since distribution of this information may influence the world price of gold and thus damage Russian interests in this market." Because of this, Lenzoloto AO cannot get money from its foreign founder. According to information in KOMMERSANT's possession, on 15 December 1993 at a conference in Yegor Gaydar's office a decision was made to remove the "secret" designation; however, at this point there is no official confirmation of this. According to preliminary information, the presidential administration commission and the Irkutsk Oblast administration are inclined to accept the compromise solution proposed by Lenzoloto AO General Director Valentin Avlov. Which is the following: Since the conversion of Lenzoloto PO into Lenzoloto AO has already taken place, let it continue to operate. To develop the Sukhoy Log deposit, a new privately held AO will be created with the participation of Lenzoloto AO, Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], the Irkutsk Oblast administration, and other interested enterprises. This proposal was also accepted by top officials in Roskomdragmet, Roskomnedr, and the State Committee for Administration of State Property, with whom Mr. Avlov conducted negotiations during his visit to Moscow. This raises hopes that the conflict will be resolved very soon.
