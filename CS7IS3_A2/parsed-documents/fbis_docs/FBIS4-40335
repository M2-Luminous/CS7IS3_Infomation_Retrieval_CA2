The price of electricity has increased 2.8 times, heating supplies 3.3 times, and natural gas 3.6 times. Prices for railway cargo transportation has increased five times. Prices for sugar and alcohol have increased two to 2.5 times. Consumer goods from state- owned shops very quickly find their way to the hands of profiteers, and flea market prices have also skyrocketed. At a republic meeting of the Congress of Entrepreneurs and Union of Industrialists held recently, Prime Minister Tereshchenko said that the price for electricity would be approximately double soon. Salaries and wages are worth nothing now. Our people are very tolerant, but in many places people have begun to show their dissatisfaction openly. Of late, there have been street protests in the Aynabulak housing development of Almaty because the price for natural gas had been increased sharply.
