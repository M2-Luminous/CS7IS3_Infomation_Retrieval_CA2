In particular, oligoribonucleotides containing the ApUpG initiation codon on the 5'-terminal of the molecule have found application as mRNA models in studies of ribosome functional processes. The most promising and universal method for preparative synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides is based on using immobilized T4 bacteriophage RNA-ligase for joining chemically synthesized triplets. In this work, the oligoribonucleotides ApUpG(pU)[.sup]n[/] and ApUpG(pU)[.sub]n[/]pUp were synthesized from oligoribouridilates via catalysis with immobilized RNA-ligase. The oligoribouridilates were obtained from hydrolysis of poly(U) endonuclease from cobra venom and from ApUpG trinucleoside diphosphate that had been chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method. Seven reaction cycles were carried out on one column with the immobilized enzyme. The end product yield varied from 4.9 to 18.0% after chromatographic purification. The structure of the obtained compounds was verified by chromatography with labels and enzyme hydrolysis down to the nucleosides. References 15: 12 Russian, 3 Western.
