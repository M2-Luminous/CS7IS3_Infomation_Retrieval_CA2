Speaking today at the American Society of Newspaper Editors who compared his explanations of the Whitewater affair to a girl making excuses for skipping her homework, Clinton said that he is doing his best to answer questions about the Whitewater affair but he could not have perfect recall of events which happened 15 years ago. "I have done my best to answer the questions asked of me... I'll continue to do that," Clinton said, heatedly defending his handling of the Whitewater affair. But he said he could not stay on top of the daily Whitewater revelations in the media without letting the presidency suffer. "Maybe you think I should have shut the whole federal government down and done nothing but study these things for the last two months," the U.S. president said. "I have done everything I know to do but, can I answer every question that anybody might ask me about something that happened 10, 15, 17 years ago on the spur of the moment and have total recall of all of that while trying to be president? No sir, I cannot," he stressed. Clinton said he had agreed to the appointment of a special prosecutor in the Whitewater case precisely to put the search for information in capable hands and allow himself to focus on the business of the presidency. Special prosecutor Robert Fiske is investigating whether money from a failed Arkansas savings and loan association was funnelled to the Whitewater Development Co. in which the Clintons had invested back in the late 1970s. Reports said today that records released by the Clintons' Whitewater business partner, James McDougall, showed Mrs. Clinton had taken a more active role in the Whitewater company than White House officials had acknowledged. The records reportedly showed that her law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, was given as Whitewater's address on tax returns and that some monthly payments from Whitewater lot buyers were mailed to her there. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said today that "we stand by our description of her (Mrs. Clinton's) role." White House officials have long described the Clintons as passive investors in the Whitewater Development Company that was largely run by the McDougalls.
