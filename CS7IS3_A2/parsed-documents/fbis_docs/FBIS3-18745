The government stated that the recession had ended and started stimulation through borrowing. A decision was made on starting stimulation back in December, but last week the government's desire to stimulate became so strong that it sent bills involving the first stimulation package to the Eduskunta a week earlier than had originally been intended. "These measures are extremely urgent," Aho said on Friday when presenting the government's proposal for this year's first supplementary budget. The objective of the proposal, which is part of the stimulation package, is to get companies to invest. In the same breath Aho announced that the recession had ended: "The recession may be considered to have ended in the last quarter of this year, since the Finnish economy has been growing since then." In actual fact the economic crisis may be considered to have ended only when unemployment slackens. It can happen only when investment starts to rise, i. e., when companies procure new machinery and equipment for increasing production. "Through the stimulation package it is desired to create the kind of incentives that will cause at least some investments to be made earlier, so that they do not pile up at the same time in the traditional manner," Raimo Sailas, the budget chief of the Ministry of Finance, said. The Central Federation of Industry and Employers predicted recently that large investments would not start until 1995-96, when the Finnish attitude toward membership in the European Union becomes clear. It Is Useless for Companies To Expect New Measures Raimo Sailas said that he does not believe that companies will wait to see if there are new stimulation packages, although he admits that "this is a familiar game." According to him "it is useless for companies to expect" completely new stimulation measures. At present the only large industrial investment is the renovation of Outukumpu's plants in Harjavalta. A decision on building the Metsa-Botnia pulp plant in Rauma is expected next. The government will encourage companies to invest through a special investment credit. This means that companies will be permitted to deduct 7 percent of the expenditures for productive investment. According to an estimate by the Ministry of Finance the credits will cut a 700-800-million-markka hole in the government's tax revenues. In addition to the investment credit, the supplementary budget presented on Friday contains 1.7 billion markkas worth of public-sector investments and procurement speedups. Minister of Labor Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative) calculated that public and private investments together could now reach a value of 4.6 billion markkas. Lobbying Efforts Broke Records In December the government decided to make citizens' buying power increase by arranging for an increase of 150 million markkas in child allowances and 100 million markkas in health insurance benefits. In addition the government canceled its earlier decision to tighten up taxation. Taken altogether these decisions will increase government borrowing this year by approximately 3 billion markkas or about 4 percent. Companies and officials around the country have attempted to publicize their own projects to the Ministry of Finance in recent weeks. "The flood of letters and lobbying attempts by businesses and the new provincial associations have broken all records," Raimo Sailas said. The government is proposing 455 million markkas for highway work and 440 million for the railroads. Accelerating public investments will benefit road builders in particular. The government calculates that the stimulus package will increase domestic demand this year by 5 billion markkas. According to an estimate by the government, the rate of growth in total output will speed up from the 1 percent forecast in fall to 2 percent by virtue of the package. According to the Ministry of Labor, the package will produce 16,000 new jobs. In comparison to the December statistics this would mean a reduction in unemployment from 21.8 percent to 21.2 percent. Good Year End Surprised Government Up to December the government opposed an expansion of borrowing, claiming among other things that stimulus would stop the drop in interest rates. Interest rates have continued to fall, however, even after the government's change in direction. Raimo Sailas from the Ministry of Finance could not give a precise answer to why the government decided just now on a large stimulus package. "In October and November of last year the notion prevailed that development would be much weaker than it apparently turned out later. Surprisingly the development was not so bad, and consumer demand livened up. The intent of the stimulus is to prevent our tailspin from continuing." Sailas admitted that one could discuss the timing of the stimulus. "Well, yes, this is not at all a fine-tuning matter, but it certainly will not overheat the economy. We shall not see how lasting the growth in consumption is until the new tax cards come in." The government's economic policy has been criticized on the grounds that delaying stimulation has deepened the recession more than previously. Sailas explained the late beginning for stimulation by the fact that when the recession was at its deepest "one could not know at all what is now known. ``If even in the fall of 1992 people had been certain that the balance of payments would come into equilibrium so rapidly, it would have been possible to start operations that would have prevented the recession in domestic markets from deepening. In addition to us the so-called markets would have had to be assured of this notion. If things had been that way financial policy could have been a few degrees looser.'' In Sailas' opinion economists and other citizens have a tendency to overestimate the capabilities of fiscal policy, i. e., the regulation of government revenues and expenditures. "I have tried to emphasize more and more that it is more important to attempt to create a stable framework for operations than to run after fluctuating forecasts or attempt to fine-tune fiscal policy."
