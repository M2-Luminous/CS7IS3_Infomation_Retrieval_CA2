In a letter, approved over the weekend and published in full by today's eastern Slovak pro-government daily LUC, HZDS leading officials recall that Kovac ran for the 1992 parliamentary elections to the former Czechoslovak Parliament on the HZDS east Slovakia branch's slate. They accept with understanding the suspension of Kovac's HZDS membership (as long as he holds the post of Slovak president), but with "less understanding" the establishment of a corps of the president's advisers filling the President's Office, the letter says. "We were disquieted at your (Kovac's) new year's speech in which among other things you urged political entities (fortunately there are not many of them in parliament) to form a broad coalition. Unfortunately you did so only on a general level which did not address anyone," reads the letter. The HZDS functionaries ask him whether or not those who refused to vote for the adoption of the Constitution and the Declaration of Slovakia's Sovereignty, who formed new groups in parliament, call for early elections, and "question each of the present government's steps every day" are also among those to be represented in the coalition he proposes. "Our questions require clear answers. A general appeal which can only further destabilize the political scene and give the executive power again to those who failed to gain it in the regular (1992) democratic elections is not sufficient," says the letter, which LUC says was also signed by four HZDS deputies of the National Council of the Slovak Republic.
