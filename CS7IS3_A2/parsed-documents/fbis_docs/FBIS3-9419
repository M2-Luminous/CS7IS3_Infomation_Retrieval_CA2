"Besides seeds, there are not enough necessary raw materials for sowing," Miroslav Sandzakov, Vojvodina assistant secretary for agriculture, told TANJUG. A record 1.35 million tonnes of oil were produced in Vojvodina last year, sufficient to cover one-quarter of the country's overall needs. According to the energy balance made by the government, agriculture has absolute priority. Around 800,000 hectares of the 1,080,000 hectares in Vojvodina have been plowed so far. Agricultural producers expect the state to ensure the necessary fuel for the plowing of the remaining 280,000 hectares. Due to the ban on imports of natural gas, factories for the production of artificial fertilizers are working at reduced capacity. It is estimated that around 60 percent of this year's needs will be met and this will consequently lower the output. Experts estimate that the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina could under normal conditions provide food for four times the number of inhabitants of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Besides its 10.4 million inhabitants, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cares for refugees from the former Yugoslav republics torn by war. There are around 500,000 registered refugees but the total number of refugees is estimated at 700,000. According to data of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is currently in the group of countries which cannot feed their own population. Until the introduction of the international blockade in May 1992, Yugoslavia not only satisfied its needs in foodstuffs but also exported significant surpluses.
