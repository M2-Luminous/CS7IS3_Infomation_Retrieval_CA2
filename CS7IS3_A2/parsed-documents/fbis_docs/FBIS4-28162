FBIS4-28162 "dreas110_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 South Korea Foreign Minister Departs for Beijing for Talks Foreign Minister Departs for Beijing for Talks SK0806002394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0012 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806002394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] New York, June 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu says that the situation over the North Korean nuclear dispute could change within a few days if Pyongyang cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for its efforts to maintain nuclear safeguards in that country. "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic sanctions," Han told South Korean correspondents stationed in New York, shortly before his departure for Bejing Tuesday. On President Kim Yong-sam's order, Han was heading for Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on the North Korean nuclear issue, it was announced by Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho in Seoul Tuesday night. Han had been scheduled to return home Tuesday from New York. He is expected to meet Qian Thursday to explain the results of his talks with U.S. Government officials and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council on possible sanctions against North Korea. Han will ask China to go along with the Security Council after explaining to Qian that the reason South Korea, the United States and their allies are pursuing a resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea is simply because there is no other alternative. Meeting with Korean reporters, Han said an overwhelming majority of the Security Council members had told him the world body must take strong action against North Korea. But a vote in the council will not come until after next week because some work must still be done on revising the language of a draft resolution by the permanent members, Han said. Pressed for a comment on the possibility that China might oppose sanctions, Han said it appears Beijing will make up its mind after looking for any changes in the North Korean attitude. But when the Security Council adopts a resolution on sanctions, the situation naturally calls for such action and therefore, China would not be in a position to block the resolution or oppose it, Han said. Asked about his visit to China, Han noted that every country in the Security Council believes that Beijing has an important role to play in the North Korean nuclear issue. He said he plans to brief Chinese leaders on the results of his negotiations with U.S. and Russian officials and members of the Security Council in New York. Han said he will also ask the Chinese to continue their efforts to persuade North Korea to accept U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities. With regard to a reported Russian proposal for an eight-party conference on the nuclear issue, Han said that is not the official Russian position. Moscow was said to be pressing for such a conference, to be attended by representatives from the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the IAEA and the United Nations. On the possibility of multilateral sanctions being imposed by South Korea, the United States and Japan, Han said Seoul does not feel such sanctions are needed. Han acknowledged there would be some danger in the event that the United Nations slaps sanctions on North Korea. Nonetheless, the world body cannot afford to flinch because of Pyongyang's threats. Seoul will take realistic, effective and comprehensive measures to deal with all possible eventualities, Han added. In his talks with Qian, Han will also explain the outcome of President Kim's visits to Moscow and Tashkent before returning home Thursday. Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Yi Sang-ok is visiting Beijing at the invitation of a Chinese association of diplomatic officials and will discuss the North Korean problem with Qian.
