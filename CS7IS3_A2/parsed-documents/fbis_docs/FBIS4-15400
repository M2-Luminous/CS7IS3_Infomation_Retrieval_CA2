Sergey Stepashin, head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSK], came to St. Petersburg today to hold a regional meeting with counterintelligence directorate heads and a closed meeting with directors from the military-industrial complex. However in an interview for our program he made a fairly clear statement on incidents of corruption in the Russian Government. [Begin Stepashin recording] Only yesterday, or rather the day before yesterday to be precise, I sent a written report to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin about a very high-ranking official of ministerial rank, who is now being investigated. Yes, such work is going on. But I want to stress once again that corruption and episodes of corruption are fairly sensitive and so there can be no haste here. [end recording] Sergey Stepashin, naturally, could not name the minister accused of corruption. However, the fact that the president was informed immediately shows that we are talking about someone in the top ranks of politics. But the meeting with the military-industrial complex bosses was not only concerned with corruption. Inter alia, we received information that there is a sharp increase in recruitment work by foreign intelligence services and even a stepping up of activities by the special services of our southern neighbors in the CIS. Representations have been made to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan about attempts to recruit our citizens. Five personnel from the Georgian security department were detained by our counterintelligence and handed over to the authorities in Tbilisi. So, at the moment, it is still too early to talk about a free and open society without strong special services.
