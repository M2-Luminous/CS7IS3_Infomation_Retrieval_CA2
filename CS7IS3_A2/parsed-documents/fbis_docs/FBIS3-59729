Of the four companies, Toshiba has produced a lower-cost resin sealed version. The HEMT is used in the front end of tuners in broadcasting and communications satellite tuners. A lower noise factor means that the diameter of parabolic antennas can be reduced. Broadcasting satellite tuners receive microwaves (selected stations) in the 12GHz band, amplify the signal, and convert it to intermediate frequencies (IF) of about 1GHz. The HEMT is often used in the high-speed amplifiers in the front end of broadcasting satellite tuners. This transistor must not only operate at high frequency (12GHz), but must also have a low noise factor. The noise factor is expressed as a quotient of the signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal and the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal. The lower the noise factor is, the higher the output signal-to-noise ratio will be. Therefore, demodulation can be performed even with small diameter parabolic antennas. Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp are the four companies which have begun shipping samples of the HEMT, which has a noise factor of 0.45dB in the 12GHz band (this is the standard value at 25°C). (See Table 1) Of these companies, Toshiba has developed a low cost resin-sealed version. Toshiba also claims: ``When reflow soldering is performed, there is less conductivity between pins than in the ceramic sealed type.'' When the noise factor is reduced to 0.45dB or lower, antenna diameter can be decreased to 30-40cm. With a noise factor of 0.6dB, antenna diameter exceeds 40cm. InGaAs Used Most Frequently in Electron Transit Layer The reason that the noise factor is lower in HEMT transistors is because both the electron mobility and electron density are high. The noise factor is inversely proportional to the electron mobility and electron density, and directly proportional to the gate length. Impurities such as silicon are not added to generate electrons in the electron transit layer (composed of GaAs) in HEMT transistors. There is a separate electron supply layer (AlGaAs, etc.) which supplies the electrons. Since there are almost no impurities to disturb the mobility of electrons in the electron transit layer, electron mobility is high even for high electron densities. To increase the electron density in the electron transit layer, Fujitsu developed a product with an InGaP electron supply layer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Except for NEC, all companies use GaAs for the substrate and InGaAs in the electron transit layer. For the electron supply layer, Fujitsu uses InGaP, and Toshiba and Sharp use AlGaAs. NEC has not announced the material used. In addition to these manufacturers, the following companies have also announced low-noise, high-frequency transistors such as the HEMT: Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. (NF reference is 0.5dB at 12GHz), Oki Electric Industrial Co. (0.55dB), Mitsubishi Electric (0.55dB), Hitachi Ltd. (0.6dB), and Sony (0.7dB). Rolm began marketing a product with 0.7dB noise factor, but this product has been discontinued. Sanyo Electric is developing a high-frequency transistor called TMT (two-mode channel FET), which has a noise factor of 1.6dB (25°C, 60GHz). Samples of this product will begin shipment in 1994, but no product will be for the 12GHz band.
