[Sobchak] These men brought themselves so much into discredit, at the latest with the putsch, that they will no longer play a serious role in politics. If they are really innocent, as they are claiming, they could have had that confirmed before court. Amnesty can only be granted to people who are guilty. [Mascher] It is said that Rutskoy might be built up as an identification figure for the humiliated masses.... [Sobchak] You know, I know Rutskoy personally. He is an extremely narrow-minded man with great ambition, but little intelligence. He is not a statesman, but always remains on the level of a division commander. All the time, he only executes orders. [Mascher] In his speech before the Duma, President Yeltsin made great concessions to the opposition and forces hostile to reforms.... [Sobchak] Yes, that is true. But there is also a new opposition. The previous one openly called for Yeltsin's removal. Therefore, he behaved differently toward it, but he was still not tough enough. In his place, I would have dissolved the parliament as early as April after the successful referendum. However, Yeltsin is unfortunately unable to use the results of his victories. This was also the case in August 1991. Today we have a completely different situation. The opposition is no longer intransigent, people like Gaydar or Yavlinskiy are also in the opposition. Therefore, Yeltsin is behaving differently. [Mascher] But the amnesty was a provocation.... [Sobchak] Yes, of course, the Duma challenged the president. However, I believe that an aggressive confrontation between the president and the parliament no longer makes any sense today because the new constitution is already effective. [Mascher] That is to say, one is not afraid of politicians like Zhirinovskiy? [Sobchak] His importance is above all exaggerated in the West. He has hardly any influence in the Duma, whereas people such as the communist Zyuganov, Lapshin from the Peasant Party, or Gaydar are influential. I think that the West is not reacting like this by chance. It wants to justify its inactivity -- the lack of real help and cooperation. So far, Russia has received the promised loans neither from the United States nor from the European Union, only the time allowed for the repayment of debts has been extended and tied loans for buying grain from the Americans have been granted. That is to say, Washington is supporting its own farmers, but not Russia. Then we have to repay these funds at a high interest. The West is not only interested in Zhirinovsky because of his scandalous appearances. It is not openly said, but some politicians take the view that the weaker Russia is, the better it is for the West, as it would no longer be a threat. This is an incorrect assessment that could dangerously disturb the balance of forces.
