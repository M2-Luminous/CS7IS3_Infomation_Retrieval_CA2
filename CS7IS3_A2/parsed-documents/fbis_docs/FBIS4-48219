Speculation at the time of their arrest said that they had been picked up for failure to repay to public funds huge sums of money which commissions of inquiry had found them guilty of obtaining through corrupt practices. From Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report. The Sierra Leonean Government has now published 19 names as those recently arrested and detained at Pademba Road maximum security prison in Freetown. All but two of the detainees are former ministers or deputy ministers in the government of ex-President Joseph Momoh. The 17 politicians include two women: (Emeckley Simbo) and Matilda Conteh, both former deputy ministers. Others include former Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Koroma, former Development Minister Sheku Kanu, former Transport and Communication Minister Michael Abdulai, and the former minister for party affairs. The two nonpoliticians detained are Mohamed Bangura, a businessman, and the former head of the Sierra Leone Fire Brigade, Allassan Kamara. All 19 were picked up by the police after an announcement from the government last Saturday [7 May] morning that while some of those asked to refund various sums to the government had done so, others have not. Three commissions of inquiry into corruption found they had stolen these funds from the government.
