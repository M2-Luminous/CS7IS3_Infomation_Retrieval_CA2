Katsman; place and date not given: "I Am Not Khrushchev: I Can Compromise..."] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Katsman] Leonid Danilovich, let me touch upon the inner political life of Ukraine. What are your prospects in the upcoming 26 June presidential and local elections? [Kuchma] When I am told that we urgently require a new constitution, I remain a supporter of the opinion that this is not a key issue. Hundreds of states have lived without a constitution. If we had a new constitution, we would have violated its clauses just as we are violating virtually all of the laws in our state. I am a supporter of the belief that a new power -- able to make all people obey the law, including a constitution -- should appear. If the issue of shifting the date of elections was backed by specific measures of an economic nature, some anticrisis measures, or a kind of balanced program (in my opinion, currently, we require extraordinary measures), then we could discuss the issue of shifting the elections. When this demand is only explained by drafting a constitution, I do not accept this idea. According to statistics, only 27 percent of Ukrainian enterprises operated in March. This represents a complete breakdown -- extraordinary measures are required! Presidential elections should be held and Ukraine should receive a strong and stable executive branch! [Katsman] Are the elections for local authorities necessary? [Kuchma] I was, and still am, an adversary of holding the local elections. I am afraid that we will have 25 presidents of oblasts and the autonomous republic. I support a federal system in Ukraine, however, without political independence among the regions. We should empower regions with more economic rights but avoid turning them into islands of political tension. Local elections will strongly affect the vertical power structure. I am not sure that we would be able to adopt a decisive document if the oblast administration head is nominated for his post through the same popular elections as the state president (of course, there will be a difference in scale). Local elections could finally destroy the last few scraps of executive power that we still have. [Katsman] Will the Interregional Bloc of Reforms (the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc) step up its activity during the Supreme Council runoffs in 112 constituencies, where elections were not held on 27 March and 10 April? [Kuchma] By all means! The bloc was organized not long ago (some five months ago), but we still somehow managed to make mistakes. For example, we virtually did not nominate any candidates in the Supreme Council elections. We only appealed for support for our joint statement with Vladimir Hrynyov. Therefore, this is probably the reason why our bloc's legislative faction won fewer seats than we had anticipated. The issue of toughening the rules of play arises: If you have agreed with some principles -- adhere to them and act accordingly when you are elected a Supreme Council deputy! This is almost a form of party discipline, but it will provide an opportunity to bloc forces of the extreme right and left in the legislature. We will seriously deal with the runoffs, but we are not still sure if they will be held in mid-summer. Vladimir Hrynyov and I set up an open bloc, so I expect the faction to be of a similar nature. As for me, I do not believe that we will not find sane people among the socialists and communists, as well as among national-democrats. We should begin working right away. I would like to convene plenary sessions no later than 5 May.... You know, our bloc is open for any and all cooperation. As for me, I am not Khrushchev, who had rows with all communist parties around the world which had stepped away from Marxist-Leninist dogma.... [Katsman] You have entered the presidential campaign. What are your chances? [Kuchma] I want to be fair with regard to those who have been nominated for this post along with myself. I assess my chances as equal to theirs. [Katsman] Will Leonid Kravchuk participate in this marathon? [Kuchma] Leonid Kravchuk is a shrewd politician. He is and will always remain the first president of independent Ukraine. I am sure that all the bad things will be forgotten. However, I believe that he will not participate in these elections. Nevertheless, we will see...
