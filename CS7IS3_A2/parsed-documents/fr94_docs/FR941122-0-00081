FR941122-0-00081 FR941122-0-00013 Two proposed nonessential experimental population rules for the areas of Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho were published in the Federal Register on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively) (Service 1994a). The Record of Decision, notification of the proposed rules, and tentative schedule for public hearings were mailed to nearly 50,000 people on September 6, 1994. All interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment were published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette beginning on September 14, 1994. The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the Federal Register on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana; and on September 29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, DC; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994. A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered. From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994, the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified and addressed in the final EIS: The Reintroduction of Gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and are discussed below. Changes in final rule as a result of public comment: The following minor changes and clarifications were made to the final rule or to discussions of the final rule based on public comments on the proposed rule. These individual or cumulative changes do not alter the predicted impact or effect of the final rule.
