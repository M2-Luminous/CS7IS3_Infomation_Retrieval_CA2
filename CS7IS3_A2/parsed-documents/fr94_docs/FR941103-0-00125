(2) ASME Code stamped cargo tanks. Any work involving repair on any ASME Code stamped cargo tank must be performed by a repair facility holding a valid National Board Certificate of Authorization for the use of the National Board ``R'' stamp and registered in accordance with subpart F of part 107 of subchapter B of this chapter. (3) The following provisions apply to cargo tank repairs: (i) DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect either at the time of manufacture or at the time of repair; (ii) MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, and MC 306 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the original specification or with the DOT 406 specification in effect at the time of repair; (iii) MC 304 and MC 307 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the original specification or with the DOT 407 specification in effect at the time of repair; (iv) MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the original specification or with the DOT 412 specification in effect at the time of the repair; (v) MC 338 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect either at the time of manufacture or at the time of repair; and (vi) MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the repair procedures described in CGA Technical Bulletin TB&hyph;2 and the National Board Inspection Code_Provisions for Repair of Pressure Vessels.
