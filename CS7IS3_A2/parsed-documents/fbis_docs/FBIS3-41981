A blast rocked the eastern coast of the Sea of Japan. North Korea had launched the first test flight of its secret Nodung missile. It sailed 500 kilometers toward Japan and fell into the sea. In Tokyo, the Japanese were in a panic. They knew well that the Nodung could have easily flown its maximum range of 1,000 kilometers and crashed into Japan. In Washington, U.S. strategists upgraded the missile threat from Pyongyang from potential to real and decided that the communist country required high-level attention. Within hours, the news was relying to Jerusalem, Yitzhaq Rabin and his military aides agreed that a turning point had been reached. North Korea was a friend of Syria and Iran. The Arabs now had a missile that could strike the Jewish state from launchers out of the effective range of the Israel Air Force [IAF]. To Rabin, it was the realization of a frightening thought he had been expressing for at least a year. Israel could eventually face thousands of medium-range missiles deployed by radical Arab leaders swept into the euphoria of jihad, holy war. Should Israel make a preemptive strike, hundreds of missiles could rain down on it. If not, Israel would be forced to submit to a dangerous and humiliating surrender. Rabin's conclusion was that Israel must step up the development of what could be its most ambitious and, perhaps, most expensive project ever: the Arrow (Hetz) anti-missile defense system. To its supporters, the Arrow can be Israel's answer to the growing Arab missile threat and a card to play in future Middle East diplomacy. To its opponents, the Arrow is a wasteful project that will bankrupt the government and never work. These days, both proponents and opponents are nervous. In the coming days, the Arrow will undergo the first of three tests to determine whether it can actually intercept and destroy the warhead of an incoming enemy missile. If the tests fail, opponents could succeed in reducing the scope of the project. If the tests succeed, Israeli officials will decide to prepare for the production and deployment of a system which no other nation has. "The next three tests will be crucial, not only for the technological hurdles but also psychologically," says former defense minister Moshe Arens, an Arrow supporter. "If they fail, then they [in the government] won't want to continue." Both sides agree that Israel faces a growing Arab missile threat. Syria is acquiring Scud C missiles from North Korea. Egypt is investing heavily in missile production as well. Military sources acknowledge the eventual threat of 2,000 Arab enemy missiles being aimed at Israel. "The danger of missiles is a real threat," says Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur. "I don't know who doesn't appreciate this great danger." Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yisrael Tal, one of the top military strategists in Israel, says the Arabs have reached a strategic balance with Israel through their acquisition of ground-to-ground missiles. "We have lost the monopoly of strategic deterrence, and there is a threat that it will pass over to the Arabs," Tal is quoted in Arye Shalev's Peace and Security in the Golan, published this year. Tal, a senior Defense Ministry official, has not repeated these views in public. The argument is over the Israeli response. Until the Gulf war, Israel and the U.S. shared the same approach. A missile attack could be dealt with by the Air Force, which would search and destroy missile batteries. "I was hearing the same story," says James Hackett, an executive with Titan Systems and one of the leading missile experts in the U.S. "They said, `We don't need [anti-missile] missiles. Just give us more airplanes.'" The Pentagon changed that attitude after the war, in which 29 soldiers were killed by an Iraqi Scud attack on Saudi Arabia. The Israeli military's view has remained the same: absorb a first blow, locate the enemy's offenses and then attack hard. "The entire effort is how to reduce the early damage [from a missile attack] so the missile launchers can be found," says Me'ir Kohen, a missile expert close to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] leadership. "If we have good intelligence, we can find them." The subject has pitted uniformed commanders against defense technocrats. It has been a controversy fueled by a wholesale disinformation, personal enmities and a bureaucratic battle between the IDF and the Defense Ministry. Israel Aircraft Industries [IAI], the chief Israeli contractor for the Arrow, originally set 1995 for the completion of the Arrow's development. Military experts say it will be a miracle if any sort of system can be installed by the end of the decade. "It [Arrow] is not practical in the short term," says former Air Force commander Avihu Bin-Nun. "The resources are limited. If we invest in the offensive answer, then we have versatility." "The missile threat is very small," he adds. "It has been blown out of proportion by us. One plane can do more against us than all 40 missiles that fell on us [during the Gulf war]." Bin-Nun's view is widely held throughout the military, particularly among the commanders who draft budgets. For years, the Air Force had little to do with the project. Today, IDF strategists, set to review its multi-year program, are planning to demand a cut in the Arrow program. In many ways, its a rerun of previous army battles with the civilian defense establishment over budgeting huge research and development programs. "The army works from a mindset," says Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yirmeyahu Olmert, a former secretary to Arens. "The army always wants to work tactically and doesn't want to look at the long term." The shooting in this battle has been largely behind closed doors. Spokesmen for the army and Defense Ministry refused to allow interviews on the subject. Few Israeli officials would talk, particularly among those with firsthand knowledge. Most, like the chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defense committee, Ori Orr, would not. One of the reasons is that the stakes are high. The end of the Arrow would be a severe blow to a financially ailing Israel Aircraft Industries, the prime Israeli contractor. The Arrow is the biggest project involving U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation. An expansion of the Arrow program would certainly mean less money for other military development projects. The Arrow aims to protect Israel from short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, regardless of whether their warheads are conventional, biological, chemical or nuclear. A long-range early warning radar would detect the launching of an enemy missile hundreds of kilometers away. Another kind of radar, called fire-control radar, would track the enemy missile as it made its way toward Israel. An Arrow would be fired to intercept and destroy the missile before it reached Israel. If the Arrow failed to destroy the enemy missile, another Arrow would be launched. The Arrow travels at a speed of Mach-9, nine times the speed of sound. For defense of specific points, the U.S. is providing $13.9 million for a hypervelocity gun, in which plasma is injected into the gun barrel behind the shell, thereby doubling the shell's speed. The Patriot PAC-3, a planned improvement on the missile Israel received during the Gulf war, would also intercept short-range tactical missiles. Like most huge projects, the Arrow missile began as a political indulgence. It was 1985 and the Reagan administration was looking for support for its controversial Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars. The U.S. offered to fund any project by any country that would develop an anti-missile defense system. The response was lukewarm. IAI, however, came up with a plan to develop a missile that could shoot an incoming enemy missile out of the sky. The Arrow would be used against ballistic missiles with ranges of 1,000 kilometers and intercept them about 100 kilometers from target. This would make the Arrow ideal protection against unconventional weapons, such as chemical or nuclear warheads. U.S. officials were quickly convinced and, by May 1986, Israel and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding to facilitate formal Israeli participation. Two years later, the two countries agreed on funding and the beginning of the first stage of the arrow experiments. The stage would include four tests and cost $158m. The U.S. would pay 80 percent, with Israel picking up the rest. In May 1991, the U.S. and Israel announced the second stage of the Arrow. It now had a new name, Arrow Continuation Experiments (ACES), and a lot more money. The second stage would comprise 11 launches, and Washington agreed to pay 72 percent of the $322m, with Israel paying the rest. Israel also agreed to absolute U.S. control and accepted the condition that it could not sell Arrow technology or even use it for other Israeli projects. Meanwhile, the debate over the Arrow intensified as the IDF poured in more money. Sources in the General Staff pointed out that the IDF's pre-Gulf war forecast of Scud damage had been overestimated, and grumbled that Israel didn't need a missile defense system. Others said Arab missiles were too weak to make a difference in war. The Air Force was upset that it did not lead a project that it might eventually be asked to purchase and deploy. "In the beginning, the IAF was not in the picture," Bin-Nun says. "The IAF didn't sign anything. They haven't allowed the IAF to lead this. It is a mistake for the IAF to stand on the side, to give advice but not have direct responsibility." The biggest question was whether the Arrow was making real progress. There was no ready answer. What qualifies as success when the project is huge, the technology novel and the exact price hard to pin down? "For the IDF, it makes sense not to put all of its money into one thing it can't back out of," says Ze'ev Eytan, a senior researcher and an editor of the annual military survey released by the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies. The early launches of the Arrow were difficult. Sources close to the project say the first, in August 1990, lasted only five seconds; news reports said it lasted six seconds. The tracking radar failed to operate and the safety officer feared that the missile might go off course. The officer aborted the mission and instructed the missile to self-destruct. Arrow sources say the Pentagon determined that the flight did not constitute a test. The project slipped further. The second Arrow test was on March 25, 1991, four months behind schedule. Arrow sources say that flight lasted 16 seconds. The central computer of the missile overheated from external heat and malfunctioned. The Israelis tried to present the launches in the best light. They said the first flight was designed to test only the Arrow's launching mechanism, engine and computer. As for the second test, IAI officials reported that six of the 11 objectives of the flight were achieved. The Americans were more blunt. "We didn't get a lot of the test objectives done," Col. Harold Richardson of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative Office told the U.S. magazine Defense News. The third test was also delayed as engineers tried to figure out what was wrong. That launch, on October 30, 1991, also failed, U.S. and Israeli sources say the test started well, but the interceptor developed a malfunction and deviated from its planned course. The Israelis and Americans decided it was time to regroup, U.S. officials in charge of the project determined that the Arrow had to take a step back. The American style has always been cautious, step-by-step, with advancement only predicated on the success of the previous test. However, in the early stage of the program, the Israelis would embark on several tasks and see which one was progressing. The Israelis involved in the Arrow acknowledged that the joint project entailed heightened media exposure, adaptation to U.S. R&D standards, as well as a constant reassessment of the project. In all, it led to an atmosphere of what some of them termed "do or die" before each launch. "I agree that if this was an Israeli project we could have taken more chances and be less exposed to the public eye," a defense source says. Some of the Americans involved in the Arrow, like most of the Israelis, saw the silver lining in its failures. They argued that the project was still flexible and changes could easily be made. "If I had three straight successes, I would be dead scared," a U.S. Arrow source says. "My fear would be when my failure was going to come." The Americans decided that the Arrow missile first needed to be test-fired without a flaw. As a result, the fourth test was downgraded. The mission was just to ensure an Arrow flight and to maintain contact between the missile and ground control. The Arrow would not be tested for its ability to intercept an enemy missile. The Israelis involved in the Arrow reviewed many of its components. Sources close to the project say IAI engineers made up to 70 changes in the Arrow between the third and fourth launches. The approach worked. On September 23, 1992, the Arrow was fired from a boat and was airborne for 42 seconds. Ground control maintained contact with the Arrow and the missile performed well. The planners were pleased. Arrow engineers said this was a turning point for the project. On February 28, the missile underwent its fifth flight. This time, the mission focused on the missile's sensor. An Arrow simulating an attacking missile was fired. This was followed by a second Arrow, containing an electro-optic sensor. The Arrow's sensors found the incoming missile and followed it. The Arrow interceptor passed within several meters of the incoming enemy missile. The Arrow was not equipped with a live warhead and did not destroy the incoming missile. But for the Arrow's planners, this was a bull's eye. They said the Arrow had proven that it could -- under optimal conditions -- locate and intercept an enemy missile. They said had the Arrow been equipped with a warhead, it could have destroyed the missile. The sixth and most recent test was in July. The launch was aborted when the target missile veered off course. The Pentagon and Defense Ministry took more than 30 hours to pass verdict on the test. The U.S. ruled the launch did not constitute a test. Israeli and American planners agree that plenty of work remains to be done. As Michael Holtcamp, the manager of the project, based in Huntsville, Alabama, put it, one slip of the Arrow's sensor or radar and the mission is unsuccessful. The Arrow will have three chances to prove this. "The next three tests are called lethality tests," Holtcamp says. "That is to ensure that the target is killed. We hope to have proven the principle in the next three shots." Americans working on the Arrow insist that the mission is difficult but possible. They point to the precision-guided missiles, particularly the Tomahawks, used by the U.S. during the Gulf war. Those missiles were programmed to hit specific targets, albeit stationary, and were largely successful. "There are imaging systems out there," says a U.S. source close to the Arrow project. "The technology is there. The problem is that the application has never been done exactly the way it's being planned for the Arrow." Gerald Steinberg, an expert on missiles at Bar-Ilan University, agrees that the problem is daunting. "It has never been done before." At the same time, project managers are planning significant changes to the Arrow. A new missile, called Arrow II, will be smaller and lighter; Arrow II will be considered for production, while the first Arrow, which is experimental, will not. The new version will have two stages as does the current Arrow but it will have a longer range. The sensors on the missile will also be improved. The new missile is scheduled to undergo seven tests, starting in the next few months and continuing until 1996. So far, opponents of the Arrow are not impressed by its technological achievements. They say the Arrow is far from even proving that it can destroy an enemy missile under optimal conditions, let alone under battle conditions. They also doubt that the Arrow can effectively protect against nuclear warheads. By firing plenty of Scud missiles, an enemy can quickly ensure that Israel will use up its supply of valuable Arrows. "IAI engineers are trying to enter completely new fields where unknowns dominate," says Reuven Pedatzur, a defense researcher who last month released a report on the Arrow for the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies. "In much of the Arrow technology, these engineers have no prior professional experience. Major breakthroughs will be needed to complete the project." Pedatzur says the snags in technological advancement will mean more delays in the project and increased costs. The costs will include the huge investment in the Arrow's components, such as the fire-control radar and early warning systems, which he says are not being financed by the U.S. Already, the government has budgeted about $120m for the radar system and at least $100m more might be needed. Israel wants Washington to finance the development of the radar but has not received a commitment. So far, the Defense Ministry has acquired two estimates of the Arrow's costs -- that of IAI and the Israeli WALES consulting firm. In 1989, IAI estimated the cost of developing Arrow missiles and launchers at $1.3 billion. This includes the development and purchase of early warning radar, fire-control radar and a command-and-control system. A U.S.-developed model radar, which operates at a different frequency and is being promoted by the Pentagon, would cost about 10 times that much. Defense sources warn against committing anybody to this estimate. "I don't think that today IAI can give the right numbers," says a defense source. "But it is a lot less than what Pedatzur is saying." Pedatzur says the early-warning radar will cost $100m per unit and the cost of developing two systems will cost between $400m and $500m. Development of the fire-control radar, which tracks the incoming enemy missile, is estimated at $200m with the price of each unit at between $30m and $50m. The command and control system is estimated by Tadiran, which wants the contract, at between $40m and $50m. Pedatzur says the cost of the entire Arrow system to the IDF could top $6.75b. This would include research, development and procurement of 100 launchers and 400 missiles. It would not include the costs of a nationwide communications system, manpower and training. "This is still not the whole story," Pedatzur says in his report. "Other components still in the concept stage will have to be developed in the wake of the lessons of the Gulf war. It is difficult to gauge these costs, but they will probably run into billions of dollars." Brig.-Gen. (res.) Aharon Levran, who has researched the Arrow for Bar-Ilan University's Center for Strategic Studies, calls Pedatzur's estimate baseless and misleading. He dismisses the argument by the Arrow's IDF critics who assert that the project is not cost-effective; one of their arguments is that it makes no sense that a $1m Arrow be used to destroy a $200,000 Scud missile. "You can't talk in sterile terms about cost-effectiveness," Levran says. "You have to look at the matter as to what damage they [incoming missiles] will do and what they do to the strategic balance. If this is the central strategic challenge, you have to find an answer to this and not hide behind clever answers." Still, Pedatzur has plenty of supporters. He has been invited to discuss his report with the IDF General Staff. In Washington, the General Accounting Office [GAO], the congressional watchdog of government spending, says in a report released last August that Israel might be underestimating the costs of producing and deploying the Arrow system. The report says Washington is already providing funding not only for the development of the Arrow but for other programs related to the completion of the project. The reference is to $54.4 million budgeted for the entire Arrow system, including its radar system. "The U.S. may be drawn into funding most of the elements needed to deploy and support a complete Israeli Arrow missile defense system in response to piecemeal Israeli requests," the GAO report says. The study raises another question: Will the U.S. allow the Arrow to be completed? The GAO cast doubts on whether the Arrow is even suitable for Israel's needs, as opposed to another missile defense system being developed in the U.S. Precisely that argument was expressed when Israel was developing the U.S.-financed Lavi fighter-jet a decade ago. At the time, U.S. defense contractors demanded that their government stop spending taxpayers' money to build a foreign airplane that would eventually compete with American products. The IDF, particularly the Air Force, pushed for the end of the Lavi, saying it was unworkable and unaffordable. In 1987, Israel decided to cancel the billion-dollar Lavi project. Today, Lavi supporters assert that Israel cannot afford to buy the top-quality U.S. airplanes that will do the job originally envisioned for the Lavi. U.S. involvement in the Arrow is on a much smaller scale than it was on the Lavi. The problem is, what if the Arrow works? Who will own and sell it? Under the agreement, the U.S. will own all of the Arrow technology developed. But disputes have erupted over Israel's claims that it contributed most of the technology. Pentagon officials say the feud is not unusual. The U.S. and Japan have argued for years over technology ownership in their joint projects. "This is the great lurking problem in all technology transfers," says Steven Bryen, a former Pentagon official responsible for U.S. technology transfers. Opponents and proponents of the Arrow are looking to Washington. They have quietly lobbied Congress and the Pentagon for support. Pedatzur has tried to relay his fears on the Arrow to U.S. officials. At one point, he says he tried and failed to interview Bin-Nun on the Arrow and present this in a hearing in Congress. "What's my goal?" asks Pedatzur, who now works for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I want a public debate." On the other side is Marvin Klemow. A tough-talking former Associated Press reporter now representing IAI in Washington, Klemow protects the Arrow as if it were his own child. He and other Israelis connected with the arrow have done their best to stop Pedatzur--a former military correspondent who still writes for Ha'aretz--and others from speaking to Pentagon officials and congressional aides. "He was telling people that he was doing an objective study for the Jaffee Institute," Klemow says. "We said he was a reporter. He never told them that he was also a reporter. So, they denied [Pedatzur the chance to meet them]. One congressional aide he did see said that every question he did ask was meant to elicit negative responses." Throughout, Rabin has maintained a stony silence. Publicly, the prime minister and defense minister has never commented on the Arrow, leading some military sources to assert that the prime minister's heart is not in the project. "I doubt if Rabin has had five minutes to even seriously consider the Arrow and its future," a source close to Rabin says. But quietly, the Rabin government has expanded the commitment to the Arrow. Lt.-Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, the head of the Ballistic Missile Development Organization, the U.S. agency involved in the Arrow, told Congress last May that Israel is committed to completing the development of the Arrow, regardless of U.S. aid. Sources close to Rabin say he changed from being an opponent to a lukewarm supporter of the project during the Gulf war. He became a strong advocate of a missile defense system after the May 29 Nodung launch by North Korea. "His position is very supportive [of the Arrow]," says Oded Ben-Ami, Rabin's spokesman at the Defense Ministry. "Israel has every interest in developing the Arrow and bringing it to completion." Later, Rabin gave approval to fund the production of several Arrow missiles and a launcher even before the end of the U.S.-Israel research-and-development project to find out if the system works. Defense sources say money has been budgeted for the current fiscal year to prepare for the eventual deployment of the Arrow as part of a five-year Israeli plan that ends in 1997. Defense sources estimate that the deployment is dependent on the development of the Arrow radar and it will not be achieved before 1995. Moreover, the IDF is now said to be fully cooperating with the project. The IAF has recently completed a feasibility study and operational assessment of the Arrow. In August, military representatives participated in a series of tests to determine how the Arrow could defend against an enemy warhead containing multiple chemical bombs, each the size of a soft-drink can. "Rabin supports it 100 percent and wants them to prove that the Arrow can, or cannot, shoot down an incoming missile," a senior defense source says. However, there are doubts regarding the number of missiles to be produced. That will depend on U.S. aid. "If the Americans leave the project, there will be a serious debate," says Gur, Rabin's deputy. So far, the Americans have been cautious not to be drawn into the debate. "U.S. decision-makers should understand that the signals they send today will have major ramifications for the Israeli approach to the Arrow program," says Marvin Feuerwerger in a 1991 study for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Still, the debate is already being felt in Washington and the result is that many in Congress and the Pentagon are beginning to wonder whether Israel wants the Arrow. Senator Daniel Inouye (Democrat-Hawaii) was confused as he made the rounds in Israel in July to warn officials that the project was in danger. As a Capitol Hill source put it: "From a purely political standpoint, for the U.S. to withdraw support for the Arrow now will send a very terrible signal now with regard to support for Israel's security and the peace process." Israeli sources said Inouye told Rabin that cancellation of Arrow would send the wrong signal to the Arabs. He said he didn't understand why so many military men were against the Arrow when the lion's share of the costs were paid by Washington. "If you don't know what you want, then I don't know how to help you," an Israeli source quoted Inouye as saying. Arens put it another way: "It's really a very daring assumption that the U.S. would continue to fund the missile if we are not definite about it." Bryen, the former Pentagon official, agrees. "The more the Israelis debate it, the more the U.S. will say, `Well, it's too controversial.' It's a self-fulfilling prophecy."
