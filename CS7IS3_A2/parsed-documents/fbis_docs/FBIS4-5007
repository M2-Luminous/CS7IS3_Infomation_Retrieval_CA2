FBIS4-5007 "dreas067__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-067-A Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Prospects, Strategy of Nomura Securities Prospects, Strategy of Nomura Securities 942A0098A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Mar 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0098A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Interview between Nomura Securities President Hideo Sakamaki and NIKKEI KINYU securities division reporter Akira Suzuki; place and date not given] [Text] Prospects for profitability on the part of securities firms have brightened, stock prices are gradually recovering, and the four leading securities firms will show recurring profits for the fiscal year ending in March 1994 for the first time in three years. On the other hand, the operating environment does not permit optimism in view of the decontrol of brokerage fees for high-volume transactions beginning in April of this year and the establishment of securities subsidiaries by city banks between July and November. We asked top officials of the leading securities firms for their management strategies to be used in operating their firms during this difficult period. [Suzuki] We understand that a specific numerical target was set for the first time at your department and branch managers conference for a return on equity of 3 percent. [Sakamaki] In my first three years as president I have placed importance on systems in terms of building a foundation. In the next three years, I will look for improvements in not only systems but in results as well. Establishment of specific goals will clearly define the direction in which we wish to head. A return on equity of 3 percent represents the average for companies whose stocks are listed on the exchanges, but we have a need to reach 100 billion yen in recurring profits. In the year ending March 1993, just over 10 firms attained recurring profits of 100 billion yen, but I do feel it is a reachable goal. [Suzuki] I understand you'll be implementing new managerial accounting and personnel systems. [Sakamaki] We can summarize a company president's work into accounting and personnel. The current personnel system was made over 20 years ago in 1970 and now contains a number of revisions which make it look like extensive patchwork. We must now modify the system so that recognition is given for productivity. The reason is that we face foreign securities firms' competition immediately next door. [Suzuki] The past several years have witnessed criticism that Nomura has not fulfilled its role as the industry leader. [Sakamaki] As an example, I do not believe that leadership consists of Nomura engaging in major stock transactions to be participated in by other securities firms. Rather, I believe leadership consists of Nomura, including its Nomura Research Institute, actively engaging itself in the development of new products and improvement of market features such as tax reform relative to securities. Development of new products does involve considerable cost, but it is a fact that we have contributed to the industry as a whole in this respect. [Suzuki] What sort of retail strategy have you prepared for the new fiscal year? [Sakamaki] We would like to beef up our research services in their second year and emphasize investments in securities on a scheduled [cost averaging] basis. Such accounts could easily total 3 million for the industry as a whole. Since we are seeing increasing volumes of financial instruments that pay only 1 percent in net return, there is greater appeal for investments in stocks of companies whose future prospects are improving. This year will witness a resumption of secondary offerings and an increase in initial public offerings. I think we will see increased liquidation of interlocking stock ownership. The next three to five years will require extraordinary efforts on the part of the industry to raise the ownership of stock by private individuals as a means to absorb stock made available through such liquidation. [Suzuki] What sort of strategy do you envision for overseas operations? [Sakamaki] The total valuation of stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange when I was hired by Nomura was about 2 trillion yen. We now have other Asian markets operating on a similar scale. Asia is now ripe for both human resource and capital investments. U.S. firms have clearly assumed a policy of establishing local subsidiaries. Our American subsidiaries employ 900 of which only 5 percent are Japanese. Our European subsidiaries have not been localized as much as our U.S. subsidiaries but our basic policy consists of localization of human resources and horizontal integration. [Suzuki] I assume you will cooperate in aid to Sanyo Securities and assist in its secondary offerings? [Sakamaki] Although Sanyo is not affiliated with Nomura, we have collaborated in the request for aid after obtaining confirmation of separate actions in the reconstruction of its nonbank element and the parent Sanyo. We will expeditiously determine that there are no financial problems and underwrite the stock offering. In any event, we hope that Sanyo will make quick progress towards recovery through self-help efforts. [Suzuki] What will be the effects of establishing securities subsidiaries by city banks? [Sakamaki] I believe it will become a case where the city banks encroached upon territory they considered greener pastures, but will find that they were in reality pastures remaining in decay forever, resulting in bad times for both banking and securities industries. We will engage in competition when appropriate, but as a special member of the Securities Dealers Association of Japan, we would like to see city bank securities subsidiaries cooperate with other securities firms in playing a confrontational role against parent banks in expanding direct financial markets. President Sakamaki looks back at the past three years and comments, "It was a period for changing the cultural aspects and building a new foundation for the company." If one is to consider his tenure of six years, he must use the next three years in building a new Nomura Securities on top of the foundation just built. The past several years have witnessed many accusations of "Nomura being a sleeping lion," and there were times when dissatisfaction was expressed by the younger company employees and former senior officials of the firm relative to its operations. (Future installments will be carried in General Financial News section.) One board member comments, "It would be normal to feel some doubt about one's management policies if he heard so much criticism, but Mr. Sakamaki was not affected in any way." A relief pitcher, suddenly designated as such just when the bases are loaded with no outs, endeavors to minimize errors and confidently begins pitching straight balls. President Sakamaki states, "Nomura has not increased its net worth since I became president. It's about time that we started making investments for the future." There is a feeling that we will see the return of a strong Nomura.
