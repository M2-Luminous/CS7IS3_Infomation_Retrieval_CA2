It observes in particular that the peoples of the North Caucasus and the south of Russia have greeted the end of the war with Abkhazia with great satisfaction. At the same time, the letter says, the threat of a new spiral of conflict has recently risen sharply. The attempt by certain Georgian forces to impose their will on the people of Abkhazia and deprive them of the opportunity to control their own lives as they see fit may bring to naught all that has been done by the joint efforts of the peoples of Russia, and lead to a new war which may prove to be even more embittered. At the same time numerous rallies are being held in the cities and settlements of Abkhazia. Its population is alarmed at the imminent signing of a treaty between Russia and Georgia which envisages the strengthening of Georgia's national army. The rally participants believe that this will create new preconditions for an escalation of hostilities. The quadripartite meeting on the problem of Georgian-Abkhazian relations, planned for this week in Sochi, has also been frustrated. It was planned that representatives of Russia and delegates from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees would take part in it. According to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the reason for the cancellation of the meeting is that it has not proved possible to sign in Moscow a multilateral agreement on refugees. The possible conclusion of a military alliance between Russia and Georgia is generating alarm in a number of regions of the Caucasus. As has become known from confidential sources close to the leadership of Abkhazia and the Confederation of Caucasus Peoples, if strong-arm pressure is applied to Abkhazia, the Confederation of Caucasus Peoples is prepared to send approximately 5,000-6,000 of its volunteers to defend it. Roughly the same number of volunteers may be activated on Russia's borders with Georgia which pass through the North Caucasus.
