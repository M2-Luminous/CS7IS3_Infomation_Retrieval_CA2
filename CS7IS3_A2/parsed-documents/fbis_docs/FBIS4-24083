This was decided on Wednesday [22 June] by the senate rules committee. President of the Senate, Mr Kobie Coetsee, asked the parties to submit their members' names to the parliamentary secretariat by noon on Thursday. He said experience would guide whether the grouping of the portfolios needed to be changed in future. Secretary to Parliament Mr Robin Douglas pointed out that according to a press statement by the speaker, debate on legislation was due to start next week. The African National Congress is to have six senators on each committee, the National Party two and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], Freedom Front and Democratic Party one each. Three house committees are also to be formed to deal with internal parliamentary arrangements, the library and catering facilities. Following complaints from Senator Naren Singh (IFP) about "untenable" office accommodation for his party, the committee resolved the matter would be addressed urgently by a delegation led by ANC chief whip Senator Bulelani Ngcuka. The committee concurred with a decision of the National Assembly's rules committee earlier this week that France's President Francois Mitterrand be formally invited to address a joint meeting of both houses during his state visit to South Africa next month. The address is to take place on Monday, July 4, at 11.30AM.
