According to correspondent Octavio Mulandi, very fierce clashes have taken place over the past 48 hours, with the aggressors suffering heavy losses. Mulandi said more clashes are expected in the coming days, taking into account yesterday's warmongering speech by the Futungo de Belas chief in an interview with the ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY. Eduardo dos Santos promised to recover strategically important regions in his struggle against the Angolan people. This morning, the MPLA-PT air force once again bombed agricultural fields and villages at Picapo, the correspondent said. Meanwhile, the UNITA Armed Forces are ready to prove to Eduardo dos Santos that it is foolish to mount offensives when parties are negotiating peace. This was stated by a UNITA captain interviewed on the front line in Bengo today.
