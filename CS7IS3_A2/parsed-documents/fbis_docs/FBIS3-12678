These vile crimes eloquently demonstrate the extremely racist nature of the Zionist enemy, which is hostile to all that is humanitarian and good in this world, while it brags about peaceful solutions. The Hebron massacre and the bloody confrontations that followed it in the occupied territories reaffirm our party's unwavering stand on the illusion of peace with the usurping enemy. They also represent further evidence of the principles that what has been taken by force can only be retrieved by force and that there is no final solution to the Palestinian issue other than the liberation of all its territories from Zionist desecration. Our party stresses that Zionists' ruses will not deceive the Arab people. There is nothing that can make us differentiate between the Zionist settlers' actions and the practices of the occupation gangs. All of them were involved in shedding Arab blood during the month of Ramadan in the Ibrahimi Mosque and in the steadfast towns of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is logical for Rabin to attempt to depict the bloody massacre as an action of an irresponsible individual and to ask the Palestinians to exercise self-restraint and not stage provocative acts against him?! However, it is shameful for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement describing the bloody massacre as part of the extremist acts that are engulfing the world, as if it is the government's duty to look for excuses and justifications that absolve the Zionist gangs from the martyrs' blood. Still worse is the Egyptian Government's determination to continue to deceive the Arabs and tame them so as to accept the humiliating capitulation to the Zionist enemy. These regrettable incidents have proved the weakness and naivete of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which places the Palestinian people firmly in the Zionist enemy's palm. They have destroyed for good all the illusions that have been propagated about living under the Zionist spears and among tense and racist settlements. It is a glaring idiocy for some Arab rulers to call on the Zionist enemy to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories when the occupation forces protected the killers while they broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and are still firing the bullets of treachery at the Arab demonstrators in every Palestinian village and town. The time has come for the Arab rulers to wake up from their slumber, stop squandering the rights of the Arab people in Palestine, shake off their submissiveness to U.S.-Zionist orders, and voluntarily abandon--before being forced to do so--the suspicious propagation of plans of capitulating to Zionist ambitions. Our party calls on the Arab masses to declare their anger, profess their solidarity with our kinsmen in the occupied territories through all available means, and fully condemn attempts to impose capitulation to Zionist ambitions. We call on the Arab masses to boycott all forms of normalization with the Zionist enemy. The NADP declares its full support for the Arab people's intifadah in Palestine, which is one of the noblest expressions of Arab rejection in an age of government subservience to Zionist arrogance.
