Michai Wirawaithaya, a former Thai cabinet official and anti-AIDS activist, said in Phnom Penh that AIDS poses a threat to Cambodia and is comparable to a big time bomb that will cause a tragedy if the Cambodian Government ignores its spread. Citing Thailand as an example, Michai said recognition of reality and of the importance of preventing AIDS will lead to a successful remedy of the problem. The successful Thai campaign to inform the public about AIDS prevention has reduced the contraction of AIDS in Thailand from 1,200 to 600 cases daily, or 50 percent prevention effectiveness. Michai plans to invite members of the Cambodian Government's National AIDS Prevention Committee to observe AIDS prevention efforts and the final stages of AIDS infection cases in Thailand. On cooperation with Laos, Dr. Siriwat Thiptharawadon, the Nong Khai Province public health officer, said that in order to cope with contagious diseases -- including AIDS -- that will follow the increased convenience of travel between Thailand and Laos after the April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, Nong Khai Province will stage a medical and public health seminar with 75 Thai and Lao officials concerned with the control of contagious diseases. The seminar is aimed at formulating suggestions, ways, and plans to combat contagious diseases along the Thai-Lao border, particularly after the opening of the Friendship Bridge. It is also aimed at increasing understanding among these officials in control of contagious diseases and effecting coordination between the two countries in case of epidemics.
