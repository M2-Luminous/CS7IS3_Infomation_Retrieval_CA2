Following his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today, Sha'th said: We will not budge an inch from our demand that Jerusalem be the Palestinian state's eternal capital. Sha'th criticized the Israeli authorities' closure of the Gaza Strip, regarding this act as a violation of the clauses of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in form and substance. He added: We are doing our utmost to implement the agreement and avoid the Israeli authorities' provocations in the Jericho area. Addressing Rabin, Sha'th said the Palestinians will not accept errors or tolerate them under any circumstances. Sha'th urged the Arab League and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to continue their backing for the Palestinian National Authority and the PLO. He remarked that the Palestinians need help for the next five years, particularly in the political and economic spheres. Sha'th said he discussed with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid the Arab League's role in the coming days. He specified this role as moving on three fronts, involving in the first place continued Arab backing for the Palestinians' legitimate rights, overcoming any hurdles obstructing the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement, and assistance in handling the still inscrutable Israeli position. He added that Palestine is the only Arab country that suffers a total occupation of its territory, noting that Gaza and Jericho are a first step but the remaining Palestinian territories are still occupied. Sha'th said the second front involves greater financial assistance from the Arab funds and the third is political and media backing for the Palestinian issue at international forums. He announced that the negotiations with Israel will be resumed very soon.
