Yugoslav deputy health minister Svetlana Arsenic told the UN children's committee here that despite provisions to allow medical equipment into Yugoslavia, the sanctions had denied vital medical equipment to thousands of ordinary people. The embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro was imposed by the United Nations in May 1992 to punish Belgrade for supporting Serb aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Children have been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of medical equipment and drugs and 15,000 have died as a result, the Yugoslav minister said. If the UN agrees to an exception for medical equipment, "even the smallest imports" are subject to complicated bureaucratic procedures at the UN sanctions committee in New York, Arsenic said. "The examination of a large number of requests is constantly delayed and put back," she said. Yugoslavia's ambassador to Geneva, Vladimir Pavicevic, said that because of the impact of the sanctions, Belgrade can no longer apply the UN convention on children's rights. Sanctions against Yugoslavia have caused a sharp fall in medical cover available with some of the most vulnerable being the 3.2 million children in the region, 200,000 of whom are war refugees "of all nationalities", Arsenic added. In several areas of Yugoslavia, the death rate has risen above the birth rate, she added, suggesting that this jeopardised "the very survival of the Yugoslav people."
