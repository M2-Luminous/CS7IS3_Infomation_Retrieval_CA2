The following is a dispatch from our correspondent at the Presidential Palace: Mr. Pelletreau expected Arab-Israeli negotiations to resume toward the end of April. After meeting the president he stressed that American support for the Lebanese Government as it moves to bolster Lebanese national unity will continue. [passage omitted] Earlier, Pelletreau visited Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz. [passage omitted] At the end of the meeting, Minister Buwayz made the following statement: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has Mr. Pelletreau brought any new positions on the bilateral peace negotiations [words indistinct]? [Buwayz] Mr. Pelletreau's visit is part of new American efforts to get the peace process moving. It follows various consultations with the parties involved in the negotiations. The United States is willing to give a new impetus to this process. Perhaps this needs additional intensive consultations at the level of the U.S. secretary of state. [Correspondent] Have the discussions dealt with the explosive situation in the south? [Buwayz] Yes. The talks touched on this situation and on repeated Israeli aggression, through which, we believe, Israel is (?harming) the peace process at the same time it is engaged in negotiations. There are also suspicions about internal interferences in this regard. [Correspondent] [question indistinct] [Buwayz] There is a climate that effectively means holding contacts [words indistinct] officials. I do not think that this round has been decided yet. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did you discuss the continued U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon? [Buwayz] I believe that the latest American decision includes some signs that the American position is changing. These include the period [word indistinct] the decision, which is shorter than that of earlier decisions, and certain phrases that suggest that this period will be used to reconsider the ban. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, it is known that you are leaving for Cairo today to attend the Arab League Council meeting. The Arab boycott against Israel is on the agenda. What do you expect from this? [Buwayz] We believe the boycott was a result of a state of war. Lifting it should be a result of a state of peace. Making progress at the negotiations and reaching a declaration of principles that makes us believe that peace is becoming final and real will effectively and legally end the boycott. But abolishing the boycott theoretically while the state of war in the Middle East continues, I believe, will be only a (?theoretical) decision. At any rate, we believe that the boycott is a feature of the Arab-Israeli conflict and must be discussed within a comprehensive framework for peace. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the foreign ministers of the Arab cordon states in Cairo? [Buwayz] It is customary for the meetings of the cordon states to be held independently from other regional or international meetings. This, however, does not mean that consultations or preparatory meetings in Cairo are not possible. But I think that any such meetings will only be in preparation for a coordination meeting, which may be held either in Cairo or in [words indistinct] independent from the Arab League meeting. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is it true that Washington asked Lebanon to calm the [word indistinct] situation through negotiations? [Buwayz] The U.S. policy toward this subject is steady; [?it always asks] the Lebanese Government to calm the situation and control things in the south. This is nothing new, but there is no exceptional interference in [words indistinct] [Correspondent] Do you think the internal security situation will affect the negotiating delegation or the Lebanese-Israeli negotiations? [Buwayz] Since the beginning of the negotiations, we have been eager to secure for the negotiating delegation a sort of immunity against all internal changes. I believe this climate is necessary for the delegation to continue the negotiations in the best way. Anyway, I believe [words indistinct] or negatively affect the performance. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you share the view that the private radio and television newscasts threatened state security? [Buwayz] I believe a country like Lebanon, which is living in the middle of a volcano in this region, cannot continue to have a disorganized security, media, and democracy. From this perspective, I think that we cannot live in a more easygoing and freer atmosphere than in Switzerland, France, or Britain. We live in a very turbulent area. Therefore, I believe that organizing the media through a clear and frank law will return matters to normal and to an acceptable level of freedom and democracy commensurate with the internal situation and the homeland's security. In any case, I believe this principle is not new or exclusive to Lebanon. Freedom, if it is abused, hurts others. There is an acceptable level of freedom that guarantees the freedom of others, their rights, and the rights of the homeland. Therefore, a well-studied law that is based on the principle of freedom and democracy -- which are basic in Lebanon and are the pillars of this homeland -- and that will place controls and checks to ensure that this freedom will not become an attack on the homeland will resolve this situation.
