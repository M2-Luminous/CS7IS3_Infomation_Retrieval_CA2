All levels of party, government, and agricultural departments should, without exception, put the agriculture-oriented science and technology in the first place and make a great breakthrough in research, development, and utilization of agriculture-oriented science and technology. Comrade Jiang Chunyun has been extremely concerned with the work of agriculture-oriented science and technology. Since 1986, he has traveled to the provincial academy of agriculture science on four occasions to conduct investigations, resolve problems, and guide the work. Early on the morning of 1 May, Jiang Chunyun and Vice Governor Wang Jiangong again led responsible persons of pertinent provincial-level departments to this academy to handle affairs on the spot. They viewed the vegetable research institute, the central laboratory, the crop science and technology development department, the institute for research in atomic energy application, and the wheat varieties exhibition center of the academy. They asked questions while viewing and highly praised many high science and technology items that were under researches. When seeing the wheat grinder that is advanced in the world, Jiang Chunyun encouraged (Zhao Zhidong), researcher of the vegetable research institute, to seek cooperation with foreign traders and try the best to bring in, master, and apply advanced foreign technologies in an effort to develop and produce the advanced agriculture-oriented scientific and technological equipment of our own. On 1 May, International Laborers' Day, Jiang Chunyun extended festive greetings to hard-working scientific and technological workers wherever he went, and extended cordial regards and lofty respects to laborers on all fronts of the province on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government.

Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Now, the province's agriculture is precisely at the critical moment of embarking on a new stage. To develop a high-yield, fine-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, we must depend to a large extent on science and technology, In developing agriculture, we must depend on science and technology to resolve problems. He called on top party and government leaders at all levels to pay attention to the primary productive force, put the agriculture-oriented science and technology in the first place, actually grasp the research, development, and application of agriculture-oriented science and technology with a view to promoting the large-scale development of agriculture. Jiang Chunyun also expressed hope that the provincial academy of agriculture science would carry forward achievements and advance on the crest of a victory. In the next step, the academy should make a new breakthrough in research of agricultural science, should, in particular, achieve even more notable results in the research of biological projects, should make a new breakthrough in development, popularization, and application of advanced technologies, and should translate even more scientific and technological research results into practical productive forces. At the same time, the academy should make a new breakthrough in studying and introducing advanced domestic and world technologies in order to make even greater contributions to accelerating the progress of the provincial agriculture-oriented science and technology and promoting the large-scale development of agriculture.
