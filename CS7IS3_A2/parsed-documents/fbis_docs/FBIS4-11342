[Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...agree that the upcoming elections are of special importance for the future of the country. Mexican society demands a strengthened democracy for peace, unity, and justice. Democracy requires legality, impartiality, and transparency in the elections. Democracy also requires the promotion of dialogue and respectful debate among those who aspire to the presidency of the republic. All the presidential candidates have expressed their willingness to publicly debate ideas and programs. Luis Donaldo Colosio was the first to call for a debate. I have personally reiterated at different campaign rallies my desire to hold a debate. I trust that throughout the campaign there will be an opportunity to discuss our positions with all candidates from all parties. Therefore, I now respectfully invite Diego Fernandez de Zevallos and Engineer Cuahutemoc Cardenas to discuss as soon as possible and in public our ideas and political programs. The citizens' demand and the expressed willingness of the contenders make it possible that the debate be held as soon as possible. Therefore, I expect a prompt response from Fernandez de Zevallos and Engineer Cardenas. I propose the debate be carried live by radio and television in a format of unquestionable impartiality, transparency, and fairness. I propose one single broadcast that can be received and transmitted by all radio and television stations that wish to join be used, without favoring any specific enterprise. In addition, conditions must be established so that representatives of the print media can cover the debate to their full satisfaction. I believe that to make the debate a fair political exercise and fruitful for citizens, the candidates must have equal time to explain their ideas. Additionally, we must have the opportunity to comment on the responses from the other candidates and issue an opening and final statement. A moderator of absolute integrity and recognized impartiality would help candidates adjust to the time allotted. This would be the first debate among presidential candidates in Mexico's modern history. Holding the debate would give all citizens the opportunity to learn directly about our ideas and programs as well as allow the public a respectful exchange of ideas. Above all else, holding this debate would strengthen our democracy because it would permit voters to compare the different political programs in order to select freely among them. I am fully confident the debate will make it clear that my party has the best program to secure Mexicans a future of well-being, democracy, and justice. I am fully confident public opinion will be able to confirm that the PRI's candidacy to the presidency of the republic offers the leadership, service experience, and social sensibility required to achieve the progress of Mexico. Many thanks. [end recording]
