FR940504-0-00060 FR940504-0-00015 The Amendment also modifies the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR, when the allowable recreational coho allocation for the entire area is equal to or less than 167,000 fish. The Amendment establishes two subareas with independent impact quotas to ensure that a large southward shift in the recreational harvest does not occur. Of the total recreational allocation, the subarea from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, Oregon, receives 70 percent and the subarea south of Humbug Mountain receives 30 percent, the purpose being to avoid large deviations from historical harvest shares. The two subareas will be managed for their respective impact quotas; the recreational fisheries for coho salmon in each area may be closed upon attainment of the quota except for the area south of Point Arena, California (38 ○57 ’30 ’ ’ N. lat.). South of Humbug Mountain, there are two additional conditions: (1) An impact guideline of 3 percent of the overall recreational allocation south of Cape Falcon will be applied from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California; and (2) the recreational fishery for coho salmon will not be closed south of Point Arena, even if the fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena is closed, upon projected attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota; but the projected harvest through the end of the year will be included in the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota. Quota transfers between subareas are allowed on a one-for-one basis, but only if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. At its March 8&hyph;11, 1994, meeting the Council considered and adopted management options for annual ocean salmon fisheries under the assumption that the Amendment and its implementing regulations would be in place when coastwide ocean salmon fishing seasons open on May 1, 1994, as regularly scheduled. During this meeting, the Council clarified its intent regarding the fishing allowed when the spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 coho per mile in the standard index areas. Under the existing plan, no fishing would have been allowed at that level of spawner escapement. This is a standard that is more restrictive than under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which allows some incidental take of listed stocks. Therefore, the Amendment will allow an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent that will provide only the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock. This standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable harm replaces other allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28 spawners per mile. Implementation of the Amendment requires changes to the regulatory language in the Appendix to 50 CFR part 661. The only change to the proposed regulations published on February 2, 1994, clarifies this issue of allocation at low spawner levels by adding language in paragraph 2(b)(i) of Appendix section II.B.
