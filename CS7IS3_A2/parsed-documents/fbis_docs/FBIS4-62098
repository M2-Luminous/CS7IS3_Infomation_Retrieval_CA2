The document envisions mutually advantageous terms of technical and material assistance, and the provision of scientific and technical information. This event was preceded by another, no less important event -- a 750-kilovolt power transmission line originating at the "Belorusskaya" substation at the Smolensk AES was put in operation. The 750-kilovolt power transmission line was constructed jointly by builders and operation personnel of Smolensk's Desnogorsk and of Belorussia. A large group of builders and operation personnel of the Smolensk AES were awarded certificates of honor of Belorussia's Supreme Soviet and the Ministry of Power Engineering for this successful work.
