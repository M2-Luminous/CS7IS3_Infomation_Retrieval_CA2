Tietmeyer also called for a new relationship between growth and employment, and said that social support in Europe discouraged the creation of jobs. Tietmeyer told the World Economic Forum here that his unequivocal message was that there should be no experiments in policies to combat inflation. Expansionist monetary policy could not be used to fight unemployment, he said. There was no alternative to rectification of structural causes of under employment. He also warned against sliding budget deficits in Europe, holding that a stable monetary policy which left no room for inflation had to be linked to budgetary policies which did not lead later to an increase in taxation. Tietmeyer posed the question of how to reduce the budget deficit without bearing down unduly on demand. The problem was how to do it at the appropriate time while being credible about the fact that the deficit would be reduced. Growth was necessary in dealing with unemployment, but growth alone was not sufficient. A new relationship between growth and employment was needed. In European countries there were too many encouragements to be unemployed and these should be replaced by incitement to work. He blamed rigidity in the labour market, a lack of flexibility in pay rates and a system of social welfare which discouraged the creation of jobs.
