Take notice that on May 18, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;553&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon the transportation of natural gas for Natural Gas pipeline Company of America (Natural) which was authorized in Docket No. CP79&hyph;167&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CIG proposes to abandon its transportation service of up to 5,000 Mcf per day for Natural, from the Bunker Hill area of Carbon County, Wyoming. Natural no longer has gas available from this area. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before June 14, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CIG to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
