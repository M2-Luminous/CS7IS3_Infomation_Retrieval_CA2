A succession of civil conflicts, an orgy of crime, and political instability are calling in question the very existence of the unified independent state. The living standard has fallen as far as it can: with a subsistence minimum of 4 million coupons, the actual minimum wage constitutes 50,000; 97 percent of the population is living below the poverty line, and for a long time the basic foodstuffs have for the majority been bread and tea. The orgy of crime is making everyday life unbearable, and almost every male aged between 16 and 60 has a gun. The Georgian government is making desperate attempts to push back the impending chaos, but the ambitions of the leaders of the opposition, the division of society, the clan contradictions, and the domination of the mafia groups are making any constructive work inordinately difficult. In the opinion of Vakhtang Rcheushvili, vice speaker of parliament, it is essential that the republic, in order to cope with the crisis, define its foreign policy reference points, strive for economic stabilization, and curb the violence. Membership of the CIS and a return to the orbit of Russian influence could contribute to the accomplishment of these tasks to some extent, unless the mere fact of them serves to intensify the division of society. The opposition in Georgia is composed of parties whose existence--in the apt observation of parliamentary deputy G. Lordkipanidze--"becomes totally meaningless without the `Down With Russia' slogan." A characteristic example of such nationalist propaganda is afforded by the recent appeal to the Georgian people of the National Independent Party, which makes demands for the "de-occupation" of Georgia, the immediate resignation of Shevardnadze and his ministers, and the creation of a coalition government of "pro-West, anti-Russian, national, and democratic forces" and also proclaims that "the elections held in Russia showed Moscow's true colors," that Russia cannot be a democratic state, and that "anyone who supports Georgia's integration in the CIS or, in any form, Georgia's continuation in the sphere of influence of Russiashould be declared an enemy of state interests and the Georgian nation." Nor, equally, in the Georgian government, meanwhile, is there any unity on questions of the expediency of participation in the work of the structures of the Commonwealth. In the course of the December conflict between Security Minister Igor Giorgadze and Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili--a conflict which once again brought Georgia to the brink of civil war--Giorgadze accused Karkarashvili, specifically, of having thwarted the negotiations on a defense alliance in Ashgabat. The fact that both ministers were until recently still in office (a statement of Georgiy Karkarashvili, in which he announces his resignation, was carried in the Georgian press on 1 February) testifies that the most varied approaches to the problem of Georgia's introduction to the CIS are represented in the highest echelons of power (Giorgadze and Karkarashvili represent particular clans and groups, of course, but Georgia's situation is such that each group has integral interests and, correspondingly, integral notions concerning the political program). Serious problems for Shevardnadze are being created also by the "special position" of the National Democratic Party of Georgia [NDPGr], which has the largest party parliamentary faction. At the Sixth National Democratic Party of Georgia Congress at the end of December 1993, membership of the CIS was seen as an "abdication of responsibility for Georgia's future," and addressing a meeting of the Europarliament, Gia Chanturia, the chairman of the party and well-known Georgian dissident, called for a weakening of Russia's influence in the republics of the former USSR and predicted for Georgia the role of some bridge between East and West. Evaluating the results of Shevardnadze's course as a failure in all spheres of foreign and domestic policy, the national democrats, who have supported the head of state since his return to Georgia, advocated a change of government and parliamentary elections no later than the spring of 1994. Chanturia declared that withdrawal from the government and the objections in principle to the policy of the authorities do not signify the NDPGr's switch to the opposition, but this does not make it any easier for Shevardnadze since he is deprived of the support of a most influential political party. In addition, certain prominent figures who performed leading roles in Georgia in 1992-1993, Tengiz Sigua, for example, have also opposed membership of the CIS. There is quite a banal paradox: easing the political opposition is possible only to the detriment of practical interests. The bitter nature of the polemic surrounding Georgian-Russian relations is largely connected with another most acute question--the problem of the republic's territorial integrity. The position of Russia (or of certain circles in Russia) at the time of the Abkhaz war was taken very hard in Georgia, and the conflict surrounding South Ossetia equally affects the very essence of relations between the two countries, but the greatest significance is attached to the situation in Ajaria, Georgia's sole autonomy, where peace and a certain stability have been preserved amid the Georgian disturbances. Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ajaria, has said repeatedly that he cannot conceive of a Georgia outside of an alliance with Russia, and people from the ranks of those closest to him make no secret of the fact that relations between Moscow and Batumi will intensify and strengthen regardless of the positions of the central leadership in Tbilisi. The leaders of Georgia's national radicals are inclined to see in Abashidze's firmness the "hand of Moscow" and are exploiting in every possible way the theme of a repetition of the "Abkhaz scenario" in Ajaria, but, and this is typical of the current situation in Georgia, they are by no means endeavoring to look for a compromise and reconsider their views for the sake of civil peace and the unity of the country. Zurab Zhvania, chairman of the Green Party, just about the most serious independent politician and a decisive supporter of Shevardnadze's policy, once observed: "Georgia's tragedy is that the political confrontation is unfolding against the background of the struggle of mafia clans, an unprecedented flowering of corruption, and the domination of consumerism in all walks of life, that is, a total crisis of the civil society." A revival of the healthy self-awareness of the nation, the restoration of a normal moral climate, and a simplification of the political situation are becoming most important tasks, which (however utopian this may be for spiritual questions) have to be tackled by political methods. It is possible that the formation of the Georgian Citizens' Union (SGG), a new grassroots organization founded in December 1993 by several of the country's top politicians for the purpose of erecting a barrier in the way of petty political demagogy and ensuring support for constructive constitutional, economic, and cultural work, will contribute to a certain brightening of the situation. The idea of the need for a large association which could assume responsibility for the country's future was first expressed a year ago by David Berdzenishvili, a leader of the Republican Party, but Shevardnadze showed no enthusiasm for such projects throughout 1993. Only after the arguments about Georgia's membership of the CIS had shown that the search for concord among politicians was doomed to fail did the head of state consent to head the Citizens' Union. "At this critical time," Georgiy Baramidze, a member of parliament from the Greens and deputy chairman of the SGG, declared, "the best part of Georgia's political spectrum has resolved to unite around a man personifying a specific policy," whose authority "was a tremendous stimulus to the consolidation of all constructive forces of Georgian society." The cementing role in the Citizens' Union was performed by the Green Party, whose leader simultaneously holds the position of vice president of the European Green Association, and also the Party of Peace and Freedom (Afghan veterans), whose chairman, Nodar Giorgadze, former instructor of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League Central Committee, who was responsible in Kabul for ties to Afghan youth, retains his decisive influence on the organizations of Afghan war veterans in Georgia (11,000 persons), and also the Tbilisi Citizens' Union (the Tbiliso Society), which rendered Shevardnadze decisive support in the critical fall days of 1993. The creation of the Citizens' Union has evoked harsh opposition criticism: Nodar Notadze, leader of the People's Front, called the new organization "red-brown" and claimed that its very existence is a threat to the foundations of Georgian democracy. I. Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence Party, accused the Union's activists of a "betrayal of the interests of the motherland" and so forth. Georgiy Baramidze, deputy chairman of the SGG, treats such philippics with composure. He is convinced that only a large all-Georgia organization arranged along territorial lines is capable of universal constructive activity and can serve as a model of the future Georgian society; Baramidze surmised that the hour when Georgia once again values not an ability to shoot from an automatic weapon or juggle slogans but an ability to work with people is not far off. The political situation in many republics of the former USSR, in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia primarily, confirms once again the old idea that public institutions and power structures that are optimal for European countries with a stable political culture could prove disastrous or ineffective for states that are experiencing an entirely different inheritance. Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of Georgia, is attempting to find ways of reining in the chaos without resorting to dictatorship here and without abandoning the gains of democracy, but he is constantly encountering difficulties connected with the moral state of society. Under these conditions only a policy capable of ensuring a synthesis of national tradition and the experience of the Soviet period and the mechanisms of government and values of the end of the 20th century could guarantee a way out of the crises.
