Handing this report to the IAEA in Vienna, he said that the agency's inspectors very freely inspected all of Iran's nuclear installations in Aban [month ending 21 November] and that officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran actively cooperated with this delegation. The IAEA chief said that this delegation's inspection of Iran's nuclear installations was an important step toward removing existing false ideas on the nuclear programs of some countries. This is not the first time that the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic's nuclear programs have been confirmed by the IAEA. Previously too, the IAEA sent delegations to inspect our country's nuclear installations and those delegations also emphasized the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs. The IAEA's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is the clearest answer that can be given to babblings by hegemonistic powers that ignore that agency's reports and have always tried to falsely accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to mask their own support for the nuclear arsenals of the regime occupying Jerusalem. Last year IAEA chief Hans Blix stated that Israel should also be included among the places where nuclear weapons are to be dismantled as part of the Middle East peace process. He stated that an area free from nuclear weapons requires that Israel also abandon its nuclear capability. Nevertheless, under pressures from America and other Western powers that support the regime occupying Palestine, he has never been able to send investigation teams to occupied Palestine. Hans Blix's remarks clearly refer to the existence of nuclear weapons in occupied Palestine and to the Zionists' opposition to any effort to send delegations there. For years now the Zionists have been investing immensely on nuclear projects in occupied Palestine with American support. They are receiving all types of financial and technical support from the Americans in the manufacture of such weapons. Not only have the Zionists not hidden there efforts and the American support for their nuclear programs, but they have even very impudently been boasting about their progress in these projects. With America's political support, they are the only party to the Middle East compromise talks that is refusing to allow international teams to inspect their nuclear installations. This is a fact of which all the Arab regimes longing for peace with the regime occupying Jerusalem are aware; and Hans Blix and other high- ranking IAEA officials have also admitted this on several occasions during their visits to Middle East countries. The fact is that if it is the IAEA's duty to prevent non-peaceful nuclear projects around the world, then it should begin to confront those governments that disregard all limitations on the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Americans and the Zionists have repeatedly proven with their actions that they do not recognize any laws, criteria, or commitments on the use of weapons of mass destruction or in perpetrating crimes against the human lives. Therefore, these are the governments that deserve stricter pressures by world forums. If international laws and world commitments are so easily trampled on by impudent regimes that are not punished for their acts and if laws do not differentiate between obedient and disobedient governments, what our world recognizes as universal law will be nothing more than mere words on paper that only take up space in the archives of international bodies. The IAEA should be able to prove with its actions that it is not affected by pressures from any side.
