Kakizawa told a meeting of the government's task force for administrative reforms held at the official residence of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata that Japan should promote deregulation in response to growing calls from overseas. He noted that Japan and the United States have agreed to drop discussions on so-called "numerical targets" for Japanese imports of American products in resumed negotiations on a new framework for bilateral trade. Kakizawa said deregulation should also be implemented in the expanding information and communications industry to promote competition on the market. He said Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British Broadcasting Corp. are building up their footholds in Asia and Japan should join them in the race.
