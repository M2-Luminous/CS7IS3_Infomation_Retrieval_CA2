FR940516-0-00069 FR940516-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Parts 710, 712, 713, and 720 [FHWA Docket No. 93&hyph;7] RIN 2125&hyph;AD09 Removal of Obsolete and Redundant Right-of-Way Requirements AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule eliminates a number of FHWA prior approvals previously required in the acquisition of real property for Federal-aid highway projects. Consistent with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), this approach reduces the regulatory burden for States and encourages greater flexibility by reducing the degree to which the FHWA will be involved in the development of Federal-aid highway projects. DATES: This regulation is effective June 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald B. Saunders, Chief, Operations Division, Office of Right-of-Way, HRW&hyph;20, (202) 366&hyph;0142; or Reid Alsop, Office of Chief Counsel, HCC&hyph;31, (202) 366&hyph;1371. The address is Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule modifies several provisions in the FHWA's right-of-way regulations that require the FHWA to grant prior approvals or authorizations for particular actions by a State. These case-by-case approvals will no longer be required and will be replaced by a one-time FHWA approval of State procedures. Oversight by the FHWA will continue through the use of process reviews. In the future, prior approvals may be reinstituted if they are found to be necessary to protect the Federal investment. As a result of a review of the FHWA's right-of-way regulations, the Office of Right-of-Way identified a number of requirements that imposed burdens on States without commensurate program benefit. The review disclosed a number of case-by-case approval actions that, based on experience, were no longer necessary to protect the investment of Federal-aid highway funds. These approval actions are divided into the two categories set forth below. The first category includes six FHWA approvals or authorizations. The State may now take the approval or authorization actions required by the following sections if they are in accordance with procedures that have been approved by the FHWA. ␣ 1Approval action 123 CFR section Use of fee negotiators 710.203(e)(3) Interest on right of entry payments 710.304(j)(5) Use of fee attorneys 712.408(a) Land service facilities 712.805(c)(1) Temporary use of right-of-way 713.103(h)(1) Appraisal fees 720.202(d)(2) The second category includes four FHWA approvals that are eliminated on all FHWA-funded projects except those on the National Highway System (NHS). These concern the long-term use or disposal of rights-of-way and are no longer considered necessary or useful on a case-by-case basis for non-NHS projects. The FHWA will continue case-by-case approvals or authorizations relating to the use or disposal of NHS rights-of-way, consistent with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 106(b)(2) which require that a higher level of FHWA oversight be maintained on the NHS. Accordingly, the authorization actions required by the following sections may be taken by the State if they are in accordance with procedures that have been approved by the FHWA, except with regard to facilities or projects that are on the National Highway System (NHS), described in 23 U.S.C. 103. The FHWA approvals or authorizations that are prescribed by the following sections continue to be required with regard to facilities or projects on the NHS because of FHWA's special interest in the integrity and safety of NHS facilities and right-of-way. ␣ 1Approval action 123 CFR section Non-highway use and occupancy of right-of-way 712.203(b)(1) Airspace agreements 713.204 Disposal of right-of-way no longer needed 713.305 Disposal of access-control and relinquishment of right-of-way 620.203(d) through (l) On July 21, 1993, the FHWA published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) concerning the above provisions of FHWA's right-of-way regulations (58 FR 38987). The FHWA received three comments on the NPRM, all from State Departments of Transportation. All three commenters supported in varying degrees the proposed changes. Two commenters indicated that the proposed changes would increase their flexibility or simplify their right-of-way programs. The third anticipated a slight decrease in paperwork and a subsequent saving of time. We received no negative comments. Furthermore, none of the three commenters suggested any changes in the language of the NPRM. Accordingly, the language of the final rule is unchanged from that proposed in the NPRM. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. The rulemaking would not affect the level of funding available in Federal or federally-assisted programs covered by the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4610 et seq. ), or otherwise have a significant economic impact; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since it will make relatively small changes in existing regulatory provisions by eliminating certain FHWA prior approvals. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. This action, in effect, both clarifies and simplifies current regulatory requirements.
