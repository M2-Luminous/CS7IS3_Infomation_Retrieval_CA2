After the meeting they informed Ukrainian and foreign journalists about the main subjects of the conversation. The opposition leader informed the ambassador in detail about the purpose of Rukh's activity and shared his views on the current political situation. Vyacheslav Chornovil said about the Supreme Council resolution of 3 February that "although Ukraine was not even preparing to become a member of the Nuclear Club, the rate and conditions of forced disarmament were determined without taking into account the interests of the Ukrainian side." However, observed the Rukh chairman, it is still not too late to correct the situation with additional agreements. Replying to William Miller's question regarding Rukh's attitude to the latest events in the Crimea, the opposition leader stressed that the creation of a territorial autonomy, and moreover, the holding of presidential elections vividly show the incapability of Ukraine's leadership, headed by Leonid Kravchuk, to secure territorial integrity or to build a unified independent Ukraine. William Miller, the U.S. ambassador, expressed concern at the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the deputy chairman of Rukh. "His disappearance is a tragedy, and it is very unfortunate that no one is reporting information about the fate of this person," noted the diplomat. The ambassador did not say a single word about an increase in U.S. assistance to Ukraine after the signing of the trilateral statement, which Leonid Kravchuk and Anatoliy Zlenko spoke about in the Supreme Council on 3 February.
