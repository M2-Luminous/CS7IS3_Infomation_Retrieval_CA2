Such rigmarole of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is nothing but a disgusting jargon of a political mountabank aimed at prettifying his disgraceful records woven with arch crimes of flunkeyism and treachery, fascism and repression, division and confrontation and, at the same time, at dampening the unyielding fighting spirit of the South Korean people who decisively rose in struggle to topple the "civilian" regime, and at maintaining at any cost the colonial puppet regime now driven to the crisis of destruction. The traitor openly revealed his wicked intention of division and confrontation when he took issue with the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the North, arguing in a far-fetched manner that "the North's nuclear problem is a stumbling block in the way of reunification". This time he made a gesture as if he were intending to bring about any change in the North-South relations, saying "the North has no nukes" and he "would promote summit talks when the talks could be considered helpful to checking the North's nuclear development". This means, in the final analysis, that he admitted of his own accord that his clique's criminal "policy against the North" in the last one hear was wrong. His attempt to find a solution to the North-South relations by taking issue with the North's "nuclear problem" cannot be construed otherwise than a mode of thinking of a stupid fellow running about like a headless chicken, lost to reason. The Korean nation will never pardon the foolish Kim Yong-sam group, the source of national disaster which is nonspiring with outside forces to harm and stifle the same fellow countrymen, engaging itself in fascism, suppression, division and confrontation.
