The message says: "The faction of deputies of the Saeima or parliament, `For Fatherland and Freedom', considers it necessary to call your attention to the fact that issues of ethnic minorities and terms of granting citizenship are quite different, completely separate things. It is recognised that `an ethnic minority' is a term generally applied to those citizens of a country who do not belong to the indigenous population of the country. The number of such people in Latvia equals to 365,043 which amounts to more than 20 percent of the total of citizens. They are granted all citizen rights, moreover, the minority groups are also given large opportunities to develop their cultural autonomy. Thus there is no particular problems with ethnic minorities in Latvia." "Meanwhile Latvia does face problems concerned with foreign nationals which have come to this country during the years of occupation, and their descendants. In violation of internationally recognised laws the invader country, the former Soviet Union, has brought a vast number of its civilians into the occupied country. Russia, which nominally has taken over the commitments of the former Soviet Union, is seeking to put an international pressure on Latvia in a bid to make it legalize consequences of occupation and colonization, instead of providing means for repatriation of the people transferred here under the occupation. Regrettably, those groundless claims have been met with understanding and encouragement also in some influential international bodies, as it is shown by your recommendations to Latvia, which would help to maintain political influence of Moscow here, endorsing it to pursue criminal policy of Stalin and Hitler. The faction 'For Fatherland and Freedom' calls on you to not only to counsel Latvia, but also to exercise your authority to ensure the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to voice as strong a support to repatriation of the persons transferred to Latvia under the occupation, as it is voting to the demand for Russian troops pull-out, as well as to provide a wide political and financial aid to the process." One of the reasons for writing the letter was the fact that the high commissioner who is visiting Latvia, has scheduled meetings with representatives of various factions of the Latvian parliament, but he, incidentally, failed to slate talks with the faction "Fatherland and Freedom."
