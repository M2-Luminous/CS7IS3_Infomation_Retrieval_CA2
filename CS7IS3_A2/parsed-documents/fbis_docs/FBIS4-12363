FBIS4-12363 "drnes068_c_94012" FBIS-NES-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Egypt Islamic Groups' Conditions for Ending Violence Given Islamic Groups' Conditions for Ending Violence Given NC0704080094 Cairo AL-'ARABI in Arabic 4 Apr 94, p 4 NC0704080094 Cairo AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Text] Lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat announced at the Lawyers Association last week the conditions of the political violence groups, better known as the "Islamic Group" and the "al-Jihad Group," for ending the acts of violence in Egypt, which al-Zayyat described as "reactions" to the authority's violence. Al-Zayyat called for giving the "religious groups" freedom to express their opinions peacefully, unconditionally releasing all members of these groups who are detained, stopping referring defendants to military courts, and enabling what he described as "Islamic preachers" to practice and express their views through all means. Al-Zayyat, a lawyer representing defendants belonging to the religious current, claimed that there is no animosity between the "Islamic groups" and Copts and that they are not against tourism in Egypt. He justified the recent bombings by saying that they were meant only to put pressure on the government. Al-Zayyat's remarks came in a seminar organized by the Youth Committee of the Lawyers Association.
