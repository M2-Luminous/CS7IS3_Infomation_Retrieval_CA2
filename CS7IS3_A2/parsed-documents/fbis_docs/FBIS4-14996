FBIS4-14996 "drsov066_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Latvia Russia Said `Neglecting' Airspace Accord Russia Said `Neglecting' Airspace Accord WS0504201194 Tallinn BNS in English 1750 GMT 5 Apr 94 WS0504201194 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 05, BNS -- Russia is neglecting the June 2, 1993, agreement with Latvia on the use of the Latvian airspace by Russian military aircraft, officials said. Moreover, Russia proposed the Latvian Communication Ministry to sign a new agreement which provides for free use of the airspace and airport services, said Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau monitoring the Russian troop withdrawal. The Russia-proposed agreement also foresees free movement for aircraft that brings its troops out of Germany. Under the earlier, neglected document, Russia must pay Latvia for services in accordance with the Communication Ministry tariffs. In total, Russia owes more than 25,500 lats to the Riga airport and 251,500 U.S. dollars to the Latvian Air Communication enterprise. Russia wants to start all calculations of arrears starting with the day when the new agreement is signed. Latvia, however, insists that the issue of payments be tackled regardless of any further agreements. Under the draft agreement, Russia will operate free flights in the Latvian airspace to maintain and repatriate Russian troops in the Baltic states and Germany. But, Upmalis said, it would be impossible to detect which flights are actually needed for these purposes. The Latvian Communication Ministry is unlikely to sign up to the Russian proposal and it will also demand the repayment of the debt, said Uldis Petersons, a spokesman for the ministry. On the other hand, the new agreement is necessary because the 1993 document was only a purpose agreement, Petersons noted.
