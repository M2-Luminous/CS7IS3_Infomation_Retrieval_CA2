As an urgent priority, he offered the deputies to consider rescheduling presidential and local elections until a later date. Kravchuk insists that presidential elections must follow the creation of a proper legislative basis for government functioning and the adoption of a new constitution. In his view, parliamentary approval is needed of laws on the presidency and local government before the elections can be held. These must provide for an executive presidency and sweeping powers to regional council heads, Kravchuk believes. He also spoke of a risk that the presidential and local election campaign might lead to polarization and a bitter power struggle instead of defusing social tension at a time when "we are in need of consensus and tolerance". Kravchuk believes that the danger of power erosion is increased because of the specifics of the economic situation in Ukraine whose predominantly state sector is in need of central government. In his view, further experiments in government reform may wreck the levers of economic management while political instability push back the international financial agencies willing to provide economic aid to Ukraine. "The dispute between Ukraine and Crimea are known to all and sundry. There is a risk that it may spread to other regions," Kravchuk said. IF Note: Some Crimean leaders consider Kravchuk's drive for rescheduling the presidential election as a desire to try to cling to his office as long as possible. Crimean Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov said that "Kravchuk ought to have set an example of civilized behavior by stepping down in a dignified manner." In an interview with INTERFAX, he said that "a democratic changeover of government is when the politician is seen off with honors but not when he is driven out of power or tries to hold back to his office with tooth and nail." Stepping down in time is the main thing in a democratic society, Saburov believes. Meanwhile, the rescheduling question is not even on the parliament's preliminary agenda. The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission reports that the following have received the 100,000 signatures required for registering as presidential candidates: President Leonid Kravchuk, Chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Leonid Kuchma, ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, leader of the Ukrainian socialists Aleksandr Moroz and Education Minister Petr Talanchuk.
