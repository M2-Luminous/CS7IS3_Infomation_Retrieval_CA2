FBIS4-53769 "dreas099__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 17 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Ministry To Press U.S. To Adopt ITU Resolution Ministry To Press U.S. To Adopt ITU Resolution OW2005225494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005225494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has adopted a resolution calling for the creation of the next-generation cellular telephone system that makes it possible to use cellular telephones anywhere in the world. On 16 May, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [MOPT] decided to press the United States into putting the resolution into effect. The United States has adopted a policy ignoring the resolution, which has prompted the MOPT to make that decision. The MOPT plans to formally notify the U.S. side of its decision at the trilateral conference on cellular telecommunications research slated to be held in Tokyo beginning 24 May. The conference will be attended by Japan, the United States, and European nations. The European Union (EU) is expected to cooperate with the MOPT in pressing the United States to put the resolution into force. While present car and cellular telephones use ground stations to transmit radio waves, the next-generation mobile telephone system has the feature of using satellites to transmit radio waves. The next-generation cellular telephone system, if adopted worldwide, will standardize the current diverse radio waves used by cellular telephones. Internationally standardized radio waves would make it possible to use cellular telephones either in Japan or in other nations. The resolution adopted by the ITU in 1992 also calls for standardizing radio waves. The ITU has urged its member nations to use a total of 230 mHz including 1885-2025 mHz and 2100-2200 mHz as their exclusive radio waves for the next-generation cellular telephone system. President Clinton, however, has decided to shift part of the exclusive radio waves to the current cellular telephone system, incurring a backlash from Japan and European nations.
