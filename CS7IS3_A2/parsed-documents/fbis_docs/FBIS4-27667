"The recent situation is heading towards a critical phase in which the (whole) nation could collapse concurrently," concluded a meeting of DP lawmakers affiliated with the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification and National Defense Committees. During the meeting presided over by party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, it was decided to hold an emergency meeting of DP lawmakers Friday to announce the party's official position on the North Korean nuclear issue and call on the ruling Democratic Liberal Party to convene relevant National Assembly committees to deal with the issue. The DP lawmakers also decided to demand that the North immediately stop playing the "foolhardy" nuclear card to head off any possibility of a crisis developing on the Korean peninsula. The opposition lawmakers agreed that if the need arises, sanctions must be imposed on the North by the United Nations Security Council through resolutions based on a global consensus rather than through an initiative by South Korea, the United States and Japan alone. They also pointed out that armed conflict could erupt on the Korean peninsula if economic sanctions were imposed, considering that a sea blockade would be necessary for effective implementation.
