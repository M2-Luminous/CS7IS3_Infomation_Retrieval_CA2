Gavrileva report on news conference given by President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov with unidentified correspondents; place and date not given: "Edict No. 1 Is Not Yet Ready"] [Text] The second news conference of the president of Crimea was held after his visits to Kiev and Moscow. Because Yu. Meshkov had granted KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA a lengthy interview on his working trip to Russia, there were few questions on this subject from the assembled journalists. [Question] I would like, all the same, to get an answer from you: What are the main results of the visit? [Meshkov] That to which we had aspired for several years was accomplished: preservation of the unity of the economy of the Republic of Crimea and Russia. All our problems met with the requisite understanding and the maximum possible support, and preliminary agreements were reached, and all that remains is to implement them. The main thing is that we are switching from declarations to action. I believe that we will all perceive the results of this switch very soon. The Republic of Crimea enjoys most favored nation status in Russia. For example, specialists of the former Fourth Administration are prepared to supply the necessary equipment and make specialists available for medical treatment, primarily of children. I hope that they will be here next week to train our medical personnel on the spot. [Question] Does the invitation to Ye. Saburov to take the office of vice premier indicate that you do not have your own team? [Meshkov] Issues need to be decided to the maximum benefit of the Republic of Crimea. Appointing this person to this office is of the maximum benefit today. [Question] And what will this "march from the Varangians to the Greeks" cost Crimea? [Meshkov] A purely symbolic amount inasmuch as he is bringing everything necessary with him. [Question] What will the directions of the economic reforms in Crimea be? [Meshkov] The traditional ones--an equalization of the system of civil legislation in order that there be a legal foundation for the unity of our economies. We cannot ignore the processes already under way in Russia and which will necessarily take place in Ukraine. [Question] What kind of mechanisms will be engaged for introducing the ruble in Crimea, and will it be introduced before summer? [Meshkov] The problem of the use of the ruble in Crimea has preliminarily already been resolved, and the techniques and procedures will be determined later. It is vitally important that the matter be resolved before the start of the resort season. [Question] What was Russia's attitude toward the request for the allocation of money for the program of the return of the Crimean Tatars? [Meshkov] The application was accepted, and I know that there is the most heavyweight resolution possible in Russia. Actual names? We should best wait for the specific results. [Question] People say: "A friendly calf suckles two mothers." May it be considered, following your visit to Moscow, that we have opted for one "mother"? Will we not lose out--after all, Clinton has promised Ukraine sizable assistance. [Meshkov] I do not know whether the word "friendly" is compatible with the image that journalists have created for me. Ties only to Russia? Russia looks most favorably both on Crimea in general and on a solution of questions of the Crimean economy in particular, which, unfortunately, cannot yet be said of the persons who represent the Ukrainian economy, if there still is such. But this does not mean a demonstrative severance of economic ties to Ukraine; on the contrary, we will have more opportunities for expanding them. [Question] Did you notify the president of Ukraine in any form of the trip to Moscow? [Meshkov] No. It was a working visit for the resolution of specific economic problems--this did not go beyond the framework of pure economics, and for this reason I shall not be reporting on the work that was done to the president of Ukraine. [Question] When will your apparatus be formed, and who will be a part of it? [Meshkov] We have abandoned the word "apparatus," we prefer to speak of an "administration." Our principle is minimum composition with maximum professionalism. It now consists of two professors and the same number of generals--each a specialist in his own field. The comments in respect to the contacts that have been made by employees of the administration outside of Crimea have been more than positive. There have already been comments at the international level also. We are taking the path of a minimum number of employees and maximum provision with energy and accounting equipment. Problems of communications and accounting equipment have been resolved with Russia, and this will signify unilateral assistance to the Republic of Crimea free of charge. Salaries are more than modest, and I tell each member of staff that they will lose out financially by switching to the administration. [Question] There are rumors in Crimea concerning a new appointment at the Crimea Television and Radio Company.... [Meshkov] It is impermissible for state structures to be used to propagandize one's own personal beliefs. [Question] Explain the situation involving the black Lincoln. [Meshkov] [laughs] I learn about all the "movements" of the black Lincoln from the press. There has been no conversation with those intending to make a gift of it. [Question] Is there a mechanism for permanent contacts with the Government of Russia? [Meshkov] Yes, Crimea has been allocated... no, I shall not say yet. The mechanism is this: Trade and economic missions of the Russian Federation and also of its components--Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Rostov-na-Donu--will be opened in Crimea, and ours, in Russia; and also personal contacts, which were generated at the time of the visit. [Question] Will the administration of the president not increase the bureaucratic machinery--and how will its appearance affect the size of the government? [Meshkov] I believe that this will signify a sharp reduction in bureaucratic structures. I hope for a qualitative improvement in work--of both the administration and the government. [Question] GOLOS UKRAINY reported that you were received neither by B. Yeltsin nor V. Chernomyrdin, and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote that you were greeted in Kiev by two young persons unknown.... [Meshkov] A meeting had been arranged, but Boris Nikolayevich's illness prevented it taking place. The contacts with Zhirinovskiy were not planned. In Kiev the meeting was modest, as modest as could be; the negotiations took place in a friendly, but official atmosphere, and tension was sensed on both sides. Subsequently it was dispelled, and the discussion became more specific. But it simply could not be compared with the meeting in Moscow--in terms either of level or quality. Heaven and earth. [Question] You have declared repeatedly that the Republic of Crimea will be a guarantor of a restoration of the rights of the Crimean Tatar people. What do you understand by these words? [Meshkov] Primarily observance of the entire volume of civil rights that are declared and upheld by the international community. The Republic of Crimea is responsible to its citizens. We sought 50 billion and obtained a positive resolution. I can confirm that the undertakings in respect to compensation for loss must be fulfilled, but not individually but on a legal basis. [Question] What is your attitude toward men with shoulder boards and their social protection? Will a committee for servicemen be formed under the auspices of the president? [Meshkov] Protection--to the extent that is guaranteed any citizen of the Republic of Crimea, particularly those with shoulder boards inasmuch as they are in the service of the state. As for a committee, I cannot yet say; it is not, I believe, a question of a committee but of the attitude toward the problems of servicemen, and they are being tackled, for example, by various structures, to which we have appealed with a request for assistance in the construction of housing for officers. [Question] What kind of interaction do you have currently with the Council of Ministers, and who was in charge of Crimea during your week's absence? [Meshkov] Normal, working interaction, except for the deplorable events you witnessed following the proclamation of the election results. I was not expecting this, to be honest. But we have negotiated the first difficult times, and the government has, on the whole, rendered the necessary support. Control of the situation was not lost, and in addition all the preliminary output of the previous negotiations in Kiev was continued. The duties of chairman of the Council of Ministers are being discharged--in conscientious and skilled fashion--by A. Franchuk. [Question] Is a reform of the local authorities--the system of soviets--contemplated any time soon? If so, in which direction? [Meshkov] This question has been determined by life itself, and it must be decided not in the plane of the elimination of the representative bodies but in the plane of changes in their purposes and tasks. This will mean, obviously, more professional and fewer representatives of the populace together with the local administration. If there are county councils in respectable old England, they are ordained for us by God himself. [Question] Your understanding of freedom of speech? [Meshkov] A journalist must do his professional duty: convey information, not express his personal viewpoint and on the strength of this invite people who will confirm it. I am prepared for the most impartial criticism. But what do the newspapers attributing to a person words he has never spoken have in common with this? [Question] Has there been Edict No. 1, and to what is it devoted? [Meshkov] There is a silent competition under way in the administration currently for the right to prepare the text of the first edict. The team handling interethnic matters will be the winner, it seems. [Question] Judging by your interview in KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA, you are not disposed to reveal yourself completely, thereby evoking associations with the party nomenklatura, which you so hate. Is this an accident or a fledgling tradition? [Meshkov] It is necessary to resort to Aesopian language in cases where your interlocutor does not give you the right to convey the content of the interview. At the same time it is improper not to answer the questions of a journalist inquiring after the content of the interview. Let us consider that this will not become a tradition.
