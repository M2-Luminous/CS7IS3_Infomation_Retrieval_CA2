The meeting summed up the results of combat against corruption in units directly under the provincial authorities and made arrangements for the next step in combatting corruption. Provincial party Secretary Guan Guangfu expressed four ideas on further implementing central anticorruption instructions and carrying forward the province's anticorruption struggle. Guan Guangfu said: The year 1994 is a year of reform in our province, a year of making endeavors, a year of implementing policies, and a year of clean administration. Party organizations in all localities throughout the province should strive to bring about a great change in party style and in practicing cleangovernment. This year of clean administration indicates the provincial party committee's determination to curb corruption and its utmost concern for anticorruption and clean administration. Guan Guangfu pointed out: The deeper we carry out reform and opening up, the more necessary it is for us to combat corruption and practice clean administration. This gives expression to the nature of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Reform in the last 15 years has proved that only when corruption is severely curbed can we ensure the smooth carrying out of reform and construction. [passage omitted] This year is an extraordinary year, in which we face very arduous tasks. Whether or not all tasks can be implemented properly depends on whether or not leaders at all levels can cultivate a good mental attitude and a solid work style in organizing the masses for the fulfillment of all these tasks. [passage omitted] Guan Guangfu requested: The current three anticorruption tasks should be further implemented so as to spend the Spring Festival happily in a clean atmosphere. To put it more specifically, there is a need for leading cadres to perform better in practicing clean administration and self-control, to increase momentum in cracking major and important cases, and to severely curb malpractices. Because the Spring Festival is approaching, we must increase the momentum of the fight against corruption. First, we must reduce meetings and commendation activities; unnecessary meetings must not be held and necessary meetings must be held in a simple way; second, no public money can be used for extravagant eating and drinking; third, the offering of gift money and gift checks is prohibited; fourth, the higher authorities, particularly institutions directly under the provincial authorities, are not allowed to accept native or special products offered by their subordinates; fifth, no public money can be used for highly expensive entertainment. Guan Guangfu stressed: Institutions directly under the provincial authorities should play an exemplary role in the combat against corruption. The current fight against corruption is focused on party and government institutions, an law enforcement, administration, and economic management departments. Taking the province as a whole, attention should first be paid to institutions directly under the provincial authorities. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Guan Guangfu requested: It is necessary to fundamentally resolve corruption and carry out long-term struggles against corruption. The fight against corruption is a prolonged task and involves comprehensive social systems engineering, which requires first, education, and second, law, for its thorough resolution. In the course of curbing corruption, there is a need to increase the momentum in cracking major cases, to gradually eliminate the ground and conditions for the emergence of corruption. At present, we must stress the following: First, we must pay attention to education, the implementation of regulations and policies, the improvement of structures, and the implementation of supervision and management, which all involve the overall situation; second, all levels of party committees and governments should strengthen their leadership, put the fight against corruption on their agenda and pay constant attention to it; and third, we must support discipline inspection work. Ding Fengying, secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission, also spoke at the meeting. Vice Governor Li Daqiang chaired the meeting. [passage omitted on names of other participants]
