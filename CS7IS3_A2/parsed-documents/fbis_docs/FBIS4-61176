According to the Socis-Gallup service, 18 percent of the electorate were prepared to vote for him in March, a significant increase on the 16.6 percent in December 1993. A poll in all parts of Ukraine in which 1200 people older than 15 were questioned showed that Vyacheslav Chornovil (9.1 percent in March and 10 percent in March) and President Leonid Kravchuk (16.5 and 11 percent, respectively) were also fairly popular figures. At its latest congress the Popular Rukh decided not to field its own presidential candidate. Kravchuk agreed to register as a possible candidate. Nikolay Mikhalchenko, his domestic policy aide, told Interfax that Kravchuk had thus shown that he was not afraid of elections. On the other hand, Mikhalchenko said that Kravchuk would ask the new parliament to postpone the elections which are scheduled for June 26. As reported earlier, 120 members of the new parliament are prepared to back this proposal. Kuchma thought that a postponement would be useful for implementing a specific economic reform program but he rejected Kravchuk's argument that the postponement was needed to change the power structure and to have the duties of the new president specified in the Constitution. Numerous parties and trade unions agree with Kravchuk that a new constitution had to be adopted before the elections. This view is shared, in particular, by the "greens" who called on Kravchuk to put off the presidential and local elections until the end of the year. They say that the presidential race must be resumed following the adoption of a Constitution by a Constitutional Assembly. Levko Lukyanenko, leader of the Ukraine democratic league, told Interfax that the presidential elections had to be postponed until the end of 1994 or early 1995. He thought that presidential elections had not to be held before a Constitution was adopted which would define whether Ukraine would be a presidential or a parliamentary republic or a cross between them or before the power of the president were defined or legislation on local administration was in place. Donetsk coalfield trade unions are prepared to negotiate a postponement of the elections with Kravchuk, Igor Dyatlov, who chairs the inter-regional league of strike committees, told Interfax. Meanwhile, Mikhail Volynets, chairman of the Inter-Regional Union of the Independent Miners' Union, told Interfax-Ukraine that the miners were kept in the dark about the presidential race and showed no interest in it. In his view, of all the presidential nominees Kravchuk alone could run the country. He thought that Kuchma was responsible for the falling living standards of the miners.
