[Begin recording] [Abu-Zayyad] East Jerusalem is a symbol of the Palestinian nationality, of the Arab dignity, and of the Islamic belief and faith. And, of course, it is viewed by us as our future capital. [Correspondent Mark Weiss] Can you confirm that the PLO is engaged in efforts to continue moving national institutions to East Jerusalem? [Abu-Zayyad] Well, I think that the issue of Jerusalem is supposed to be on the negotiating table in the second phase of the negotiations, and I believe that this thing will be discussed through negotiations. I don't think that the PLO will move its offices to Jerusalem without negotiations and without coordinating with the other side because at the end we need to find a solution for Jerusalem which will be for the satisfaction of all parties. [Weiss] Israeli leaders, at the moment at least, insist that Jerusalem will remain the united capital of Israel. Do you believe Israel will eventually compromise on this issue? [Abu-Zayyad] Well, of course yes. Of course I do, because anyone who wants peace he knows deep in his heart that he cannot have peace and have Jerusalem only under the Israeli sovereignty.
