But the government and the ANC [African National Congress] have said they are prepared to give members of the Freedom Alliance more time for possible participation. At a meeting in Ulundi, the IFP's Central Committee called for international mediation to bring about a negotiated settlement. The message from the Central Committee was clear -- no participation in the election with the constitution as it is at the moment. The party's negotiators gave feedback on the unsuccessful talks with the government and the ANC. Many of the members stated unequivocally that the negotiations had brought them nothing. [Begin IFP leader Buthelezi recording in English] We want actually those things that have not been accommodated, accommodated. So I mean that question applies both ways because even now if those things were acquired -- even if there was no international mediation. If they were accommodated, we would still participate in the election. So because we have not acquired that that's why we now seek international mediation so that those things can be accommodated before we can participate in the election. [end recording]
