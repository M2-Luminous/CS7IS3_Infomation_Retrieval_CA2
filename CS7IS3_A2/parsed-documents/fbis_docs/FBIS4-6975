FBIS4-6975 "dreas080_a_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Kono: Coalition `Good as Dead' Kono: Coalition `Good as Dead' OW2604050194 Tokyo KYODO in English 0448 GMT 26 Apr 94 OW2604050194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker said Tuesday [26 April] the ruling coalition is as good as dead and displayed interest in possible talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] which just quit the coalition. "The ruling coalition has virtually collapsed. Their power game...has failed," Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said at a meeting of party executives, according to party officials. Kono also told reporters the LDP is willing to hold talks with the SDP or new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which were both key components of the coalition, if they can agree over the modus operandi of politics. "I would like to see what stance the two parties take, but if they think the same way as we do on how to do politics, we can have talks." The SDP walked out of the coalition early Tuesday after it was enraged by a move by other coalition partners to form a new parliamentary bloc. The party's withdrawal stripped the coalition of its majority in the key House of Representatives. LDP executives met in the morning to discuss how they should handle the renewed political turmoil, and decided to put up a united front to cope with the situation. Kono made clear the LDP will capitalize on the confusion to regain the ruling status. "The time has come for a showdown," he said at the meeting. But he warned against expected moves from the newly-elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata or his coalition partners to lure away some LDP lawmakers to secure a Diet majority. Kono criticized Shinseito, headed by Hata, for its "forcible way" of handling Diet business. "It is not a true form of democracy that places importance on process," he said. The surprise move among conservative and centrist coalition members to form a new bloc is widely believed to have been masterminded by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a top coalition strategist and a self-acknowledged behind-the-scenes negotiator. Another LDP leader made a more articulate call for an alliance with the disillusioned SDP. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "the current situation is tantamount to anarchy. I am infuriated." "Let us keep close contact with the SDP," he told the party's top brass.
