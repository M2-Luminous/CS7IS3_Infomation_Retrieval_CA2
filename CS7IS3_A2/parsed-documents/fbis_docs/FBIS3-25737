The negotiators met only this morning to look at a new version of the third document consisting of 16 principles, of which about 60 per cent has been dealt with. The principles cover administrative decentralization, autonomy of provincial governments, the national anthem, and the republic's symbols, immunity, and the acquisition of diplomatic passports by National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] officials, as well as war crimes and the pardoning of individual action during the course of the war. All these issues have already been dealt with. Tomorrow, the mediator will submit a new document to the two sides. A plenary session will be held on 28 February, during which UNITA's role in central and provincial governments, the Constitution of the Republic, the news media, the status to be accorded to Jonas Savimbi, the return of UNITA property, and UNITA's role in economically strategic enterprises will be discussed. Legal issues will continue to be raised with UNITA demanding a more open debate on institutional structures. The government only agrees to negotiate within the law, noting that the Lusaka peace talks cannot interfere with national sovereignty. Meanwhile, Chief Beye [words indistinct] media coverage. Over the past days threats were made about investigations into information leaks. It has been reported that the UN secretary general's special representative suggested that journalists should be expelled. It seems that Chief Beye wants to raise the flag of peace and therefore take Angolans by surprise. If that is the case, than let it happen right away.
