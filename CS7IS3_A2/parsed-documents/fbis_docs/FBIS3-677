Delegates of the two parties will now report back to their principals. The talks have taken place despite a statement by [Afrikaner] Volksfront [National Front] co-leader Constand Viljoen that the Freedom Alliance is suspending negotiations. IFP National Chairman Frank Mdlalose said his party was holding talks with the ANC apart from the rest of the Freedom Alliance. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said earlier in Durban that he would end his opposition to the interim constitution if mediation proved his stance wrong.
