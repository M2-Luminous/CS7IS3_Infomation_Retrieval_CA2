Perhaps this is why the all-knowing and all-understanding democratic press has not informed its readers of a fact which could, if people were so inclined, be called sensational. Namely, that the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office has not applied the amnesty to the former security minister. He is still under investigation. I telephoned defense attorney D. Shteynberg yesterday: "Viktor Pavlovich and I visited Gaydanov, the new chief of the investigations administration, and he informed us of the reason for what I would term this lawlessness." It turns out that the Prosecutor's Office is waiting for the State Duma to adopt a decree on the procedure for applying the amnesty. This may be required for some people, but as far as the political prisoners are concerned, the Duma has already made everything perfectly clear -- the amnesty is to be applied forthwith! I believe that the Prosecutor's Office is maliciously violating the constitutional principle that all are equal before the law. Of course, the exception made for V. Barannikov could be considered an annoying misunderstanding. It could be claimed that, in the course of the struggle which A. Kazannik waged against the presidential entourage, striving to release A. Rutskoy, R. Khasbulatov, and their associates as quickly as possible, he forgot about the man in the hospital. But that explanation is one for dimwits. There is another, more likely, theory. The "collective Rasputin" with which, we recall, the former security minister finally quarreled on the eve of his resignation has forgotten nothing and has not forgiven him. It is as if they are hinting to the recent inmate of Lefortovo, from where he was transferred to the hospital after a heart attack, that, even though now "at liberty," he is still wholly in the hands of "their man" -- A. Ilyushenko -- a direct presidential appointee. And this is why conclusions must be drawn. Needless to say, it is no secret that Viktor Pavlovich knows a very great deal about the "secrets of the Kremlin court." For instance, which dollar incomes are used to educate the sons of certain highly placed grandees in prestigious foreign colleges, which of them have accounts in what bank, or which of them are involved in corruption or the trade in natural resources. He could also talk about why one of those close to the court -- a fervent opponent of the CPSU -- is nicknamed "Tanya." Naturally, the amnesty will eventually be applied to V. Barannikov. But the pointed playing on the sick man's nerves points to the invisible deal that they are trying to foist on him. Something along the lines of "you keep quiet and we'll set you free."
