FBIS4-46357 "jptot024__l94034" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 9 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA EL SALVADOR Death Threats Against Human Rights Ombudsman, Legislator Death Threats Against Human Rights Ombudsman, Legislator Legislative Deputy Receives Death Threats PA1006133794 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 2 PA1006133794 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY Spanish BFN [Text] Deputy Carmen Calderon de Escalon (the president's sister) has received a death threat. Gloria Salguero Gross, the president of the National Legislative Assembly, reported this yesterday. The official said that the deputy, who lives in Santa Ana, received the threat on Wednesday in an anonymous telephone call, taken at the headquarters of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) in that western city. They said they "were going to kill her along the Santa Ana-San Salvador highway." Miss Salguero credited the threats to "sick minds." Deputy Calderon de Escalon, sister of President Armando Calderon Sol, is currently the secretary on the Assembly Board of Directors and an ARENA leader. She also chairs the Assembly Treasury Committee and a Special Budget Commission. A commission, which was appointed by the Assembly Board of Directors, is studying security for the legislative building and its deputies. There are 84 deputies in all and to provide security for all of them would require a special budget appropriation. Salguero Gross, during the first press conference she has given as assembly president, also reported that President Calderon Sol will appear at today's plenary session to formally present his first request for permission to leave the country. Unofficial sources said the president will travel to Costa Rica and Puerto Rico. The assembly president indicated that he will be given a special one- year permit to travel anywhere in Latin America. Meanwhile, the official announced that members of the media will be required to carry a special "card" to gain access to the assembly installations. In her opinion, this is organization. For others it is limiting the freedom of press. In addressing the "self-investigation" the deputies are supposed to complete on themselves on the excessive cost of the remodeling and repair work done at the legislative buildings, Salguero Gross reported that an external audit will determine whether there was mismanagement or not. Deputies of the new Technical Committee (charged with overseeing the construction work at the building) agreed to request an independent audit to determine if the construction of wooden dividers really costs 4.2 million colones. A member of this committee reported yesterday that prior to this, the committee will investigate the name and background of the contractors involved in the project, including the air conditioning supplier. [San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish on 9 June carries a 375- word report on page 24, with reactions by the UN Observers for El Salvador, ONUSAL. ONUSAL Chief Enrique Ter Horst said that "the threats should not be taken more seriously than what they really are." He explains that "they are anonymous so anyone can make them." "We have no way of knowing," Ter Horst continued, "whether the threats were made by death squads or by some impulsive individual wanting to have some fun creating instability." Diego Garcia Sayan, chief of the ONUSAL Human Rights Division, said that the special ONUSAL investigation group will look into the incidents.]
