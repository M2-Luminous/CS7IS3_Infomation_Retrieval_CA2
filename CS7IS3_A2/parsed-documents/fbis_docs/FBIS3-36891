The visitors -- generals and colonels -- will instruct their Lithuanian colleagues in the rational use of resources for the country's defense. In any event, as the guests and their hosts stressed, all spending will pursue one aim -- the intensive rapprochement of Lithuania's military, economic, and other structures with the corresponding structures of the NATO countries. The NATO "landing party" in Vilnius is part of the program of synchronized visits by other delegations from the military bloc to countries in central and Eastern Europe. The left-wing opposition is asking this question: Shouldn't a decision as portentous as entry into NATO have been taken only after a referendum of the people on this question?
