He said the winner of the presidential race would become clear only in the second round which, in his words, would become a "duel" between himself and Kuchma. The head of state based his argument on the results of an opinion poll, which had indicated that 27 percent of the electorate would vote for Kravchuk and 20 percent for Kuchma. However, the Leonid Kuchma thinks his main rival will be the last Supreme Soviet speaker, Ivan Plyushch. "Plyushch," he said, "really concentrated power in Ukraine into his own hands." Observers back that argument up by the fact that Plyushch has the support of most local authorities in the Republic. He was behind a law, which will give the heads of local authorities all power in their regions after the 26 June elections, and that will help him considerably in his pre-election campaign in a number of regions and at local polling stations, they say. The speaker of the current Supreme Soviet, Aleksandr Moroz, is thought to have less chances of success. However, his recent exploits have done much in the objective sense to earn him more popularity among the eastern "Russian-speaking" regions of Ukraine. Moroz has a balanced approach to the Crimean issue, and his firm opposition to President Kravchuk's plea for the presidential and local elections to be postponed to a later date is also in his favor. The Supreme Soviet on Thursday evening rejected Kravchuk's proposal to defer the elections. IF Note: A parliament resolution stated that it [the parliament] considered it undesirable to postpone the elections to a later date give that preparations for those elections were almost complete, with "election constituencies and commissions set up and candidates for the presidency and local government registered." However, the parliament approved Kravchuk's proposal to create a legal base for the future president to exercise his powers. Supreme Soviet commissions have been recommended to submit their proposals for draft laws governing then powers of the Ukrainian president, cabinet of ministers and local authorities and governments by 12 June. The government has been requested to submit a draft law on the cabinet of ministers to the Supreme Soviet, also by 12 June. The law would define the rights of the cabinet of ministers and regulate its relations with local authorities.
