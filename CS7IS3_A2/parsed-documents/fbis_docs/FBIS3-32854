In reply to a request made by various political and human rights organizations that requested clarification of the incident, the National Defense Secretariat said the Mexican Army never carried out any action to arrest, much less to murder these individuals, given that on 7 January there was no military presence in the area. The Defense Secretariat added that at the request of the people, the Army arrested 32 individuals who had broken the law, clarifying that this occurred five days after the armed confrontation began. The Army turned over the 32 arrested individuals to local authorities after a public medical examination was made to determine their physical condition, the bulletin concluded.
