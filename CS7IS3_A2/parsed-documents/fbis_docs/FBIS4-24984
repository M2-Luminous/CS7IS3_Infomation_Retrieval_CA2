A national meeting on scientific and technological progress in the chemical industry closed here today. According to information from the meeting, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has proposed that higher priority be given to the development of nine key technologies in the Ninth Five-Year Plan of the chemical industry. They include new catalysis technology, new separation technology, biochemical technology, and computer application. The plan also covers 10 major projects, including a synthetic ammonia plant using natural gas as raw material with an annual output capacity of 300,000 metric tons and a urea plant using an ammonia gas process with an annual output capacity of 520,000 metric tons; and projects for the development of refined industrial chemicals in the agricultural drug, dyestuff, electro-chemical, and three other major categories. The Ministry of Chemical Industry proposed that 30 major scientific research results and new technologies be put to use during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. They include the 10,000- etric-ton-class ionic membrane caustic soda producing technology and the 10,000-metric-ton-class polyvinyl chloride resin producing technology. It is reported that China's chemical industry will develop more than 300 new major chemical products annually in the last five years of this century; and by the year 2000, the output value of high-technological chemical products will account for approximately 10 percent of the total output value of China's chemical industry.
