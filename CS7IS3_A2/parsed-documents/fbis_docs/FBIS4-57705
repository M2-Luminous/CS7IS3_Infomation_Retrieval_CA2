Serra maintains that the greater number of national banks and the opening of foreign credit institutions, which will accompany NAFTA, will create more competition and allow the country to receive new resources that will increase the money supply. "Both circumstances," he predicted, "will put downward pressure on interest rates." In his speech before the 76th General Assembly of the Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the Secofi secretary said the foreign trade indicators for the first quarter of this year "are very positive" and added that for the January-March period, total exports increased approximately 17 percent compared to the same period in 1993. In addition, Serra reported that the sale of manufactured products abroad was the sector with the most dynamic growth. This sector grew nearly 26 percent, particularly exports of cotton fabrics and other vegetal fibers as well as plastic products and automobiles. Serra explained that according to statistics compiled in the United States, Mexican exports to that country increased 22 percent in the first two months of the year, a figure double the increase registered by exports from the rest of the world. In a speech given before President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Serra also declared that the type of imports to the country demonstrate the technological modernization and competitiveness of the national economy, adding that intermediate goods accounted for 71 percent of imports, capital goods for 17 percent, and final consumption products for 12 percent. Such results of the commercial balance, Serra continued, show the benefits of NAFTA and the growing competitiveness of the country's economy. Regarding financing, the secretary spoke of an increase of over 4 billion new pesos in credit lines from the National Bank of Internal Trade (BNCI) in 1994, representing a 60-percent increase over last year. Of this amount, nearly 30 percent is destined for the creation of infrastructure and 44 percent for small and intermediate businesses. Regarding development banking, the Commercial Development Fund (Fidec) tripled its financing from 1990 to 1993 with its credit supply going from 1 billion to 3.2 billion new pesos, Serra remarked. Serra said financing resulted in the construction of 463,000 square meters of storage and cold storage facilities, while Fidec is expected to increase its credits for businesses' working capital this year by 81 percent, and for those destined for building commercial centers by 166 percent. Serra also said emphasis has been placed on promoting new forms of business associations to improve the scale of operation by organizing purchasing credit and integrating business groups. Regarding legal changes, Serra noted that between 1989 and 1993, the number of credit unions that can operate in any sector of the economy, issue bonds, and trade assets grew by 22 percent annually. Consequently, the secretary of Secofi concluded, these new forms of association can resolve businessmen's credit problems, problems of joint negotiations with purveyors, and problems searching for markets and forming associations with foreign businessmen.
