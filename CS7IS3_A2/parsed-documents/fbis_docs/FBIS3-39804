The European Commission, however, does not seem to be in a hurry to come to the rescue of European industry. The solemn announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of an order for some 60 civilian aircraft from Saudi Arabia has been making a few waves. First of all, because it is unusual for a head of state to announce such commercial transactions. And also, because, by choosing to make the announcement himself, Mr. Clinton gives rise to speculation on the conditions surrounding the award of the contract. The facts: Intent on renovating its fleet, Saudi Airlines had initiated talks with the world's three leading airliner manufacturers, America's Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas and Europe's Airbus. High-level U.S. Administration officials went on several trips to Riyadh, while Bill Clinton repeatedly said he would use all his influence to tip the scales in favor of the U.S. manufacturers. The talks began in the spring of 1993 and are not officially over and, in response to a Saudi request, Airbus Industries has extended the validity of its offer until 1 March. All this does not prevent President Clinton from announcing that the contract has been awarded to "his" manufacturers. Some information even trickles out as to the way the bounty is to be distributed between Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas; it is indicated that the order for civilian aircraft could be accompanied with another order for KC135 flying tankers, and the whole package is funded by a loan from Eximbank, an institution whose role is the same as that of the French COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade]. Worth noting, however, is the fact that the U.S. manufacturers, the Saudi authorities, and the Saudi airline have not followed Bill Clinton's lead and are keeping remarkably quiet. GATT Complaint The Europeans maintain they have received no official confirmation. Nevertheless, in the meantime, Airbus Industries' legal staff has begun working on a possible GATT complaint. Article 4 of the Agreement forbids any state incentive in favor of commercial deals, even in the form of debt rescheduling or military agreements. On the other hand, the absence of an official confirmation from the main parties leaves room for doubt, yet some people go so far as to speculate that this was a last-minute attempt by the U.S. Administration to secure the contract. In any event, the behavior of Bill Clinton and his officials amply justifies the often-expressed fears of European manufacturers. Indeed, it seems to demonstrate once again, and in a most obvious manner, that for the United States trade liberalization is nothing more than an export commodity. All this does not bode well for the future talks meant to settle the aeronautics issue. One remembers that when the GATT deal was concluded on 15 December 1993, this issue was left "on the back burner." An interim agreement remains in force until new negotiations are completed. Should there be no new agreement, however, the aeronautics industry will have to comply with the general rules. And, as emphasized by manufacturers, a strategic sector such as aeronautics -- whose production cycles are very long and which requires considerable investment levels -- cannot do without state support. In such a context, the Americans only need to play for time. The European system is based on refundable state advances which are considered to be direct subsidies and are perfectly identifiable. But they often exceed 5 percent of a new aircraft's development costs. In the United States, however, subsidies are channeled primarily through state agencies and are allocated as research contracts. Furthermore, the volume of orders placed by the U.S. Administration by far exceeds that of the two A310's placed by the French Air Force, and the United States has myriad "militarized" versions of civilian aircraft, with the most famous being the KC135 and EC135, both derived from the ancient Boeing 707. For the Europeans, this challenge could not have come at a worse time. Aircraft manufacturers face a worldwide crisis in air transport, which has been driving orders down, as well as cuts in military budgets. Of course, in the latter case, manufacturers need not be concerned with general trade rules. However, it is worth noting that the order for three Rafale fighter aircraft to be funded from the 1993 budget has only recently been placed with the manufacturer. Moreover, the lack of multiyear programs excludes any potential economies of scale, with respect to supplies, for instance. Therefore one can understand easily the fears of the manufacturers, who are faced with the prospect of a sweeping implementation of trade agreements which are not suited to their field of activity. This explains their current lobbying activities in France and Germany, which are meant to raise government awareness and to request -- should the parties fail to reach an agreement -- the establishment of a subsidy system similar to the one used by the Americans.
