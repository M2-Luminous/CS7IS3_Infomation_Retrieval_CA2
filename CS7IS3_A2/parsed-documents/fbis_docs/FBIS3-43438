In a memo to the delegation Mr Buthelezi said "the political power bases of minorities must be constitutionally entrenched by means of a federal system". Otherwise, he said, "the successful majority will destroy the political power bases of minorities, thereby preventing forever that a minority could become a majority in the future". Mr Buthelezi said he was meeting the Americans at a time when "some of the most important decisions in the history of the IFP" would be taken. He was referring to the party's Central Committee meeting which got underway after he received the Americans on Friday morning. Mr Buthelezi defended the IFP's stance towards negotiations in South Africa, telling the Americans that "no concessions have been made to accommodate the Freedom Alliance or the IFP". He alleged that during talks his party's inputs were "constantly ignored", demands "sidelined", and concerns "silenced". "Manipulation and arrogance characterised the process leaving no space for true negotiations with us." Mr Buthelezi added that during negotiations "we dramatically reduced our original demands without being met by corresponding efforts from our counterparts."
