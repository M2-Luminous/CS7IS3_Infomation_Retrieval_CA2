During the first quarter, the total retail volume of consumer goods amounted to 352.24 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent from last year's corresponding period. After being adjusted for price increases, the sale volume rose 5 percent in real terms, thus maintaining the strong momentum of steady growth. Consumer markets in our country are well stocked this year. According to a breakdown of consumer goods based on an analysis of supply and demand by relevant departments, supply and demand are basically balanced for 58.7 percent of the 726 major commodities, whereas the supply of 29.7 percent of the commodities outstrips demand. Sales of various brand-name, special, and new products have increased sharply. In the food category, brand-name foods and beverages, as well as fresh fruit and aquatic products, have enjoyed extremely brisk sales. Among clothing and accessories, brisk sales of cashmere and fur clothing, underwear, and leather shoes have continued unabated. Among daily necessities, the sale volume of home electrical appliances has increased 30 percent or more in some areas when compared to last year's corresponding year. Sales of cameras, videocassette recorders, and some small home electrical appliances have consistently been strong. As urban and rural markets go, last year's vast disparity between consumer markets in urban and rural areas has begun to narrow as consumer markets in rural markets have grown more rapidly. Increases in peasants' incomes have somewhat improved purchasing power. During the first quarter, the retail sales volume of consumer goods at or below the county level totaled 142.5 billion yuan, up 22.3 percent from last year's corresponding period. The retail sales volume of consumer goods in the cities was 209.8 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent from last year's same period. Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Tianjin are among the regions which posted increases of 30 percent or more in their total retail sales volumes of consumer goods.
