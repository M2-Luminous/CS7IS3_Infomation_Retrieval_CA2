The UD Presidium empowered its deputies to submit a draft law on county [powiat] governments to the Sejm. The Presidium also called on all supporters of Solidarity reforms to "mobilize forces" in the June local government elections. The UD decided at its electoral conventions to name candidates for the councils together with the KLD (Liberal Democratic Congress). Hanna Suchocka urged members to arouse themselves from their torpor and to get to work. According to Jerzy Osiatynski, former Minister of Finance, the current government is able to do only one thing--raise taxes. "Under the slogan of fighting unemployment, the government introduced a lump-sum tax for small companies. In 1993, 1 million people found work thanks to these companies. Now, the entrepreneurs are deregistering their firms," charged Osiatynski. He also warned against a rise in inflation brought about by the "nonchalant attitude of the government to the popiwek [excess wage growth tax that government plans to stop as of 31 March]." The halt in privatization and the bad climate surrounding it were deplored. One Presidium member lamented, "Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Smietanko is torpedoing attempts to privatize the tobacco industry." Another complained, "The person named to head the commission for ownership transformation is Bogdan Pek from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], who knows nothing about privatization." The UD Presidium also expressed indignation concerning the government's personnel policy as a return of the "old, PRL-style functionaries [PRL referring to the Polish People's Republic, the official name of the Polish state in the communist era]" and "a purge of voivodes conducted according to party criteria." Waldemar Kuczynski [former privatization minister and current member of the UD Presidium] stated that a joint UD-KLD commission is preparing a declaration "in the poetics of a manifesto" for the unification congress. It will consist of two parts: "Poland five years after the fall of communism" (the achievements and defeats of the Solidarity governments) and "Poland of tomorrow" (the vision of the state according to the new party). He added that the commission is looking for some kind of catchy slogan, playing on national ambitions, something in the style of "Polska gola" ["Polish goal," the refrain called out by soccer fans during international meets]. For each KLD delegate at the congress, there will be 2.7 delegates from the UD. In the 100-person Executive Council, there will be 73 former members of the UD and 27 former KLD members. "We haven't yet given up on the idea of inviting 20-25 so-called notables to the congress," UD secretary Andrzej Machowski told GAZETA.
