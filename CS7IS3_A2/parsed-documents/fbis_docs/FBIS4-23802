As providers of vital foreign exchange and suitable conduits for the implementation of affirmative action initiatives, parastatal groups falling under Sigcau's ministerial ambit, such as Denel, Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], Transnet [Transportation Network] and Safcol [expansion unknown] would be commercialised but not sold to the private sector. This was a change from the former government's policy which was to commercialise public enterprises with a view to eventual privatisation, she said in Pretoria. "While we have appreciation and understanding for the role of privatisation in the more sophisticated economies, we remain justifiably wary of privatisation along similar lines in SA's unique context." Privatisation could lead to share ownership being transferred to "an exclusive group" without granting the nation as a whole the opportunity to benefit from the process. For the moment, the emphasis would be on commercialisation as well as ensuring transparency and accountability in the governing of public enterprises. While affirmative action programmes had already been instituted in the parastatals, Sigcau said she would be taking a keen interest in how these were developed, particularly with regard to women. Eskom's objective was to achieve a "fundamental shift" in its race and gender profile by the year 2000. Until December 1996, Eskom's recruitment of employees, bursars and trainees would give preference to black South Africans. Transnet's Turn Strategy, which had been in operation for two years, had similar aims and objectives. Denel had committed itself to training 500 technicians, 200 computer programmers and had agreed that 30 percent of its management would be from under-represented groups within three years. Sigcau said affirmative action programmes would have to be sensitive to the aspirations of non-black staff. "There will still be promotions of white South Africans and no white employee will lose his job because of affirmative action." But she warned that while every effort would be made to implement affirmative action in a sympathetic way "no one will be allowed to frustrate its objectives." Sigcau also said government's policy on acquisitions would prevent, "if at all practicable", the continuing concentration of markets. Competition policy would emphasise the "protection of competition, rather than of the competitors."
