The two countries, while emphasizing that they can hold the annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" anytime, will wait a while before making a final decision on whether and when to resume it, the source said. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told his national security aides that the Patriots are purely defensive in nature and ordered them to start negotiations with U.S. officials on deployment as soon as possible. Gary Luck, commander of UN Forces in South Korea, earlier asked President Clinton for the Patriots to beef up his defenses. The Seoul government persuaded the Clinton administration against deploying the missiles, however, concerned that it might provoke North Korea in the middle of negotiations on Pyongyang's nuclear program. Seoul's stance on the Patriots "irritated" Washington at the time, the source said on condition of anonymity. As to whether and when Team Spirit would be resumed this year, the source said the two sides had not made a final decision. "Although the principle is to go ahead with the military drill, there are those who think it is an overreaction," said the source. Seoul and Washington announced on March 3 that they would suspend the drill this year, timed with the arrival of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in Pyongyang.
