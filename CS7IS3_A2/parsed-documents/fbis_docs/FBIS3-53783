Customs, intelligence, and police have conducted various successful raids across the country and seized huge quantities of narcotics, including heroin and charas, during the last one month. In the biggest-ever haul in Lahore today, city police seized about 1.5 tonnes of morphine powder and arrested three drug couriers. The smuggling attempt was foiled last night in the Bund Road area. The material was being smuggled on a truck loaded with 497 drums; 50 of them were filled with morphine powder. The city policy chief said the three alleged drug couriers -- namely Haji Nisar Khan, Akhtar Khan, and Javed Khan -- were arrested while raids are being conducted to arrest Mahmud Butt and Mujadded Butt. The recent antinarcotics drive is the result of the present government's resolve to eradicate the menace from its roots. The government has set the year 2000 as the target for complete eradication. It is one of the eight points given by the Pakistan People's Party in its election manifesto. A Narcotics Control Board and the Ministry of Law are working on a draft law which will enable the law enforcing agencies to act more effectively. Besides other measures, the government also plans to enhance its mass awareness campaigns. Fifty tonnes of charas was seized recently when antinarcotics agencies and Pakistan Customs jointly carried out an operation at Makran coast. In the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province], 20 kg of heroin was seized recently when it was being smuggled from the tribal area to Peshawar for down-country dispatch. In another raid, 12 kg of heroin was seized at Azadi Chowk post; three persons were arrested. A large quantity of heroin and charas was also seized at different places in Balochistan.
