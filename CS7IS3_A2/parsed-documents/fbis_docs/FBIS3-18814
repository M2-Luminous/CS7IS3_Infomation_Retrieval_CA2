FBIS3-18814 "drweu046__a94046" FBIS-WEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Berlin Police Chief Denies Escalation of Crime AU0803174094 Hamburg DPA in German 1404 GMT 8 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0803174094 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Berlin police has stated that a report, according to which the authorities are preparing for a "hot and bloody spring" in the capital city, is "pure panic-mongering." There are "indications and individual statements from the left-wing extremist and right-wing extremist camps concerning planned disturbances," Police President Hagen Saberschinsky said on Tuesday [8 March]. However, the responsible state protection department of the police does not know anything about an analysis by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution about an "escalation of violence." Referring to a confidential analysis by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, today's edition of the daily DIE WELT reports that Berlin is facing an escalation of violence. According to the paper, the authorities fear an increase in the number of political murders. Riots are expected in particular during the international soccer match between Germany and Great Britain on 20 April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution did not confirm the newspaper report, either. Its spokesman, Eberhard Kruschke, told DPA that no "specific plans" for disturbing the soccer match are known. It is still too early to analyze the situation. Office for the Protection of the Constitution and police stressed that they are in close contact. The police will "do everything so that extremists from the left and the right do not have a chance in the city," Saberschinsky stressed. According to DIE WELT, the leftist autonomous scene in Berlin considers the holding of the soccer match "on the Fuehrer's birthday, in the stadium built by the Fuehrer, in the capital of the Fuehrer's Reich" as a provocation. At first the match was supposed to take place in Hamburg, but then it was canceled for fear of riots. Subsequently, the Berlin Senat declared its readiness to have the soccer match take place on the Spree river. The number of violence-prone autonomous activists is estimated at 5,000 all over the country. The stronghold is Berlin, where more than 1,000 people belong to this scene.
