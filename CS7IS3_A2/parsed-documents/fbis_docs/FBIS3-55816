The first official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Russia begins on 12 January. In this connection our commentator Lidiya Podolnaya interviewed Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, who made the preparations for several summits and took part in them in various capacities, including that of USSR foreign minister. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich now heads two nongovernmental organizations, Russia's Foreign Policy Association and the World Council of Ex-Foreign Ministers. Let us hear the conversation. [Begin recording] [Podolnaya] Sensations and some kind of breakthrough are always expected of such summit meetings. Are there any grounds for expecting something similar from the present meeting? [Bessmertnykh] I don't think so -- and that is the good thing about it. This summit meeting is one of those rare meetings which are not overloaded with bureaucratic agenda items. Officials tend to delight in talking about the 20-25 odd agreements which presidents are going to sign when, sometimes, these selfsame presidents have not even set eyes on them. This means that the presidents have an opportunity, after making each other's acquaintance in Vancouver and, I think, getting to like each other, to discuss what kind of Russia Washington wants to see in the near future ... [Podolnaya, interrupting] As its partner? [Bessmertnykh] As its partner, and what kind of America Moscow would like to see. In other words, the presidents are to discuss, for the first time perhaps, a strategically very important task: How these two great powers are to live together in a changing world. Naturally -- and you are quite right -- they must build this concept on the basis of the premise that they remain partners, and that they must be partners, but it will be very important, I think, for the presidents to strip off the declarative veneer of politics, something which was achieved, for instance, on Malta, when the presidents of our two countries frankly told each other that certain events in Europe, the reunification of Germany, the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, the liberation of East Europe, and so on were all possible in present circumstances. They should say roughly the same things now about the future development of world forces and the place of the United States and Russia in this new set-up. [Podolnaya] Security issues usually dominate talks of this kind. Of all the questions to be discussed by Clinton and Yeltsin, which are the ones which require a quick solution in spite of being the most complex and sensitive? [Bessmertnykh] I think that this time security should be examined in a slightly different light. In order to study the problem of security the two presidents will have to sort out questions connected with the two states' own national security. Not everything is clear-cut here. There is still quite a lot of suspicion, notably among the U.S. political elite. These people talk with rather surprising frivolity about the revival of Russian imperialism and accuse Yeltsin's Russia of engaging in such imperialism. I witnessed this myself during a recent visit to the United States. This shows that there is no clear understanding of what Russia's vital interests are and what they are not. The way in which these vital interests are defended is another matter. Our president could well assure his American counterpart that this will be done within the framework of international law and existing principles governing the conduct of great powers, as permanent members of the Security Council. After that has been done, it will be easier to talk about what is to be done next with nuclear weapons. It is absolutely vital to reach agreement on the desirability of a further reduction in the level of nuclear armaments. The question of how to complete work connected with nuclear armaments in the Ukraine is bound to come up, of course, but the main topic will, nevertheless, be the subject of European security, notably in the context of the fairly lively debate on the future of NATO. I think that in this area, too, both sides should tell each other fairly clearly what they expect of the North Atlantic organization, NATO, and what they expect of the future system of European security. Here Russia has its own interests and it would be no bad thing if the U.S. leadership was made to understand that these Russian interests must be respected. But these Russian interests certainly do not contradict the tasks of pan-European security. [Podolnaya] On the contrary, the two things actually coincide. [Bessmertnykh] They coincide. In practice they complement each other. If Russia's security interests are adequately safeguarded, one can safely say that pan-European security has a chance of surviving. I personally consider that the question of NATO membership, expansion of NATO, has been prematurely inflated to unbelievable proportions. Nobody in the West really wanted to expand this organization by bringing the East and Central European states into it. In my view President Yeltsin was absolutely right when, on one occasion, he said that Russia has no objection, in principle, to certain states joining this alliance, but in the first place, Russia's interests plainly decree that this process should take a certain period of time. Second, the NATO organization must itself be transformed. After all, this was something we agreed on. It was agreed that NATO would be transformed into an organization more in keeping with the present international political and strategic situation. So, the Russian interest stipulates that this organization should first be transformed and given new functions and status. The expansion of this new organization will not then be a problem. This range of questions is bound, of course, to be very important. Here I would also like to mention the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The year 1995 is approaching. This is the year when the nuclear non-proliferation treaty comes up for renewal. I think that, as before, the United States and Russia should stand side by side on this question, coordinating all their actions in perfect harmony. [end recording]
