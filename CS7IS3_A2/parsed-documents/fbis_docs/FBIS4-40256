The Nikolaev Navy yard, which started the ship's construction, is said to have suffered colossal losses involving the ship's maintenance (see UBN no. 1/1993). The Ukrainian Government remains undecided on the construction completion issue. The Varyag, which was designed to carry as many as 80 combat aircraft and thus could be employed for naval task force missions, is said to be too costly (about $1 billion) to make prospects of its marketing abroad bright. The Ministry of Engineering, MIC [military-industrial complex] and conversion is reported as studying the Varyag's utilization. However, the almost completed Ulyanov aircraft carrier, which was scrapped for metal, failed to find buyers. The Chernomorski Navy yard, which was given the right to sell the scrapped ship, is reported as engaged in negotiations with a West German firm to this effect. The ill-fated Varyag's replica, the Russian Navy's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral of Fleet Kuznetsov, which belongs to Russia's Northern Fleet, was built by the Chernomorski Navy yard, too. This class ships' precursors included the Moskva, Leningard air-capable cruisers and the Kiev aircraft carrier.
