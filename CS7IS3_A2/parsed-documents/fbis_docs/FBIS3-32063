This bill will enable us to keep our promise to create 500,000 new jobs for Bolivians during our administration. I am sure you are well aware that a privatization drive is under way all over the world. Even Russia and East European countries are privatizing their public companies. But Bolivia has chosen another path. Rather than selling its assets, Bolivia has decided to invite foreign and domestic capital to invest in our state-owned enterprises an amount of money that is comparable to the value of the companies' equity. In other words, instead of having one YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits], we will have two YPFBs. We will incorporate new and needed management techniques and technology. Principally, the capital inflow will create investments which will in turn generate new openings and create new jobs. We are well aware that the biggest problem in Bolivia is the shortage of openings. This is why we give so much importance to this bill and consider it of paramount importance for the future of our country. The remaining part of these enterprises, which will be owned by the government, will be apportioned among Bolivians. We will establish between five and 10 pension funds so that each Bolivian may have his own savings and be covered for his old age. We estimate that this will happen in 1995. [passage omitted] We cannot disregard the importance of this bill. You may wonder why we took so long to draft this bill that only comprises four chapters and 11 articles. Well, we took our time because we had to discuss it with foreign and domestic investors, and with the Bolivian people -- we have conducted public opinion polls and established task forces to make an in-depth study of the project. We consulted everyone because it would be totally worthless to draft a bill that is rejected by everybody and that yields no results. I ask you to bear this in mind. [passage omitted] Foreign and domestic private investors in our state-owned enterprises will have their profits, their returns, but the Bolivian people will also stand to gain because all those over 18 will have access to the aforementioned pension funds that will provide them with a sure pension for their old age. It is my considered opinion that this bill will be instrumental in creating new jobs and establishing the first social security system in South America to provide coverage for all Bolivians, without exception. I think the new investments will constitute a driving force to spur domestic growth and benefit all Bolivians. I think we can double our growth rate to a pace similar to that of Chile, rather than at our current pace which only serves to cover our basic necessities while leaving unemployment unsolved. We have an agenda. By Carnival Sunday [16 January] -- within two weeks -- we will have submitted to Congress an educational reform bill. Thank God, we have been able to reach a consensus on a basic project. We will draft a bill on this project. This law will not be controversial because we have discussed it with all sectors -- the church, teachers, parents -- and we deem it very important because -- while Bolivia urgently needs new jobs -- one cannot overlook the need for a better education system. We can no longer endure the present education standards -- they are a complete disaster and a disgrace. We want to change our education system by consensus, we want all Bolivians to become involved in it so that nobody feels obliged to accept something against his will. But we must effect this change. Moreover, we are also studying the popular participation project. We are not sure if this will be a law or a supreme decree -- we will seek the people's advice on this issue even if we are accused of dragging our feet. We take our time because a sense of responsibility guides all our actions. Our administration is not arrogant and despotic; we seek other people's opinions, we discuss things so as to avoid instituting policies that wreak disaster on the country like in the past. Finally, we are working on the national budget, which will have a deficit of only 3 percent, as agreed during our negotiations with the IMF. We estimate that inflation in 1994 will be 7.5 percent and that the country will grow by 4 percent. We intend to invest at least $450 million in the public sector. We are putting together a budget that is based on austerity. We will implement cutbacks in government spending instead of increasing taxes. There will be no tax increases. We will modify the tax system so that it is more productive and less damaging, but we will not increase taxes. One thing that I do want to make clear is that it never crossed our minds -- and it never will -- to freeze savings or bank accounts. I do not know where this rumor originated, but it is an evil rumor that is very damaging to our country. [passage omitted] I want to state very clearly that as long as I am the president of the Republic, savings, whether in dollars or bolivianos, will not be touched. [passage omitted]
