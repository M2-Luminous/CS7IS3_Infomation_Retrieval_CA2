The vast majority of delegates accepted the party's list without changes. The first person on the list is Party Chairman Gyula Horn followed by Sandor Nagy, chairman of the MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], and Laszlo Bekesi, responsible for the party's economic policy. On the list containing 174 names, 11 people represent trade unions, eight are members of the Left-Wing Youth Association, and three represent the National Federation of Pensioners. According to the decision of the party's executive, only those who conclude a political agreement with the party can run in the colors and with the support of the MSZP. The point of this is that later, if a person happens to leave the party's parliamentary group, he or she will also have to resign his or her mandate. Matyas Szueroes, deputy speaker of the National Assembly, decided to keep his place on the national list. [passage omitted] In the political debate Bekesi sharply criticized the present government's ideas regarding bank privatization and its overspending from the budget. He blamed the government for sacrificing agriculture and for carrying out privatization on ideological grounds. At the moment, the foreign debt amounts to $24.5 billion and the internal debt is 3 trillion forints. According to Bekesi, the increase of real wages this year and next year cannot be expected. Talking about the internal arguments of the party, Bekesi said if the MSZP would win the elections or would come second, it would not be able to avoid governing and preparations should be made for a social-liberal coalition now. [Kert] The MSZP would not join a future government at any price, Horn said. The Socialists' condition is that the future coalition partners agree on the necessity of a social pact. In the interest of easing the economic crisis they should be willing to continue, what is more, to speed up compensation process, to create a venture-friendly environment and to support agriculture with encouraging credit and trade policies. If we could not fulfill our promises we would step aside, Horn said in ending his closing speech.
