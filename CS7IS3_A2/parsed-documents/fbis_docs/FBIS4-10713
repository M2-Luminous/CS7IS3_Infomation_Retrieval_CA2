In an impromptu message delivered before the start of a cabinet meeting, Menem said that through the results obtained in the 10 April election the government "achieved its political objective regarding constitutional reform," which would enable him to seek reelection. Upon accrediting "the government" with raising the banners of the fight against corruption, Menem warned that these banners "should not fall into the hands of those who would use them exclusively for election-oriented purposes." He was thus tacitly alluding to the successful campaign and victory of the Grand Front in the federal capital. Menem, who asked for "applause" for Communications Secretary Raul Burzaco on his birthday, reaffirmed that "Justicialism has obtained a comfortable victory in the election of delegates for the Constituent Assembly." According to government sources, Menem attributed the Justicialist setback in the federal capital "to the historically proven volatile nature of the federal capital voters," who cast their vote "in accordance with historical circumstances." Commenting to his ministers on the reason for the decline in ballots cast in this election for the Justicialist Party compared to those of 1993, Menem said that this was due to "the special nature" of the 10 April elections. He noted that on 10 April "the ballots were not being cast to elect executive branch or legislative officials" nor were they intended to decide the economic course. Hence, he said, "small parties were able to capture more votes." Underlining the importance of the Justicialist victory, he noted that the Justicialist Party won in "123 of the 127 districts" in Buenos Aires Province and "in all of the 31 districts" in Santa Fe Province. Menem also emphasized the success of the Justicialist Party by affirming that "75 percent of the Constituent Assembly delegates elected nationwide belong to parties that voted in Congress in favor of the constitutional reform." Finally, and before going on to the cabinet agenda, Menem urged his ministers to continue "to work as usual" and put aside "any pessimistic approach toward the electoral outcome."
