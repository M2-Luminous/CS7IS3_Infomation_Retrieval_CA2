FR941222-1-00019 FR941222-1-00007 Pacific halibut PSC catch limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that any overages or shortfalls in PSC catches will be accounted for within the 1995 season. The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May 18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at its December 1994 meeting.

The apportionment for these two complexes is presented in Table 6. Table 6._ Proposed 1995 Apportionment of Pacific Halibut PSC Trawl Limits Between the Deep-Water Species Complex and the Shallow-Water Species Complex [Values are in metric tons] 1Season 1Shallow-water 1Deep-water 1Total Jan 20&hyph;Mar 31 500 100 600 Apr 01&hyph;Jun 30 100 300 400 Jul 01&hyph;Sep 30 200 400 600 Oct 01&hyph;Dec 31 (1) (1) (1) No apportionment between shallow and deep for the 4th quarter. Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut PSC bycatch in 1995 are based on an average of mortality rates determined from NMFS-observer data collected during 1992 and 1993, except for the GOA hook-and-line rockfish, for which 1992/93 rates were not available and the rates from 1990 and 1991 were used. Except as noted below, the Council proposed that revised halibut discard mortality rates recommended by the IPHC be adopted for purposes of monitoring halibut bycatch mortality limits established for the 1995 groundfish fisheries. The Council's action would establish two separate mortality rates for the GOA bottom trawl pollock fishery: 54 percent for shoreside operations and 81 percent for offshore operations. The proposed rate differences for at-sea and shoreside processors result from analyses by the IPHC that showed that at-sea processing vessels had a significantly higher discard mortality rate than the shorebased operators. However, NMFS notes that directed fishing for GOA pollock by the offshore component is prohibited under §672.20(a)(2)(v). The IPHC determined that the careful release measures implemented for vessels using hook-and-line gear did not show appreciable improvements in mortality rates and has recommended one rate for both observed and unobserved vessels in the hook-and-line fisheries. This action was approved by the Council. The halibut mortality rates are listed in Table 7.
