Last year the city's industrial enterprises signed 197 contracts on setting up foreign-funded firms, with a total investment of 596 million U.S. dollars -- 83 percent and 88 percent increases, respectively, over the previous year. Of the total investment, 200 million U.S. dollars came from foreign investors. Some 66 foreign-funded firms went into operation last year. By the end of 1993 Tianjin had registered a total of 674 foreign-funded industrial firms with a total investment of 2.36 billion U.S. dollars. Their registered capital came to 1.74 billion U.S. dollars, of which some 873 million U.S. dollars came from foreign investors. The city now has 187 foreign-funded firms in operation. They have 43,000 employees. In 1993 Tianjin's foreign-funded enterprises recorded an industrial production value of 7.33 billion yuan (about 900 million U.S. dollars) and profits of 750 million yuan, and handed over taxes of one billion yuan. By the end of last year 227 enterprises had started technical upgrading programs by using a total of 590 million U.S. dollars in overseas funds. The technical upgrading programs have helped enterprises improve product quality, technology and management. At the same time, the city has paid special attention to strengthening cooperation with international big-name corporations. In the past two years Tianjin has encouraged a number of its major electronics, motorcycle, refrigerator, washing machine and detergent firms to seek cooperation with big foreign companies, such as Hankel of Germany, Samsung of the Republic of Korea, Honda of Japan and ZEC of Italy. So far, the city has set up joint ventures with more than 100 such companies, 18 of which have an annual production value of over 100 million yuan each and annual profits exceeding 10 million yuan each.
