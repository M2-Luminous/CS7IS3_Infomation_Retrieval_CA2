"The German Government's position is widely known, as we oppose that EU decision," said Schafer, making statements to the press after meeting with Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. The German vice chancellor, who arrived in Managua the night of 13 February for a three-day visit to this country, mentioned that Germany filed a recourse last year at the former European Community Court of Justice requesting that the application of the trade quota for bananas be suspended. The new EU import regulations, effective since July 1993, set the Latin America importation quota at 2 million tons (108 million boxes), 500,000 less than the previous year. "The German Government opposes this kind of EU decision and has filed a recourse at the Court of Justice to revoke it and rebroaden the markets for bananas, which is something we want," Vice Chancellor Schafer said. He did not comment on the recent GATT ruling condemning the importation quota, however. The Union of Banana-Exporting Countries (UPEB), which consists of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala, Colombia, and Honduras, termed the GATT resolution as important, because it allows the strengthening of its position to seek a compatible commercial agreement between the EU and Latin America.
