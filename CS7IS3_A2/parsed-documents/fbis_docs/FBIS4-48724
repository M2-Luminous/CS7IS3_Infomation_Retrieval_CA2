FBIS4-48724 "drafr101_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 25 May South African Press Review for 25 May MB2505115494 MB2505115494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR KwaZulu Land Transfer -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 May publishes on page 16 an editorial examining the transfer of land to Zulu King Zwelithini. While noting that President Mandela has defused the crisis "for the time being," the editorial claims that "disquieting questions remain. The transfer has the hallmarks of a furtive pact and political chicanery....Suspicions linger that Buthelezi was preparing a fall-back position in case the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] lost the provincial election in KwaZulu/Natal. By transferring land held by the KwaZulu Government to Zwelithini, he seems to have been securing an alternative IFP base." Mandela's Speech -- In another editorial on the same page, THE STAR describes President Nelson Mandela's speech to Parliament on 24 May as "romantic" and "wonderfully unifying." "It charted a possible course for the country which would constitute a `high road' in anybody's terms. Stripped to its essence, the president's message is that the middle classes of this country will not only be allowed to continue in their productive endeavours, but will be actively encouraged to do so by the new Government -- on condition that there is full acceptance of the urgent need for the upliftment of the poverty-striken and disadvantaged." Noting that the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program has been endorsed by all major role-players in South Africa, the editorial concludes: "In a programme of sensible, achievable reconstruction and development lies the future of all of us; if it fails, so will we." BUSINESS DAY Mandela's Speech -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY also looks at President Mandela's speech in its editorial on page 10 of its 25 May issue. The paper says Mandela presented "an inspired, positive, and attainable vision of the future that together we can create....His vision of our country's future displays an idealism for which we all should strive." The editorial continues: "We believe in Mandela's sincerity and in his commitment to what he says....We trust the sincerity and commitment of the party Mandela leads....While we would have preferred specific commitments on issues such as the free flow of money and people in and out of the country, we trust the commitment to dealing with them sensitively once more pressing issues have been addressed." The paper notes that Mandela's speech recognized the need to reconcile the concerns of investors and bankers with the demand that "economic and social inequalities...be rectified quickly." The editorial concludes: "The future will not be easy, and attaining the future envisioned by Mandela implies commitment from everyone. We cannot choose but to remain on the road we have taken. Along it we can together create the great society." SOWETAN Gun Control -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on May 25 publishes on page 10 an editorial that notes efforts being made in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, and Vereeniging provisional parliament to strengthen gun control by revising licensing procedures. "In general, we will support any effort to impose gun control on a paranoid society which is `armed to the teeth.'...While limitations on gun licensing is a step in the right direction, a comprehensive plan is needed to make the country relatively gun free." The paper urges that such a plan take into account the need to improve policing so that citizens will not feel the need to own a gun, the need to stop individuals in government agencies from dealing illegally in guns, and the need to stop the flow of guns from Mozambique and other neighboring countries.
