In response to an address, which has been published by the local official press "to realize his special responsibility to the Kazakh nation and correct his mistaken opinion," he made a statement in the regular issue of the newspaper `People's Congress,' which is the voice of the People's Congress of Kazakhstan party. The poet, the party leader, and the deputy of the Supreme Kenges says, in particular: I am experienced enough to understand that this publication of a writer's appeal in the official Kazakh newspapers has been fired against me and inspired by my permanent opponents, who as before prefer to remain in shadow. I used to believe, and I still believe, that national radicalism was and is the manifestation of political ignorance. Therefore, for several years I am trying to restrain the so-called patriots. I and like-minded people in my party believe that "the course of history will lead us eventually to the creation of the confederation of Euroasian sovereign states, with the union between Russia and Kazakhstan being the nucleus of this economic-defense union. You write to me "we don't understand your suggestion. There is no nation in the world which doesn't strive to be independent. How can your speak about confederation, when our independence is only two to three years old?" I want to explain this: confederation is the union of politically independent countries with their own presidents, governments, budgets, currencies, armies, parliaments, and constitutions. These countries are not subordinate to each other, they have a common economic and defense space, regulated by agreements which they sign. Borderlines between them are conventional. The states create the most-favored nation regime in trade and economy for each other. President Nazarbayev has been working for this all these years -- he simply doesn't use the word "confederation." Presumably this is because of his attitude to political terms. Further on, Olzhas Suleymenov went on to note that those who have made accusations do not know history. "You are saying that up until recently Russia acted as an empire while Kazakhstan was a colony." These definitions might have been correct before 1917. Later on, both Russia and Kazakhstan became dependent on the bureacratic center. I studied issues of colonialism and national-liberation movements over a period of thirty years. I travelled to Asiatic and African countries, former British, Portuguese, and French colonies. Can you imagine unskilled Englishman working, for example, in India and any Indian supervising his work? Or can you imagine Frenchman cultivating land in Africa, with his boss being from Senegal? Who is the slave and who is the colonizer? Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan are difficult, says Olzhas Suleymenov. Therefore, now when Kazakhstan is facing a dilemma we have to be honest and objective in remembering the main landmarks of our history. These are: in the 18th century it was Russia who saved Kazakhstan from extermination; in the 19th century Kazakhstan became Russia's colony; in the 20th century we together with the Russian people fought and won. It was the Russian Federation who has given us our independence. This must be remembered. Independence. The conclusion is: Kazakhstan can live without the Russian empire and Russia can develop successfully without Kazakhstan as its colony, but in the very near future they wouldn't be able to exist without each other as equal and sovereign states, since their histories are so interconnected. The current economic and other problems of the two countries is the proof of this. "There is no future for our country if we won't understand this," summarises Suleymenov. "Kazakhstan and Russia have been united by our wise ancestors, let's not allow ignorance to divide us."
