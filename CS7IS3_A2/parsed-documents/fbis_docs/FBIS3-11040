Speaking in Bayamo, Almeida Bosque stressed the need to restore popular target-shooting practice and to encourage all the people to participate in this activity. In a meeting with members of the Veterans secretariat, Almeida Bosque stressed the need to organize a movement for counseling children and young people to make target shooting a common practice if we want each Cuban to learn how to shoot and shoot well. To achieve this, he recommended development through initiatives, contests, and other activities, but always with the objective of contributing to preparing the people for defense. Accompanied by Division General Ramon Espinosa Martin, chief of the Eastern Army; Vice Admiral Aldo Santamaria Cuadrado; other chiefs and officers; and local Granma political leaders, Almeida Bosque expressed interest in current activities, in discipline, in patriotic-military work, and stressed as unavoidable the need for the association to be self-financed.
