"Investment should be based on mutual interest with no exploitation and it must be in line with the direction and the interests of the people who own the country," he told more than 200 Cambodian officials and Thai businessmen at a seminar on investment in Cambodia. The seminar, entitled New Dimension of Cambodia's Investment and Environment, is organised by the Board of Investment and the Thai Embassy. It is the first major seminar since the formation of the elected Cambodian Government. [passage omitted] Mr Chuan, accompanied by a large delegation of public and private sector officials, arrived on Wednesday for what embassy officials called an "historic visit" aimed at boosting the often troubled relations between the two neighbouring kingdoms. The visit was to focus primarily on trade, which the premier said had "expanded rapidly from around $600,000 in 1988 to $183 million in the first half of 1993". [passage omitted] He said more than 10,000 million baht had been invested by Thais in Cambodia and this showed they had great interest in Cambodia. [passage omitted] "We want to see the good investors drive out the bad." The deputy governor of the National Bank of Cambodia said the Khmer Government did not control money transfers and foreigners were free to transfer their profits. Companies have to pay 20-30 percent income tax. The Government will waive it for four years starting from when the company makes a profit and waive import duty on materials and machinery for export- oriented projects. Federation of Thai Industries president Chokchai Aksaranan called on the Cambodian Government to have a clear-cut policy on trade and investment. "The policy must be clear and transparent and must not be changed so often," he said.
