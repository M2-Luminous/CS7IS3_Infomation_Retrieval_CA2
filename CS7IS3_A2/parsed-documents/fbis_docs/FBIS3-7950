In his talks he learned that the Czech Republic does not wish to change the Visegrad Four into a lobby for persuading the European structures to accept these countries more swiftly. When meeting the press at the end of his talks in Prague, the Polish Sejm speaker said that Poland also does not wish for the institutionalization of the Visegrad Four and acknowledges that the Czech side emphasizes economic cooperation. On the other hand, Poland is convinced that the Visegrad Group ought to explain jointly to the West European countries its urgent need to join the European structures. In an interview for Czech television, the Polish Sejm speaker spoke about the current situation in Russia and the possibility that Russia would like to play the role of superpower also within the Partnership for Peace program. Poland must carefully follow developments in Russia where democracy is only in its initial stages. Poland must draw its conclusions and bring them to the Pan-European discussion. In spite of its firm Euro-Atlantic course, in no way could Poland neglect its good economic relations with Russia and Ukraine because it sees the [word indistinct] future of Polish interests in them also, Mr. Oleksy said. Poland and the Czech Republic are of the opinion that only democratic Russia should take part in the structures of the Europe of the future and in its future security system. A Russia with an imperial policy will not fit into the strategy of European security, as it is perceived by Poland and the Czech Republic, the Polish Sejm speaker said in Prague today.
