[Begin recording] [Kamal] I can say that when I left Cairo for beloved Amman there was a paper comprising 12 contentious points. On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, it was agreed that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and the Israeli foreign minister should meet to try to overcome these points, after Israel had a chance to study them, especially from the PLO's point of view. I was somewhat cautious when I learned yesterday about the optimistic report that a compromise [previous word in English] was reached, because Mr. Rabin holds the reigns and has the final say. It became evident that, until this morning, the man was still studying the particular issue of security at crossing points, which is a sensitive issue to both the Palestinian and Israeli sides, as well as to the Jordanian and Egyptian sides. Hence, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon for another meeting before the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan in order to formulate the agreement. However, this must be preceded by a meeting that solves the problems over the issue of crossing points, especially the crossing point at Rafah. This is after Rabin announces that he is coming to Cairo, just as he announced earlier, to sign the final agreement on security preparations and withdrawal within the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. [Reporter] Besides the issue or problem of crossing points, are there other problems obstructing the agreement? [Kamal] I believe that there are still stylistic issues rather than issues that are particularly sensitive to either side or to the Arab side, in general, especially to the Arab cordon states.
