The party Central Committee and the CMC have been paying great attention to improving the party's work style and promoting ethical integrity in the Army. In line with the guidelines laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress, the CMC made a decision to carry forward the Army's fine tradition and intensify ethical construction. Leading comrades of the CMC have repeatedly stressed at a number of important meetings the need to regard the building of the party's work style and clean government as a major issue. They took a personal interest in cases, read reports on self-examination and self-rectification by party committee standing committees in major military units, giving instructions to them, and checked up on the work done by major military units. On the inspection tour, they made it their main task to investigate whether senior cadres had maintained high standards of ethical integrity, and, whenever they found anything wrong, they pointed it out in earnest and saw to it that the mistake was corrected. The CMC has resolved to straighten out Army production and operations and has called special meetings to set out the tasks. On the CMC's instructions, the General Political Department and the CMC Discipline Inspection Commission sent work groups to nine major military units to investigate the situation in building up the party's work style and clean government. All these measures have provided important guarantees for achieving the phased objectives set by the CMC. Party committees and leading organs at regimental level and above throughout the Army have taken self-examination and self- rectification as a practical step to put into effect the call by the party Central Committee and the CMC to improve the party's work style and maintain ethical integrity. They have paid great attention to and meticulously organized the campaign. Leading cadres and staff members at all levels carried out self-examination and self-rectification in real earnest and received education in the campaign, thus promoting the building up of clean government. In improving the party's work style and building clean government, leadership at all levels has focused on the problems affecting army building in line with actual conditions. Taking into account their professional characteristics, various organs instituted new rules and regulations to plug loopholes, uphold unified standards, rigorously enforce work procedures, and clearly define duties and powers. Many units took practical measures to cut down administrative expenditure, relinquished plans to refit their offices and expand their guest houses or reallocate or conceal cars bought without authorization, and rectified unhealthy tendencies, including indulging in ostentation and extravagance. Leaders at all levels have encouraged cadres to work industriously for the people through the campaign to build clean and honest government. They also reduced senior cadres' activities so that they could go down to grass-roots units to help solve practical problems. To comprehensively carry out the tasks set by the party Central Committee and the CMC, party organizations at all levels throughout the Army have paid equal attention to education and to identifying and acting on violations of laws and discipline. They conscientiously studied the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" to arm party-member cadres' minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They conducted in-depth education on the party and the Army's objectives, ideals, convictions, and fine traditions to increase cadres' ability to resist hedonism, extreme individualism, and the decadent way of life. Various units throughout the Army also gave publicity to and commended in many forms those units and individuals who acquitted themselves splendidly in improving the party's work style and building clean government in urging officers and men to preserve the true qualities of veteran Red Army men. A responsible member of the CMC Discipline Inspection Commission said that though the Army had made fairly great achievement in building up the party's work style and clean government in the previous stage, it has a long way to go to meet the requirements of the party Central Committee and the CMC as well as the expectations of the people. It is a long-term task to improve the party's work style and build clean and honest government in the Army, so it is necessary to continue to keep sustained attention on the job, he added.
