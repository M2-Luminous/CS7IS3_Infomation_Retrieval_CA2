The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service reported that large enemy forces, mostly armored cars, launched an attack yesterday against Karabakh positions in the direction of Martuni and Gadrut. The offensive lasted from morning until late at night. After losing five tanks and 30 soldiers on the battlefield, the Azerbaijani troops retreated to their initial positions. Two Karabakh fighters died and seven were wounded. Relative calm prevailed on the other sectors of the front until noon today. The same source reported that an Azerbaijani Air Force plane appeared over Karabakh at around 1030 today. According to preliminary reports, the enemy plane was most probably engaged in a reconnaissance flight. Azerbaijani attack planes bombed the settlements in Askeranskiy Rayon at 1100. Casualty figures are being determined. The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has reported that the calm prevailing on the border for the past three days has not been violated. We talked with the Press Service a short time ago and were informed that the situation on the border remained unchanged at 1930.
