He was reacting to the fact that the leadership of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government coalition, confirmed at a meeting today its intention to push for Senate elections in 81 one-mandate constituencies. Asked about the ODA's further approach at talks on the system of Senate elections Kalvoda said he would consider it tragic for the coalition if it was unable to agree on a government bill on senatorial elections to be submitted to parliament. Meanwhile, Josef Lux, chairman of another coalition party -- the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) -- told CTK that both variants for Senate elections -- the ODS's and that of other coalition parties which prefer Senate elections being held in 27 three-mandate constituencies -- conform with the constitution and the majority election system. What is essential is that the system is clear and transparent, Lux said, adding it was not any fundamental dispute between the coalition parties. These questions will be further discussed and if no agreement is reached it is up to Parliament to decide, he said. "We are prepared to discuss any variant," he added.
