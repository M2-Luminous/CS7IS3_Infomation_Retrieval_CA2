(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data. (b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', requires contractors and their subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract. 227.403&hyph;12 Government right to establish conformity of markings. (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.'' All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 is also a nonconforming marking. (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If the person who has placed the nonconforming marking on the technical data fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction of the nonconformity, the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking. (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking. (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding the existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either_ (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or, (ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense. 227.403&hyph;13 Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions. (a) General. An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 2321, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the item to which the data pertain. (b) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement. (c) Challenge and validation. Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the assertion. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''. (1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. Assertions must be challenged within 3 years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data_
