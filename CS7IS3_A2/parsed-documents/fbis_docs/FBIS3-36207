The symbolism really does appear sinister if you consider the fact that the first meeting between Gerhard Frey and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy took place in Germany while preparations were being made there to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Hitler's accession to power, and their second meeting took place in Moscow while the 50th anniversary of the lifting of the siege of Leningrad was being celebrated in Russia. What do the leader of the "German People's Union" and the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party have in common? Considering himself the "best friend" of the German people, just as Frey is of the Russian people, Vladimir Volfovich cannot understand why he was refused a German visa. Frey is bringing an action against the FRG Embassy and is threatening to win the case, because he has not lost a single court case in his entire busy life. Tell me who your friend is.... Evidently knowing this Russian proverb, at the start of our conversation Gerhard Frey uttered very flattering words about Zhirinovskiy as the future president of Russia. [Vinogradov] Did you know, Dr. Frey, that our readers know you as an extremist, a neo-Nazi, and publisher of the ultraright-wing newspaper NATIONALZEITUNG? [Frey] I have never been either a Nazi or, still less, a fascist, as the former communist press used to portray me. I always struggled for my motherland's reunification, but I was seen as someone who does not recognize the postwar borders and who demands revanche. In my opinion, the point is that, having lost an enemy in the guise of communism, German journalism, which was created according to U.S. standards and licenses after the war, lives on old notions. A new enemy image is now being foisted onto German society -- in the person of my friend Zhirinovskiy and, thus, in the person of the Russian voters who voted for him. [Vinogradov] Did you fall in love with Russia long ago? After making Zhirinovskiy's acquaintance? [Frey] I have always loved Russia. Our peoples have much in common. When Russia and Germany were together, the world only benefited from that. We suffered the greatest losses, and the memory of the millions who died must be a guarantee that we never again end up as enemies. Let us recall history. Russia saved Frederick the Great in the Seven Years' War and saved Europe and Germany from Napoleon, and even in the early twenties, despite the difference in the systems, the treaty of Rapallo was made possible. Zhirinovskiy and I advocate the implementation of a friendly policy in Moscow and Berlin, and then our countries will once again occupy a worthy place in the world arena. Russia is having a hard time now, and we must help it to surmount the crisis. [Vinogradov] How do you rate Zhirinovskiy's calls for the borders in Europe to be changed? Are they consonant with your wishes to return to Germany the lands lost after the war? [Frey] What, in fact, are you talking about? European borders have long been being redrawn. Examples of this are provided by Germany, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union. Next came Belgium, Canada, Italy, Ireland.... The 1975 Helsinki Act is a dead document. The Oder-Neisse line is not a God-given border once and for all. We should proceed from the peoples' right to self-determination. If the population of Crimea, for example, or Belarus wishes to reunite with Russia, who can prevent this? It is perfectly possible that in five or 10 years' time Warsaw will wish to discuss with us the return of Silesia. [Vinogradov] But what about Kaliningrad Oblast, the former East Prussia? [Frey] I do not doubt that in the future our countries will find a mutually acceptable way to resolve this problem too. After all, we have to correct the injustice perpetrated against Germans driven from their primordial lands, be they Pomerania, Sudetenland, or Silesia.
