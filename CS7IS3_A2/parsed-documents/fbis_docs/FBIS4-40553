One thing only is needed for that: North Korea must change its present stand, which only generates more suspicion that the country already has or intends to have its own nuclear weapons. The Moscow proposal still holds about calling a many-sided conference to postpone sanctions. The conference might work out effective measures to safeguard the sovereignty and security of the two Korean states, that's on the one hand, and on the other to guarantee a nuclear-free status for the Korean peninsula. North Korea is among many countries that considers such a conference feasible, but its conduct so far, especially its withdrawal from the IAEA, makes one think that the country opts for a path of upsetting the nuclear nonproliferation regimen. If that is the case the international community has no other choice but to introduce sanctions. Russia's foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev, says such a development would be highly undesirable. The United States draft resolution put before the United Nations Security Council offers an embargo on arms supplies to North Korea, curtailing financial transactions with it and suspending United Nations relief aid, but even if the draft is passed the sanctions will be phased, not introduced immediately. Pyongyang still has the time to prove to the world that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful. As for brandishing arms, this is something fully applicable not only to Pyongyang but also to Washington and Seoul. That can have serious complications on the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of northeast Asia.
