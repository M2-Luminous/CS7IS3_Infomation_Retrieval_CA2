Thank you for coming to answer our questions. First, can we regard what happened yesterday as a victory, a great victory, for NATO and for France? [Leotard] I won't use the word victory for the moment. It is a stage. It is a positive stage on a path where other stages have been very negative. There is still a war situation on the ground, in many other places. The town of Sarajevo is still under siege. The people lack food, they cannot leave. Elsewhere towns are being shelled, women and children are still in a very dangerous situation. I think we have to realize that we issued threats, we threatened to use force, and I am glad to see that this threat worked, that it made it possible to achieve a result, and that it hasn't yet been used. [Giesbert] For you, it is a small first step? [Leotard] It is a step, it is a stage, and a positive one, of course, because what we wanted is happening. But it isn't over. [Giesbert] It is not all done. For example, we have heard every figure as far as estimates are concerned: for the United Nations, 100 percent of the Serb heavy weapons were neutralized or moved yesterday; for Karadzic, the head of the Bosnian Serbs it was 50 percent; for Francois Mitterrand it was 80 percent. Has the ultimatum been respected 100 percent, 90, 80 or 50 percent? [Leotard] You know, day is breaking. Yesterday afternoon we sent two helicopters to Sarajevo, since the planes had problems because of the weather. So now again today these helicopters are going to fly over the hills around Sarajevo. A number of guns, if they are still there, are there for technical reasons. The Serbs themselves showed us that they couldn't move them any more either because there was no more petrol, or the engine of a tank had disappeared, or they were concreted in. [Giesbert] And do you believe this? [Leotard] We checked. We checked. And we will continue to do so today. You must remember that the ultimatum is still there as far as the means of carrying it out are concerned. That is to say that if ever there is to be shelling, for example, of course the hardware that has been assembled, the aircraft, would be used. That is clear. [Giesbert] So you are saying now, this morning, that there could still be air strikes? [Leotard] Of course. Of course. We really mustn't -- I was going to say, disarm ourselves. [Giesbert] So you haven't given in to Serb strategems, as the Bosnian Muslims are accusing you of having done? [Leotard] No, not at all. Let me remind you that were there to be shooting from the Muslim side, they would undergo the same treatment. Let me repeat, we are not there to make war on one of the sides, we are there to enforce respect for a UN resolution, and what is to be regretted is that we were not able to do it earlier, for all sorts of reasons. Now we have to be firm about implementing what the ultimatum actually says, that's to say the use of aerial force should there be shelling of the civilian population. And I will add a second very important factor: the town of Sarajevo is still under siege at this moment, and it is essential to get the siege of Sarajevo lifted. This is our aim now. [Giesbert] That was the aim of the ultimatum, if I understand it rightly? It seems that you have given a short period of grace, a short extension, to the Serbs? [Leotard] There wasn't even half an hour's extension. Not even half an hour. [Giesbert] Ah, because you are not yet quite sure that the ultimatum is being respected? [Leotard] No, not at all. I have just said that according to our information, all, or almost all, the weapons have been withdrawn. We will check during the morning hours whether it is all of them, and whether there is no dishonesty: it is a question of hours, but of course we are keeping the possibility. All the officials (?of the EU) and my counterpart ministers of defense repeated the same thing as I did yesterday in Italy, and so we are keeping the possibility of doing so. Everyone must know that our resolve remains intact. [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, isn't the danger now that the Serb arms might be deployed elsewhere in Bosnia? The weapons that have left the surroundings of Sarajevo will be used elsewhere? [Leotard] That's what I said at the beginning, that we are still in a conflict situation. So when a weapon has not been confiscated and taken under UN control, it is moved to be used, unfortunately. We are in a country where towns are still under siege, and shelling is taking place. So what you are saying is quite clear: there are risks elsewhere now, and what I would like is for the dynamics of the victory on the diplomatic level -- victory is the word you used -- the dynamics of this sea change on the diplomatic level, to get the situation to improve elsewhere. [Giesbert] So basically you are telling us: we will continue to put pressure on the Serbs? [Leotard] Absolutely. And I am convinced that we have to put it not only on the Serbs, but on the Bosnians too. [Giesbert] Is that what Edouard Balladur's statement meant yesterday, when he told us that the ultimatum would stay in force for a few more days? [Leotard] We and the other allies took the decision to retain the air contingent, which is large, and the first infringement will be very seriously punished, and at the same time decided to continue pressure diplomatically and politically, so that, for example, one of the aims we are pursuing, namely to put the sector of the Sarajevo district under UN control, can be put into effect. This presupposes huge diplomatic efforts. For the moment the local people, the Serbs and the Bosnians, say they are willing, but the conditions are not right. That probably means that at the UN Security Council there will be initiatives, it means that there will be extra troops on the ground, for example, it means a number of conditions which at the present moment have not been met. [Giesbert] From what you are saying, Mr. Leotard, we cannot help feeling that in fact everything is just beginning now? [Leotard] I think a lot of people have made the mistake of thinking that... [Giesbert, interrupting] It is not over, it is beginning? [Leotard] Yes, exactly, that the end of the time limit was the end of the war. The end of the time limit is the beginning of another period. [Giesbert] Yesterday evening we avoided the internationalization of the fighting, but it can still get internationalized? [Leotard] We are by no means out of the woods as far as this danger is concerned. You know that we are there to a large extent to avoid this. It is a conflict that has very serious potential dangers for Europe, so if there are 9,000 French soldiers there in the area of operations as a whole, in the Adriatic and in Yugoslavia, we are there mainly to prevent this conflict from flaring up. Let me take the chance to tell you that I hope everyone realizes that the 270 French injured, the 18 dead we have suffered, all this has not been pointless. France's physical effort, the effort of its troops, of its lads, has not been pointless, because I am thinking of them today. I think that what they did made it possible for peace to move forward. [Giesbert] You told me just now that we must not focus all attention on the tragedy of Sarajevo. It is true that there at the moment there are other tragedies -- there is the tragedy in Tuzla, for example. Yesterday the Serbs fired three shells. There is Mostar, where the Serbs and Muslims are resisting the Croats, there is Bihac. [Leotard] There is Srebrenica, there are numerous towns. [Giesbert] Don't we need to make ultimatums now for Tuzla, Mostar, Bihac, and the others? [Leotard] I think so. We have to use the enormous air force that we have now gathered round and over Yugoslavia so that the process of negotiation and political discussion can go on. We have always said, and I repeat it again, that there is no military victory in the real sense of the word is possible on the ground, so now the force we put on show, the force we demonstrated, can have its effect without being used. That is the principle of forces for democracies, in fact. [Giesbert] The force you are talking about, is simply a turning point for European defense? [Leotard] I think it is a real turning point, or in any case I hope so, and I am saying this without self-satisfaction for the French government, or for France in general. It is a turning point above all, because French concepts have gradually been accepted. We are the ones who have been behind all the diplomatic and military initiatives from the beginning. We were the ones who asked for the creation of protected zones. We were the ones who asked for corridors. We were the ones who provided troops. Today about half the planes are French planes. So it was France which took all these initiatives, and it hopes the other Europeans will grasp the dimensions of the Yugoslav tragedy. [Giesbert] You speak of France, but there is another country that has returned in strength to the diplomatic scene, Russia. Are you glad? [Leotard] In a way, yes. I'll tell you why. [Giesbert] Why in a way? Because you feel a bit that it is playing a double game? [Leotard] As long as Russia is in the process of becoming democratic, it is and can be a partner for security in Europe. Of course this condition: as long as Russia is becoming democratic is important. It is doing this. But I think that the Europeans must realize that Russia is a factor in the security if it becomes a democratic country. Why not? Because it is a power which has strategic interests in Europe and round Europe. So we can enter a partnership of dialogue for the architecture of security in Europe. [Giesbert] We now have to think of political solutions, Mr. Leotard. It is time for diplomacy too. What do you want to see in Bosnia -- there are several solutions: there is partition, there is cantonization. [Leotard] First of all -- and it wasn't me who thought of it -- it is up to the different sides, the three sides who are still making war, to sit down round the table. Several months ago they accepted a scenario of -- we say partition, but I hope it won't be partition, because these people have to live together. Trade exchange and a common currency. In other words, that they should manage to find the tools themselves, and define the tools of cooperation between them. If they didn't do that, we would have a continuation of the war, because these are scattered pieces of territory, as you saw on the map. So they have to continue to be able to make exchanges on this part of the European continent. That is one of the most important aims for us. [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, you and Edouard Balladur are going to receive the political leaders today. What are you going to tell them? [Leotard] The prime minister took the wise decision, and a brave one, to consult all the French political forces. He asked Mr. Juppe and me to be with him. I think this is a good picture of what a government can do, first to act, first to face up to its responsibilities and commit itself to its actions, and at the same time to consult the political forcs of the country to get them to ponder this tragedy. [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Leotard.
