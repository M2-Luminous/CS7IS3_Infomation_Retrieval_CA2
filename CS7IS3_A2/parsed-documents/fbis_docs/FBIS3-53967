[Darawshah] Thank you my brother. Greetings to you and to everyone at the Voice of the Arabs. [Al-Jundi] The ball is now in the Israeli court, and there is a proposal from Yitzhaq Rabin to hold a referendum among the Israeli people regarding withdrawal from the Golan Heights after reaching agreement with the Syrians. Could you inform us about the current viewpoint inside the Israeli Knesset and the Government? [Darawshah] The summit between al-Asad and Clinton has greatly affected the political arena inside Israel, be it in government, the Knesset, or among the public. Everyone has become occupied with the meeting, especially President al-Asad's statements regarding his readiness to realize the peace of the brave--one that guarantees a just and comprehensive peace--and to fully normalize relations. In other words, full withdrawal in return for full peace. This is what the Israeli Government demanded previously. It claimed that the extent of an Israeli withdrawal corresponds to the depth of peace that Syria proposes. Clearly, President al-Asad has presented a wise proposal, one that stunned the world and gathered international support. But it has also caused some embarrassment to the Israeli Government and Yitzhaq Rabin. In the past two days, Rabin proposed something that we, as supporters of peace and people who want to boost the peace process, reject. Rabin proposed holding a popular referendum after agreeing on a draft agreement with Syria. In other words, the Syrian negotiators will sit at a table with the Israeli negotiators knowing beforehand that any agreement they reach must be approved by Israeli public opinion, which could change according to the prevailing atmosphere. [Al-Jundi] So, this agreement between the government and Syria could change if the people reject it? [Darawshah] Rabin stated that the agreement with Syria will lead to a big withdrawal from the Golan Heights. He did not specify its extent but said there will be a big withdrawal and sacrifice. So, such a step requires going back to the people for a referendum in which they will express their opinion. I believe this is stalling, a postponement, especially when viewed together with Israeli reaction to the joint statement and the Syrian president's stance, which was dry; it was not sufficiently expressive. We hoped Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres would have adopted a more flexible position showing greater acceptance of the Syrian stance announced by President al-Asad during his meeting with President Clinton. [Al-Jundi] But some believe Rabin is trying to appease Israeli extremists and Jewish settlers in the Golan. [Darawshah] It is, indeed, an attempt to calm the situation. But deep down, Rabin realizes that any peace agreement with Syria must lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from the Syrian Golan. He knows it. I believe most Israelis realize that it is unavoidable. But given the opposition to such a step by the rightists, the settlers, the Likud, and other right-wing members of the Knesset, Rabin is trying to find ways to pacify opponents, such as the referendum proposition. But I believe Rabin knows full well that if he wants peace with Syria, he must pull out completely from the Golan and leave it to its motherland, Syria. [Al-Jundi] Through your contacts with parliamentary blocs in the Israeli Knesset, how much support is there for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan? [Darawshah] I believe that if the Knesset and the Israeli public in general are offered a draft agreement between Syria and Israel based on a complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces and settlers from the Golan in return for a full peace--including the exchange of ambassadors, economic cooperation, security arrangements, water agreement, and a peaceful strategy--the majority will support it. Rabin apparently realizes this but wants to pave the way through the referendum idea. [Al-Jundi] I understand from this that for Rabin, it is only a matter of time and that the withdrawal will inevitably come. [Darawshah] Rabin is known to be a cautious politician. He analyzes positions and moves slowly and gradually. He is doing this with the Palestinians now. He did it with the Jordanians. With Syria too, he wants to move gradually and prepare the public for difficult decisions. For the Israelis, withdrawal from the Golan is a difficult decision and Rabin knows it. So, he is preparing for this withdrawal through proposals, delays, and procrastination. But sooner or later, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan and from all occupied Arab territories is unavoidable. Rabin realizes that Syria is very important if the general Arab-Israeli conflict is to be solved. [Al-Jundi] Thank you. [Darawshah] You are welcome.
