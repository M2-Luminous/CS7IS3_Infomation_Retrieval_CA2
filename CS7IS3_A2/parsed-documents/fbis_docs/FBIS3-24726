The CP negotiator, Mr. Fanie Jacobs, said the alliance would have nothing to do with the six-point proposal submitted by the ANC that placed new restrictions on exclusive powers for provinces. Earlier, the deadline for negotiations was extended to Monday [31 January], and the date for the election was not promulgated today, as was originally planned. It's not known whether these developments will delay a decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party on its participation in the election. An announcement was to have been made after the party's conference at Ulundi this weekend. Similarly, it is not known whether right-wing Afrikaners will decide this weekend on their own transitional council.
