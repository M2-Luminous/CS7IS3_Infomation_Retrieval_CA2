Independent Publications Denied Registration"] [Text] The new year has brought no faster democratic change in Uzbekistan, where a virtual end has been put to freedom of speech. A repeat registration of the mass media was completed by the republic's State Press Committee in the first 10 days of December. Contrary to expectations by the numerous Uzbek opposition, the republic's State Press Committee did not register a single newspaper whose founder was a journalist collective or a private person. In the wake of the "Gorbachev perestroyka," a number of independent publications are known to have appeared and existed till late last year. Besides, some former organs of party and Komsomol organizations, and even of local soviets, started to publish material in a democratic spirit. Deciding to put an end to this "journalist laissez faire," the republic's leadership officially announced that all publications in the republic should be registered again. As was expected, the only printed organs that continue to be published are those of power structures. Having been registered as founders of five main daily republic papers are the Supreme Soviet, the Cabinet of Ministers of the republic, the People's Democratic Party -- successor to the former Uzbek Communist party led by Uzbekistan's president -- and the Republican Fund in Support of the Press set up in accordance with Islam Karimov's edict. The founders of oblast, rayon, and town newspapers have correspondingly become the administrations of the oblasts, rayons, and towns as in recent Soviet times when the mass media were fully controlled by the official authorities.
