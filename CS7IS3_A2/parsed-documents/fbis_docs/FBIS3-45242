Since 1985, Chinese scholars have completed such voluminous works as "The General History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in Northern China", "The General History of Mongols", "The History of the Relations Between Northern Ethnic Minorities" and "The Cultural History of Northern Ethnic Minorities". Three books by Lin Gan, the noted scholar of ethnic minorities -- "The General History of Xiongnu", "The History of Donghu" and "The History of Tujue" -- have roused the attention of historians, as it cleared up the western migration line of the north Xiongnu, the tribal institution of the western Xiongnu and the activities of the early Donghu people, all of which previously posed major difficulties for historians. In his latest work, "New Points About the Ethnic Minorities in Northern China", Lin explored the relations between the northern minorities and the Hans in central China, the assimilation of the minorities by the Hans and the origin of the northern tribes and pushed the research of such significant issues to a new height. The history of northern China's ethnic minorities has been a topic of great interest to the international historical society. Since some 2,000 years ago, in the wide region ranging from the northeastern to northwestern ends of China, there have existed dozens of ethnic minorities. While many of them, such as the Qidan, Nuzhen and Xiongnu, had established their own regimes, the Mongols eventually united all of China and started the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). The history of the northern ethnic minorities is an important part of the history of China as well as that of the world. In its earlier period starting from the mid-18th century to late 1940s, research of the northern ethnic minorities had resulted in the publishing of fewer than 200 papers. The 1950s saw the beginning of a new era for the research. The three decades thereafter produced many important scholars and works, with Ma Changshou and his works on the history of the Xiongnu and Tujue as the representatives. The period from the early 1980s represents a golden time in Chinese ethnic studies. Publications of the period include 49 research works, 26 collections of research papers, 12 collections of historical documents, the Chinese version of 19 works by authors from Russia, Iran, France and Japan, as well as 12 books on archaeological discoveries in the region and how they reflect on northern ethnic minorities. Based on the findings of an extensive social and historical investigation, scholars have completed the histories of major nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including the Mongols, the Daur, Oroqen and Ewenki. Besides the writing of two books on the history of the Mongols, Chinese scholars of Mongolian history also published hundreds of research papers in the period. Of these works, the one of the greatest value is the Chinese version of the "Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty", translated into Chinese by Professor Yi Linzhen from the University of Inner Mongolia. Besides providing numerous annotations based on the knowledge of voluminous ancient documents, Yi has also written a lengthy foreword in the Chinese and Mongolian languages for the classical historical work written in ancient Mongolian language in the 13th century. The work has been partly translated into Japanese and published in Japan. In the latest development, a work by the title of "The Cultural History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in North China" has been completed by scholars from nine Chinese regions and recently published. The book, containing 1.2 million Chinese characters, represents the first systematic cultural research of the northern nationalities from the angles of folklore, archaeology, history, comparative linguistics and art.
