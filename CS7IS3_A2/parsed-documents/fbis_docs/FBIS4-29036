This being the recent situation, the people are seriously worried about left-leaning procommunist forces. These forces, who were held back in the past, have become active recently. People pointed out this is the result of relaxed anticommunist consciousness and of failure to properly implement the functions of public security organizations since the civilian government was inaugurated. This paper carries an in-depth examination of the true aspects of the "left-leaning procommunist forces" in our society, as well as of the failure in public security functions. As clearly elucidated by party Secretary Kim Chong-il in his work, "Historic Experiences in Socialist Construction and Our Party's General Line: Let us have a sense of confidence to enter a new stage of socialist construction by firmly maintaining the chuche cause expelling all challenges at home and abroad." This article, which reminds one of a teaching of the North Korean Workers' Party, was carried in a document of the Hanchongnyon's Central Standing Committee last February. Even though the entire student movement has been recently weakened, the prosecutor office's and police have launched a roundup of core members of Hanchongnyon because they accept North Korean allegations without questions and because their "ideological radicalism" has deepened. Besides, this year the student movement has launched a powerful offensive against the incumbent regime, unlike last year. This worked as a factor that keyed up public security authorities, whose main mission is to maintain public order and stability of the system. The 1994 document of Hanchongnyon's deputies defined the incumbent regime as a "colonial regime with subordinative and a comprador nature to the U.S. imperialists." Thus, public security authorities observe that the degree of attack on the present regime has strengthened remarkably compared to that in the early stage of the civilian government. It is a general view that such "ideological radicalism" of the student movement has deepened since the collapse of Eastern Europe. So-called Marxism-Leninism believers and the chuche idea faction [Chusapa]--two leading factions of the student movement in the 1980's--have been unable to clearly explain the collapse of the socialist camp with existing theories. This being the case, the Marxist-Leninist camp developed a "Trotsky faction," which inherited Trotsky's idea, Russia's communist, on international communism, while Chusapa's ideological dependence on Kim Il-song's chuche idea has been deepened. "The Revolutionary International Socialist Workers Union" [Hyoksano]--a transformed Marxist-Leninist faction--was formed in November 1992. Since Hyoksano was formed, it organized regional committees in Seoul, Ulsan, Masan, and Changwon, and branch chapters in Inchon and Anyang. Thus, it has a nationwide organizational system. Hyoksano even dispatched its members to the consultation office for foreign workers located in Kurodong, Seoul, and propagandized the idea of international communism to the illegal foreign workers. Thus, Hyoksano is keenly interested in international solidarity of socialist workers. The prosecutor's office arrested 11 major class members of Hyoksano in November 1993. However, the people view that the forces of this organization, which has a deep and firm foundation in labor circles, have not been completely eliminated. In particular, the prosecutor's office revealed that North Korean revolutionary songs, including "The Fatherland Is One," were among the songs sung by the workers of the "K" industrial firm in Inchon during their strike, and 170 out of 366 leaflets spread in industrial sites last year propagandized the socialist revolutionary idea, going beyond the limit of the average workers movement. Thus, the prosecutor's office believes that left-leaning ideology is expanding. Meanwhile, the Chusapa, which is leading the student movement, maintains that the collapse of Eastern Europe is an inevitable result of following Marxism-Leninism without criticism, and to solve this problem, people should assume the chuche idea as an ideological base. "Let us decorate the anti-U.S. and antiwar struggle with victory with indomitable spirit, and achieve the brilliant cause of great national unity amid the fierce wind of a confederal system." This is the content of leaflets spread during the meeting of unification forerunners in Suwon campus of Kyonghui University last March. As shown in their leaflets, the students use the exact same words as North Korea. The result of the prosecutor's office investigation of documents confiscated from Hanchongnyon's planning department last April shows that the recordings of the "Voice of National Salvation," North Korea's clandestine broadcasting network directed at South Korea, numbered more than half of the total of 149, and that most of the leaflets they spread were reproductions of North Korean allegations. People also point out that animation of the movement of some "left-leaning procommunist" forces is a result of the curtailment of public security functions. Thus, the people call for "early recovery" of public security functions. It is true that the Agency for National Security Planning, the prosecutor's office, the police, and other public security-related agencies dealing with procommunist criminals, were criticized as an advance guard for security of the regime and as a means to suppress democratic movements under the authoritarian governments in the past. The scale of these organizations was also expanded according to the degree of necessity for maintaining their political system. However, since the civilian government was inaugurated, the number of student movement organizations has decreased, and dissident figures, who carried out antigovernment struggles, have now joined the government, thus changing the atmosphere. As a result, consciousness of the importance of public security has been relatively weakened, and each public security office reduced its staff or transferred its members to public welfare and intelligence fields. Public security-related officials candidly admit that because of this atmosphere, investigators in the anticommunist domain almost suspended their operation until Hanchongnyon's procommunist acts benefiting the enemy became an issue. The number of criminals who were detained on charges of violating the National Security Law was 449 in 1990; 320 in 1991, and 305 in 1992. However, as if to prove the security-related officials' remarks, the number of criminals drastically decreased to 122 in 1993 when the civilian government was inaugurated. As of late May this year, 69 figures are detained. Reduction in the number of detainees reflects the gradual disappearance of cases in which public security authorities unreasonably applied laws and regulations, and curtailment of the overall movement. On the other hand, this means that the morale of anticommunist investigators declined because security-related authorities were treated lightly and accordingly, their investigations were passive. The investigators complain that with the demoted position of security-related offices, they can hardly carry out even essential investigations. A security-related official in the prosecutor's office said that it is true that the past regimes abused public security to maintain security of the regime, and carried out unreasonable investigations. As a result, disputes over human rights violations took place ceaselessly, and people held unfavorable views about security- related authorities. However, since the times have changed, consciousness of the authorities and people should also change. Besides, support for security-related offices should increase so public security functions can actively cope with recent left-leaning procommunist movements.
