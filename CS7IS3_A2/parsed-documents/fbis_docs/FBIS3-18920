It is "completely inexplicable" for the Federal Government and him personally that, in view of the outstanding political importance of this question for Europe, member countries have not endorsed the consensus, the chancellor stated in Bonn on Wednesday [9 March]. In the question of fishery, a package that had exactly taken Madrid's interests into account was presented. "I hope that Spain will endorse this balanced proposal." In the controversy over the blocking minority, the EU presidency presented a "reasonable proposal." He hopes that Great Britain will still agree to it. According to Kohl, the Federal Government sticks to the objective of admiting all four countries -- Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway -- to the European Union in January 1995. He appealed to the still hesitant member countries to clear the road for the conclusion of the negotiations for membership now.
