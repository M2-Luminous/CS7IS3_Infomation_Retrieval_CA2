Located 40 km north of Lima in the region known as Huarangal, the nuclear center is a small science and technology citadel where a group of professionals and technicians specialized in various subjects are developing a series of activities applicable to nuclear energy. The center's most important component is its investigations reactor called RP-10 (10 megawatts of thermal power) with four radial tubes [tubos radiales] and one tangential tubo [tubo tangencial]. The reactor's core contains MTR [materials-testing reactor]-type fuel with uranium enriched by 20 percent in which various samples are lowered for the production of radioisotopes, studies on the behavior of materials under neutron irradiation, neutrography [neutrografia], and diffraction and fission traces. Another important plant component is the radioisotope production plant, which entails a series of laboratories located next to the reactor that are used for the production, quality control, and development of radioisotopes and irradiated [marcadas] molecules. In addition to the nuclear center, IPEN has at its main headquarters in San Borja a test reactor (RP-0), a 14 MeV neutron generator, two gamma irradiators, and several laboratories engaged in projects such as the irradiation of food, isotopic hydrology [hidrologia isotopica], non-destructive tests, and gauging. The Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo nuclear medicine centers, which in addition to rendering routine services also carry out training, research, and development programs, are also part of IPEN's infrastructure acquired with the support and cooperation of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
