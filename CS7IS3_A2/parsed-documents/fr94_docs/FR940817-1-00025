ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA proposes to redesignate Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving the redesignation as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial redesignation and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to the direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
