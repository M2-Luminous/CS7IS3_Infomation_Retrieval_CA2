Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday said Russia was seeking a special accord with NATO taking account of Russia's military strength and nuclear status. "We still hope that the signature will take place in April, as announced by [Foreign Minister Andrey] Kozyrev," the spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said on Tuesday that Russia would join the program by April 21. The NATO spokesman said: "We have not been officially informed about the Russian preferred date of the signing of the Partnership for Peace framework document." NATO sources said it was clear that the Russians were determined to join the Partnership for Peace program, but that NATO was having difficulties in working out exactly what type of cooperation Russia wanted with the Alliance. The Partnership for Peace, aimed at increasing military cooperation between the 16 members of NATO and the former East Bloc countries, has already been signed by Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia and Slovenia.
