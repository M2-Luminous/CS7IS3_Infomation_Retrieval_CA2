Achtung! The Secret of Esteemed Frau Kopel's Success Lies in the Millions"]] [Text] Volgograd--They pleaded: do not harm us. If Germany refuses us help, we will have nothing else to put our hopes in. Our children have no native tongue. Our adults are the most uneducated nation in the country. There are no churches left for our believers. But who today wants to have anything to do with these trivial problems? If Germany, too, refuses help, we will have no future in Russia. They pleaded: tell the truth. For it is even worse to live in a lie than it is to live in poverty. And with the consent of the people who trusted me, I am choosing the honest truth. Throughout the past four years the question of Russian Germans as a repressed and not entirely rehabilitated people was a stumbling block for the two countries' politicians, for the public and for individual citizens. Passions seethed, dozens of conferences were held, and journalists engaged in furious debate. A separate republic. An autonomous national cultural entity. Renaissance. The desert lands of Elton. Practically everything imaginable was proposed to solve these problems. And the Soviet Germans quietly gathered their belongings and left for the West. Two hundred and fifty years ago their ancestors had fled Germany to Russia. Because things were bad there and good here. Now things are good there and bad here. And people always are pulled to where things are better. In 1989 100,000 Germans left the Soviet homeland. In 1993, about 200,000 left. As a rule, these are skilled workers and the most industrious peasants. There are few members of the intelligentsia among them. That is because as of the beginning of the 1990s only about four Soviet Germans in 100 had a higher education. Today no one speaks any longer about an autonomous entity. The explosion of ethnic conflicts has cooled the hottest heads. Today on the intergovernmental level projects of ordinary socioeconomic and cultural development of the territories where there are concentrations of Russian Germans are being proposed and carried out. Germany is giving special attention to the Volga region. Equipment for schools, hospitals and mini plants is being sent there, along with equipment for private farmers and humanitarian aid. We spoke with those to whom this aid is directed and heard: "No one needs us--neither Russia nor Germany." These attitudes are especially strong in Volgograd Oblast. "Our taxpayers' money is being spent uselessly in Russia." A scandal over this matter, after gradually ripening, suddenly burst into the open, stirring up not only the upper echelons of power but also Germany's public opinion. The most popular publications started talking about Germany's having gotten bogged down in Russian problems. Investigators from the Federal Accounting House, analyzing reports on aid to Russian Germans, discovered that the financial investments did not accord with existing expenditures. Millions of deutsche marks had disappeared altogether, and no one knew where. The state prosecutor got involved in the case. And everything had started in 1990, when, under the pressure of the fourth wave of emigration from the Soviet Union and the problem of determining the status of the eastern lands, Germany's government reached the conclusion that it was better to aid Russian Germans within Russia itself than to help them migrate to the FRG. All that needed to be done was to create the necessary conditions for the development of their own culture and education and provide them with economic support, and everything would be fine. A Mr. Waffenschmidt, the German Ministry of the Interior's official in charge of immigrant affairs, was assigned the job of preparing the project and carrying it out with the help of Soviet Germans. However, not having any concept of his own on this account, the civil servant shifted the burden of the problems onto the Association for Germans Abroad (VDA), turning it into his money courier. Today Karsten Slamelcher, VDA's federal secretary, has been sent on an indefinite leave that looks very much like a permanent separation. His further fate depends on the results of an investigation. However, Germany's prosecutor will hardly succeed in finding the ends of all the German money lost in Russia without help from Russia itself. In any case, our attempt to conduct our own journalistic investigation in Volgograd, where a VDA bureau has been operating for two years, led to the surprising conclusion: the truth about the money has no place whatsoever among the interests of the local civil servants. The VDA bureau was set up in the spring of 1992 in Volgograd. A certain citizen from Ulyanovsk who calls herself Frau Kopel, became the head of it. The history of the frau's appearance and activities in Volgograd is mysterious. While spending a half-year in VDA courses in Germany, the Russian citizen Svetlana Kopel gained the support and trust of Mr. Slamelcher. After returning to Russia, she became acquainted with yet another influential "comrade," Anatoliy Yegin, Volgograd Oblast's deputy governor for ethnic questions. By mutual agreement of the two men, Svetlana moved to Volgograd, where she opened and became head of the VDA bureau, which is supposed to implement the program of aid to Russian Germans on behalf of the German government. For reasons known only to her, the Frau did not register the bureau, did not open a bank account, and herself obtained no residence permit in Volgograd, remaining officially employed in the Saratov Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Under Russian laws, this means that the VDA company in Volgograd does not exist, and the frau herself is not a resident and taxpayer of that city. Through unknown means, but most likely not without the help of Yegin, she managed to obtain permission and have a seal of the Volgograd VDA bureau made. The firm does not exist, but its seal does. So she could get to work. In accordance with an intergovernmental agreement, Germany pledged to finance the construction in eight Volgograd villages of 800 cottages for immigrants from the former USSR. Naturally, the homes were intended primarily for Russian Germans. The overall expenditures required investments of more than 8 million DM. Our country assumed obligations to build the infrastructure for the revived villages. The total expenditures are unknown. Volgograd Oblast's Deputy Governor Yegin was in charge of the project on Russia's behalf. Frau Kopel was in charge of it on Germany's behalf. In the summer of 1992, Yegin, who knows nothing about construction, singlehandedly distributed the most profitable contracts, for which foreign exchange had been allocated, among local companies. "Who has what proposals?" There were proposals. In certain cases the cost of houses grew to more than one and one-half times what had been planned. Once again, the reasons are unknown. The participants in this highly unique "competition" included the owner of the VEST Individual Private Enterprise, a well-known former knitwear factory shop chief named Karapetyan. He got a contract to build 65 houses in the village of Umet for a total cost of 3.2 million marks. Yegin's decision to enlist Karapetyan in the German project is yet another riddle, since prior to June 1993 VEST had no license for construction work, and the deadline for fulfilling the contract expired in November. But Kopel approved the contract, paying an advance of 620,000 marks--part of it in cash. When a German government delegation visited the village of Umet in November 1993, it was horrified: foundation pits that had been dug for 17 houses and foundations that had been laid were filled with ground water. There was hardened cement. Here and there stacks of broken brick had been laid with the mastery of primordial man. And this was 190,000 marks' worth. The Germans dissolved the contract and demanded that the advance of 620,000 marks be returned. No one has returned the money to them. Incidentally, seven out of the eight contracts handed out by the generous hand of Yegin have still not been carried out. Although the deadline for their fulfillment has long since passed. In 18 months of life in Volgograd, Frau Kopel's wealth increased with cosmic speed. It is possible that not only the German government's lack of oversight over the expenditure of funds in Russia, but also the VDA Volgograd bureau's lack of a bank account contributed to this. The frau brought hundreds of thousands of marks from Germany to Volgograd in nothing more than a suitcase. Out of this truly golden suitcase, she withdrew personally for herself tax-free wages of 4,600 marks. Incidentally, not a single one of the executives of Russia's other VDA agencies earns so much. The suitcase also produced a bonus of 8,000 marks and then 30,000 marks for the purchase of the apartment where Svetlana's mama now lives. This, incidentally, is also a unique phenomenon--none of the executives of the other Russian bureaus has received money for the acquisition of housing. Money from the same suitcase was used to acquire four motor vehicles for the needs of the Volgograd VDA bureau. Only they were registered, with Slamelcher's permission, in the name of Frau Kopel and are kept in her personal garage. This four-car garage is attached to the two-story home that Svetlana has also managed to acquire in 18 months of living in Volgograd. And the more the frau's property grew, the more incomprehensible events occurred in the VDA bureau. First a very valuable computer disappeared, and then a fax machine, and then certain other small items. On the other hand, the firm's rolls include people whom no one has ever seen. The bureau's employees have dubbed them "dead souls." However, the "dead" contrived to get their pay in foreign exchange. They included, for example, the director of the Saratov Chamber of Commerce and Industry and certain other interesting citizens. Only suddenly something unforeseen happened: part of the report documents disappeared from the VDA office. This was connected with a scandal in Germany, which broke out at the end of 1993. The FRG Federal Accounting House demanded a report on the budget-financed money that had been spent in Russia. And delegations from the German Ministry of the Interior became frequent visitors in Volgograd. They did not want to hear any more of Mr. Yegin's eloquent discussion, and they demanded that they be taken to visit the construction projects and the schools and enterprises where German equipment had been installed. Slamelcher's position became shaky. Yegin's was not yet. The frightened Slamelcher sent a telex to Volgograd: "The contract with Kopel is dissolved. She is not to be allowed to work with documents until the new bureau director arrives and affairs are turned over to him." This was on 23 December 1993. And on 24 December Kopel appeared in the firm's office in the accompaniment of a man. He showed VDA employees his credentials: "Maj Shcherbak, chief of the Ninth Division of the Central Rayon Department of Internal Affairs." Together they opened sealed doors of the director's office, put something in a suitcase, and left. The raid, covered by the officer's epaulets, was repeated two more times. And once again, a suitcase was carried off. During all this time the major was officially on leave. After the second visit of Kopel and Shcherbak, the VDA employees wrote a complaint to the militia. It disappeared. During the third visit they called the OMON special militia. In the presence of armed officers, the "raiders" laid the valuables they had taken on the table. They turned out to be contracts for the lease of tractors that Germany had turned over to Volgograd farmers, certain contracts with "dead souls," and reports on the allocation of humanitarian aid and medical equipment. They were all confiscated as evidence by the Central Rayon Department of Internal Affairs "in the interest of the investigation," and the bank packages of currency--70,000 DM, about $2,000, and several million rubles--were also sent to the same place. A couple of weeks later Mr. Tsilke, the new director of the Volgograd VDA, demanded that the militia return the firm's property. The money was returned. Not to the VDA, however, but to citizen Kopel. The investigator's explanation was murderous in its logic: "The lady said that the money belonged to her." And the "lady said" also that as soon as she left the militia office she was robbed immediately, so she no longer has possession of either the marks or the dollars. One could tell something else about the humanitarian aid from Germany that was sold through the rayon trading organization, with the money earned subsequently being loaned at interest. And about how that aid was selectively unloaded at Lebyazhye Field from Boeings into the cars of civil servants from Yegin's department. One could also tell a lot about the exchange of delegations of schoolchildren, who for some reason were accompanied to Germany by those same civil servants and their wives. But all that is small potatoes, and all in the past. Our task--to show the scale of the abuses connected with the provision of aid to Russian Germans living on the territory of Volgograd--has proved impossible to accomplish. It is already virtually impossible to find the German money that has been lost in Russia. The Russian Germans still have draft programs for the revival of their own culture and for the social and economic development of the territories in which concentrations of them reside. The programs, however, are based not on humanitarian assistance but on the establishment of joint ventures. But local civil servants do not want to hear of these proposals. It is more interesting for them to tackle the problems of Russian Germans without the Russian Germans themselves, so that they can satisfy their own personal requirements in the course of the business. And in the broader sense, both sides are to blame for this. Germany--for the fact that it was too trusting of its own and another country's civil servants. Russia--for the fact that it shifted the problems of its own citizens onto the shoulders of Germany. The color photos spread out on the VDA desk show a smiling and embracing Yegin and Kopel, who is not a frau at all but citizen Smirnova, who kept the name of her former husband--a Russian German. As for Maj Shcherbak, he is living peaceably under the same roof with the former frau. It's such a close-knit collective. The Story Continues At a session of a Russian-German intergovernmental commission that just began the other day in Bonn, one of the most urgent questions will be that of implementing the Russian Federation president's 21 February 1992 edict "On Urgent Measures for the Rehabilitation of the Russian Germans." In many respects, relations between the governments of Russia and Germany will depend on the extent to which progress is made in creating the German national territorial formations provided for by the edict. As will the nature of the economic assistance in settling Russian Germans in Volgograd Oblast. The government delegation will include Anatoliy Yegin, deputy governor of Volgograd Oblast.
