It states: ``The agenda of the 32d NRSR meeting includes two important items -- the so-called bill on bilingual signs and the so-called bill on [birth and marriage] registers. We draw attention to the fact that these laws constitute only another partial solution to the entire language problem. Leaving aside the initiatives of the Slovak Heritage Foundation, there have been six meetings of representatives of Slovaks from southern Slovakia at Surany devoted to this issue. At these meetings they repeatedly warned that the social, civic, and also political situation in southern Slovakia continues to pose a permanent threat to the language and ethnic sovereignty of Slovaks in their own state. Approximately 500,000 citizens of Hungarian nationality, but more than 1.2 million Slovaks, live on the territory of southern Slovakia, leaving aside members of other nationalities and ethnic groups. Therefore, it would be democratic if not only political parties, but all citizens living in the region, made decisions on its major problems. We recognize the language rights of all our fellow citizens. However, we cannot accept rights going beyond the framework of established European norms. Their realization in our conditions would jeopardize the standing of members of the Slovak nation. Moreover, a return to names and designations [of communities] from the time of pre-1918 Hungary and from the history of Horthyite Hungary is inadmissible. We cannot accept the disappearance from the Slovak south of names and designations after Slovak national figures. ``Entries in [birth and marriage] registers in the language of the minority clash with the codified standard of the state language. Interference with this standard is inadmissible in all advanced countries. "We appeal to you to postpone the planned partial solutions and to deal with the language problem comprehensively, in a separate NRSR law on the protection of the state language and in a law on the status of ethnic minorities. In those two laws, the problem of designating place names should be tackled exclusively by means of transcription of the official name into the minority language. Should the NRSR fail to accept this proposal, we consider it necessary that this sensitive and serious problem be dealt with democratically -- by means of a referendum." Eva Garajova, Andrej Strycek, and Stanislav Bajanik yesterday personally visited NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic in this matter.
