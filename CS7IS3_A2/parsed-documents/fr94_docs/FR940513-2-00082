FR940513-2-00082 FR940513-2-00039 The current National Academy on Aging has been in operation since late 1991 under the auspices of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. The principal aging policy issues addressed by the Academy have been income security, long term care, older women, and the implications of demographic change in an aging society. Information regarding the work of the Academy is available by calling the Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging at (202) 619&hyph;1269. (5) Other Older Americans Act Mandates 5.1␣Responding to the Needs of Minority Elderly Through National Minority Aging Organizations Throughout its history, the Older Americans Act has assigned a high priority to the development and provision of services to those older individuals who are in greatest economic or social need, with particular attention to individuals whose status is low income or minority. Consistent with this legislative mandate, the Assistant Secretary for Aging has established four major initiatives which have special relevance to low income minority older persons. The four initiatives, which are described in detail elsewhere in this Title IV Program Announcement are: (1) Home and Community Based Long Term Care; (2) Special Concerns of Older Women; (3) Nutrition/Malnutrition Among the Elderly; and (4) Developing a Blueprint for Future Aging Generations. This priority area is intended to underscore the stake of minority aging populations in efforts now underway to advance these initiatives and to enlist national minority aging organizations in these efforts to better serve and represent minority elders. The growth of the older population, the impending acceleration of that growth rate when the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, and the implications of these developments have attracted considerable public attention. What has not been impressed upon us so strongly is the diverse composition of our growing older population. While today, 44 million persons are over the age of 60, 14 percent of these older persons are minority. By the year 2030: older whites are expected to grow by 197 percent; older African Americans will grow by 300 percent; and older Hispanics will grow by 395 percent. Immigration is a primary factor in this projected growth. Combined with projections that older Pacific-Asian and Native American persons will grow by 200 to 300 percent, these numbers will make minority elders total about 25 percent of the older population in 2030. When we fully realize the potential impact of these numbers and the accompanying diversity they reflect, both among and within future older populations, a number of key minority aging issues take on new dimensions. Minority elders continue to experience a number of barriers to home and community based long term care; the gaps in income, health, caregiving, and housing faced by older minority women have reached crisis proportions; minority elders are more likely to be malnourished and need better access to nutrition programs and services; minority older persons are a litmus test of whether we, as a nation, can plan well for a diverse and equitable aging society in this decade and well into the 21st century. National minority aging organizations_representing older persons, professionals, advocates, program planners_that have the capacity, the experience, and the conviction to work for and with minority elders are a vital source of leadership and action in addressing minority aging issues. They have essential roles to play: (1) In ensuring that home and community based care is accessible and available to at-risk minority elderly; (2) In meeting the special concerns of minority older women; (3) In targeting nutrition services to malnourished minority elderly; and (4) In securing for minority elderly a fair opportunity to serve and be served in a diverse and equitable future aging society. Applicants under this priority area should demonstrate that their proposed projects will produce specific strategies, with measurable outcomes, for dealing with one or more of the four (4) issue areas outlined above. The applicant should make clear who will undertake what action under the proposed project; what the outcome, results, and intended benefits will be; and what the potential is for the replication and reinforcement of the strategies being proposed. In particular, the applicant must demonstrate that it has concrete plans for continuation of the proposed strategy and project activities after the demonstration period has been completed. Thus, the effort being proposed by the applicant must not only make tangible and significant differences in the lives of minority elderly, these changes must be seen as having a lasting impact. Eligible applicants under this priority area are national minority aging organizations with extensive knowledge and experience in serving, representing, and working with minority elderly. AoA expects to fund approximately five (5) projects under this priority area for a two-year period with an approximate federal share of $150,000 for the first year and $100,000 for the second year of the project. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994. 5.2␣National Volunteer Senior Aides/Family Friends Projects An estimated five to seven million children suffer from chronic health conditions/disabilities; approximately one to two million of them need help (because of disability) with activities such as feeding, dressing, or bathing themselves. About 90 percent of these children are cared for at home. Public/formal resources for such care are in scarce supply. Furthermore, the informal, supportive, traditional bonds within extended families and communities are not as available as in the past. Additional resources are needed. Drawing upon the experience and good will of older volunteers is one way to help alleviate some of the overwhelming burden that the families of disabled children so frequently face. Older volunteers can be a significant resource for the families of severely disabled or chronically ill children. This has been demonstrated in recent years by the Family Friends Program of the National Council on Aging (NCOA) and by the Volunteer Senior Aides Program of the Administration on Aging (AoA). (The latter was modeled upon the former.) These two intergenerational programs match mature and caring volunteers with children who have special needs because of disability or chronic illness and with children/families who are otherwise in distress.
