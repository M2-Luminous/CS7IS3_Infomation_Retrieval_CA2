The proposal was raised at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' meeting with Jordan's King Husayn in Amman two months ago. A year ago, Israel also proposed digging a channel through the 'Arava from the Gulf of Elat to the Dead Sea. The waters from the channel would flow over the disputed area, and joint tourism projects would be set up on its banks. Jordan is demanding an area of 320 square km in the 'Arava which Israel took over 20 years ago. Some of the area is cultivated by 'Arava settlements. Political sources said yesterday that the size of the disputed area is still unclear because the Israeli-Jordanian border in the 'Arava was never authoritatively marked either on maps or on the ground. The agenda agreed on in the Israeli-Jordanian peace talks in Washington states that in determining the international border, the border dating to the British Mandate, on the basis of maps and the situation on the ground, would be taken into account.
