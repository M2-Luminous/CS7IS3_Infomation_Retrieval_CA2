Speaking on the "Sunday Newspaper" radio program, Peter Boross expressed the view that the coalition now being formed is not unified. At the same time, the outgoing head of government also stressed that it is in interest both of the country and of the Hungarian Democratic Forum that a successful government be created. He said also that this year there was a turnabout in the economy. Inflation and unemployment fell and productivity improved. At the same time, he believes that a wrong assessment was made at the beginning of the system change in the region about how much time is needed for people to become more satisfied with their lives. According to Peter Boross, this requires 10-15 years. The outgoing prime minister believes that a government which does not take up the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the borders and does not make a stand in their interest does not deserve the trust of the Hungarian people.
