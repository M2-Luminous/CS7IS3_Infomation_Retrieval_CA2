Indeed, Russia has economic and strategic interests in Bessarabia and certainly wants to preserve its former assets in spheres of influence. Similarly, the West does not have a clear idea of the identity of Bessarabia as Romanian soil. The West knows that Russia has to be protected to avoid a large-scale explosion. These things, however, are not the explanation for the fact that nothing has come of our country's reintegration. It was simply the stubbornness of Snegur [Moldovan president] and that of the communist oligarchy to preserve their privileges, or to be more than they were after the collapse of the Soviet empire. In 1991, under Snegur's leadership, Bessarabia proclaimed its independence and called itself the Republic of Moldova. The Romanian Government acclaimed it. Since the situation was not yet clear, Mircea Snegur was talking about the development, over a short period, of the Republic of Moldova, after which the problem would be posed of returning to the mother country, "as would be normal." Snegur and the others began their game. First, one by one, they rid themselves of the patriotic intellectuals, who demand unification. Then they accepted assistance from Romania on the grounds of a brother in despair, only to turn to the Russians, from where they get their fuel. In this way they are able to maintain a minimum standard of living, which, however, offers a certain stability and the possibility not to begin the reform process. It never crossed their mind to open the border with Romania. All this time, Bessarabia is conducting fierce propaganda for the independence of the great republic. The war in the Dniester region was a break during which it consolidated its popularity -- there is someone who earnestly concerns himself with the country during hard times. In actual fact, however, Snegur lost the Dniester region. Then came the climax -- the 27 February elections and 6 March referendum. Snegur gathered around himself all former communist nomenklatura members. He turned definitively toward Russia, promising that he would stay in its sphere of influence. He lashes out at Romania because it is the only one that can take away his power -- by annexing Bessarabia. In Mircea Snegur's view, the Romanians and Bessarabians are not only not the same people, but not even brothers. And soon the Romanian language will probably be prohibited in Bessarabia. All this was possible with the help of a good friend from Romania -- President Ion Iliescu. Both have studied in Muscovite schools. The similarity in the way Snegur and Iliescu developed is striking. Iliescu organized a referendum and the Constitution was adopted -- Romania became a semi-presidential republic. Through the elections in 1992, Iliescu has a parliament, which he controls. Snegur has a puppet parliament and, through the referendum on independence, he became the great communist duke of the Dukedom of Bessarabia. Iliescu tramples on the fallen heroes of December 1989. Snegur tramples on the heroes fallen in the Dniester war. Iliescu loses Bessarabia, Snegur loses Dniester. Both are sending out signals of love to Moscow. Terrible times are in store for Bessarabia -- it is much easier to install an absolute dictatorship in a small dukedom. And, as long as the Iliescu bloc is in power, not much can be done for Bessarabia. History can no longer be falsified -- the monarchy brought Bessarabia back to the country, the Iliescu bloc lost it. And a question -- if Romania were to claim Bessarabia, would Snegur call the Russians and would he shoot at the Romanians?
