FR941031-1-00021 FR941031-1-00003 The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A ``substantial number'' is defined as a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to a proposed rule, or any number of small entities judged to be substantial by the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic impact'' is defined by an annualized net compliance cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a threshold cost level for defined entity types. FAA Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for small entities operating aircraft for hire at 9 aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled operators and $4,850 for unscheduled operators. Of the 141 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the proposed AD, 6 airplanes are owned by the federal government. Of the other 135, one business owns 26 airplanes, one business owns 9 airplanes, one business owns 8 airplanes, 1 business owns 7 airplanes, one business owns 4 airplanes, two businesses own 3 airplanes each, thirteen business own 2 airplanes each, and forty-nine businesses each own 1 airplane. Because the FAA has no readily available means of obtaining data on sizes of these entities, the economic analysis for the proposed AD utilizes the worst case scenario using the lower annualized cost threshold of $4,850 for operators in unscheduled service instead of $69,000 for operators in scheduled service. With this in mind and based on the above ownership distribution, the 64 entities owning 3 or fewer airplanes would not experience a ``significant economic impact'' as defined by FAA Order 2100.14A. Since the remaining five entities do not constitute a ``substantial number'' as defined in the Order, the proposed AD would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
