Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, praised Sichuan, the most populous province in China, for making impressive economic achievements in recent years. "I'm sure Sichuan will achieve greater economic development in future," he said in a group discussion about premier Li Peng's government work report with NPC deputies from the province. He said that with weapons factories, steel plants and a railway network built in the early 1960s, Sichuan, including its leading manufacturing center of Chongqing, has a sound industrial base. Therefore, Sichuan will be able to continue to expand its economy on that base, said Qiao. Sichuan should accelerate the development of township factories and a diversified economy suited for hilly areas to spur the growth of its rural economy, he said. Land-locked Sichuan Province, Qiao told the deputies, has its own advantages for attracting overseas investors, such as its rich natural resources, cheap land and labor, and low prices.
