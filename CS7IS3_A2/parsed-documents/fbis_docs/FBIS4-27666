"I understand the concrete time and method of a sanction will be determined after the U.N. Security Council studied a report from Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." Yi, concurrent national unification minister, made the remarks at a working luncheon with the members of the foreign policy, unification and security subcommittee of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party's special committee for the buildup of international competitiveness. He indicated that even if China were shy of taking part in a sanction, Seoul and its major allies could mount an effective sanction. "China's particpation in an international sanction is desirable," Yi said. "But, it is obvious that even if China does not take part, an economic sanction by South Korea and its major allies like the United States and Japan would deal North Korea a serious blow."
