The decision on Monday by the homeland cabinet not to take part in the April election appeared to add fuel to the stoppages. "The government is deeply concerned over the current unrest and its possible impact on South African citizens and interests and on the peaceful implementation of the election process," said a South African Government statement issued in Pretoria. It said South Africa was keeping a close watch on the situation in the homeland. "The government has once again addressed an urgent appeal to the Bophuthatswana government to become a full participant in the constitutional process, including the proposed election," the statement said. South African Defence Force members, meanwhile, conducted military excercises near Bophuthatswana borders, but defence spokesman Maj Merle Meyer said they were not to prevent the unrest spilling across the border. The homeland government accused South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha of fanning unrest in Bophuthatswana and attempts by Ambassador Prof Tjaart van der Walt to mediate in a labour crisis at the homeland's Broadcasting Corporation were rebuffed. After a day of police action against strikers in the homeland, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] recommended financial strangulation of the government of President Lucas Mangope, cancellation of Bophuthatswana's diplomatic ties with Pretoria and other measures if the homeland flouted TEC directives. The announcement came hours after African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela urged Pretoria to withdraw its seconded officials to force Mr Mangope to step down. "I think we have now given him enough time. I have tried to reason with him (Mr Mangope) but it is clear he has no vision. Further pressures will be used and I have no doubt he will not be able to withstand them," Mr Mandela told students at the University of Venda. In another development in a day of drama in Bophuthatswana, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said an IEC delegation including chairman, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, would travel to Bophuthatswana on Wednesday for talks with the homeland government. As stoppages spread on Tuesday, strikers at the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] held hostage BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon Masilo at the corporation's offices. Eddie Mangope is President Mangope's son. The hostage drama ended when homeland police stormed the building anf fired tear gas at hundreds of workers who had taken virutal control of the corporation. The strike over pay cut radio and television broadcasts on Tuesday. Mr Eddie Mangope, who earlier had told South Africa's ambassador he would resolve the crisis on his own and did not need the intervention of the diplomat, was found in the offices unharmed. Between 10 and 20 strike leaders at the BBC were reported arrested. Later, Mr Eddie Mangope said in a statement the crisis had been resolved following talks with the strikers and the BBC would resume broadcasts on Wednesday morning. Confirmation of this claim could not be immediately obtained. [passage omitted] Striking civil servants are demanding participation in the election process to ensure their pensions are protected under a new government. Mr Mandela said on Tuesday an ANC government would not seize the pensions. On Tuesday scenes of violence were witnessed around the capital Mmabatho with teargas being used indiscriminately by the homeland authorities for most of the day. The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng. Burning barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in streets in Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed with rocks, stood on street corners. There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. A source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA that members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to help out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently confirmed. A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at least two camera teams had their film confiscated. [passage omitted]
