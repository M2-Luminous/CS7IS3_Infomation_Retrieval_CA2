The Geneva negotiations and the withdrawal of the aggressor's artillery from around Sarajevo were the main focus. We have just received Mladen Bosnjak's report: [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Mr. Silajdzic, what were the results of your talks with [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate] Granic? Mr. Lazovic, how was the proposal on the three-way or four- way organization of the authorities and territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina--made by the Bosnian Croat convention--received in Geneva? [Silajdzic] I think we held four meetings with Mr. Granic. We agreed, first, that military commanders should meet and try to put into effect a total cease-fire. We also agreed that both sides completely supported a project entitled All Return Home. That means creating conditions for everyone to return home, for everyone who has been expelled to be able to go back home. I think that we owe such an approach to our era and to this civilization. I am pleased that the Croatian delegation accepted such an approach. We also agreed that the talks should be intensified and should resume. [Lazovic] I can say the proposal by the Bosnian Croat convention--which had been accepted by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly--was received with real interest in Geneva. That was the first time that Bosnian Croats appeared before the international public with a policy completely different from that of Zagreb. The delegation of the Bosnian Croat convention clearly said at a news conference that they represented two-thirds of the Bosnian Croats and that they denied the right of legitimacy to Akmadzic and others who are really entitled only to represent western Herzegovina. This is a complete novelty in the policy of the Bosnian Croats. I am convinced that the official policy of the Republic of Croatia will have to take this into consideration in the upcoming period. It is interesting that even the representatives of the so-called Srpska republic listened to the proposal with a certain degree of interest. If the activities of the Bosnian Croats achieve satisfactory results in the coming period, particularly in the international arena, I believe that a change could be brought about that is favorable to the overall Bosnia-Herzegovina policy.
