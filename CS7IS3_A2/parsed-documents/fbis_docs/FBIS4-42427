Almost half of the tax cuts will enable companies to employ low and unskilled workers at lower costs. The parties negotiating for a "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66] agreed that structural unemployment is one of the country's major problems. The partial agreement brings the formation of the new government closer, it is being said within the potential coalition parties. The party specialists, brought together within the so-called A Team, are recommending that their party leaders (Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo) allocate around G5 billion to resolve this problem. They want to use that money to reduce costs to the employer. Insiders point out that the agreement is a "first step." The party specialists did not consider the effect of the proposed measures on incomes. "They will have to discuss this with the politicians appointed by the crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions." Despite this partial agreement, the extent of spending cuts remains the principal point at issue during negotiations on the formation of a government consisting of the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66. The threatened new financial shortfall of G3 billion is playing a part in the negotiations. PvdA leader Kok believes that the negotiators must find a solution to make up for this deficit. Kok: "I have a sort of double role, negotiator on the one hand and finance minister on the other; it is therefore in my own interest to prevent complications, as otherwise it is I who will have to face them later." Kok believes that the G3 billion deficit is "not casting a shadow" over negotiations between the three parties. Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo were once again optimistic yesterday about the prospects of forming a "purple" coalition.
