In a written statement presented to Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas, the former minister said he will use "all legal measures, including extreme ones" to defend himself against the "self-will" of the prosecutor's office. In order to avoid conflicts, Butkevicius demands to stop the official investigation of the alleged financial violations in the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense forces in 1992-93 and to stop legal proceedings against him. The former minister also demands to return the property that was seized during a search in his apartment. Last week, over 40 searches were carried out in apartments of former and present Defense Ministry employees, including Butkevicius. In his March 21 statement, published by the RESPUBLIKA newspaper Wednesday, Butkevicius said he did not commit any crimes during his service as defense minister. Butkevicius said he is prepared to explain how the weapons were bought, however "not as criminal, but as a former Lithuanian defense minister."
