Relating to Its Capital Requirements for Equity Specialists May 9, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 14, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 8, 1994, the PSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 1 On April 1, 1994, the PSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, Office of Derivative and Exchange Oversight, SEC, dated March 4, 1994. Amendment No. 1 made various clarifying amendments to the proposed rule change. 2 See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, Office of Derivative and Exchange Oversight, SEC, dated March 28, 1994. Amendment No. 2 made further clarifying amendments to the proposed rule change. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The PSE proposes to amend its rules relating to the capital requirements for specialists. The proposal states that if an Exchange specialist firm is subject to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement Under Rule 15c3&hyph;1, 3 such firm must maintain a minimum net capital of not less than $200,000. 4 The proposal establishes a lesser minimum net capital requirement for broker-dealers in specialist posts that are backed by more than one broker-dealer. Finally, the Exchange is proposing to amend its rules in response to recent amendments adopted by the Commission to its net capital rules for Exchange specialists. 5 3 The Aggregate Indebtedness Standard under Rule 15c3&hyph;1 states that no broker or dealer, other than one that elects the Alternative Standard, shall permit its aggregate indebtedness to all other persons to exceed 1500 percent of its net capital (or 800 percent of its net capital for 12 months after commencing business as a broker or dealer). See 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1(a)(1)(i) (1993). 4 The term ``net capital'', as used in the PSE proposal, means net capital as defined by Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1. Rule 15c3&hyph;1 defines net capital as the net worth of a broker or dealer, adjusted by certain adjustments prescribed in Rule 15c3&hyph;1. See 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1(c)(2) (1993). 5 According to proposed PSE Rule 2.1, Commentary .03, the proposed amendments to Rules 2.1(b) and (c) will become effective on July 1, 1994. See Amendment No. 1, supra note 1. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements governing the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
