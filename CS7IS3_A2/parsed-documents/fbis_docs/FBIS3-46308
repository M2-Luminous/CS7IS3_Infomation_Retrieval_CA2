It was on this very day that the tense two days of textile negotiations between China and the United States were scheduled to end and when the drastic reduction of China's textile export quota, as announced by the U.S. Government at the beginning of the month, was to take effect. International public opinion has believed that the U.S. unilateral action of reducing China's textile export quota, if enforced, will trigger a trade war between the two countries which might result in tense Sino-U.S. relations. Thus, the success or failure of this round of Sino-U.S. textile trade talks carried major significance. The text of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Sino-U.S. Textile Trade Agreement was subsequently signed by both sides at 1740 [0940 GMT], less than half an hour before the U.S. negotiators' scheduled flight departure time. The concessions made by both sides on the premise of preserving their own interests have averted an outcome not beneficial to either side, and these have produced results satisfactory to both. Focus and Divergence China has been the largest supplier of textiles and garments to the United States, with an annual export value amounting to several billion dollars and representing 13 percent of the textiles and garments sold in the United States. The quantity of Chinese textiles and garments to be exported to the United States are subject to the limits of U.S. import quotas to be negotiated and agreed upon before they are recorded in the textile agreement. With the termination of the third Sino-U.S. bilateral textile trade agreement on 31 December 1993, China and the United States, from September through December 1993, held three rounds of unsuccessful talks in a bid to conclude a fourth agreement. The focus of disputes was the question of "illegal transshipments." The so-called illegal transshipments refer to illegal trade carried out fraudulently to avoid quota procedures binding both exporting and importing countries. The United States has alleged the serious illegal transshipment of China's textile exports to the United States. For example, China-made garments bearing the labels of another country or basically China-made garments transported to a certain country for simple processing were sold to the United States as local products, thus avoiding the quota binding China and the United States. It should be pointed out that such illegal acts were carried out by a handful of enterprises in China. In fact, concerning the question of illegal transshipments, the stand, interests, and regulatory objectives of both China and the United States coincide. Illegal transshipments have not only upset the United States' import quotas in terms of protecting its own textile industry but have also disrupted China's export order, lowered the prices of its exported textiles, disturbed its export channels, and resulted in it being unable to guarantee its product quality. China and the United States diverged on the following three major points: First, the United States maintained that about $2 billion worth of Chinese textiles have been illegally transshipped to the United States, while China held that, despite the existence of illegal transshipments, the actual amount was not that high. Second, the United States pressed for a mandatory reduction of quotas, based on "substantial information", as a punishment, while China insisted that a punitive reduction, if permitted, must be based on the facts and should be examined in consultations to avoid unilateral action. Third, the United States emphasized that cracking down on illegal transshipments is the sole responsibility of the Chinese side, while China pointed out that both sides must be responsible in a common crackdown because these illegal transshipments involved not only Chinese exporters but also U.S. importers and businessmen of a third country who engaged in illegal activities. As both sides held fast to their views, no agreement was reached in the first three rounds of negotiations. On 6 January 1994, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor hastily announced that if both sides were unable to reach an agreement in the fourth round of negotiations, the United States would, beginning 17 January 1994, reduce Chinese textile import quotas in 1994 by 25 to 35 percent. Mutual Concession; Mutual Benefit; Mutual Satisfaction Representatives of the Chinese and the U.S. Governments began their fourth round of negotiations in Beijing on 15 January. Accompanying the U.S. negotiators to Beijing were representatives of U.S. textile manufacturers, importers, retailers, and consumers' associations. Jennifer Hillman, leader of the U.S. delegation and chief textile negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, said that they were here to supervise her negotiations. As both sides were well aware, both parties' interests would be seriously hurt if negotiations were to break down again. Hence, from the very beginning, both sides were hoping to reach an agreement and the atmosphere was frank and pragmatic. The negotiations were tense and tough. On the first day, Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, invited his American counterparts to dine and then turned the dining table into a negotiating table, enabling both sides to better understand the other's flexibility limit. Negotiations on 16 January, a Sunday, adjourned at 0100 hour in the morning. With talks entering a crucial stage by noon on 17 January, neither side had the heart to eat a formal lunch and merely filled their stomachs with hamburgers. Both China and the United States eventually made the necessary concessions: China -- agreed to accept a textile quota reduction of up to three times the amount of textiles if conclusive evidence proves Chinese enterprises' involvement in illegal textile transshipments; accepted major adjustments to automatic increases of some categories of textile quotas as proposed by the U.S. side; agreed to factory visits by personnel from the U.S. Mission in China after obtaining the Chinese side's consent, permission from the enterprises to be visited, and on condition that they be accompanied by personnel from the Chinese side; and agreed to hold consultations over the imposition of a limit on silk products. The United States -- renounced the reduction of Chinese textile import quota by 25 to 35 percent; withdrew the original discretionary clause in the handling of the illegal textile transshipment problem; agreed to a 1.63 percent increase margin for 1995/1996; and agreed to retain the flexible clause on interchangeability of quotas for different categories of textiles. Mutual concessions lead to mutual benefits. The agreement, reached on the basis of mutual concessions, has helped both sides avoid major losses. China will not be forced to lower its annual textile exports worth more than U.S.$1 billion and the American importers, retailers, and consumers will avoid losses amounting to tens of billions of dollars as a result of drastic import reduction of Chinese textiles. Viewing the situation as a whole, if a fierce trade war were to erupt between the world's largest developed and developing nations, their economic losses would be unmeasurable. This agreement also signifies that, as trading partners, a party should not ignore the views of another by indiscriminately and unilaterally handling contradictions and problems emerging from bilateral trade. As Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, told Chief U.S. negotiator Ambassador Hillman after the signing of the agreement: The best way to solve problems is through dialogue and consultations on an equal footing; any attempt to exert pressure will be in vain and will only lead to a trade war. Ambassador Hillman also acknowledged that the adoption of a formula deemed fair to both sides has resolved differences and led to an agreement satisfactory to both. The Chinese People Certainly Mean What They Said The Chinese Government has always attached great importance to the question of illegal transshipments, a focus of the Sino-U.S. textile trade talks. As far as strengthening propaganda and education among enterprises engaged in export and production and perfecting legal systems are concerned, the relevant departments have successively handed down more than a dozen documents, explicitly banning illegal textile transshipments. Serious actions were also taken to crack down on such illegal activities. In particular, the "Provisions on Banning Illegal Textile Transshipments," jointly formulated and promulgated in March 1993 by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, emphasized both prevention and crackdown. Three national conferences were convened in early 1991 and in early and late 1993 to specifically thrash out related matters. On the organizational side, in July 1992, China set up a group to investigate illegal textile transshipment problems. With participation by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, and with Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as chairman, the group led a nationwide campaign against illegal textile transshipments. Nationwide on-the-spot investigations were conducted in September 1992 and May, July, and August 1993 to identify problems and plug loopholes. In late June 1992, in a bid to strengthen cooperation with U.S. Customs for joint action, China submitted to the United States a proposed draft of "the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding on the Joint Prevention of Illegal Textile Transshipment (Draft]." China also instituted investigations of enterprises suspected of involvement in illegal transshipment activities and, once confirmed with conclusive evidence, took stern measures against them, including punishing those who were responsible and exposing their activities. So far, China has punished 14 China-based enterprises dealing with export and production, terminated trade ties with three foreign enterprises, and closed down a foreign enterprise's office in China. It should be pointed out that, after all, Chinese enterprises engaged in this sort of illegal activities are extremely few in number. Of the 69 illegal textile transshipment cases the United States handed over to China between April 1990 and 16 January 1994 for full investigation, only five out of the 47 investigated cases were confirmed, the rest lacked full or sufficient evidence. Vice Minister Shi Guangsheng, leader of the Chinese negotiating team, emphatically pointed out: This handful of enterprises, which sought their own benefits at the expense of national interests, have upset the normal Sino-U.S. trade order; their illegal acts must be resolutely and sternly dealt with. From now on, enterprises involved in illegal transshipment will face quota reductions -- for serious cases -- withdrawal of operating rights, and -- for those held directly responsible -- legal consequences. He further urged governments of various localities and departments in charge of foreign trade to attach greater importance to this issue and do their part in protecting national interests. He said that areas found to be involved in illegal transshipments will face punishment of more than three times the quota reductions. The Chinese people certainly mean what they said; when a promise is made, it will be firmly honored.
