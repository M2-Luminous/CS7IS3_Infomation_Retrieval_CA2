FR940930-0-00148 FR940930-0-00028 Provisions established in the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program Fees rule (57 FR 30044, July 7, 1992) give EPA the authority to recover all reasonable costs associated with enforcement and compliance activities performed by EPA. CFVs certified for use in the Pilot program may be subject to California-only fees if a manufacturer only intends to sell the CFV in California. However, other CFVs certified under the same process may be subject to fees applicable for a federal certificate. This would be the case if such CFVs were sold outside of California (e.g., CFVs used in the CFF program outside California). As EPA proposed in the NPRM, vehicles certified as CFVs are to be labeled according to CARB's revised motor vehicle emission control label specifications. 19 These revised labeling requirements include labeling vehicles to designate that they meet LEV, ULEV or ZEV standards. 19 Contained in California's proposed LEV program, California Code of Regulations, Title 13, section 1965. 2. Heavy-Duty Clean-Fuel Vehicle Standards Today's rule requires that engines intended for use in clean-fuel vehicles greater than 8,500 and up to 26,000 pounds GVWR meet a combined non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) plus NO X emissions standard of 3.8 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/Bhp&hyph;hr). This new standard applies to all light and medium heavy-duty engines which are to be certified for inclusion in the Clean Fuel Fleet program, independent of fuel type. (Also, this standard applies to heavy heavy-duty engines participating in the Clean Fuel Fleet program for the purpose of generating credits.) Thus, it applies to vehicles operating on gasoline, diesel, alcohols, gaseous fuels, electricity, and other fuels. Section 246(f)(4) of the CAA requires that credit-generating standards be promulgated for heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, including standards for heavy-duty ULEVs and ZEVs. The CAA requires these standards to be ``comparable'', which EPA interprets to mean comparable to the credit-generating standards established for light-duty vehicles. a. The Heavy-Duty Clean Fuel Vehicle Low-Emission Vehicle NMHC+NO X Standard. Section 245 of the CAA sets forth the statutory framework governing establishment of the heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicle standards. Section 245(a) sets a combined NMHC+NO X standard of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr for engines intended for use in heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, reflecting a 50 percent reduction from the current combined HC and NO X standards for heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDE). Section 245(b) permits EPA to set a less stringent standard or standards if EPA determines that the statutory level of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is infeasible for clean diesel-fueled engines. Under this provision, EPA must make a determination as to the feasibility of this standard for clean diesel-fueled engine technology, taking into account ``durability, costs, lead time, safety, and other relevant factors.'' If the Administrator determines that the standard is not feasible for clean diesel-fueled engines, EPA may set a less stringent standard so long as it is at least a 30 percent reduction from the combined NMHC plus NO X standards for model year 1994 heavy-duty engines. A 30 percent reduction would be equivalent to a NMHC plus NO X standard of 4.41 g/Bhp-hr. EPA determines today that a combined NMHC+NO X emission standard of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is infeasible for clean diesel-fueled engines, for the reasons discussed below. Under Section 245(b)(1), EPA has the authority to establish a less stringent standard. The only statutory criteria for setting the less stringent standard is the requirement that the standard require at least a 30 percent reduction from the combined NMHC+NO X standards for the 1994 model year heavy-duty engines. Because the same standard that will apply to diesel-fueled vehicles will also apply to vehicles run on other fuels (including gasoline), EPA has looked at feasibility for both diesel- and nondiesel-fueled vehicles. Based on these considerations, EPA has decided to set the standard at 3.8 g/Bhp-hr. (i) Establishing the NMHC+NO X Standard. In determining whether the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO X standard is feasible for clean diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines, EPA believes that the CAA does not require a determination that the standard is feasible for every diesel engine family, but rather that it is feasible for at least enough diesel engine families such that fleet operators have enough choice to meet their requirements under the Clean Fuel Fleet Program. The clean-fuel vehicle standard is not a mandatory national standard for all heavy-duty vehicles manufactured, but instead applies to vehicles that fleet owners in certain areas must buy as a certain percentage of their vehicle purchases beginning in model year 1998.
