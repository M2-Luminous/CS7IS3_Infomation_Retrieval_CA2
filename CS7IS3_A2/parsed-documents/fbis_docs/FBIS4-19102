[Begin Juppe recording] First, of course, we have to put an end to the Serb offensive against Gorazde, without delay and without conditions. This resolution must not waver. Of course, France, which is part of the air support contingent, will face up to all its responsibilities as far as this is concerned. But equally, in order to prevent a potentially never-ending escalation, we have to set precise political aims for our action in Gorazde, starting with an immediate cease-fire, and, second, the deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on the ground to act as a buffer between the communities. We are contemplating the possibility of a Security Council resolution to this end. [end recording]
