The Abu Sayyaf group was forced to flee Hill 734, their biggest camp in Sampinid, after an intensive military operation. Here is Arnold Clavio's report from Basilan: [Begin Clavio recording] Government troops have overrun at 3 AM today Hill 734 in Sampinid complex, the center of the Abu Sayyaf camp. The military had been in an offensive position since last night, prepared to finally capture the reputed kingdom of Barhama Sali. When the camp was captured, the military immediately named it Camp (Gadjuli), in recognition of the heroism of Lieutenant Colonel (Johnson Gadjuli), who had earlier planned the capture of the Sampinid complex, but was unfortunately shot in the head by an Abu Sayyaf sniper. At present, the military is continuing its mop up operation and its pursuit of Sali's group in Sampinid. Colonel Edgardo Espinosa, commander of the 3d Marine Brigade, said they are carefully scouring the complex for possible land mines buried by fleeing bandits. Espinosa added that they are scheduled to exhume the bodies of Abu Sayyaf members killed, and excavate the group's arms cache. According to Espinosa, once they have totally cleared the perimeters of Sampinid complex, they will immediately establish a permanent battalion of Marines in the area. The 445th Engineering Battalion will also join and undertake reconstruction of houses. Meanwhile, the bodies of three Marines who were earlier reported missing were found today. The bodies of Sergeant Edgar Escobidal, Sgt. Vicente Kaplanan, and Private First Class Romarico Espijo were flown to Zamboanga City. The number of casualties on the military side has reached nine, while 41 Abu Sayyaf members have been killed. [end recording]
