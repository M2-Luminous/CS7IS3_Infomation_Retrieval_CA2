In October, 267 were registered, following 296 in September. The figure for November has not yet been published in the Bundestag, the response said. The 335 crimes in December consisted of 16 arson attacks, 39 attacks against persons, and 280 "other crimes," such as material damage or insults. A total of 176 suspects were reported.

According to the Federal Government, 3,900 investigations were discontinued -- mostly because it was impossible to find a perpetrator.
