[Vaitekunas] Yes, explosions, the beginning of privatization, innovative economic changes -- all these things are interrelated and they manifest themselves in the criminal world in the most repulsive manner. When I assumed this office, my colleagues and I primarily stated that we could not pursue normal results without a normal instrument, that is, the law. This is from what we began. A department was set up at the ministry to prepare draft laws. Where did the law on preventive detention originate? At the ministry. Certainly, the Seimas [parliament] had to bring itself to adopt such an untraditional decision. However, we did not see a better option under the conditions of that time. No one proposed such an option. This played an important role in stabilizing the situation. We believe that the perspective is linked with the law, where our initiative is essential. Certainly, our influence on the criminal situation is the greatest through the exposure of offenses. I suppose that it is the exposure of some brutal and impertinent crimes which has allowed us to stabilize the situation slightly and forced criminals to change "forms" of work. Crimes are becoming more intelligent... [passage omitted] [Versinskiene] Let us go back to the law on preventive detention. How many people were detained in our country under this law? Are there any situations when courts send the work of investigators down the drain, when criminals are released from court rooms, or when they receive very mild punishments? [Vaitekunas] We detained 270 people over the four months it was in effect last year, and more than 90 individuals this year. I would not dare accuse courts, but the situation is hardly favorable. We have agreed with the prosecutor general to hold a coordination meeting in the near future. Courts often return criminal cases so as to add new facts to the investigation, while their motives concern the uncertainty about the restriction of witnesses and their evidence. Some lawyers claim that this restriction should be interpreted in a very specific manner -- the restriction of persons themselves rather than their evidence. What would such restriction mean then? We disagree with such a position. Therefore, we have already submitted for government's consideration and coordination a package of amendments to laws that would really allow to classify witnesses, victims, and their evidence as secret. Opponents say that this restricts their right to defense, that the defender and the accused are not allowed to familiarize themselves with all material, and that constitutional human rights are violated. Yes, this sounds nice. However, we all enjoy these rights. If the latter are endangered, the Constitution protects the victim. [passage omitted] [Versinskiene] Your relations with the press are rather complicated. Why do journalists often fail to receive information from officials? [Vaitekunas] The press is meant for the reader. Therefore, it goes without saying that it wants to provide operative information. We are interested in the press, because it is also our way of communicating with people. If an official providing information feels responsible and comments on an event or fact in line with his duties, there should not be any misunderstandings. I am being frank -- I have a special sentiment for your paper. RESPUBLIKA has been of great help for me not only as a human being, but also as an official in my difficult duties. I have already said and I can repeat again that RESPUBLIKA and I are on the same side of the barricade. However, one must always remember that all people, even journalists, make mistakes. Thus, one should also admit one's mistakes. I miss one thing in the press -- I would like to see not only recorded facts and superficial descriptions, but also more thorough analyses. Journalists are people who look to the perspective and who have broad views. Therefore, their possibilities to influence various processes are also very large. [Versinskiene] My last question concerns the perspective in particular. There are plans to transfer border defense to your ministry. Are you ready for that? [Vaitekunas] It is the Seimas that will adopt the final decision. Amendments to relevant laws have already been drafted. First of all, this means very considerable physical work for us -- the number of jobs alone in this system is 6,000. On the other hand, there is great responsibility. After all legal issues are settled, they will demand the immediate introduction of order on the border. However, no one can promise this, because it is a process rather than a one-day job. Nevertheless, there is no other way. We also have a virtual need for this. Looting, car thefts, drugs, contraband -- everything travels across the border. We will assume all the responsibility then, and there will be no one to accuse. [passage omitted]
