FR940620-0-00157 FR940620-0-00029 Response. Because of the likelihood and serious effect of breakdowns in tunnels or on bridges, AASHTO recommends full shoulders in longer tunnels and a 30 inch curb or public sidewalk. A four foot shoulder is the minimum recommended for bridges on arterials. Where motorist aid communications systems are provided in new construction, it should be possible to provide physical access from the roadway to the callbox (e.g., with an indentation in the raised curb at the callbox). Comment. The NPRM asked whether callboxes were available that met the five pound requirement for controls and operation. One manufacturer of callboxes that utilize cellular telephone technology was confident that its equipment could meet the force requirement, although it acknowledged that some changes to their current specifications might be necessary. Another manufacturer, whose radio signal callboxes are powered by user actuation of a pull-down handle, asserted that the mechanics of this process made it impossible to meet the five pound force without increasing the range of motion required or impeding system reliability. The manufacturer reported that its product had been found usable by five persons with a range of mobility impairments during independent testing by the Delaware Architectural Accessibility Board in 1985. Several State highway agencies noted that callbox technology is now focussed on cellular telephone communications because of greater system reliability. Response. Many industries have retooled to implement technological advances. While some manufacturers may have difficulty achieving the required operating force, accessible roadside callboxes are available from several manufacturers. Moreover, the operating force requirements in ADAAG are the same as those in UFAS, which has been in effect since 1984. Some units that do not currently comply with the operating force requirements can be made accessible by the addition of mechanical operating components. The increased range of motion which may be necessary can be accommodated by a lower mounting height or by reversing the direction of lever operation. No substantive change has been made in operating force and control provisions. Comment. The NPRM asked questions on the mounting height of callboxes, inquiring about the feasibility of a 48 inch maximum height rather than the standard 54 inch height. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) commented that callboxes as low as 42 inches above finished grade would meet standards imposed by the Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. 101, et seq.), ``*␣*␣* if callboxes are mounted on the downstream side of their supports. A breakaway support with a callbox mounted opposite the direction of traffic will carry the callbox over the car on impact.'' While a few commenters anticipated increased difficulty in snow removal at a lesser height and some noted guardrail and other possible mounting impediments in existing locations, no commenter furnished information that would preclude a lower installation. Furthermore, several commenters noted that systems currently installed in California are mounted with the highest operable part at 54 inches, with the bottom of the receiver somewhat lower and its armored cord within 46 inches of grade. Persons with disabilities and groups representing them recommended a lower height, ranging from 36 to 48 inches. Response. Callboxes are located outdoors where surface conditions may not allow as controlled an approach as is possible to elements installed in a building. Furthermore, persons using callboxes located as recommended by the FHWA should be facing traffic and may be using a front approach to the device. Therefore, the interim final rule requires that the highest operable part of a callbox be mounted no more than 48 inches above finished grade at the callbox. This height requirement should ensure that the bottom of the callbox is at or above the 42 inch minimum recommended by FHWA. Comment. The NPRM requested comment on programs proposed in California that would provide access to motorist aid communications systems by means of cellular technology, and asked if these were an acceptable alternative to physical accessibility at the callbox site. Responses were received from many Service Authorities for Freeway Emergencies (SAFE), several State and local transportation departments, and many persons with disabilities and organizations representing them. Although several persons with disabilities welcomed the access offered by such a program, most commenters recommended that new callboxes be physically accessible and noted that providing cellular telephones only to persons with disabilities was discriminatory. Other commenters noted that the logistics of such a program would be unmanageably complex and could not guarantee cellular telephone availability to all who might need them. Response. As discussed above, newly installed callboxes must be physically accessible. Access to existing facilities, including callboxes and callbox systems, is covered by the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150(b)). Comment. The NPRM proposed that callboxes not require voice-only communications. Comments from individuals who have hearing impairments and organizations representing them recommended that callboxes include TTYs or provide for the use of a portable TTY.
