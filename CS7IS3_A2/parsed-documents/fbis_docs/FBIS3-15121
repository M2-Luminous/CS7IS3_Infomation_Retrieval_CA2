The date and procedure for the elections are to be determined by a round-table conference of all parties and political movements of the country, according to the party's central committee coordinating secretary, Sergey Skvortsov. He published this statement in Moscow today on the eve of an expanded government meeting to discuss ways out of the economic crisis scheduled for March 4. According to Skvortsov, the way out of the crisis "lies in the total rejection of the so-called course of reforms rather than its adjustment proposed by the Duma opposition. It is evident that a bankrupt president does not want this and cannot do this, just as the stillborn Duma does not want this and cannot give up the course either." In Skvortsov's opinion, Russian President Boris Yeltsin "in his address 'On the state of the nation' virtually recognized the total bankruptcy of his policy and recognized the existing practice of unilateral concessions to the West as unbefitting." However, "Yeltsin made these statements by no means to ground his resignation." Vice versa, "having lost a considerable part of his social base, the president is trying not to let power out of his hands by looking for support in the present Duma opposition," according to the coordinating secretary. To avoid social upheavals, it is necessary to bring about changes to the current situation in the country and find politicians who would really stand up for the people's interests, the renovated Communist Party leader believes.
