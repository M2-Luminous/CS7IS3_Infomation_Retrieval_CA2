After a barrage of katyusha rockets on the Galilee this morning, the head of Northern Command has put the blame on the Hizballah organization. At the same time General Yitzhaq Mordekhay made it clear the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] would not let Hizballah escalate the situation in southern Lebanon. According to Gen. Mordekhay, there may have been a connection between the katyusha attack and the SLA's [South Lebanese Army] bombardment of Sidon.
