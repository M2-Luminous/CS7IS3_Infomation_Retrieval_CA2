Daqing Oil Field is now entering the late period of high water content development and has an overall water content as high as 80 percent, which poses a serious threat to Daqing's ability to attain its objective of 50 million tons of sustained and stable yearly crude oil output. In early 1992, Daqing Oil Field Management Bureau organized a key attack to study the worldwide problem of submerged well logging interpretation, and it has now made an important breakthrough. They have now produced a feasible method for thick strata residual oil saturation logging interpretation, thin strata position determination, and high platform oil strata submerged strata logging interpretation. After placing several 10 wells into operation for confirmation, the coincidence rates were, respectively, 89.5 percent, 93.4 percent, and 85.3 percent. Daqing Oil Field has now completed submerged strata interpretation for 3,625 wells at an average interpretation coincidence rate of 75.7 percent. The related technical personnel have used the new "FJ3 submerged strata integrated interpretation technology" to interpret 115 readjustment wells for Daqing's No. 6 Oil Extraction Plant with a coincidence rate of more than 80 percent.
