As all of you, ladies and gentlemen, have already been aware, after the audience, His Majesty met with both of us [Ranariddh and Hun Sen] and proposed to the royal government the cease-fire, a standstill, and the meeting with the Khmer Rouge at a roundtable. As you know, we already answered His Majesty when we saw him -- not just at this point in time -- that we are pleased to accept his proposal. In sum, the royal government is prepared to declare that it accepts an unconditional cease-fire, the standstill, and the proposal to set up a cease-fire observation committee with two generals representing the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] and two others representing the Khmer Rouge group [words indistinct]. We are always ready to participate in the roundtable meeting under His Majesty's chairmanship if the cease- fire becomes secure. His Majesty said the table would not be rectangular; it would definitely be round. This is to relieve His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan's anxiety about the problem of parity. Besides, why did we inform His Majesty that we would not go to Jakarta or Paris? Because, as the king has said, if we (?are just brought to perform at the circus), the problem will not end. We have our national pride and prestige after the general elections organized by the United Nations. Our fellow countrymen, estimated to be about 89.7 percent of the total voters, overcame all manner of obstacles to cast their vote. This is evidence of their love for liberal democracy. As we have a Constitution, a fully independent and sovereign kingdom, a national assembly, a king, a royal government, and a country, we must talk to settle Cambodia's problems. Now the Khmer Rouge issue is a Cambodian problem, so it should be discussed in Cambodia. Moreover, we have a king. As the Constitution has clearly specified, although he has not yet become our Cambodian nation's parent, the king has a great mission to reconcile and unify the nation. So the king cannot go to other places except for our country. That being the case, the royal government has proposed that if there is a roundtable, the roundtable should take place in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Moreover, the Royal Palace belongs to His Majesty, who is regarded by all Cambodians as their own parent endowed with a neutral attribute. Does the Khmer Rouge group consider the king as a nonneutral person and the royal palace a nonneutral place? This is the position of the royal government. Besides, we should also clarify that it was I who kept talking and staying with the Khmer Rouge. It was only after the 1993 elections that I crossed to this side. Therefore, we already held a lot of rounds of talks, signed the [Paris] 23 October 1991 accord, and participated in the elections. The Khmer Rouge group had ample opportunity to return to the national community. I do believe that now it is not yet late. The Khmer Rouge, like the kingdom and the royal government, must provide an immediate answer to the most correct proposal, which takes into account the people's aspiration for peace and which considers the royal palace as a neutral base for national reconciliation. This is the message I ask the national and international radios to help convey to H.E. Khieu Samphan. [applause] As you know, I, Ranariddh, have been despised for several months. The Khmer Rouge continues to call me the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] chairman, and now it has gone so far as to call me a French or American lackey or a mad dog. A Cambodian newspaper has even said that I have secretly met with the Khmer Rouge -- Ranariddh has no secret contacts; samdech prime minister [Hun Sen] has always been aware of those meetings. Because they do not want to come, I accept to act as a dog for the sake of peace. As I secretly met with the Khmer Rouge in Bangkok, some said that Ranariddh did not care about the government's fame and honor. I was willing to see him [Khieu Samphan] and talk with the hope that we were able to put an end to Cambodia's bloodshed. In light of what you [journalists] reported to the king yesterday, it can be understood that it is the royal government -- with the Khmer Rouge refusing to participate in the elections, accept the Constitution, recognize the National Assembly, lay down arms, and hold talks -- which wants to wage war. This is because the government is responsible for the war, which has dragged on in our Cambodian Kingdom. No one else is better than I am. What more should I do? Some people may say: Look! After the fall of Anlung Veng and Pailin, now he is ready to negotiate a cease-fire. Nevertheless, the national and international media have not paid attention to what I have said. I met with Khieu Samphan before the events of Phnum Malai, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so on. I asked him to declare a cease-fire. We were ready to talk at a round or rectangular table, but a cease-fire should be declared first. This is to establish an acceptable and appropriate basis for the talks. Therefore, it is not just now that we want to talk. I wish to clarify this again. However, Khieu Samphan's only answer was: We cannot cease firing, and Your Highness Ranariddh should understand that the Vietnamese are attacking the patriots. I then said: If you say that, there is nothing left that we can negotiate. I went to talk about the Cambodian problems, but in his answers, H.E. Khieu Samphan said the Vietnamese were attacking and that the Vietnamese were preparing the 14th dry-season offensive. In 1993, he still insisted that there was a 14th dry-season offensive. This means that talks, the elections, and the signing in Paris are all meaningless. In sum, today we do not mean to whitewash ourselves. We still want to end the bloody war because our neighbors, as His Majesty has said, are extremely happy to see us continue to expose one another ceaselessly -- the Cambodians have a bad habit of asking for help from others when they are bickering among themselves. This is what the neighbors want us to do, and this is what we have continued to do so far. For 23 years, we have never wanted to stop or repent of what we have committed. The royal government wishes to repeatedly state that it is ready to go to not only the Royal Palace but also Pyongyang. This is because Pyongyang is His Majesty's royal palace, Pyongyang is a parcel of Cambodian land. Before they were barred from staying in the Royal Palace, but now they can stay there as they please. The reason that we did not allow H.E. Khieu Samphan to stay in the Royal Palace was that we were of the opinion that His Majesty is the Cambodian people's own parent and a neutral person and that the Royal Palace is a neutral zone. So the conflicting parties should stay away from the neutral place. However, he disagrees. Now we have agreed to let him stay in the Royal Palace if he wishes. However, his answer is that Phnom Penh, Cambodia are not the neutral zones. Anyway, we are ready to go to Pyongyang, but we can in no way allow our sacred king (?to be used by them on stage again). We ask that the Cambodian people should not be used as monkeys at (?a circus). I really don't know what more to do. National and international media have regarded Pailin, Anlung Veng as something gigantic. I also listened to France-Inter Radio. When the KRAF captured Pailin, the radio said nothing about that. However, when the Khmer Rouge retook Pailin, it reported about it every hour. There were also interviews with experts on Cambodian affairs. I would like you to ponder a bit. The Khmer Rouge occupied Pailin since 1989. The former State of Cambodia, although it made a great deal of effort, did not try to retake Pailin. This was due to the negotiations. Afterward, even H.E. Akashi [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia chief] was not able to enter Pailin, but the KRAF could do so. I do not want to raise the circumstances under which the KRAF were obliged to retreat. I would like to ask you to be even-handed in the treatment of the issue. Could you just refrain from saying that the KRAF are defeated everywhere? Somehow, now can they do business in Pailin? I have seen no paper reporting about the Khmer Rouge's destruction of our Cambodia's national environment, future, and natural resources in Pailin. Has anybody talked about the Khmer Rouge's giving foreigners a free hand to commit the destruction that constitutes the most heavy burden for our nation's future? Has anybody talked about the royal government's duty as stipulated in the Constitution's Article 3, saying that no group can divide Cambodia? Has anyone ever talked about this? Blame is always placed upon the government. I come here just to beg and clarify. It it true that we have retreated from Anlung Veng, but Ta Mok has felled hundreds of thousand cubic meters of trees and sold them to a country, namely Thailand. The government does not want to win, but it does not want to lose, either. The government is prepared to talk, cease firing, and implement a standstill. It is also prepared to send two generals [to take part in the cease-fire observation committee] and participate in talks under the correct and lofty chairmanship of His Majesty, our sacred king. Is it like that? [Ranariddh asks Hun Sen] We are two, so from time to time we should ask each other for additional advice. In my capacity as the first prime minister, I think my clarification about the cease-fire that some of you raised with His Majesty is enough. [passage omitted]
