Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said yesterday that he raised this matter during talks with Singapore leaders. Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day official visit here, he said he had also suggested that arrangements be made to facilitate the speedy crossing of the Causeway for tourists from Malaysia and Singapore. Datuk Abdullah, who was here at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Professor S.Jayakumar, yesterday met Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and had a two-hour informal dialogue with Young PAP [People's Action Party] members. On Monday, he called on President Ong Teng Cheong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Deputy Prime Minister BG [Brigadier General] Lee Hsien Loong and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng. He said that these meetings provided an "excellent opportunity" for him to discuss bilateral matters as well as forthcoming events like the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in July. At the press conference, Datuk Abdullah said that there should be closer contact between the young people of Singapore and Malaysia to improve their understanding of each other. He disclosed that he had mooted proposals for the easier flow of the labour force working on specific projects in the three Growth Triangle countries, and between Singapore and Malaysia during his talks with Singapore ministers. He said: "We want to see more projects which are established on the basis of bilateral and trilateral collaboration, not just individual country projects." He elaborated: "In other words, we will have Singaporeans, Indonesians and Malaysians working together and experiencing a new cooperative effort to cultivate projects successfully. We can optimise the labour and skill resources and consultancy services available. "In my view, this is the sort of modality that can become the catalyst for future closer relations between the three countries." He said Singapore leaders had told him that they would look into the matter. He stressed that he was not advocating a general opening of immigration doors. Said Datuk Abdullah: "I don't want to create the misunderstanding that I am suggesting to my brother countries -- please open your doors wide and allow anyone to enter and ask for jobs. "I am talking in terms of specific projects which have been set up under the name of the Southern Triangle venture so that those who are involved in these projects should be given the facility to move in and out. "For example, if some Johoreans want to work in Batam or Singapore, then they should be allowed to move there quickly and come out." On implementing measures to facilitate the crossing of the Causeway for tourists, he said the recently-completed North-South Highway had made it more attractive to travel by road to Singapore and vice-versa. "Why can't we make some arrangement to allow tourists to cross the border very quickly and not get caught at the Causeway for hours?" he asked. "The Causeway check-point has become a choke-point." One measure, he suggested, could be prior checking in the city. With a special permit, passengers on a tourist bus can be cleared without their having to disembark for immigration checks. "The point is, if you want to encourage tourism in Malaysia and Singapore, let's have such an arrangement so that both countries can benefit," he said.
