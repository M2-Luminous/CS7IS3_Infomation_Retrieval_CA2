(Equitrans), 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;570&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to install a delivery tap under Equitrans' blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;508&hyph;000 and transferred to Equitrans in Docket No. CP86&hyph;676&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Equitrans proposes to install one delivery tap in the City of Coal Center, Pennsylvania to provide gas transportation service to Equitable Gas Company, a division of Equitable Resources, Inc. (Equitable). Equitrans projects the quantity of gas to be delivered through the delivery tap will be approximately 1 Mcf on a peak day. Equitrans states it will charge Equitable the applicable transportation rate contained in Equitrans' tariff on file with and approved by the Commission. Equitrans further states that the 1 Mcf per day of peak service will not impact Equitrans' peak day and annual deliveries. Equitrans also states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries without detriment to its other customers. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
