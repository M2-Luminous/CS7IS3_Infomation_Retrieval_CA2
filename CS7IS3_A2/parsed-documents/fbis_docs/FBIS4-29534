It is obvious that the United States has begun mapping out a policy of "offensive negotiations" on the basis of the result of "the Carter-Kim Il-song talks." In contrast, our government is taking pains to downgrade the significance of the result of Carter's visit to the North, merely repeating its previous attitude of pushing for both "dialogue and sanctions." When U.S. President Clinton's "willingness to hold high-level North-U.S. talks" was made public on 17 June, the officials who are deeply involved in the government's policy-making process did not hide their displeasure. They said: "We do not know why the United States has made public its `willingness to have talks' so early without officially confirming President Kim Il-song's remarks." The officials expressed their concern by stating: "The United States seems to be attempting to seek a turnaround in its domestic political situation by heightening the dramatic effects of its efforts to solve North Korea's nuclear issue. The United States needs, first, to closely examine if North Korea is possibly using tactics to gain time." Our government continues to be agonizing over that it is neither easy nor reasonable to refute U.S. logic for "resuming talks." It seems that our government's passive attitude originates from President Kim Yong-sam's "remarks consistently calling for sanctions against the North" and "his cynical attitude to Carter's visit to the North." Recently, President Kim determinedly stated: "There is no way to solve North Korea's nuclear issue other than sanctions." He has expressed his strong displeasure several times by stating: "The Kim Il-song regime will likely make bad use of Carter's visit to the North." As the strongly worded remarks by the head of state are still vividly remembered, it is not easy to highly appraise Carter's "go-between efforts" or to apply logic to a change to a dialogue phase. At first, our government had asked that Carter's visit to the North be held in abeyance. Rejecting this, the United States notified our government that "he is visiting the North in a private capacity and is not carrying any official message from the U.S. Government." This notwithstanding, as soon as the result of the Carter-Kim Il-song talks were made public on 16 June, U.S. President Clinton convened an emergency meeting and even issued "a special statement." Of course, before issuing the statement, the U.S. Government tried to save the ROK Government's face by going through the formality of making prior consultations via telephone talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the early morning of 17 June [Korean time]. It is highly likely that the U.S. Government has also conveyed its position to North Korea through former President Carter that UN Security Council debate on sanctions against the North will be discontinued in case talks between North Korea and the United States resume. It would not be realistic to continue both dialogue and UN Security Council debate on sanctions at the same time. Of course, the U.S. Government immediately denied the news reports that former President Carter said that UN Security Council debate on sanctions will be discontinued if conditions are met. The prevailing opinion, however, is that this was aimed at relieving the ROK Government's embarrassment. It has now been learned that the United States is studying in an affirmative manner the question of upgrading the high-level talks as requested by President Kim Il-song through Carter. Therefore, it seems that the dialogue between the North and the United States will proceed at a high pace. If the ROK Government continues to fuss about its delayed involvement in dealing with this issue, it will further be left out in the cold in North-U.S. negotiations.
