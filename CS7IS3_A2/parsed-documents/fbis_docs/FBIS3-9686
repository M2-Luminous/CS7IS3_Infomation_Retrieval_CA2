How does it differ from the previous one that was adopted in Trnava last year, entitled "From Sovereignty to Prosperity"? [Meciar] The difference between the programs is, above all, in the chronology: This year's policy covers the period 1994 to 1998. The program is built so that it allows for creating a basis for a government program, and, moreover, it reassesses the situation in which the Slovak Republic finds itself today. In other words, it is based on many years of experience, seeking pragmatic answers to the problems encountered in all spheres and in all kinds of activities, whether in politics, culture, or elsewhere, which the Slovak Republic must overcome. In other words, our program represents an offer. We are again the first to come up with something like this, and we expect again that the others will create alternatives to our program because we have, indeed, sought what is good and possible. [Samelova] The assembly also altered the statutes of the movement, among other ways by putting the current consultative body, the HZDS Council, and the national leadership on an equal footing. What reasons have led you toward this step? Is this not some kind of duplicity? [Meciar] No, in essence it means building a two-chamber system of the movement's leadership, which has been built like this from the very beginning but, owing to the passivity of the chairmen, has never been fulfilled. The movement's council will unite professional clubs, and it will unite the intellectual sphere that will work with us. It will also unite the deputies and the state administration that will work toward the elections and the local elections that are being prepared. This is of great significance. These people must have influence and space to make decisions. [passage omitted] At the same time, the principle that the leadership, after the Assembly, is the highest political body of the movement must be respected. [Samelova] The Assembly devoted considerable attention to the analysis of why it was that the HZDS was in the opposition again today. Could you tell us something about the results of this discussion? [Meciar] It was a businesslike discussion. We are not looking for a culprit; we are looking for causes, but, above all, we are seeking guarantees in the movement's mechanisms for the future period. We cannot fail to see that 18 deputies from our movement failed from both the human and the political viewpoints. Of them, 10 signed a statement saying that, if they were to leave the movement, they would give up their mandates. They have left the movement but have kept the mandates. We cannot fail to see that the government was overthrown not only by the opposition, but also by the attitude of these people who were in the movement with us and recognized its program. We are seeking ways to guarantee the stability of the parliament both within the movement and outside it. We are seeking to undertake measures inside the movement in the sphere of pledges, discipline, and responsibility toward citizens, and ways to win over the citizens during the elections so that they may find the same security with us that they did in 1992. [Samelova] You mentioned the deputies who left the HZDS. In this connection, self-critical addresses were allegedly heard at the assembly. They came from the districts from which these deputies, who are no longer members of the movement, got to parliament. What was this self-criticism about? [Meciar] The selection of the candidates was based on proposals of district assemblies, the so-called nominating assemblies. Then it was confirmed by the nominating assembly held in Zilina. Afterwards, they went through psychological tests and personal interviews. Despite this, there were human errors. In other words, the criticism was aimed at the districts for not knowing their candidates well. In many cases, those who had left could not cope with their work because they had no dialogue with the movement they had left or with the citizens. [passage omitted] The government is now in the hands of these 18 people. For me, it is always a warning if people put their subjective desire for posts or power above the principles they are to serve. [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, on Thursday [24 March], at the HZDS meeting, the moderator said that the radio and television were closed to the HZDS. Ever since your Cabinet was dismissed, the HZDS has not organized any news conferences. You yourself have refused in the parliament requests by radio and television for interviews. How would you explain this contradiction? [Meciar] To be precise, running along the corridor with somebody sticking a microphone in front of you--that is not an offer. It is normal that giving interviews is also work. It is work for both the editor and the interviewee, and time and conditions must be allocated for it. I see no contradiction here. Indeed, we appear less on both the screens and everywhere else. We can see the changing character of reporting, we can see the contents of the reports, and we are aware that we are not participating in it. Our assessment of these things is that this is one of the areas where we were unable to ensure full democracy. That is why, logically, when conditions prompt a different interpretation of democracy, the media behave differently, too. [Samelova] Two weeks ago, at support meetings for your departing government, some of your followers physically attacked four journalists. How do you view this unpleasant incident, the fact that those involved were your potential voters? [Meciar] Did you see it? [Samelova] I was there. [Meciar] I received the resolution from the people who were there and who were protesting. They talked about Mr. Zitny, who sprayed tear gas in people's eyes without their doing anything bad. There were about 100 signatures of eyewitnesses who described the situation in a completely different way. I am not a judge to play the role of a referee. If I am to follow whomever I trust more, I certainly trust the citizens more than Messrs. Zitny and Hrib. [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, my last question will be worded so as to be both personal and professional. When, in June 1992, you took the post of the prime minister for the second time, you said in your main interviews that you had given a written pledge to your party that, if the Slovak parliament should recall you again from the post of prime minister, you would not return to politics. Everything seems to indicate that you are preparing for the election campaign and that you are preparing for your third return to politics. How did you (?personally) come to terms with this pledge? [Meciar] First, I have not left politics yet. I have only changed position from the government to the opposition. My daughter came to see me in parliament when they recalled me. When they dismissed me, she came to see me and said something that was absolutely correct from the point of view of her understanding the events that concern me. She told me that politics was one hell of a dirty business and that I should leave. But there are other points. First, the movement to which I offered my post invited me back to it. Second, there is a certain hope and trust of the citizens that things may look different, that there is an alternative to the current government coalition. If all of this has some meaning, I will come again in September with an offer. I will ask those who will decide in the elections what I should do.
