This is the first time an 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam leaflet has featured such a statement. The belligerent leaflet announces that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is not intimidated by arrests. On the contrary, the recent spate of arrests will inspire it to escalate its struggle. The leaflet warns Shin Bet officers that their fate will be similar to that of No'am Kohen and Hayim Nahmani. The leaflet goes on to point out, however, that the movement will pursue its war on "terrorists Rabin and Baraq" as long as even a single Israeli soldier remains in the West Bank and Gaza. Until now, the leaflets of the military branch of Hamas have always referred to an all-out war, and not to a war until the end of occupation.
