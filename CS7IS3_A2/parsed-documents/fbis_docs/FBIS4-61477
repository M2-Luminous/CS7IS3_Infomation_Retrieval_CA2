In his words, the missiles which were earlier targeted against the United States and Great Britain, will not be targeted against any site in the world. Sergeyev reported that earlier the command considered the possibility of re-targeting strategic missiles at points in the open sea. "However, we have chosen not to target them at any point," he said. Sergeyev pointed out that non-targeting of Russian missiles is being implemented in accordance with the Declaration on Organization of Daily Activity of Strategic Nuclear Forces with Non-Targeted Missiles signed by Russian and American Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on January 14, 1994 in Moscow. On February 14 Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John Major signed a joined statement on joining this Declaration. Sergeyev expressed conviction that by May 30 American and British strategic missiles would "not be targeted against Russian sites either." "This will raise the threshold of nuclear security in the world," Sergeyev asserts.
