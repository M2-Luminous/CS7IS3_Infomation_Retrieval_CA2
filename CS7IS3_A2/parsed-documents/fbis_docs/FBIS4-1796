INTERNATIONAL In the Russian city of Grodekovo, 20 km from Suifenhe in Heilongjiang Province, about 3,000 Chinese do business in the peak season. Four gangs can be identified among them, namely the "Harbin group," the "Wuchang group," the "Yanji group," and the "Hunchun group," which prey on their compatriots and extort money from them. On 22 September 1993, the head of the criminal investigation section of the provincial public security bureau led 16 criminal investigation detectives to Grodekovo, with the consent of the Russian side. As a result of the joint operation by Chinese and Russian police, 40 persons who had committed crimes outside the border were arrested. (Summary) (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 20 Mar 94 p b4) Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, border trade has developed rapidly, while transnational crime such as drug and gun trafficking have also become more rampant. Since last June, the People's Armed Police Guangxi Border Detachment has mainly cracked down on guns and drugs. In half a year, they have cracked 152 drug and gun cases; seized 1,463 guns of various kinds, including 217 army guns, 7,179 rounds of ammunition, and 418 hand grenades and antitank grenades; seized 69,037 grams of opium and 7,099.4 grams of heroin; crushed 49 gangs specialized in gun and drug trafficking; and arrested 239 criminals involved in gun and drug crimes. Guangxi party Deputy Secretary Ding Tingmo said that Guangxi has a coastline of over 2,000 km, and that the crackdown on transnational crimes along the border will be a long-term task. (Summary) (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 14 Mar 94 p b2) Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi, National People's Congress deputy and commander of the Yunnan Armed Police Corps, in an exclusive interview with a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE staff reporter on 21 March, said that in 1993 armed police and public security authorities in Yunnan cracked over 4,000 drug cases, 27 of which were cases of armed drug trafficking; seized five tonnes of heroin and opium; and arrested over 6,000 criminals, 473 being sentenced to death. He said that the drug problem is still very serious in Yunnan. Trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the following new developments have been observed: -- A rise in major drug trafficking cases. After making some money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits by engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or more. -- A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Last year, Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military firearms, 13 other firearms, and 50 hand grenades. -- Better organized means of trafficking. Drug trafficking using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty. Criminals use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate with one another and transport drugs through such methods as relaying or sending traffickers and drugs separately. -- An increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to come only from the Golden Triangle, but are now infiltrating into China from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns Honghe and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from Laos and Vietnam. -- An increase in drug traffickers from other provinces. Last year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers from other provinces, and the number of provinces and autonomous regions they came from increased from 22 the previous year to 27. Most active were drug traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang. Si Jiuyi explained that as Yunnan borders on Vietnam, Burma, and Laos, the residents in the border areas share customs and languages with those three countries, and the border markers are not very clear, posing enormous difficulty for antinarcotics operations. Drug traffickers have such slogans as "You can execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another problem is that antinarcotics operations are short of funds and manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle. In the end, the criminal got away in a car. Si Jiuyi said that the Yunnan Armed Police have steadily increased the number of cases cracked over the years. Many armed policemen have received awards. Two of China's 10 Young People of the Year were antinarcotics heroes from Yunnan. Over 20 members of the Yunnan Armed Police were killed in antinarcotics battles over the past few years.
