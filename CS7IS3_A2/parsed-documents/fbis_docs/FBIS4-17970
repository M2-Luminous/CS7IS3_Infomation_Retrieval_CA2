That is major progress. The talks will continue," according to Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's special representative in the Near East and member of the government delegation which has been conducting talks in Damascus under the leadership of Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government. The delegation members prefer not to go into the details of the continuing talks, but the idea of writing off part of the Syrian debt was apparently discussed in Damascus. The problem of the debt, which stands at approximately $10 billion, is the most acute one in our relations with Syria. A large part of the debt results from major purchases of Soviet weapons in the seventies and eighties. Skokov's [as published] trip to Syria was supposed not only to revive the frozen relations with a partner in the Near East who was once important to the USSR. The visit was part of the revitalized Russian policy in the region, which Moscow sees as the second most important area after Yugoslavia in which it can demonstrate Russia's new role in world affairs as a great power. Russia is pretty well placed in the region. It has the opportunity to establish qualitatively new links with old friends. It has many former compatriots in Israel. The first test was the request made by the Russian delegation in Damascus to help find Israeli servicemen missing during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Moscow could also be of use in the process of the settlement of the Syrian-Israeli conflict over the Golan Heights. captured by Israel in 1967. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher intends to pass to Damascus a proposal on the stage-by-stage return of the occupied territories over a period of 10 years. Russia's growing importance in Near East affairs was acknowledged in Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Evidently, it was this that prompted him to settle for Moscow's promise not to sell new offensive weapons to Syria, a matter that was broached in connection with the agreement on military-technical cooperation signed by Soskovets in Damascus. Moscow will resume supplies of spare parts and also purely defensive weapon systems. It is to be hoped that this treaty will not lead to a further increase in Syria's debt to Russia, which is facing massive financial problems.
