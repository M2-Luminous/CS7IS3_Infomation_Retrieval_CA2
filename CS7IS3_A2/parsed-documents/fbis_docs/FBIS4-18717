After months of bitter argument, the leaders of the Northern League and the National Alliance met for the first time this morning. Their meeting lasted for an hour and had at its heart the theme of federalism. Furthermore, relations between Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini appear to have thawed. Daniela Calastri interviewed Gianfranco Fini and [Northern League Senator] Francesco Speroni. [Begin recording] [Fini] I certainly wanted a positive dialogue concerning the formation of the new government. As far as federalism is concerned, we will give the constitutionalists time to discuss matters further and to make verifications. [Calastri] Has Bossi agreed to your taking part in the government? [Fini] I believe that this problem has been overcome. [Calastri] Do you agree with the idea put forward by the League of a prime minister who instigates the reform to a federal state and then a takeover by Silvio Berlusconi in the following months? [Fini] We did not speak about this aspect. I believe that it up to the president to decide. I believe that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must appoint Silvio Berlusconi to the post of prime minister. [end recording] [Begin recording] [Speroni] Finally we have managed to convince a political force that appeared to be the heir of an old fashioned style of centralism to sit down at the table and discuss federalism. This is a positive thing. [Calastri] Who will be the head of the government? [Speroni] It will be up to Scalfaro to decide this. I agree with Berlusconi on this point. Scalfaro must decide. [Calastri] So certainly not Berlusconi then? [Speroni] At present we have begun to tackle the issue of federalism. We will speak about the government later. [Calastri] If Scalfaro proposes Berlusconi, then this would be fine by you? [Speroni] There are still obstacles. First of all, we must chose the speakers of the chambers, then Carlo Azeglio Ciampi must resign and then Scalfaro must undertake his round of consultations. Only then will it be possible to see who the prime minister will be. [end recording] [Announcer] Silvio Berlusconi was aware of the meeting between Fini and Bossi. He said that he was very happy about this. The news was revealed a short time ago by Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the National Alliance.
