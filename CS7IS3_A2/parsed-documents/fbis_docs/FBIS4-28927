The paper notes: The IAEA decided not to call in question Japan's concealment of plutonium. This is an unjustifiable act to evade its responsibility for having failed to properly discharge its mission. It is maximizing the DPRK's "nuclear issue" with a groundless "suspicion", while leaving alone the criminal caught red-handed who intentionally and wantonly violated the nuclear non-proliferation system. This is the height of partiality and the double standard. The partiality of the IAEA is found, above all, in its notion of the nuclear danger. Japan's concealment of a large amount of plutonium is directly linked with its nuclear armament. Japan hopes to become a nuclear power with thousands of, tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. For the IAEA not to call in question the concealment of plutonium is to connive at and foster Japan's wild ambition to become a nuclear power. Japan's nuclear armament is a new big threat to peace in Asia and the rest of the world. Compared with it, the fledgling peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK which extracts a tiny amount of plutonium for an experimental purpose do not pose a threat to anyone. It is unreasonable for the agency to maximize the matter of the minimum of amount of reported plutonium of the DPRK. The prejudice and partiality of the agency only impair its authority and dignity. The partiality of the IAEA is manifested also in judging the possibility of divergence of nuclear material. The 70 kg of plutonium of the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan was reportedly discovered at three of the 17 glove boxes of the plant. The world considers that the amount of plutonium exposed in Japan this time where many nuclear facilities have been in operation for scores of years is a very small part of the total amount concealed all over Japan. The IAEA which should solve Japan's diversion of plutonium which stands out with great urgency in actuality is bringing forward the non-existent diversion of nuclear material by the DPRK, making the situation complicated, while covering up the immediate question. The effectiveness of the DPRK-proposed method of preserving the technical possibility for the later measurement of fuel rods has been proved theoretically and experimentally and recognized by world's experts. Nevertheless, the IAEA is deliberately distorting the stark objective reality and blocking a smooth solution of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" under an unjustifiable pretext. This is a very irresponsible act. Facts show that the IAEA Secretariat does not seek non-proliferation of nuclear weapons but has pursued the sinister political aim of stifling the DPRK from the beginning according to a prearranged scenario under the manipulation of specified forces. If the agency continues to pursue a vicious political aim, expanding partiality, the non-nuclear states, the third world countries, will no more trust it.
