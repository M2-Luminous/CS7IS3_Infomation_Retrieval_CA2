Professor Hiroshi [?Kumai], chief of this research group, said: Studies have begun on the situation with Iranian workers in Japan, and it is hoped that the results will help solve the problems faced by foreigners living in Japan, especially Iranians. Last summer the research group circulated a questionnaire in Persian among 245 Iranian workers living in Tokyo and the surrounding cities to permit them to write about their lives and their problems. According to Professor Hiroshi Kumai, 70 percent of the people questioned were between 20 and 30 years of age and each has been living in Japan for an average of 25 years [as published]. Most are working as simple laborers in construction or factories, and 20 percent were unemployed. In this questionnaire the Iranian workers were asked what their motivation was for coming to Japan. One in two answered that he wanted to increase his work abilities. A number also wrote that they had traveled to this country to earn money, find work, and to save some money. Sixty percent of the Iranians questioned said they had faced some kind of discrimination during their stay in Japan. Some of the Iranian workers also believed that technological advances in Japanese society have caused the disappearance of humane issues and that Japanese employers exploit Iranians as cheap laborers. Professor Kumai concludes from the research that: The conditions of Iranian workers in Japan are the worst in comparison with the workers from other countries. He advises Japanese officials that discrimination against Iranians must be stopped and that attention must be given to their demands. Based on statistics the Islamic Republic of Iran has published, there are now close to 20,000 Iranians living in Japan without valid visas, and most of them have been hired illegally in various centers. Since Farvardin 1371 [21 March-20 April 1992], following a wave of young unemployed Iranians going to Japan, regulations voiding visas between the countries have been cancelled. Currently Iranian youths seeking employment make their way to Japan through unconventional and difficult routes. For example, they will go to Vladivostok in Siberia and from there they get to Japan by bribing local officials and boat operators.
