Following the guidelines established at the Guadalajara Summit, it is my turn, as president of the country that will host the Fifth Ibero-American Summit, to speak of these two days of intense work that we have conducted. These have been two days mainly marked by a clear sense and concept of what democracy and freedom are. Absolutely nothing was left to be discussed. All the topics suggested for discussion were discussed in depth in well-presented statements, and this has left us convinced that there is no better way of making progress in development and growth than this type of meeting that allows us to present our proposals based on the experiences we have lived and are living in our countries. Important issues that have been a matter of discussion for a long time on other continents have become crucial issues of these meetings, especially this fourth summit that is about to end. We are conducting a process in the image and likeness of what is happening in the old Europe. Europe has been discussing this issue since the days of the so-called Steel and Coal Community, for the past 40 or 50 years. We began this process of integration and the establishment of free trade zone only 10 years ago, only a decade ago. The results to date have been highly positive. We have centered our discussions, talks, and proposals on the issue of trade. Don Manuel Belgrano, an Argentine, one of our forefathers, a lawyer and great statesman who later became, because of the circumstances in general of the nation, once said that trade was the soul of the peoples. That phrase continues to be true today. This is why we have also centered our attention on trade as a proposal for development and growth of our respective nations. This can be either bilateral or multilateral trade. But this is mainly based on the proposal for integration, on the proposal for free trade zones that little by little are becoming a reality. We have talked about the processes of transformation. We have also said that there is no incompatibility between state and market, especially the social or popular market economy. We have also said that there is no incompatibility between democracy and this new proposal in the fields of commerce and industry; this is true at least for many Latin American countries. However, we have also centered our attention on the fact that these processes of in-depth change have, in some countries, increased the poverty index. This is one of the main concerns we, the men who are leading the destiny of our countries, have. But we have also reached the conclusion that there is no better system of government than this one, the one we have in practically all the Latin American countries; be it democracy based on the presidential system, democracy based on a monarchic system, or parliamentarian democracy. In the end, these are all democracies. A sole and indisputable democracy without any sort of gadgetry in which the people can fulfill their aspirations in total freedom without obstacles or problems. The people can also speak freely and without pressure. This freedom is the main guideline on the path toward that future of greatness that lies ahead for man if he learns that democracy is essential to attain peace and in that world of peace, justice. Peace, justice, and freedom are issues that evidently concern mankind. It is our duty, the duty of the men chosen by the people, to make this a reality. Of course, we also talked about human rights. We have talked about the right to life. We have talked about the mother and the child. We will continue to talk about this until the next summit. If you were to ask me at this moment which of the four summits has been the most positive, I would have to say -- and I am not trying to say that the others were not -- that this one has been the most important because of the issues discussed, because of the freedom with which we expressed ourselves, and because of the organization. This was an important and effective summit. As if this were not enough, during this closing session we listened to the words of the Colombian president who closed, with a golden broach, this meeting that next year we will repeat in Argentina. The actual site for the next summit will be chosen in the next few months. Perhaps we can hold the next summit in one of the most European cities on this earth, Buenos Aires [laughter], or in one of the most beautiful places of this continent, in southern Argentina, in Bariloche. Perhaps even on the beautiful beaches of Mar del Plata. But we will hold the summit in a place where our guests will feel good and comfortable and where they can enjoy the freedom and democracy we, the Argentines enjoy and try to strengthen. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, freedom and democracy are strengthened with greater freedom and greater democracy. Thank you and I will see you in Argentina. [applause]
