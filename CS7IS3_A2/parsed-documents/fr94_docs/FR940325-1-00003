FR940325-1-00003 FR940325-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;220&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model 382 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual to require takeoff operation in accordance with revised performance data. This proposal is prompted by a report of a change that had been incorporated into the propeller governor of these airplanes during production, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the propeller when operating in an engine failure scenario. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the side of the runway. DATES: Comments must be received by May 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;220&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
