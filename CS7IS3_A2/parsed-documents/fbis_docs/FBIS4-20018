They left from Nairobi in Kenya last night, following the evacuation operation of Belgians and other Westerners from Rwanda nearly three weeks ago. Several hundreds of Belgian troops are still stationed at the military camp at the Nairobi airport. The Defense Ministry in Brussels says they will all be repatriated.
