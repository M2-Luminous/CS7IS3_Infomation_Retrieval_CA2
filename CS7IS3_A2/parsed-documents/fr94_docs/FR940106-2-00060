Background Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary to establish limits on allowable costs incurred by a provider of services that may be paid under the Medicare program. These limits are based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services. Under this authority, we have maintained limits on HHA per-visit costs since 1979. The limits may be applied to direct or indirect overall costs or to the costs incurred for specific items or services furnished by the provider. This statutory provision is implemented in the regulations at 42 CFR 413.30. Additional statutory provisions governing the limits are contained at section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Act. Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(i) specifies that for cost reporting periods beginning after July 1, 1987, the cost limits are not to exceed 112 percent of the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per-visit costs for freestanding HHAs. In addition, section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act has required that an adjustment be made to the cost limits for the administrative and general (A&G) costs of hospital-based agencies. The A&G per-visit add-on for hospital-based HHAs has been applied since 1980. We published a notice with comment period that appeared in the July 8, 1993 issue of the Federal Register (58 FR 36748) that set forth a revised schedule of limits on HHA costs for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1993. The limits were computed using actual cost per-visit data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1989 and before May 31, 1991, and were adjusted by the latest estimates in the ``market basket'' index to reflect changes in the price of goods and services furnished by HHAs.
