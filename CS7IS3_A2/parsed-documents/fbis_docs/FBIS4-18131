[Poivre-d'Arvor] This accident is the most deadly in recent years in France, but there were two other incidents recently. Last August, a Rubis-class submarine collided with a tanker, and the Amethyste touched bottom at the beginning of this month. Is this why you have decided to recall the three other nuclear-powered attack submarines currently out at sea? [Leotard] No, this is quite a normal measure designed simply to check that all possible precautions are being taken, as indeed they are every day. The two previous accidents that you mentioned are accidents that were caused by errors in command. The people responsible for these errors were immediately punished. Today we are facing a tragedy that puts the Navy and the nation as a whole in mourning. [passage omitted] I would like to remind everyone that France's naval presence--and in the Mediterranean, in particular--is a national imperative. [passage omitted] [Brunetti] Can you confirm to us that there is no risk of a nuclear leak? [Leotard] There is absolutely no risk on the nuclear front in this accident. There was a tear in a steam pipe, which has nothing to do with the submarine's propulsion mechanism and which has nothing to do, I would remind you, with nuclear weapons--with which this kind of submarine is not equipped. There is no risk. Let us not forget, however, that this has been a terrible accident in which two officers and eight crew members have been killed and which has plunged the Navy into mourning. We will start work on two inquiries--a judicial inquiry, which has already begun--and an inquiry into the command of the vessel. The naval chief of staff has announced this inquiry, and its conclusions will, of course, be public. The French people have to know who is to blame and know the technical reasons for this tragedy.
