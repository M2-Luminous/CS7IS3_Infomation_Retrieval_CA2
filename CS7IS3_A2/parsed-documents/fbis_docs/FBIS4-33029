Yesterday, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Dr. Luis Maria Boettner Ramirez denied, however, that Paraguay and Uruguay have formed a front or drawn up regional strategies. Negotiations to establish a common external tariff have exposed disagreements among the four Mercosur countries. Paraguay and Uruguay want low tariffs to develop their old-fashioned industries while Brazil prefers to keep high tariffs to protect their high technological production. Argentina is pursuing an intermediate and rather reconciliatory stance. Three significant meetings to discuss the common external tariff issue are planned. The economy vice ministers of the four Mercosur countries will meet on 17 June, the Mercosur foreign ministers will meet on 9 July, and the presidents of the signatory countries will meet on 10 July. With this in mind, it was unofficially mentioned that Paraguayan and Uruguayan officials, headed by their respective foreign ministers, have drawn up a bilateral policy to counterbalance the Brazilian stance of keeping their tariffs high. During the most recent meeting on 9 May in Buenos Aires, representatives of Itamar Franco's administration were unyielding on reducing their tariffs. The Uruguayan foreign minister returned to Montevideo yesterday. He denied that his visit to Paraguay was specifically to form a bilateral bloc within Mercosur. He noted that his visit to our country sought to enhance bilateral trade. He added that when Mercosur was discussed, they sought to enhance the integration process, bearing in mind that it will be implemented within seven months (on 1 January 1995). Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner agreed with his Uruguayan counterpart. He said they thoroughly reviewed bilateral economic issues. The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "This is why our talks, which have been extremely useful, lasted two days (24 and 25 May). I believe that on very few occasions have we thoroughly reviewed all bilateral and multilateral issues." The Paraguayan foreign minister noted that when Mercosur was discussed, an effort was made to strengthen it because a political decision has been made by the four governments to implement the integration process. He said: "We have combined strategies, but in no way have any blocs been formed between our countries. We are all together in the Mercosur."
