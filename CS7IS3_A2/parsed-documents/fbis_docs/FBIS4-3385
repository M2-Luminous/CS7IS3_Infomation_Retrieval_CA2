FBIS4-3385 "drchi076_w_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Executive Council Approves Bill on Court of Appeal Executive Council Approves Bill on Court of Appeal HK2004052694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 20 Apr 94 p 1 HK2004052694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Sally Blyth] [Text] The Executive Council [Exco] has approved the legislation needed for setting up of the controversial Court of Final Appeal, paving the way for talks on the issue to reopen with China within the next few weeks. The draft bill is based on the 1991 Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal, which was vehemently opposed by the legal profession and legislative councillors at the time. There are also signs that China will not be entirely happy with the legislation either. However, Exco's endorsement comes amid renewed government warnings that legislators will be left with a stark choice: "now or never" if the court is to be set up before 1997. [as published] The Government has also revealed there are already signs of international uncertainty over the territory's future legal system. Senior officials said a copy of the draft bill, together with an explanatory note, would be submitted to China within the next "two to three weeks", and it is hoped the talks can begin with Beijing as soon as possible after that, under the auspicies of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. Britain always promised China would be consulted over implementation of the 1991 agreement. That accord limits to one the number of overseas judges who can sit on the five member body. However, there are already indications from Beijing that it wishes to put further restrictions on the composition of the court by insisting that the Chief Justice, who will head it, and the three local judges will be Chinese nationals with no right of abode other than Hong Kong. Under the Basic Law, only the Chief Justice has to meet this requirement and there has been no previous mention of the nationality of the three judges. The Government maintains there is no reason for Beijing to oppose the new law since it has followed all previous accords on the issue. There remains the further hurdle of the bill then being passed by the Legislative Council [Legco]. So far there has been no sign that either the legal profession or legislators have eased their opposition to the original Sino-British agreement. Legco has vowed to fight the bill on the grounds that the limit placed on the number of overseas judges who can sit on the body is in breach of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Government sources have reiterated concern that time is running out for the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal. They say there is no hope of renegotiating the deal and unless the court is set up in accordance with what has been agreed, there is a grave danger that Beijing might establish a Court of Final Appeal after 1997 which would be worse than the present arrangements. The administration is also warning there are signs the international community is already wary of the uncertainty over Hong Kong's judicial system and this could get worse in the run-up to 1997.
