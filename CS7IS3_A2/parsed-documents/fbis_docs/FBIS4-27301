Maize is a high-yielding crop which holds a big share together with rice in the nation's grain production. The agricultural working people had made substantial preparations for farming from the beginning of the year. They selected high-yielding strains on the principle of right crop in right area and sowed maize in seedling beds on a stage-by-stage basis and transplanted seedlings in time. Cooperative farmers in North and South Hwanghae Provinces, North and South Pyongan Provinces and other areas are manuring and tending the maize plants with good care.
