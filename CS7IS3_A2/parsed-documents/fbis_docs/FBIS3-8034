The Czech side has received a report that this problem was discussed yesterday between the Austrian ambassador and the president of the bank and some U.S. senators. Vaclav Klaus stressed that the government is following all of the activities of the Austrian side closely; he said he assumes that Austria's negative attitude will not be accepted, and guarantees will be dealt with positively in the congressional debate on 10 March. The government also accepted a report on the situation of the customs union. Vaclav Klaus said: [Begin Klaus recording] The Czech Government is apprehensive about the latest development. It is aware of the complexity of the situation on the Slovak side. Nevertheless, it interprets the debates on certificates, norms, and so on as finer forms of protectionism, and we consider this an unfortunate infringement of the current practice and style of foreign trade relations.
