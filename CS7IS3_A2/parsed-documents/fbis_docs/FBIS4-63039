Is This Right?"] [Text] It seems that cadre rotation is under way again in the upper echelons. And given that this process is managed on virtually equal terms in our country by both the prime minister and the president, it is not always easy to work out from whom the initiative stems and in what connection. We will try nevertheless. The appointment of Nikolay Travkin as minister without portfolio came as a surprise to a great many people and caused, as often happens, quite a lot of gossip. Malicious tongues immediately christened him the "minister for the shah's affairs" [ministr shakhovskikh del]. The initial rumors that Nikolay Ilich would now officially represent Viktor Chernomyrdin on the Presidential Staff have been neither confirmed nor denied. Our source on Staraya Ploshchad merely reported evasively that the new cabinet minister's functions would be defined in the course of the next week (our conversation took place on 10 May, despite the fact that the appointment, according to that same source, occurred back on 29 April!). However, we still do not know today what the esteemed Mr. Travkin will be doing. He himself, during an impressive interview on radio Ekho Moskvy, suggested that in his new job he "will be engaged in the same thing as now -- economic reform in agriculture." Certain observers have thus gotten the impression that the main thing for the initiator was to bring Travkin into the government. And consequently, they suggest, this is just the start of his career. He may shortly have to replace one of today's active participants. Let us not forget that Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is responsible today not just for the reform but also simply for the operation of the agricultural sector, is a very influential figure in the government. He is virtually the only cabinet member capable of saying "no" to Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin. It is only natural that Travkin, even if he had the desire to do likewise, would simply be unable to do so, since if your "no" as well as your "yes" is to carry weight, you need not just to enter the cabinet formally but also to have thousands of informal links with the Agroprom [State Agro-Industrial Committee] commanders and the smart operators of the agri-business. In short, Zaveryukha is backed by the agrarian lobby, while Travkin has no backing. Consequently, while the former may pursue (and is actively pursuing) his own policy, one which does not please everyone, the latter may merely pursue the policy of the person who appointed him. It is not difficult to guess the identity of the "absent party," as it were. You merely have to recall who in terms of Aleksandr Kharlamliyevich's duties is his chief. There are, as you will know, in fact two, and there is every reason to suppose that both might be interested in changing a strong vice premier for a weak one -- Zaveryukha for Travkin. The sowing season is, as you know, drawing to a close now, and Mr. Travkin's administrative functions are still undefined.... Sergey Shakhray announced yesterday that he was resigning as deputy chairman of the Russian Federation government. At a press conference held at the Russian Foreign Ministry press center he read out the letter he had sent to the Russian president and head of government. In the document Shakhray asked to be relieved of his post as deputy chairman of the government "in view of the appointment of a new minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional policy without even formal consideration of the opinion of the vice premier in charge of the problem." Sergey Shakhray stated that his resignation "does not mean that he is going over to the opposition to the president and government or signify any kind of personal umbrage." It has to be said that this is not the first attempt to remove Shakhray from the position where he was in perpetual charge of decisionmaking on his beloved nationalities question. The last time was a year ago, when two vice premiers in charge of these problems -- Shakhray and Polyanichko (known to be a personal friend of the premier) -- appeared in the government at the same time. I do not know how their ill-concealed antagonism would have ended up if the latter's tragic death had not occurred in the Caucasus mountains, to open the account of political assassinations in Russia. Nikolay Yegorov, the new minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional policy and former head of the Krasnodar Administration, unlike his predecessor, was occupied with problems concerning relations among different peoples not "in response to the dictates of his heart" like Shakhray, but purely out of "official necessity," but again, unlike him, he enjoyed a good deal of success here and may be justly proud of the fact that no conflicts occurred on the territory entrusted to him despite all the ethnic diversity and the proximity of at least four trouble spots. Yet another sensational piece of last week's news connected with cadre changes demands attention, namely the meeting between Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, during which the latter demanded that the premier take the election results into account and present ministerial portfolios to the winning party (meaning, of course, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) rather than the losers (clearly meaning the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and Russia's Choice). Zhirinovskiy asked that the posts of minister of the economy, minister of internal affairs, minister for nationalities, and chairman of the State Committee for the Management of State Property be given to his supporters. As always when Vladimir Volfovich is involved, the press, instead of (forgive my cynicism) sensibly saying nothing, broke into a panic, which is merely what he was after. They even recalled how Hitler, having won roughly the same percentage of the vote in the elections, was "in consolation" appointed chancellor and also appointed his own ministers. And soon the "nationally elected president" Hindenburg was safely dumped from major politics. Following a logical train of thought, my colleagues automatically posed the rhetorical question: Once he has his own people in government, won't Mr. Zhirinovskiy want to take the matter of "phased constitutional reform" into his own hands and dismiss, for example, the president? You ask, we answer! Of course he will want to, and how. But if he ever does do something like that, then it will only be thanks to certain inveterate paid hacks who consistently create publicity for him and force us in effect to do the same even as we deny their "scoops." Yes, it is true, Zhirinovskiy was received by Chernomyrdin. Such a privilege is available to the leader of the third-largest Duma faction. But careful readers of the agency reports on this topic would have noted that the premier said nothing in response to his guest's demands. Conclusions should be drawn from that.
