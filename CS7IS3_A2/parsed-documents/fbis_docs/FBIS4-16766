They Urged Saving Reforms From Reformers"] [Text] The F. Ebert Fund and the Social Democratic Party of Russia held on 16 and 17 April a conference with the theme "Prospects and Problems of the Development of Social Democracy in Russia." Not only did the conference not produce the impression of reaching some sort of agreement, but not even a discussion: Everyone spoke about his own thing with the result that they could not arrive at anything at all. Not that they were going to. Aleksandr Yakovlev urged everybody to unite for the sake of an imminent reforming and strengthening of democracy. Gennadiy Burbulis urged "saving reforms from reformers, and democracy from democrats," and stated that tendencies toward disintegration in the country are at an end, and that there are every grounds for stabilization and the creation of a stable party system. Burbulis believed that one should now create a party-political system of centrism rather than a party. Burbulis accounted for the start of stabilization by the fact that the process of structuring society "has brought about several corporate systems that have divided power, resources, and spheres of influence and are now ready to achieve stability." Burbulis recommended that "one's own part be found in the formation of corporate systems since otherwise there are no chances to seriously influence society." Boris Kagarlitskiy (Party of Labor) stated "that boundaries should be drawn rather than a union formed:" "It is hard to speak about uniting even in this room where those who were shooting at each other in October are present." As he put it, "There will be no war, but there will be a devastating struggle for peace" if one attempts to try and unite social democratic forces too intensively. The conference resulted neither in unification, nor war, nor a struggle for peace -- the active politicians and theorists simply pondered a topic of interest to them while most gave little heed to what the others said. As for prospects of social democracy developing in Russia, in the end the conference did not elicit them.
