Most interesting of all are the military aspects of the treaty, which state that the two sides commit themselves to taking measures designed to guarantee each other's security and defense organizational development. The treaty also envisages joint protection of Georgia's foreign borders, which are also the borders of the CIS. The result of the preliminary consultations between Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Shevardnadze was an agreement on establishing three Russian military bases on Georgian territory. The number of troops at these bases will not exceed 20,000 men. Nothing has yet been announced about the purpose or size of the bases or the terms of the lease, but at this preliminary stage, the members of the Russian delegation indicated, we are talking about Air Force and Naval bases. The Russian troops stationed in Georgia will occupy their former positions and guard railroad lines. Russia will provide Georgia with assistance in setting up a national army and equip it with weapons, hardware, and technology without the right to transfer these products to other countries. It is generally supposed that this point of the treaty will displease both Abkhazia and a number of North Caucasian peoples who are supporting the Abkhazian separatists. This military "tethering" of Georgia to Russia, the opposition believes, will increase Shevardnadze's dependence on Moscow's policy even more. The majority faction in the State Duma has expressed its own position on this issue by noting the obviously anti-Abkhazian bent of the military cooperation. There can be no doubt that the treaty will run into difficulty at the ratification stage in the parliaments of both countries. However, Boris Yeltsin intends to resolutely follow up the promises he has made and he stressed that the present treaty is in no sense a military pact against anyone. Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze also discussed the prospects for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. They expressed restrained approval of the UN Security Council's plans to increase the number of international observers in Abkhazia to 88, but they did not hide their disappointment that the UN is delaying its decision to send "blue helmets" to the conflict zone. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Georgian Foreign Minister A. Chikvaidze noted that the situation is deadlocked. The United Nations does not want to give its mandate to the Russian Army until it can see real progress on the political settlement front. But the settlement process has now come up against the problem of refugees who are afraid to return to their homes unless peacekeeping forces appear on the banks of the Inguri. In September last year Pavel Grachev proposed to Eduard Shevardnadze that Russian troops should be sent to Abkhazia, but the Georgian president declined this proposal. Tbilisi now recognizes that this was the wrong course of action. In Tbilisi, despite the security measures taken in connection with Yeltsin's visit, terrorist acts are still taking place. The night before the arrival of the Russian president, Colonel Nikolay Kekelidze, an aide to one of Georgia's deputy defense ministers, was blown up after stepping on a mine in the porch of his home.
