"I have a feeling that it got off to a steady start," Fujii said of the bad-loan liquidation at a regular press conference after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to results for the October-March second half of fiscal 1993 reported Monday by a debt-purchasing body established by financial institutions in January 1993. Cooperative Debt Purchasing Co. said it bought 2.65 trillion yen worth of principal of bad loans, up 2.2 times from the previous fiscal half year. Welcoming the steady move without relying on public funds, Fujii noted financial institutions are expected to have also liquidated such problem loans through other measures in their fiscal book closing last Thursday. He said the government must support their efforts by promoting tax, information and other programs included in the September economic stimulus package to facilitate liquidation of real estate held as collateral for the bad loans. The debt-purchasing firm reported it managed to recover only 27 billion yen, with 24 billion yen collected, of the bad loans it purchased by selling collateral real estate. Concerning recent declines in stock prices, Fujii stressed the importance of steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package to buoy the economy. The finance minister declined to comment as usual on stock movements but said he would "quietly watch." He said cabinet ministers agreed at the morning meeting to place priority on united efforts to start Diet deliberations and enact the fiscal 1994 budget "as soon as possible."
