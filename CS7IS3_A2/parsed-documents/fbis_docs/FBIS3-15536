He said it had seemed that many of the activists there had gathered only to gain political capital for themselves rather than discuss the topical problems facing the farm sector. The prime minister in his address had reassured the farmers of the government's commitment to speeding up the reform in agriculture. But he said the government's efforts had met with little understanding and that many questions posed by him at the meeting had been left without answer. Laar said a wish to limit the congress to complaining and letting one's emotions show had been greatly in evidence among speakers. "Many speakers found that farmers need no World Bank credits, and doubted in the necessity of a free trade treaty with the European Union. But both of these are badly necessary to the farmers," he said. "If during the discussion on the property reform one speaks of the need to introduce direct election of the president and, with respect to protecting the domestic market, the prime minister is scolded for traveling around in the country, the future of the rural sector apparently seems dark," Laar said. "Looking at the luxury cars that had gathered around the Vanemuine theatre (where the congress took place) in Tartu, one could at least state that the representatives of the rural people are not having a bad life," he added.
