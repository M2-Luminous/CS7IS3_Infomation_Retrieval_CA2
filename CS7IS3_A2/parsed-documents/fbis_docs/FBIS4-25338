The call was made today by a Chinese delegate at the 81st International Labor Conference in Geneva. Addressing the conference, Chinese Labor Minister Li Boyong said that in a world moving towards multi-polarity, the ILO should help to resolve the ideological controversies left over by the long-time bipolar confrontation. He called on the ILO to show full consideration for the various social systems and values of its member countries and stop using a single pattern to assess them all. He urged the organization to step up its cooperation with member states and so promote global economic prosperity, defend social justice and protect workers' rights and interests. Li said that with unemployment being the most pressing problem in both the advanced and the developing countries, the ILO should make work promotion as its main priority. According to statistics from the International Labor Office, the number of people registered jobless in the world now exceeds 120 million, and 700 million more are underemployed. Li also called for the ILO to use a more flexible labor standard suitable for a broader application. But he said that the ILO should not use the standard as a condition for technological cooperation with member states, as it would not work if the ILO were to impose standardization on the developing world. The Chinese minister briefed the conference on the labor situation in China, where job promotion, the elimination of poverty and the protection of workers' interests have always been an important part of the government's work. The rate of urban unemployment in China has remained at the low level of under three percent in the 1990s, while the average real salary is up by 4.5 percent, said Li. The Chinese Government has also expanded the range of unemployment insurance and provides social insurance for retired workers, he said. In transition from a planned to a market economy, Li concluded, proceeding from the specific situation and learning from the experiences of the advanced countries could help to avoid social turmoil and economic recession. The International Labor Conference, ILO's most authoritative organ, began its annual session on Tuesday [7 June].
