FR941017-2-00087 FR941017-2-00056 Selection criteria for eligible orders include regular buy and sell market and marketable limit orders only. Orders marked buy minus or sell plus are excluded, as are crosses and all orders with qualifiers ( e.g., market-on-close, stop, stop limit, all or none, etc.). The order entry date must equal the order execution date. For each of the measures, including the Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire (``SPEQ''), a ten-point scale will be applied to a range of scores. Based on the raw score for each measure, the respective specialist will receive an associated score between one and ten points, which will be weighted as indicated for each measure. The first measure is Turnaround Time, which calculates the average number of seconds for all eligible orders, based on the number of seconds between the receipt of a guaranteed market or marketable limit order ( i.e., for 1, 299 shares or less) 4 in BEACON and the execution, partial execution, stopping or cancellation of the order. An order that is moved from the auto-ex screen to the manual screen will accumulate time until executed, partially executed, stopped or canceled. This calculation will not be in effect until the individual stock has opened on the primary market. Certain situations, such as trading halts and periods where the BEACON system is off auto-ex floorwide, will result in blocks of time being excluded from the calculation. A specialist who averaged a raw score of 25 seconds will receive 7 points since it falls in the 21 to 25 second range. This calculation will comprise 15% of the overall evaluation program. 4 Telephone conversation between Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on September 23, 1993.

As in the Turnaround Time calculation, a stop, cancellation, execution or partial execution stops the clock. The same exclusions which apply in the Turnaround Time calculation also apply here. 6 Thus if a specialist receives a total of 100 market and marketable limit orders and holds ten (10) of them for more than 25 seconds, his/her raw score of 10% would receive 9 points since it falls in the 6 to 10 percent range. This calculation will comprise 15% of the overall evaluation program. 5 Unlike Turnaround Time, see supra text accompanying note 4, Holding Orders Without Action is not limited to those orders guaranteed automatic execution through BEACON. 6 According to the BSE, the Holding Orders Without Action calculation will not be in effect until the individual stock has opened on the primary market. In addition, certain situations, such as trading halts and periods where the BEACON system is off auto-ex floorwide, will result in blocks of time being excluded from the Holding Orders Without Action calculation.

Thus if a specialist receives ten market and marketable limit orders where the spread between the best consolidated bid and offer is greater than 1/8th, and such specialist executes five of the orders between the bid and offer, his/her raw score would be 50% and would receive 9 points since it falls in the 46 to 50 percent range. This calculation will comprise 25% of the overall evaluation program.
