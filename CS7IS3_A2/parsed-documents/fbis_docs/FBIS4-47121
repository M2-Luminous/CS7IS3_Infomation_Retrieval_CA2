FBIS4-47121 "jpusr066___94005" FBIS-USR-94-066 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 2 June 1994 COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS Summary Document from April Conference on CIS Banking Issues Summary Document from April Conference on CIS Banking Issues 944E0921C Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 2 Jun 94 p 4 944E0921C Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Text, under the rubric "Banks," of Summary Document of the International Banking Conference: "The Search for an Effective System of Mutual Settlement of Accounts"] [Text] On 23-24 April, a banking conference devoted to the problem of interstate settlement of accounts within the CIS and the entire zone of economic influence of the former USSR was held near Moscow at the Bor vacation hotel. Among the participants of the conference "The Establishment and Development of an Efficient System of Mutual Settlement of Accounts on the Level of Central (National) and Commercial Banks of the States of the Former USSR" were: the Association of Russian Banks, representatives of central and commercial banks of the former USSR, and scientific figures. In view of the importance of the problem, NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] is publishing the conference's summary document, which appeared in May, in unabridged form. After analyzing the situation which has now developed in the sphere of mutual settlement of accounts on the level of the central (national) and commercial banks of the states of the former USSR, the participants in the conference observe the following: 1. The failure, for objective and subjective reasons, to preserve the common monetary system of the states of the former USSR resulted in those states introducing their own national currencies, which commercial banks are supposed to use in international settlement of accounts for the trade-economic transactions of their clients. The absence of convertibility and the "softness" of their currencies and the limited potential to use the national currencies to acquire goods resulted in the fact that settlement of accounts in national currencies entails substantial difficulties and conceals a possibility of material losses. In these conditions, settlement of accounts of Russian commercial structures with partners from the states of the former USSR has been done primarily in rubles, spontaneously forming a zone of use of the Russian ruble, which, compared with other monetary units, is a harder national currency and for many participants in the Eurasian market has the same significance as the dollar does for Russia. In payment relations with non-Russian commercial structures, the participants in trade-economic exchange with other CIS states use typically a freely convertible currency or the Russian ruble as the currency for settling accounts among themselves. The shortage of freely convertible currency and Russian rubles means that trade-economic partners try to prevent stoppages and the breakdown of production in their countries and so resort to bilateral deals based on physical and cost indicators and the simplest forms of barter and clearing on the level of enterprises and banks. Those commercial banks which offer their clients methods of monetary settlement of accounts with partners in Eurasian space in "soft" nonconvertible currencies, methods which are acceptable to those clients and to themselves, play a positive role. Carried out without the support of the central (national) banks under the full responsibility of the commercial banks, these settlements of accounts have not yet been markedly developed. And certain central (national) banks are not systematizing data on commercial banks working with "soft" currencies and so do not always possess the quantitative and qualitative details which permit the impact of these settlements to be assessed correctly. Thus it does not seem possible to determine to what degree the system of interstate settlement of accounts affects the process of restoring disrupted economic ties on the territory of the former USSR. The condition of accounts on nontrade operations, especially those related to monetary transfers of citizens' capital from one state of the former USSR to another, is unsatisfactory. A considerable number of difficulties arise in connection with the migration of the population. The procedure for determining the currency exchange rate needed for nontrade settlement of accounts and the mechanism for linking nontrade turnover with trade turnover and for coordinating norms for citizens to carry cash in and out of the country are unclear. Many commercial banks do not deal in exchanging cash in "soft" currencies. 2. A search is underway in the states of the former USSR for ways to establish an efficient system of mutual settlement of accounts in the economic space of the former USSR. Many participants in the conference drew the conclusion that it is important that all participants in accounts--the central (national) and commercial banks and their numerous clients--conduct this search along the lines of the Blueprint for By-stage Establishment and Development of an Efficient System of Mutual Settlement of Accounts developed by Mezhekonomsberbank [Intereconomic Savings Bank]; this document provides a strategic vision of a new payments system. Most of the participants in the conference believe that in accordance with the political and economic realities which have become established in the states of the former USSR, the new payments system may in principle be formed in two ways: 1) by combining the monetary systems of the interested countries modeled on a new type of ruble zone, and 2) by consistently developing settlement of accounts in the national currencies from simple bilateral to more complex multilateral settlement of accounts through the organization of a payments union. In the opinion of the participants in the conference, neither way contradicts the other. The development of settlement of accounts in national currencies is supposed to promote their mutual convertibility, which provides the basis for an effective payments system. We must develop a procedure for mutual settlement of accounts in "soft" currencies which most fully promotes using them under the set of rules for convertibility, providing equal opportunities for all national currencies to participate in this system of rules. Because of the different conditions which have become established in the CIS states, it is impossible to combine their monetary systems all at one time and include all the states in the unifying process right away. But in places where the necessary prerequisites have matured to a significant degree, in the interests of speeding up the creation of a common economic space it seems necessary to support the states' desire for unification of their monetary systems in a new type of ruble zone. In connection with this, many participants in the conference believe that the signing by the heads of governments of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] of the Treaty on Unifying the Monetary Systems of these states is making an important contribution to the general process of development of the economic integration of the CIS countries and serves as a manifestation of the centripetal tendencies which have objectively emerged on the territory of the former USSR. 3. After exchanging opinions, the participants in the conference expect that stronger cooperation between the central (national) banks of the interested states of the former USSR could help speed up the process of creation of an effective system of mutual settlement of accounts on the Eurasian market. The process of creating currency markets in these states, which is essential for establishing a contemporary system of mutual settlement of accounts, is occurring at different speeds. As a rule the currency markets are distinguished by a low volume of transactions and significant disproportions in supply and demand. The impact of the "black" market is substantial. All this impedes the development of settlement of accounts in "soft" currencies and reduces the economic potential of commercial banks to have a positive effect on the restoration of economic ties. The lack of coordination and reconciliation of the actions of the CIS states and their central (national) banks in the sphere of currency regulation is a serious obstacle. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a general coordinating and methodological organ. Taking this into account, the participants in the conference believe it is important to specially study the question of the wisdom of creating such an organ, for example one like the Standing Commission on Currency-Financial Questions, which operated quite successfully in the former CEMA structure for many years and played a positive role in the establishment and development of payment-accounts relations among its member states. Within the framework of the CIS, the Currency Committee under the Interstate Bank could perform similar functions, and its recommendations could be realized through the council of this bank. Developing a mechanism for a new payments system could be among the first tasks of the Currency Committee. The start of the activity of the Interstate Bank should be stepped up. Delaying its work may discredit its potential in the work of improving interstate settlement of accounts. 4. In the interests of the work, increase interaction of central (national) banks with commercial banks in the sphere of organizing their currency-financial cooperation. As analysis shows, the problems of accounts settlement and payment relations are derived from the main problem: the mutual imbalance of commodity turnover of the former USSR republics, above all with Russia, which causes the participants in the market to have a great need for rubles. Inasmuch as the national currencies of the near abroad are not convertible, they frequently wind up in the accounts of enterprises in commercial banks. Russian entrepreneurs have little interest in settling accounts in the "soft" currencies of their partners, which ultimately deters settling accounts in them and does not promote the development of a mechanism for mutual convertibility of those currencies. A certain solution could be found if commercial banks were included in the activity of the Interstate Bank. As the process of liberalization of foreign-economic ties progresses, settlement of accounts on the level of commercial banks will become predominant. In these conditions it is important that commercial banks cooperate with central (national) banks and the Interstate Bank. Prominent commercial banks are prepared for such partnership in any form. 5. The future of the currency-financial cooperation of the commercial banks of the former USSR states is seen not only in their participation in establishing an effective payments system. Commercial banks must mobilize their influence on the processes of normal movement of goods, services, labor, and capital in the space of the former USSR. The participants see overcoming the isolation and separateness of commercial banks from one another as the way to do this. 6. The participants in the conference also link the prospects of currency cooperation with the possibility and need to establish close contacts with commercial banks of the states which were members of CEMA, in particular concerning the topic of joint development of a mechanism for mutual settlement of accounts in national currencies, as well as the creation of joint banks when there is mutual interest. The readiness of commercial banks of the states of the former USSR to actively interact with banks of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is the result of their desire to help restore the economic ties in this region which were largely destroyed. Scientific-technical cooperation in the area of industrial cooperation has virtually ceased. In trade the main type of transaction is barter, which does not suit entrepreneurs of any form of ownership now. Commercial banks consider currency cooperation with their partners from China and Vietnam promising for them; the many years of experience with those partners has confirmed the profitability of economic cooperation with them. 7. The conference considers speeding up solving the problem of nontrade payments, especially monetary transfers of citizens of different countries, one of the urgent tasks. The participants in the conference are making a request of the Association of Savings Banks, the Savings Bank of Russia, the Savings Bank of the Republic of Belarus, Mezhekonomsberbank, and the specialized credit institution Western Union DP-East, created with the participation of Mezhekonomsberbank, to take the initiative to prepare the government's proposals on a possible mechanism for transferring personal capital and the conditions of its operation. 8. The conference believes that development of all forms of banking cooperation on all levels from the central (national) to commercial banks requires that the information vacuum be eliminated and measures be taken to improve the system of mutual information on the activities of commercial and central (national) banks of the states of the former USSR. 9. Based on the fact that the economies of the states of the former USSR are the transitional economies from a planned economy to a market economy, and that many cadres, including bank cadres, lack the proper experience in managing market relations, the participants in the conference believe it is important to increase scientific support of cooperation and enrich it, above all with basic theoretical research. For this purpose, it is considered wise to prepare a fundamental scholarly work "Money and Banks in the Transitional Economy of the States of the Former USSR (Theory and Economic Pragmatism)." To publish it, interested banks could create a fund to finance research work and assign the Association of Russian Banks to handle it. Along with this, it is considered important to expand applied research in the area of international accounts-payments and currency-credit relations. The conference is asking the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] institute of foreign-economic research, which specializes in problems of international relations within the CIS, to study its potential to regularly service the scientific needs of central (national) and commercial banks, together with other similar scientific institutions of the Commonwealth countries. The above-indicated fund is to be used to finance scientific research. 10. Attaching exceptional importance to the systematic exchange of opinions on pressing problems of the international activity of central (national) and commercial banks, the participants in the conference believe it is wise to conduct meetings regularly (as a rule, once a year), and for this purpose rename the conference the standing congress "Cooperation of Banks of the CIS States" and decide the appropriate organizational questions on a working basis. Questions of the interaction of commercial banks with central (national) banks, complete development of a system of mutual settlement of accounts, conduct of joint analysis of the economic situation and monetary-credit and currency policy, and changes in banking legislation can be topics of discussion in order to develop possible proposals for joint initiatives and projects. [Ordinal number 11 missing in text]. The conference is asking the Association of Russian Banks and Mezhekonomsberbank to remain the headquarters where interested central (national) and commercial banks can send their ideas temporarily, until the organs of the congress are formed. 12. The conference is asking the organizing committee to summarize the proposals and ideas suggested during the conference and to prepare an analytical report and send it to the governments and central (national) banks of the CIS states. Chairman of the conference, S. Yegorov, president of the Association of Russian banks; Cochairman of the conference, V. Kolbayev, president of Mezhekonomsberbank; chairman of the conference organizing committee, V. Khorkin, member of the Mezhekonomsberbank council.
