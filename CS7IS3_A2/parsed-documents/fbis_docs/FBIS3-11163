The Bolivian president is here on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements. He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence documents. "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the country. Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create a giant South American common market. Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera in border areas is also an agenda topic.
