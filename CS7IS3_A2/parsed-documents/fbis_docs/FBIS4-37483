Writer Views Middle Eastern Market From Islamic Standpoint 5. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Preaches Islamic Values 6. Columnist Highlights Situation of Muslims in Africa CHIEF EDITOR ON ISLAMIC AWAKENING IN TURKEY Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn publishes on page 2 a 2,500-word article in which he reviews Turkey's history before and after Kamal Ataturk and just what led to its secularism. The writer then explains how Islamic awakening started slowly after Ataturk's death and concludes: "The Arab and Islamic world is witnessing a common intricate process to retrieve its Islamic identity. The clever rulers -- if they do exist -- must not uselessly burden the nation with conflicts and shocks. While Turkey seeks to include the Islamic movement in its democratic process, the very clever rulers of Egypt still think that they can liquidate the Islamic movement, thus making us suffer from internal attrition for a while longer and making sure that Islamic victory is born only through pain, suffering, and bleeding." CHIEF EDITOR NOTES DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTIES Page 2 also features a 1,000-word article by Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he draws attention to the erosion of the democratic system in Egypt. He notes that at the beginning of "our lame democratic experiment" the regime applied democracy little-by-little because the Egyptian people were not advanced and could not adapt to democracy all at once, the situation has worsened since the president's third term. The regime has moved to "exclude liberties from the democratic system little-by-little." The writer also criticizes the government's mishandling of the case of the millionaire Ishaq Hakim who swindled the banks and individuals of tens of millions of pounds. LAWYERS MODERATION, NATIONAL UNITY UNDERLINED A 1,500-word article by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 3 discusses the lawyers' crisis. The writer says that despite the heated debate that took place during the meeting of the general lawyers syndicate council and the branch syndicates last Wednesday evening, the final resolutions were moderate, aimed at finding a "peaceful solution to the crisis." The resolutions called for sending a letter in the name of the branch syndicates to the president of the republic and forming a delegation of the syndicate council to meet with the prime minister to demand an immediate investigation of the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and the quick release of the detainees. The writer adds that while the lawyers syndicate displayed a measure of flexibility in dealing with the crisis and gave the government a chance to solve the crisis peacefully, the government did not show any flexibility and escalated its measures against the lawyers by continuing to detain the lawyers' leaders, including some members of the syndicate council, and maintaining the media campaign against the syndicate. A 500-word unattributed article on the same page notes that the lawyers' crisis has enhanced national unity among the lawyers. The article says "the recent lawyers' syndicate crisis has highlighted the genuine unity among the lawyers, despite differences in their political and religious affiliations." During the lawyers demonstration, Sayf-al-Islam al-Banna (Muslim Brotherhood) stood next to the Nasirist Samih 'Ashur, the Wafdist 'Abd-al-Halim Mandhur, and the communist Nabil al-Hilali. Three Copts were among the lawyers and citizens arrested by the police. Coptic lawyers also took part in defending their arrested brothers. WRITER VIEWS MIDDLE EASTERN MARKET FROM ISLAMIC STANDPOINT AL-SHA'B publishes an 500-word article by Dr. Husayn Shahatah on page 5 in which he views the proposed Middle Eastern common market from an Islamic economic standpoint. He notes that the purpose of the Islamic economy is to develop the land to achieve a good and dignified life for the people to worship to God. Economy in Islam is linked to moral and religious values. God has prohibited monopoly, fraud, and exploitation. But, the writer continues, the proposed Middle Eastern market will not be like that. It will be a crusader, Zionist market dominated by the Jews. "A study and analysis of everything that has been published about the purpose and objectives of this market reveals that the aim is to control the resources of the Arab Islamic nation and bring it under the hegemony of the Jews (Israel), the United States, and the West." This is economic exploitation. They want to subordinate the Arab Islamic states to non-Muslims to "control their political, educational, social, and economic decisions." MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE PREACHES ISLAMIC VALUES Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur publishes an 1,800 word article on page 5 in which he attempts to promote Islam. He begins by citing passages from a book by Imam al-Banna, founder of the Islamic Brotherhood movement, entitled "The Brothers Under the Banner of the Koran," in which he explains the purity, honesty, and universality of the Islamic faith. Mashhur notes that the prophet began his mission alone. He faced great difficulties. But God's light descended on him and dispelled the darkness of ignorance within a few years, clearing the Arabian Peninsula of idols and infidels. He then explains how the invasion of materialistic cultures left their effect on the Islamic countries, prompting the Muslims to deviate from the essence of their religion. He quotes the following passage from Imam al-Banna's book: "Our duty is to face this wave of materialistic culture until it recedes and our nation becomes free of its afflictions. We must not stop there, but pursue it in its own country until the entire world shouts the name of the prophet, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, and the canopy of Islam spread over the earth." Mashhur adds: "All Muslims have a responsibility before God to spread this true religion and to save humanity from the darkness of materialism, its tyranny and oppression, and to bring humanity to the light of Islam, its justice, security, and peace." Islam, he says, is a complete and comprehensive religion, because it is from God, who is complete. Mashhur then moves on to refute the claim of some "defeated writers that the Islamists want to establish a religious government with divine authority as in the middle ages. He also refutes the claim that the Islamists are "seeking to overthrow the present regime." He says this is a false claim, refuted by reality and facts. "We believe in pluralism and democracy that adheres to the teachings of Islam, which is the official religion of the state. We do not believe in violence or anything of that sort. We do not seek power for ourselves." Those who work for Islam, he concludes, will not relax or weaken as their reward will be with God. COLUMNIST HIGHLIGHTS SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN AFRICA In his 200-word regular column "This is Our Religion" on page 12, Muhammad al-Ghazali brings attention to the situation of the Muslims in Africa. He notes how European colonialism partitioned Africa in such a way as to deprive the Muslims of an independent state. He concludes that the "Muslims south of Egypt and Sudan, and around the Horn of Africa are facing strife and loss. Plans are being implemented to liquidate them and their religion. Zionism and the crusaders are behind this new offensive. An unjust and treacherous threat is facing the Muslims in this area, and those of us in the Nile Valley and the Arabian Peninsula must be aware of what is happening and probe its dimensions. If it does not hit us today, it will not miss us tomorrow."
