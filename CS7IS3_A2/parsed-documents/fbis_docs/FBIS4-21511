It will support this proposal at the second conference of the signatories to the Basel Convention on dangerous waste. Federal Counselor Ruth Dreifuss will head the Swiss delegation to this conference which is to take place from 21-25 March in Geneva, as decided on Monday by the Federal Council. The conference will deal mainly with a proposal from Denmark which aims at banning the export of dangerous waste to Third World countries, be it for storage or incineration purposes. Switzerland considers this a reinforcement of the main objective of the Basel conference on the control of transnational transport and disposal of dangerous waste. It is also ready to join OECD countries which no longer export waste to Third World countries, even for recycling purposes. According to the Federal Department of the Interior, Switzerland has not allowed the export of waste to developing countries since the 1986 regulation on the movement of hazardous waste was implemented. It virtually initiated the Basel Convention which came into force on 5 May 1992. The objectives of this convention proceed along the same lines as the Swiss strategy: If possible, all waste must be disposed in the country where it is produced.
