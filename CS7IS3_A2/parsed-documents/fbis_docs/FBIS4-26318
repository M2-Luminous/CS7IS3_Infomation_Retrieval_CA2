A host of factors, including stronger exports, the depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, lower bank lending rates, and ongoing public-development projects, will push up the overall economic growth in the second half of the year, leading to a growth rate for the year of 5.9 percent, institute researchers said. An even brighter picture is predicted for 1995 if growth in exports and private investment, among other sectors, continues, the researchers said. The institute also said that the private sectors will fare much better economically than the government in coming months. The growth in private consumption is expected to increase 7.4 percent in the second half year, compared with a drop of 0.56 percent for the government. Private investment should jump by 12.65 percent, while public investment financed by the government will grow a mere 1.73 percent during the same period. Meanwhile, service and merchandise exports are expected to increase 7.38 percent while imports should jump 7.34 percent, the institute said. The institute also predicted that Taiwan's consumer and wholesale prices will surge 3.77 percent and 1.93 percent, respectively, in the second half of the year.
