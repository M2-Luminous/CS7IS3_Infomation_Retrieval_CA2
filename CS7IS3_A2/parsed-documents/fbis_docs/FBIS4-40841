His proposal is caused "not by the desire of lawmakers to retain the positions, but by the interests of the state", Shumeyko told reporters and explained that it is necessary to preserve the experience accumulated by the members of the upper chamber. According to the constitution, the Federation Council is to include two representatives from each subject of the Russian Federation: one from the legislative and one from the executive body of state authority. However, the upper chamber of the first convocation was elected for two years in December 1993. Shumeyko's proposal contradicts the constitution, but the speaker believes the problem can be resolved through a nationwide referendum. "This will be cheaper than new elections", he said. Shumeyko added that he had informed the president and the speaker of the lower chamber about his decision. They both "agreed in principle with that", he said.
