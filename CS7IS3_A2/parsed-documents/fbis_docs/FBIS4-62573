FBIS4-62573 "drsov095_a_94029" FBIS-SOV-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PRES Denies Russia Anti-Muslim PRES Denies Russia Anti-Muslim LD1605112694 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1110 GMT 16 May 94 LD1605112694 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- The Duma faction of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) headed by Sergey Shakhray protested against attempts to depict Russia as an anti-Muslim country, which is being done by certain mass media in connection with its stand in the Bosnian crisis, and warned that such an image threatens Russian national interests. "They want to clash us with Muslim states of the CIS, with traditional partners in the Arab world", according to a statement of the PRES distributed on Monday and which also called on the CIS countries to promote military-political consolidation in order to "rule out suspicions of anti-Muslim moods in Russia". "There is an impression that somebody wants to transform the local Bosnian conflict into a global contrapposition of the Muslim and Orthodox civilisations", according to the document. The PRES accused mass media of "deliberately ignoring" the fact that 15 million people in Russia are Muslims and warned that Muslim-Orthodox conflict in Bosnia "threatens to spread to the Russian territory". The faction said that the Russian Foreign Ministry is also to blame for the current situation in Bosnia as it "hastily recognised the unitarian state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported the unilateral sanctions against Yugoslavia and then actually untied the hands of NATO for air strikes on Serbs". Russia should initiate the lifting of UN sanctions against Yugoslavia and at the same time insist on imposing sanctions against Croats and Muslims if they sabotage peaceful talks, according to the document. The PRES supported the proposal of the Russian president to convene a conference on Bosnia with the participation of Russia, the United States, the UN and the EU [European Union], demanded to stop recruiting mercenaries for the warring sides and called on mass media to objectively cover the Bosnian conflict.
