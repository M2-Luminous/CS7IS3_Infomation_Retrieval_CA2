Elbegdorj held a press conference concerning the results of the completed yesterday in the capital of Mongolia political hunger strike. The action which lasted from 13 April to 25 pursued the purpose of resignation of the present premier and his team. About 41 people altogether were taking part in the hunger strike representing a number of democratic public organizations. The main reason for such a immense pressure on the part of the opposition lies in the corruptiveness of the highest echelons of power as is being proclaimed by the democratic forces and disability of the government to cope with its own programme and the social economic problems as well. Answering the direct question by a correspondent about whether it should be considered as a defeat the fact that though the action is ceased whereas the prime minister is preserving his post T. Elbegdorj said that the struggle for the resignation of the government is facing a new stage acquiring new forms. Parallel with this he criticized the president saying that the position of the president and his environment was unclear and equivocal. During the course of the action the public of the country had been provided with the possibilities to have the true notion formed concerning the incumbent government which has not any more moral and ethical rights to guide the country. The government is steeped in the corruption and we sure that we would be supported widely by the public stressed the leader of the MDA in conclusion.
