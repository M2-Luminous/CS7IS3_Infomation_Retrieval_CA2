At the same time, the Central Bank is going to reduce its presence at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, Igor Knyazev, deputy chief of the bank's currency operations administration, said. This scheme is expected to be more efficient because authorized banks will benefit from putting their into circulation, which, in turn, will create a "cash flow."
