Ghawshah told AL-DUSTUR that the APF's decisions will be made unanimously and that any decision that is not approved unanimously will not be implemented. Each faction has the veto right. Ghawshah added that Hamas will present its agenda for the first meeting after the formation of the APF. The agenda discusses the role of national conferences, the way they are formed, and escalating the intifadah and jihad operations inside the territories. Hamas will also present a program of action in the Arab and international arenas by forming a delegation to represent the APF to visit Arab, Islamic, and foreign countries and explain the APF's view of political developments in the region and threats facing Jerusalem and the Palestine question. It is worth mentioning that the 10 factions which oppose the negotiations with Israel and seek to thwart the Palestinian-Israeli agreement last week adopted the name Alliance of Palestinian Forces. Answering a question, Ghawshah said: The APF's membership was confined to representatives of the 10 factions. This means we have no room for independents in the APF. He added: We have previously suggested allocating 20 percent of the seats to independents, but last week the 10 factions in general were for the idea of accord and equal weight in the Palestinian arena.
