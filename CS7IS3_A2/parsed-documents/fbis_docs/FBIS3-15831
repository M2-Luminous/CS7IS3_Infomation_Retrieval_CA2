He added that he hoped the countries will manage to do this. Setting up a common Baltic peacekeeping battalion was one of the topics discussed at a meeting in Stockholm Tuesday [8 March] between Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs and Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. "It seems that the Nordic countries are ready to help the Baltics in the formation of the battalion in every possible way, including training. We from our side try to find out how peacekeeping battalions were created in the Nordic countries and what their structure is," Laar said. The head of Lithuania's defense forces, Gen. Jonas Andriskevicius, said Tuesday that lawyers at his central staff are currently working on the legal basis for the peacekeeping battalion. He said soldiers for the common battalion are to be trained at a base in Alytus, southern Lithuania. The general said a former Soviet paratrooper units base there was offering excellent conditions for training the staff of the new force.
