He was speaking in Kiev on Friday [21 January] while attending the national stock exchange. Kravchuk said that by signing the three-nation nuclear disarmament agreement in Moscow, "we have met the conditions set by the Ukrainian parliament during the ratification of the Start-1 agreement." He said the government embarked on the road of implementing rather than blocking parliamentary resolutions and had to strike compromise and make concessions as it should be.
