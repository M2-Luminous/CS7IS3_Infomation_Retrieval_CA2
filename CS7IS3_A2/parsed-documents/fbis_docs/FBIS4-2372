Hosokawa said at a news conference he decided to step down after new allegations were revealed about financial dealings involving his private office. The new allegations came to his attention Thursday [7 April] night, Hosokawa said, adding that he made up his mind to quit his job after barely eight months to pave the way for resuming the Diet business. Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest on a 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group as political contributions and obtaining profits via dealings by using political contributions. He asserted that he was not aware of any of the alleged deals. Hosokawa said his office allegedly made the profits for several years from 1981. Hosokawa, 56, became prime minister of a seven-party coalition government last August, ending the 38-year-long grip on power by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Hosokawa opened his 30-minute news conference with a brief statement on a list of achievements and unfinished jobs under his administration. The announcement came only two days after a media frenzy over reports on his joking about resigning, which he strongly denied. Prior to the news conference, he suddenly summoned the leaders of the coalition to his official residence and told them he was quitting. At the emergency cabinet session, Hosokawa reiterated that he repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and denied that he was personally involved in a 1986 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. share purchase, which claimed was a deal by his late father-in-law. But he said he should take the responsibility for the current political turbulence triggered by the wranglings between the coalition and the opposition camp over his questionable financial affairs. The LDP has been boycotting the debates on the state budge for fiscal 1994, which began on April 1, at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, it has demanded a Diet testimony of Hosokawa's former secretary, who was in charge of his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from Sagawa. The government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap budget. "However, to my regret, I could not fully address the issues of drastic educational reform and administrative reform for the new era," Hosokawa said at the press conference. During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and pension reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government operations. Hosokawa said it is "extremely regrettable" that the financial affairs involving his office and his late father-in-law have stalled the Diet business. Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor to Hosokawa.
