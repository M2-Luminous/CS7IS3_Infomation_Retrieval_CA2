Regions inhabited by minority nationalities have specific characteristics, therefore, stability in these regions is very important. Many minority nationality deputies said: Since the founding of the PRC, the central government has expended great energy on regions inhabited by minority nationalities; adopted special policies for them; and supported them by apportioning a large amount of funds to enable them to achieve considerable development and progress. In particular, these regions have enjoyed their most prosperous period in history in the past 15 years since China implemented reform and opened its doors to the outside world. As I come from a region inhabited by minority nationalities, I have some experience in this connection. In 1958, Premier Zhou Enlai personally presided over a meeting to solicit opinions from all fields of endeavor; decided on the basic principle of freedom for religious beliefs and of mutual respect and equality between religions of different nationalities; and abolished the feudal system on [words indistinct] of the founder of a religion and Tibet's serfdom, thereby winning the support of all nationalities and religious circles. The party's policies on nationalities and religion were undermined by Leftist influence during the Cultural Revolution. They have been carried out to the letter again since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. However, when I was conducting news coverage in some localities of regions inhabited by minority nationalities, I felt that Rightist deviation had reappeared in some localities in their implementation of the party's policies on nationalities and religion over the past two years. This rendered religious activities out of control and even resulted in religious forces being placed above the law and government administration. Religious activities in some localities have violated the law and become criminal activities, causing serious damage to social stability and to the lives and properties of local people. Some deputies said: Freedom of religious beliefs does not mean there is no rule by law or government administration. In particular, the feudal system of the founder of a religion which was abolished must absolutely not be restored. Regarding criminal activities touched off by religion, they must be punished according to the law. Likewise, there is no exception to the above in advanced Western countries. It seems that it is still necessary for cadres in regions inhabited by minority nationalities to continuously study in earnest how to truly do a good job of implementing the party's policies on nationalities and religion.
