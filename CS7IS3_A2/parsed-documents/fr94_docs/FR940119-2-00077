FR940119-2-00077 FR940119-2-00056 [Release No. 34&hyph;33446; File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;92&hyph;03] Self-Regulatory Organizations; MBS Clearing Corporation; Order Granting Approval of Proposed Rule Change Regarding Revised Securities Reports and Revised Letter of Credit Issuer Standards January 7, 1994. On July 30, 1992, the MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBS'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;92&hyph;03) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on November 27, 1992. 2 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31419 (November 19, 1992), 57 FR 56396. I. Description of the Proposal The proposal amends the MBS Rules at Article IV (Participants Fund), Rule 2 (Daily Market Margin Differential Deposits to Participants Fund), Sections 6 (Forms of Deposits) and 7 (Special Provisions Relating to Deposits of Cash). The proposed rule change also clarifies MBS's existing rules regarding acceptable deposits of debt securities and letters of credit to MBS's Participants Fund (``Fund''). 1. MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 6 Currently, MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 6 require that deposits of debt securities to the Fund be valued at the lesser of their par value or 100% of their current market value. MBS asserts that, in accordance with good financial practices, it should value Treasury securities for purposes of the Fund only on a Current Market Value basis. MBS also states that the proposal will help clarify valuation of securities deposits. Moreover, it is MBS' practice not to accept deposits of Treasury securities that are within six months of their callable period in order to avoid any risk of loss due to a callable bond trading at a premium being called at par. 2. MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 7(b) Currently, MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 7(b), provided that MBS is not required to accept a letter of credit as a deposit if, as a result of such acceptance, more than 25% of all Market Margin Differential Deposits to the Fund (including deposits other than letters of credit) would consist of letters of credit by one bank or trust company. The intent of this existing rule, and MBS's current policy is: (1) To reject such letters of credit if acceptance would result in more than 25% of all Market Margin Differential Deposits 3 to the Fund (including all types of deposits) being in the form of letters of credit from one bank or trust company, and (2) to minimize the risk of concentration in one bank or trust company of a substantial portion of letters of credit deposited as Market Margin Differential. The proposed rule change clarifies the intent of the existing rule and reflects MBS's current policy. 3 The term ``Market Margin Differential Deposit'' means the amount a Participant is required to deposit to MBS's Participants Fund under Article IV, Rule 2 of MBS's Rules.
