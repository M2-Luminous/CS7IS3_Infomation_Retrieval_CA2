In particular, it says: "The Russian Federation is pursuing a consistent course of normalizing its relations with the Latvian Republic and moving them onto a footing of good-neighborliness and equal mutually advantageous cooperation with a steadfast observance of human rights. I believe that the agreements on military matters, which were initialled this March, create a contractual and legal basis for the completion of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Latvia, and for a civilized solution to the issues connected with it. They have become possible as a result of sensible compromises and responsible approaches and meet the true and long-term interests of not merely the peoples of our countries, but of the region and Europe as a whole. In this connection, I especially stress that we were not going and are not going to create military bases on the territory of Latvia. It is a matter only of the temporary functioning of one Russian military establishment under civilian control -- the radar station in the town of Skrunda. I believe that in the very near future my meeting with President G. Ulmanis will take place, during it a package of initialled agreements will be signed, and this will become a turning point in relations between our countries."
