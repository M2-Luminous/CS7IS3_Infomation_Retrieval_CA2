FR940304-1-00079 FR940304-1-00014 Most companies, of course, are not eligible for prime-rate loans. For them, the terms of borrowing are generally less favorable. While DRI/McGraw-Hill does not forecast long-term, non-prime loan rates, some insight can be gained from how such loans rates differ from prime loan rates. Based on a telephone conversation with the Federal Reserve System, DOE learned that most commercial loans were in the 6 percent to 15 percent range. Using the higher rate, 15 percent, and deducting the applicable changes in the consumer price index, the Department calculated real rates of interest ranging from 10.1 percent in 2014 to 11.2 percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 10.46 percent. Alternatively, the Department looked at the divergence of the 15 percent loans from the then current prime rate; such loans were 50 percent greater than the 10 percent prime rate prevailing in 1990. By applying a 50 percent increase to the projected prime interest rates, the Department obtained nominal rates of interest of 12.56 percent to 12.75 percent. After a deduction of the expected changes in the consumer price index, real rates of interest ranged from 7.76 percent to 9.87 percent, averaging 8.05 percent over the 21-year period. Another possible financing mechanism would be for the corporation to finance the purchase of the more efficient equipment by displacing investment capital. In Table 8 of DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecasts, there are annual projections of the after-tax costs of financial capital for each year between 1995 and 2015. After converting the numbers to pre-tax costs, and after deducting the expected changes in the consumer price index, the Department obtained the respective real rates of interest. The costs of financial capital are projected to range from 11.61 percent in 1995 to 12.86 percent in 2015. The consumer price index rates forecasts are the same as before, and the resulting real finance rates range from 7.67 percent in 2000 to 7.96 percent in 2015, with the 21-year average being 7.86 percent. Of the different possible means of companies paying for conservation improvements in lighting equipment, the range of real rates of interest is from 3.55 percent to 11.12 percent. Economic theory suggests that in deriving a commercial discount rate, the Department should consider the opportunity costs of commercial investments that were foregone. Therefore, the Department also investigated real rates of return from commercial investment activities between 1961 and 1990. These data were compiled from Annual Statistical Digests of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The variables that were examined were commercial trade credit, i.e., bankers acceptances; time deposits, i.e. certificates of deposits; U.S. Treasury securities; and commercial paper. During the 30-year period, the average real investment returns realized in the commercial sector ranged from 2.02 percent for bankers' acceptances (which constituted 70 percent of the investment dollars), to 2.29 percent for investments in Treasury securities (which constituted 9 percent of commercial investment dollars). When more risky investments, such as tax-exempt (class B) and corporate (AA) bonds were examined, their real rates were 1.27 percent and 3.52 percent, respectively, over the 1970-to-1986 period. These real rates, too, were substantially outside of the purchase finance range. The real rates for such bonds in earlier years also fell below the purchase financing range of rates. After considering the above, the Department elected to use four percent as the commercial discount rate. The Department believes that this rate approximates the real costs likely to be incurred by private businesses which are able to finance small additional investments in energy efficiency by reducing relatively liquid corporate investments, e.g., bankers' acceptances, or by obtaining loans at or near the prime interest rate, without diminishing their normal business investment. However, if increasing investments in more energy efficient technology are assumed to displace other, more profitable business investments, or would require loans available only at more typical commercial interest rates, the approximate discount rate would be higher. For example, between 1980 and 1991, the real rates of return to nonfinancial corporations averaged between 7 and 8 percent based on data contained in Table 1.16 of the National Income and Product Accounts, as presented in the Department of Commerce's Survey of Current Business and, as noted above, real commercial interest rates often exceeded 7 percent.
