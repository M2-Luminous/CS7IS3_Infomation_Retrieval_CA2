Chinese Forestry Minister Xu Youfang, who arrived in Japan on Monday, and Japan's Environment Agency chief Toshiko Hamayotsu signed an agreement covering a three-year lending period for the rare white birds following talks in the afternoon. The last two Japanese crested ibises remaining in Japan, 27-year-old Kin and about 20-year-old Midori, are considered too old to reproduce -- in human terms they would be over 80 years old. China will send the ibis couple in late September to their new home at the newly built Sado Ibis Preservation Center in Niiho, Niigata Prefecture, which since last autumn has also been the home of Kin and Midori, hoping to see the first chicks hatch next spring at the earliest. Transport during the breeding period from February to June and during the hot summer season could harm the birds, which are said to be very sensitive to changes in their habitat. During their first month in Japan, the birds will be looked after by four Chinese experts including two feeding specialists, who will also train staff at the center in the latest breeding methods. China is the only other country in the world where the Japanese crested ibis survives. Following the hatching of an artificially incubated ibis egg in a Chinese zoo in 1992, a world premier, China succeeded in incubating 12 chicks, bringing the total ibis population to around 50. Ibises usually breed in March or April laying two to four eggs. Under the agreement, China will get the first hatchling, while Japan may retain every second ibis chick being born through the breeding program. It will be the first time China has loaned a pair of ibises to another country. The ibises have not been selected yet, but will most likely be inexperienced in reproduction matters because so far none of China's ibis couples has had offspring naturally. The ibis project took shape when former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his official visit to China in March, asked his Chinese counterpart Li Peng for help in the preservation of the rare bird. Four breeding attempts by Kin or Midori and a Japanese crested ibis from China have failed over the last decade. However, Japanese experts plan to preserve the genes of Kin and Midori after their death in a bid to reproduce the birds through the use of biotechnology in the future.
