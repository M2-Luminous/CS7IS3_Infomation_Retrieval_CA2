According to information from Kharchenko, Andrey Kozyrev, [Russian] minister of foreign affairs, "resorted to conscious distortion of several specific facts" at a recent briefing at the Russian Foreign Ministry. In particular, he maintained that Russia had supposedly virtually received agreement to conduct peacemaking actions on the territory of the former USSR, although really only the necessity of carrying out peacemaking actions in general was stressed at the CSCE session in Rome. It does not correspond to reality that CSCE ministers supposedly unanimously condemned aggressive nationalism, and also that one had supposedly managed to isolate Ukraine from the world because of its stance regarding nuclear disarmament, [no closing quotation marks as received] -- noted Kostyantyn Hryshchenko. According to information from the Ukrainian diplomats, Russia itself in fact ended up in isolation after it was to blame for disrupting the signing of a package of documents in the sphere of defense planning, which suited all of the delegations apart from the Russian one. The Ukrainian diplomatic corps links the latest statements by the Russian foreign minister with the clear line of Russia's government, which was previously concealed and was made out to be the opinion of parliament. A UNIAN correspondent has learned that Borys Tarasyuk, deputy minister of foreign affairs, made observations on 8 December regarding the Kozyrev's position, when Tarasyuk stressed that it is Russian President Boris Yeltsin's idea to divide the Black Sea Fleet.
