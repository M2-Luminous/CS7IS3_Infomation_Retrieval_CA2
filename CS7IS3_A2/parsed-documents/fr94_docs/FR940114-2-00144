SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On January 15, 1992, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(1) of the Act and a registration statement under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective on April 13, 1982, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that date. 2. On June 14, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved, subject to shareholder approval, an Agreement and Plan or Reorganization and Liquidation (the ``Reorganization'') providing for the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and liabilities of applicant to Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (the ``Acquiring Fund'') in exchange for shares of the Gradison-McDonald U.S. Government Reserves Series of Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (``GM&hyph;US Shares'') and the assumption of liabilities. According to a registration statement filed by the Acquiring Fund on July 1, 1993, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, the Board of Trustees of applicant, including the trustees who are not ``interested persons'' of applicant as that term is defined in the Act, concluded that the Reorganization would be in the best interests of the shareholders of applicant, and that the interests of applicant's shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 3. The registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about August 15, 1993. At a special meeting of shareholders held on September 15, 1993, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the Reorganization. 4. On September 24, 1993, 24,964,000 shares of applicant were outstanding at a net asset value of $1.00 per share. At such date, aggregate net assets of applicant were $24,964,000. As of September 24, 1993, GM&hyph;US Shares were distributed to applicant's shareholders. Each shareholder received the proportion of GM&hyph;US Shares received by applicant that the number of applicant shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares. 5. Applicant's investment adviser paid expenses incurred in the reorganization totalling $54,222. 6. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
