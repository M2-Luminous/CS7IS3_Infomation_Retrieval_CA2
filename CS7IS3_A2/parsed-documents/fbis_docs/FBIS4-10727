Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique Borgo Bustamente, presidential and vice presidential candidates, respectively, for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, campaigned over the past weekend in Sonsonate, Santa Ana, San Vicente, and Sensuntepeque. In Sonsonate Calderon Sol said that he wants to win the run-off elections convincingly. He stated that "the people must categorically show their disagreement with leftist ideas." The candidate pointed out that he will continue to develop the national reconstruction strategy and work for the establishment of a state of law to generate trust in and respect for the country's legal system. Calderon Sol praised the "political maturity" of parties that will not be in the run-off elections, but will support ARENA. Meanwhile, Borgo Bustamente said that ARENA did not win the elections in the first round due to "a legal technicality," and not because of lack of voter support.

He held meetings in the Municipalities of Ciudad Delgado, Mejicanos, Apopa, Ilopango, and Soyapango, in San Salvador Department. Zamora added that he has met with leaders of the Christian Democratic Party and Unity Movement, but those parties decided to let their members vote for whomever they wish. The candidate denied that fellow party members voiced support for ARENA publicly, quite the contrary, the coalition has identified "a natural increase in the number of followers coming from parties that oppose ARENA." Zamora and his vice presidential candidate Francisco Lima will make public appearances next weekend in Santa Ana, San Salvador, Santa Tecla, and San Miguel to close their campaign.
