Answering reporters' questions in Ankara, Mentese said that Nevruz celebrations have been held for years and that the state will take the necessary measures to prevent it from being used as a tool for other goals. Asked to comment on the latest resolution passed by the European Parliament in connection with Turkey, Mentese pointed out that there is no discrimination between Turks and Kurds in Turkey. He said that such unfounded allegations are made by circles that want to divide Turkey. Our Kurdish brothers in Turkey are not a minority, he said, adding: It seems that the European Parliament does not know Turkey. They must come and see for themselves how the Kurds benefit from all rights. The interior minister also said that the necessary measures are being taken to ensure that the local elections are held in security.
