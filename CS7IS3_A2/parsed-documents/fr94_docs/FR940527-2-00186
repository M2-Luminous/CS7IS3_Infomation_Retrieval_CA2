SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petition was received on June 29, 1993. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and exporter of this substance. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petition. The complete petition is available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. HTS number: 3812.20.00.00 CAS number: 16883&hyph;83&hyph;3. This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals xylene, toluene, chlorine, methane, propylene, and sodium hydroxide. Texanol benzyl phthalate is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of texanol (2,2,4-trimethyl-1, 3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate) and phthalic anhydride to produce a monoester, the sodium salt of which (produced by reaction with sodium hydroxide) is reacted with benzyl chloride. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 8 H 10 (xylene)+C 7 H 8 (toluene)+C1 2 (chlorine)+4 CH4 (methane)+4 C 3 H 6 (propylene)+NaOH (sodium hydroxide)+4 O 2 (oxygen) __> C 27 H 34 O 6 (texanol benzyl phthalate)+HCl (hydrochloric acid)+5 H 2 (hydrogen)+C 4 H 10 O (isobutyl alcohol)+NaCl (sodium chloride)+2 H 2 O (water) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 80.8 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.79 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.28, a conversion factor for toluene of 0.24, a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.19, a conversion factor for methane of 0.17, a conversion factor for propylene of 0.44, and a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.09. Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing Before a determination is made, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in the Federal Register . Dale D.
