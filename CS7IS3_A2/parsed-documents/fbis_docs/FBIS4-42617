Gonzalez and Kohl have just given a news conference. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports from Schwerin: [Cespedes] Speaking at a news conference a few minutes ago, Felipe Gonzalez and Helmut Kohl expressed their agreement on the European matters which they will take to the EU [European Union] Council meeting, to be chaired by the Greek presidency, to be held in Corfu. It appears that there is agreement on the name of the person to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the Commission, although they did not reveal the name. They want to continue consulting with their EU colleagues. Agreement between the two leaders was also highlighted by the Spanish prime minister, who said he feels closer to the German chancellor on matters relating to Europe than he does to the Spanish Popular Party. He also agrees that what is important is not the timetable for a single European currency, but economic stability and the stability of financial markets. [passage omitted]
