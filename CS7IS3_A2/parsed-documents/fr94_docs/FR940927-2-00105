FR940927-2-00105 FR940927-2-00072 Each vehicle was then driven for approximately 15 miles in stop and go traffic and for a second 15 miles at highway speeds of 55 to 65 mph. The vehicles were then subjected to braking in a large, level parking lot. The asphalt surface of the lot was dry and the ambient temperature was 87 degrees F. Each vehicle was driven along a straight path and brought up to a speed of 50 mph, at which time the brakes were applied as firmly as possibly, bringing the vehicle to a sudden panic-type stop. (Although the test vehicles were not equipped with anti-lock brakes, as was the Ody-Costello vehicle, the deceleration was so severe that the valence panel under the front bumper of the test vehicles contacted the road surface during four of the test stops.) This was repeated three times with each vehicle. After each of the three tests of each vehicle, the area underhood and under the vehicle was inspected for any evidence of fluid spillage. Each time, the paper toweling was removed and replaced with fresh toweling prior to the next test. NHTSA found no evidence of any transmission fluid escaping from any of the dipstick tubes in any of the 12 braking tests nor any of the ``stop and go'' or highway tests. There were no oil spots on the testing surface, nor any evidence of any oil on any of the paper towels used around the dipstick tubes. ODI maintains a library of owner's manuals for all passenger vehicles sold in the United States. Currently, the manuals cover all model years from 1989 through 1994. These manuals were reviewed and no passenger vehicle was located that was fitted with any original equipment device or clamp to retain the transmission dipstick into the dipstick tube. In addition, almost all transmission dipsticks are located near the rear of the engine compartment on the passenger side. In all cases where the vehicles are equipped with either V&hyph;8 or V&hyph;6 engines, this places the opening of the dipstick tube above the exhaust manifold and exhaust pipe for the right bank of cylinders. Although a few vehicles were located with the transmission dipstick tube opening located a few inches higher than the subject Cougars, the height of the opening of the Cougar dipstick tube is typical. There has been one safety recall involving a transmission dipstick (recall # 93V016). This recall involved 1988 through 1990 full-sized Chevrolet trucks. It was determined that when these vehicles were towing heavy trailers in overdrive, pressure could build up in the automatic transmission and transmission fluid would be forced from the transmission dipstick tube. A special dipstick was supplied to owners with a locking seal. There is no evidence to indicate that pressure build up occurs in the subject Cougar vehicles. The construction of the Cougar dipstick and the method used to seal the top of the dipstick tube with the dipstick are also typical of peer vehicles. Dipsticks were examined for several model vehicles manufactured by Chrysler and General Motors, and the dipsticks and seals were all found to be of the same style and very similar in both construction and design. The location and the method by which the dipstick is inserted into the transmission tube are also very similar. The petitioner's primary request (``suggestion'') is that the agency require the manufacturer to install a clamp to hold the dipstick into the dipstick tube in a more positive manner. This suggestion implies that the petitioner recognizes that if the dipstick is seated into the dipstick tube according to the manufacturer's recommendations, no fluid will escape. The petitioner also suggests that NHTSA might want to look into the possibility of raising or relocating the dipstick tube so that if the dipstick is not properly installed into the dipstick tube, transmission fluid will be less likely to escape or come in contact with exhaust system components. Both ODI and the manufacturer have searched their files and the petitioner's reported incident is the only recorded occurrence that has been located. The petitioner states that the problem originally occurred when a dipstick was improperly installed by a mechanic in a Ford dealership, after transmission repairs. The dipstick is not in a unique location, nor does proper insertion of the dipstick appear to be difficult, even for owners that are not mechanically inclined. It appears that the dipstick was inadvertently left loose, or not fully seated after repairs. In order to duplicate the original incident, the petitioner has had to leave the dipstick unseated, so that the opening of the dipstick tube is partially open. The Ford dipstick tube height is typical of peer vehicles. In fact, most vehicles on the road have their transmission dipsticks in similar locations and also seal the top of the transmission dipstick tube with a rubber seal located on the dipstick. In summary, a review of all the pertinent information leads to the following conclusions: 1. The petitioner's allegation appears to be an isolated incident.
