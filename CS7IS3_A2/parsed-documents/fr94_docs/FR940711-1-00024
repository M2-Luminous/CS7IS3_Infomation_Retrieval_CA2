FR940711-1-00024 FR940711-1-00003 IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 61 requires that rulemakings contain either a description and analysis of the effect the proposed rule will have on small entities or a certification that the rule will not have a substantial economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. Because the entities that would be required to comply with the proposed rule are public utilities and transmitting utilities that do not fall within the RFA's definition of small entities, 62 the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' 61 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. 62 5 U.S.C. 601(3) (citing section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632). Section 3 of the Small Business Act defines a ``small-business concern'' as a business which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation. 15 U.S.C. 632(a). V. Environmental Statement Commission regulations require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement for any Commission action that may have a significant effect on the human environment. 63 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment. 64 No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgation of a rule that involves electric rate filings submitted by public utilities under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA. 65 The proposed rule specifies the standards and procedures that public utilities must follow in a rate filing proceeding in order to seek recovery of stranded costs. Accordingly, no environmental consideration of the proposed rule is necessary. 63 Regulations Implementing National Environmental Policy Act, FERC Statutes & Regulations Â¶30,783 (1987), 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987). 64 18 CFR 380.4. 65 18 CFR 380.4(a)(15). VI. Information Collection Statement The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations 66 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. 66 5 CFR 1320.13. The information collection requirements in the proposed regulations are contained in FERC&hyph;516, ``Electric Rate Filings'' (OMB approval No. 1902&hyph;0096). The Commission uses the data collected in this information collection to carry out its responsibilities under Part II of the FPA. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses the data to review electric rate filings. The data enable the Commission to examine and evaluate the utility's costs and rate of return. The Commission is submitting notification of this proposed rule to OMB. Interested persons may obtain information on the reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of the proposed rule can also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. VII. Public Comment Procedures The Commission invites comments on the proposed rule from interested persons. An original and 14 copies of written comments on the proposed rule must be filed with the Commission no later than September 9, 1994. The Commission will also permit interested persons to submit reply comments in response to the initial comments filed in this proceeding. Reply comments should be submitted no later than October 11, 1994. In addition, commenters are requested to submit a copy of their comments on a 31/2 inch diskette in ASCII II format. All comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, and should refer to Docket No. RM94&hyph;7&hyph;000.
