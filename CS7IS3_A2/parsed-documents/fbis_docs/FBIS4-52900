Future North-South dialogue should take the shape of either a Joint Nuclear Control Committee meeting or a high-level inter-Korean meeting to discuss problems related to implementing the joint declaration of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. These are among the items agreed at a high-level unification and security policy meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday morning. It was also agreed to revise the North Korean defectors protection law to help Northerners, including those fleeing from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, resettle in South Korea. Through his Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki, Deputy Premier Yi said the nuclear dispute has become "delicate and subtle" and that the government would continue pursuing a quiet approach to the issue of North Korean loggers, without embarassing "the third country." Attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Director Kim Tok of the Agency for National Security Planning, Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong and Senior Presidential Security Secretary Chong Chong-uk.
