The reform, now on a trial basis, is aimed at changing the traditional obligation of the state to pay fees for university students and assign them to jobs when they graduate. According to the new methods, colleges and universities will work out rational fee collection methods under which new students will have to pay a certain amount of fees calculated according to varying costs for different majors and relative family income. On the other hand, such higher learning institutions will offer scholarships and student loans to encourage industrious study habits and preparation to compete on the labor market. The institutions in turn will announce enrollment plans in advance, with reference to different majors in different provinces and regions, and make clear their fee standards in order for students to choose appropriate college locales and majors. In this way, a college or university only has to set a unified standard for enrolling students to form a fair competition mechanism for all. Traditionally, in addition to enrolling students who do not have to pay fees under the state's overall plan, universities have been allowed to admit students with sub-par entrance exam marks as long as they pay their own expenses. The state will set up specific scholarships to meet demands in majors relating to key state construction projects, national defense, cultural and educational undertakings, basic sciences and eventual assignment to work in remote places. Industrial enterprises and social institutions will also be allowed to establish scholarships. Students can apply for such specific scholarships but will have to be employed according to corresponding contracts signed beforehand. In time, all students who do not apply for scholarships will have to rely on their own effort to find jobs when they graduate. This year, 37 Chinese colleges and universities will begin to carry out such reforms.
