The party said that his family does not know where he is being held. A statement issued by the party said that Sayhat, an Esfahan University professor, is a well-known doctor who "saved the lives of thousands of Iranian soldiers under enemy fire" during the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988). The party urged "all Iranians inside and outside the country to raise their voice against repressive actions...and to demand the immediate release of this courageous son of Iran." It is known that the National Party, led by Daryush Furuhar (64), is one of the oldest secular political parties in Iran. It opposed the former regime and is now opposed to the current Islamic regime. In a recent statement Furuhar urged clerics to "quietly hand over power" to national forces. A prominent female member of the party named Homa Darabi (51), who was a physician and professor at Tehran University, committed suicide on 21 February in protest at the conditions of Iranian women. Hundreds of people took part in her funeral ceremonies at a well-known mosque in Tehran.
