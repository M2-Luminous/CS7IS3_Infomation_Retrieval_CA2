The breakthrough came with Germany and Japan, Iran's biggest trading partners in the industrial world. The two countries agreed in March to provide Iran with some $4.6b [billion] in credits, reportedly about half of its outstanding debts. According to Iran's Central Bank, an Iranian banking delegation signed a $2b deal in Tokyo with a Japanese consortium, preceded by another one with Germany, two weeks earlier, for $2.6b. The agreements with the above two countries were soon followed by two others with Switzerland and Austria in the amount of some one billion dollars. The credits are to be used for payment of delayed Iranian letters of credit held by businessmen in those two countries. A similar agreement covering an $800m [million] credit line was signed with Italy not long ago. And based on announcements by the Central Bank governor, discussions are underway for similar agreements with Spain, France, Belgium and Netherlands. Economic experts both here in Iran and internationally regard the above agreements, and the ones likely to follow, as major success by Iran. If anything, these credits were instrumental in halting the growing value of foreign exchange in the Iranian money markets. The understanding with Germany and Japan also served as a forerunner and it was as a consequence of the agreements with these two trading partners, and their confidence in Iran's economic stamina, that other similar agreements with European partners followed. The willingness by Germany and Japan, as leading industrial countries, to grant credits to Iran means that they are wise and pursue independent policies, and that they understand the delicacy of the Iranian economic situation. Iran's present economic crunch produced as a consequence of low crude oil prices, and the war can happen to any country, as it did to both Japan and Germany following the WWII. The Clinton administration has taken pride in the fact that it does not lack a clear foreign policy towards Iran. Having identified Iran as a significant threat to America's interests in the Persian Gulf region, the administration has tried to deal with those threats by isolating Iran regionally, and by cutting it off from the world economic and trading systems. Based on this containment policy Washington has made efforts to persuade its European allies and those in the industrial world to deny Iran access to international capital. In view of Washington's hostile policy towards Iran, the agreements by Iran with its credit-extending partners can be interpreted in two ways: That the US containment policy towards Iran has failed, or realization of the fact that putting pressure on Iran would not be in the best long term interests of US and Iran's trading partners in the industrial world. Agreements with a host of industrial countries led by Germany and Japan, US closest allies, cannot be interpreted but that the US policy towards Iran has failed. Iran is not a tiny Persian Gulf country the US would be able to isolate readily. It is an important country geopolitically whether they like it or not. And if anything such hostile policies as practiced by the US towards Iran, alluded to last Wednesday by the leader of the Islamic Republic in his meeting with armed forces officials, can only serve make Iran more "radical", if it is any now. [sentence as published] It also means the industrial countries would not hesitate to follow their own interest if serious conflicts with Washington emerge. The US containment policy and its consequent pressure on the Iranian economy, the brunt of which would be felt by the vulnerable masses, can also make the possibility of any eventual reconciliation between the two countries even more difficult and distant.
