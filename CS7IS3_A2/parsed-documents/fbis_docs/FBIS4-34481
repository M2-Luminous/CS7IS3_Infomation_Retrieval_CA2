Trinidadian Christopher Thomas will temporarily replace him and pass it over to Cesar Gaviria, the new official elected to this post, in September, when Gaviria will conclude his term as Colombian president. Baena Soares headed the OAS -- known as the "ministry of U.S. colonies," at one time, due to its acceptance of Washington-sponsored military dictatorships and condoning of U.S. invasions in the region -- for 10 years. A cursory assessment of his work as head of the OAS must inevitably consider the international scope. In the period of 1984 to 1994, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the disintegration of the Socialist bloc, and the death rattles of the Cold War all led to a new international disorder, which dealt pluralism a fatal blow and has kept the United Nations, the highest international forum, mired in a crisis of credibility. Within that context, the virtual vanishing of the East-West division (communism versus capitalism) under the ruins of the Berlin Wall gave Washington the opportunity to revive its ancestral crusade against "Soviet expansionism" in Latin America and allowed the OAS the possibility to get rid of the traditional U.S. hegemony while heading toward a genuine ideological pluralism based on noninterference and self-determination guided by the principles in its charter. We can categorically say Baena Soares did not achieve that goal, but, obviously, that is not his responsibility. The OAS was facing a crisis of its own when Baena Soares came to the OAS 10 years ago. For instance, memories of the 1983 Falkland Islands War were still fresh, and this war unveiled the U.S. double game of proclaiming the defense of the Americas from foreign aggressions and finally buried the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty [TIAR], because the United States sided with Great Britain against Argentina. In addition, the United States also invaded Grenada in 1983. The Contadora Group (Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela) was created in 1983 to seek a negotiated solution to the Central American conflict due to the virtual standstill in the OAS vis-a-vis a crisis in which the United States was directly involved. In addition to the backwardness of pluralistic diplomacy and the powder keg of Central America (the covert CIA war against Sandinism in Nicaragua, the transformation of Honduras into the Pentagon's aircraft carrier on land, and Washington's direct involvement in the Salvadoran civil war), we must mention another key event of that period: the crisis triggered by the Latin American foreign debt, which reached huge proportions. To mark the moment in which Baena Soares assumed his post as OAS secretary general, we must mention the transfer of over $132 billion in capital from Latin America to the industrialized world during the period of 1981 to 1986. Paradoxically, the region, as a net exporter of financial resources, directly promoted the growth of certain industrialized economies. All these circumstances, regulated by a search for genuine solutions, distinctly Latin American, to deep-rooted problems, marked the hegemonic crises of the State Department and the Pentagon in the region. Historically, the OAS and TIAR had been U.S. diplomatic mechanisms in its ideological campaign against the Soviet Union, "the evil empire." Washington made use of these two organizations during the Cold War so that the Latin American countries would legitimize the U.S. hegemonic endeavors. Washington actually established a perverse relation based on a bipolar structure. Inter-Americanism (the old Monroe Doctrine, the basis of the prevailing Pan-Americanism during the latter part of the 19th century) became the best defense of the bulwark of the "free world" (America) against "Soviet communism." That ideological scheme of domination came to an end during the mid-1980's, and certain Latin American countries, including Mexico, began to design new formulas for consensus and dialogue. These formulas were alternatives to Washington's favorite sophism, according to which force is the only mechanism to resolve differences among countries. The Contadora Group expanded in 1986 and became known as the Group of Eight [G-8]. The G-8 started its discussions as the UN Latin American Regional Group (GRULA). It began as a Latin American commonwealth, but was reduced, by war, to a democratic partnership of eight countries and the supporting nations due to the Mexican theory that preached gradual change. The Cartagena Consensus group and new integrationist ideals began to surface at that same time. These groups all seemed to converge, although there were differences, and strategically directed their efforts toward the creation of a community of Latin American nations. The OAS appeared within this framework as a forum for North-South hemispheric dialogue; that is, a forum for dialogue between the United States and Latin America. In addition, Cuba, to what was then outlined with great caution, could be included again in the community of Latin American nations. With the 1959 victory of the revolution, Cuba became a problem of "national security" for the United States. The early definition of the socialist character of the revolution led the White House to label Cuba as a "totalitarian" regime at the service of the USSR and, therefore, a "threat" to the hemisphere. In addition, Cuba was accused of "exporting" the revolution. Under the OAS umbrella, Washington distanced Cuba from the hemispheric scenario. Its expulsion from the OAS in 1962 prompted the joint, except for Mexico, breaking off of diplomatic relations in 1964 in the name of democracy and was based on the "incompatibility" of a Marxist-Leninist government like Fidel Castro's. Thus, Cuba became isolated from the "big Latin American family." Nevertheless, 23 years later (1987) the United States watched with surprise and annoyance the "formal" resurgence of revolutionary Cuba in the subhemisphere when a possible and gradual reinsertion into the OAS was proposed at the G-8 presidents meeting in Acapulco. The initiative was presented with calls for a "detailed revision" of the OAS. Until then, the OAS was seen as a pluralist system, free of any ideological discrimination and with reciprocal respect for the forms of government each member nation had decided upon within its exercise of self-determination. Baena Soares' biggest merit, during this entire process of change, was not to shun direct involvement as an organization. In this manner, the OAS participated in the Second Esquipulas Agreement, and Baena Soares personally, together with his UN colleague, Javier Perez de Cuellar, integrated the International Commission of Verification and Follow-up. Subsequently, he was an honorary witness to the conversations between the Nicaraguan Government and the contras in Sapoa. Likewise, and since the first Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara (1991), Baena Soares has been integrated into this Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese forum. As [Spanish writer] Leopoldo Zea once said, under Baena Soares's administration, the OAS experienced an era of "Latin Americanization." During this last period, one must mention the internal OAS dispute regarding militarization of the organization, as fostered by the Pentagon, in the name of "Hemispheric security," given the fall of the TIAR and the JID [Inter-American Defense Board.] The "new OAS" hailed today is a venue by which Washington aims to legally test the controversial theory of "limited sovereignty," "humanitarian intervention," and "preventive democracy," although Somalia was a guinea pig. Because of this, certain amendments have been made to the bylaws of the organization. Under the sponsorship of Argentina (as official spokesperson of the White House) and with only the opposition of Mexico, a reform to the 1993-approved bylaws in Managua permits the "suspension" of any member nation that strays from the rules considered democratic. This reform leaves a question mark on the future validity of the principles of the peoples' right to sovereignty and self-determination. That will be the package left for Baena Soares' successor, Cesar Gaviria.
