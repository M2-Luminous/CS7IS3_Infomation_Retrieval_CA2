At a meeting with Iran's charge d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari, Foreign Office minister, Douglas Hogg, was said to have made accusations that he was "convinced of contacts between Iranian intelligence and the IRA" in its struggle against UK rule. The charge d'affaires had been asked to have an advance meeting with Hogg ahead of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) group on Bosnia pressing the British Government to end its indifference to Serb aggression. But according to the Foreign Office minister, Ansari was told that he had been "summoned" to convey British concern about the supposed contacts with the IRA, which he maintained should be "immediately and conclusively severed." A spokesman for the Foreign Office said he was unable to comment on where the unspecified allegations came from other than there had been no claims or reports made in the British press. The only advance information came from a BBC correspondent, presumably briefed by the Foreign Office, who alleged that Iran was planning to assist the IRA with funds and weapons. Republican sources in Belfast were equally surprised by the claims, suggesting that it was "black propaganda" used to cover British intelligence involvement in helping to supply South African weapons to loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland. The UK Government has also been under pressure by its failure to press forward the peace process in Belfast and is seen looking for a scapegoat. Other links have been made about Britain's `Rushdie campaign' against Iran "running out-of-steam" and was looking to for a fresh smear to support the U.S. policy to isolate Tehran following this week's visit from Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
