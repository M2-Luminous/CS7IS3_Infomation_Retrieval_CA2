During all three meetings, the main issue was and remains the withdrawal of the Russian Army, its timetable, guarantees, and how not to allow, under any circumstances, this timetahle and these guarantees to be shaken in some way. I think that I received such guarantees in full from all three talks, and I would like to say today that there is no doubt that the troops will be withdrawn from Latvia in several months. The second most important issue we discussed was the Skrunda radar station, what status it should have, how we will control the it, why there have to be guarantees so that after four years, the Skrunda will no longer be in Latvia, and so on and so on. All these issues caused rather lively discussions. So, for example, the United Nations Organization has not yet considered this issue seriously from the angle of guaranteeing the status of the Skrunda radar station. And during the talks with the Russian ambassador, we ascertained that after our talks in Russia, these instructions have, nevertheless, been (?brought) here and I think that within a few days, such guarantees will also be officially drawn up at the United Nations Organization. The next issue was human rights, though this time it was no longer so acute and during the talks we were nowhere near to being reproached. I think that it is to a certain extent the success of both the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Latvian diplomats that, with our stance on concluding the agreement with Russia, we showed both Latvian political maturity and Latvia's wish to listen to foreign states and to enter the world as a serious state with serious intentions, so that we never return to the system of CIS countries, which is being formed at the moment. But when we were speaking about human rights issues, we agreed then that this autumn, Hoze Lasso, high commissioner of the United Nations Organization, would visit the Nordic countries, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, to find out that human rights are no longer violated, nor have they ever been violated in the past. We were talked a lot with UN leaders and with U.S. leaders about the necessity for both U.S. leaders and UN leaders to visit Latvia and find out how Latvia is developing and evolving. And I think that we have reached a certain agreement on these issues. Time will show which people will arrive and what they will give to Latvia. With the U.S. President we not only talked about the agreement, but we also talked about future Latvian economic development. We said that to a certain extent American capital would have to come to Latvia, where the government would guarantee the use of the capital or would guarantee the inviolability of this capital, or something of the kind, so that the capital would be able to come more safely to the Baltic states. And finishing this subject, I raised the issue of Estonia, because Baltic unity is of primary importance in all these issues. And I once again underlined that Latvia supports Estonia in all its requests. One of the issues I raised was the issue of the Paldiski base in Estonia, whose nuclear waste or nuclear energy may to a certain extent influence the future ecological and environmental protection situation in the Baltics. While discussing Baltic security, we touched on three issues: the Skrunda radar station, the Paldiski base, and Kaliningrad -- because there is nowhere else in the world where there is such a level of concentration of armed forces, as in Kaliningrad. I think that we received some support from both the United Nations and the United States, and also from the Security Council. And as a proposal for our future Latvian strategy, we brought up the issue that perhaps in two or three years, it would be necessary to hold in Latvia a summit meeting of all heads of government, at which issues of how to use all the funds left over from the reduction of militarism, from arms reduction, from the withdrawal of troops, and so on would be discussed; so that it will be possible to direct all these funds toward the protection of the environment. And, as we laughed with President Clinton, we would be able to set up a green program on a world scale, which would take the place of militarism, totalitarianism, and armament.
