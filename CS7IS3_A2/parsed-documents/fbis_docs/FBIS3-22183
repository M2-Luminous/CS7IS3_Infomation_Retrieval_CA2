This has been done by dropping clause 4 of the original bill on the recommendation of the department-related parliamentary standing committee on science & technology, environment and forests. The report of the committee was presented to the Rajya Sabha yesterday. The committee also added a new sub-clause, aimed at empowering the national environment tribunal to take up claim cases for compensation suo moto. The committee has observed that though the title of the bill conveys an impression that it is very comprehensive and covers all cases of liability and compensation arising due to environmental damage or pollution, whatever be its cause, its scope is actually restricted to cases concerning the protection of environment and payment of compensation for damage to persons, property and the environment while handling hazardous substances. ``The committee strongly feels that the government may seriously think of enlarging the scope of the bill by including cases of compensation for damages which are caused even by such substances as have not been identified as hazardous by the ministry of environment and forests...,'' the report says.
