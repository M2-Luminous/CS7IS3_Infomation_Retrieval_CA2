In good time before the EU referendum on 28 November, Norway and the EU Commission will have reached agreement on the content and size of all the support arrangements that will be given to Norwegian agriculture in the event of EU membership, Trade Minister Grete Knudsen promised in Brussels yesterday. In concrete terms this means that everything must be on the table before the end of September. "Then we have both October and November to study everything so that people will know what the issues are," the minister said. In the absence through sickness of the agriculture minister, who has had back surgery, Grete Knudsen yesterday met EU Commissioner Rene Steichen chiefly to discuss "the splendid map," as Knudsen put it. The map will show how large areas south of the 62d parallel will be covered by a new support system for so-called northern agriculture. All of Norway north of the 62d parallel is covered by subsidies to northern agriculture that faces difficulties. "There is no great distance between us," the trade minister said after the meeting. She stressed that the Norwegian side is working on the basis of the existing subsidy zones in Norway, because they "are known quantities and something that people here at home are familiar with. The map must be seen as fair," she stressed. According to the minister, there is not very much dividing Norway and the Commission if you measure in percent or in the size of areas. The problem is more to do with which areas. As an example of the Commission's thinking in the past at least, she mentioned two local councils -- Etne and Olen -- in her home province of Hordaland that have always been covered by the same support arrangements. Under the terms of the Commission's proposals suddenly only one of them would qualify for support, and that is something Norway will not have, she said. The trade minister will have another meeting with the Commission in mid-July. At this meeting the Commission will respond to Norway's proposals.
