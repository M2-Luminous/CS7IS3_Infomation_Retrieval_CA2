It targeted not only this church but peace itself not just in Lebanon but in the whole region. Therefore, we vehemently condemn this massacre and implore God to remove hatred and prejudice from people's hearts. The criminals should respect human lives that belong to God and not to them. Those who perpetrated this act have lost a great part of their humanity. We invoke God to instill peace in people's hearts in this homeland and in the region.
