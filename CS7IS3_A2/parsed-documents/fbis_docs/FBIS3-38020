The attorneys of some of them told Interfax that the investigators explained the delay by saying that the State Duma decision to declare amnesty on February 23 had to be first published in newspapers. Only then will they show the text to the accused and ask if they accept the amnesty. Numerous attorneys do not rule out the possibility that some of the detainees who do not feel they are guilty of organizing riots will reject the offer of release. Under the existing legislation those charged with criminal offenses are pardoned by the state but are not rehabilitated for their activities which are regarded as criminal by the investigators. Larisa Dementyeva, the attorney of Aleksandr Barkashov, leader of the Russian National Unity, said that her client would most probably agree to be pardoned. She emphasized Barkashov was in poor health following several surgeries for a wound he had received last December. He is now in the medical ward of Matrosskaya Tishina investigating prison and will most probably be hospitalized Friday. Dmitry Shteinberg, the attorney of former security minister Viktor Barannikov, told Interfax that his client had left the hospital for home. He had undertaken not to leave the city. The doctors insist that he is too sick to be questioned. Meanwhile, the Izvestiya daily reports that Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's press secretary, said outside the Federal Assembly hall Thursday that nobody will leave Lefortovo or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons in the coming weeks, if not months. He described the amnesty as immoral because the detainees had blood on their hands.
