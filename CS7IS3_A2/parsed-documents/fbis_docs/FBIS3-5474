Also, the official said, Clinton wanted to keep the trade dispute with Japan under White House control and settle their differences through discussion, and not confrontation. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy, said that was the message Clinton wanted to give to Tokyo when he called Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa before the White House announced Clinton's decision to reinstate Super 301, a move strongly opposed by Japan. "The President felt extremely strongly that even though we were doing something that the Government of Japan would disagree with, that it was important that he personally called and talked with the prime minister," cutter said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Clinton "wanted the prime minister to understand that there was domestic pressure here, political pressure, that he had carried out the executive order rather than simply allow legislation in Congress to occur," Cutter said. There have been several legislative moves in Congress since the trade talks between Washington and Tokyo collapsed February 11. Trade bills submitted include a tougher version of "Super 301" sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus calling for reinstating the trade legislation on a permanent basis. The "Super 301" measure authorized by Clinton requires the U.S. Government to identify unfair trade practices in 1994 and 1995. Cutter said Clinton had also give instructions to his aides in an executive order that "was more discretionary and allowed more control" by the White House. The President hoped that Hosokawa and senior officials in the Government of Japan would understand and would read the language of executive order carefully, Cutter said. Clinton believes that he has established a strong sense of personal trust with Hosokawa and that in"working together" the two of them "can keep control of events," Cutter said. "What he wanted was to be able to solve these (trade) problems in discussion," Cutter said of Clinton's intentions in calling and talking directly to the Japanese prime minister. Cutter acknowledged that there is "a great deal of distrust" on both sides over trade issues but he did not think there was any distrust between the two leaders. Despite the failure of their meeting on February 11 to agree on a new bilateral trade framework, Cutter said the two leaders "hit it off extremely well" the next morning when Clinton invited Hosokawa and his wife, Kayoko, for breakfast at the White House.
