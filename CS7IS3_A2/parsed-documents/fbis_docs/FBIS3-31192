Hungary has not made any decision on recalling its diplomatic staff from Belgrade, he said. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has been formally informed that some diplomatic missions in Belgrade have started preparations for evacuation. Since Belgrade cannot be left by air, Hungary offers itself as an obvious transit route for the departing diplomats. On request, the Foreign Ministry will render every possible assistance to them, Herman said.
