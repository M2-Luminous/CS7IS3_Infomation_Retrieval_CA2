He reiterated France's appreciation of His Majesty King Husayn's wise and moderate views on many international and regional issues. Speaking at a news conference in Amman today, Juppe said he came to Jordan and the region with two objectives. He said his objectives are represented by reiterating France's commitment to the peace initiative in the region, signed by the Palestinians and the Israelis on 13 September, as well as by expressing appreciation of Jordan's contribution as represented by the signing of the Jordanian-Israeli agenda on 14 September. Furthermore, he added, the visit is designed to stress the ties of friendship and cooperation between the two friendly countries in various fields. Juppe said France is concerned about helping Jordan reschedule its debts during the upcoming Paris Club meeting. He said an agreement had been reached with the Jordanian officials to review all aspects of the agreement signed between the two countries in 1965 in order to expand it and develop it to be more comprehensive and more effective within the framework of the joint committee between the two countries. This, Juppe added, will foster greater cooperation, noting the French desire to increase cooperation within the civil service. The French foreign minister said that during his talks with Jordanian officials, he became aware of the difficulties facing the Jordanian economy as a result of the siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah. He stressed France's readiness to alleviate the burden of the embargo on Jordan without detriment to the objectives of the sanctions.
