It was put forward at the meeting that the work of placing demobilized Army officers should be carried out as a political task and that great efforts should be made to improve such work under the conditions of the market economy. President Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, and State Council Premier Li Peng sent congratulatory messages (the full texts of which will be transmitted separately) to the meeting. State Councillor Li Guixian; Song Defu, head of the Work Group for the Placement of Demobilized Army Officers and minister of the Ministry of Personnel; Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the General Political Department; and others attended and spoke at the meeting. In his work report, Song Defu said: We achieved new progress in the work of placing demobilized Army officers in 1993 because we paid attention to the study of the new situation in this aspect. A total of 58,000 demobilized Army officers and 25,000 dependents of these officers were properly placed in 1993. This is an achievement which has played an active role in reducing the Army, strengthening the building up of the contingent of cadres, and promoting the modernization drive. In this year, nearly 50,000 Army (including armed police) cadres will be placed at work in localities. The State Council and the Central Military Commission urged governments and military leaders at all levels to pay great attention to this work. In light of the overall interest of reform, development, and stability, they should persist in carrying out the placement work as an important political task. They should work hard to implement the current placement policy, which is supposed to be stable and continuous. Meanwhile, the placement work should gradually be integrated with the establishment of a socialist market economy as well as the reform of a personnel system and Army cadre system. As for this year's placement work, we should continue to carry out the policy of placing demobilized Army officers in their home towns or the places where they were originally conscripted. In addition, we can place needed personnel in the state's key construction projects and new industries. We should focus on the placement of demobilized cadres at the division and regimental levels. It is necessary to try every way to solve problems concerning placing these cadres and their families. In his speech, Yu Yongbo said: The congratulatory messages sent by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng not only point out the right way for this year's work of placing demobilized Army officers but also show that the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission pay great attention to Army building and their great concerns about the work of placing demobilized cadres. He mentioned three points for carrying out this year's work: First, it is necessary to conscientiously be subject to and serve the overall interest of this year's work put forward by the party and the state and further enhance the sense of responsibility in carrying out this work. Second, the key to placing demobilized Army officers lies in carrying out relevant policies and regulations. Third, it is necessary to do intensive ideological and political work to encourage demobilized cadres to make contributions in their new jobs. Li Guixian spoke at the meeting on how to carry out this year's work of placing demobilized Army officers. He said: The work of placing demobilized Army officers is an important matter which has a great bearing on the state's reform, development, and stability as well as on Army building. Demobilized Army officers are the precious property of the party and the state because they are an importance force in the socialist modernization drive. He urged party committees and governments at all levels to unify their thinking, take the overall interest into consideration, and conscientiously carry out the principle of serving the cause of military and economic construction. He said that they should give demobilized Army officers a warm welcome, properly arrange a job for them, train them earnestly, and use them reasonably. Also attending the meeting were leaders of Shandong Province and the Jinan Military Region, as well as responsible persons of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, cities with provincial-level decision-making authority, central state organs, the People's Liberation Army, and the armed police.
