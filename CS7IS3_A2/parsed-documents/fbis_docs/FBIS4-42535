Cameroon has found it difficult to launch reforms demanded by international monetary institutions. President Biya has therefore come to ask Francois Mitterrand for economic support. The Cameroon president was optimistic when he left the Elysee Palace. Ghislaine Dupont asked him what lessons his country has drawn from the CFA [African Financial Community] franc devaluation: [Begin Biya recording] It is still too soon to draw conclusions. There are some very negative aspects, such as unemployment and the decline in purchasing power. But at the same time, we note positive aspects, like, for instance, the increase in capital of some companies and the increase in exports. There is the prospect of an increase of agricultural products in rural areas. We also note that the gross national product, which was decreasing, has stabilized. All this, however, is still very fragile. We cannot draw conclusions after just three months. But we need more capital, through bilateral or multilateral agreements, to consolidate the positive aspects. It was this aspect that I raised with the president. I was happy to see that I was heard and I saw him [Mitterrand] giving instructions, so funds can be released as soon as possible. There is hope. I will see other political figures. I will meet the prime minister tomorrow and I will see the finance minister in a short while. The Elysee has led me to believe that something will be done. [end recording]
