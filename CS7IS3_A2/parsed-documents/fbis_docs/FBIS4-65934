Mrs. Limbach has been chairwoman of the Second Panel and vice president since March upon the proposal of the SPD. One day after Herzog's election as the new president, Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group, stated in Berlin yesterday that it is a "tested tradition" that the highest-ranking post of the supreme German court is alternated among the parties. The CDU then has the right to suggest a new constitutional judge to replace Herzog. In Bonn, jurist and former FRG Defense Minister Rupert Scholz was named as a potential candidate.
