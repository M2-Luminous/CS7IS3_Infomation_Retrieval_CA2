The congress, which is to continue until tomorrow, Monday, will study the role of Persian language and literature in the region and its influence on the culture and literature of countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus. [passage omitted] Persian language and literature, which is influenced by Islam, prevails in extensive areas in southern, central, and western Asia and the peoples and nations in the region are familiar with this language and literature. This is at a time when the 70-year presence of communism in countries north of Iran prevented these peoples from becoming better acquainted with Persian culture and language and, as a result, from becoming better acquainted with their own ancient culture. The emergence of the Islamic revolution and the liberation of the nations in Central Asia and the Caucasus from the yoke of communism has made these nations show more interest in learning about Iran and its culture and language. The truth is that the countries of the former Soviet Union are exerting great efforts to acquire their own culture and identity and to return to their historic Islamic roots. Meanwhile, the West is trying to propagate its own culture and to encourage these countries to follow Western culture. Thus, having strong cultural ties with these countries, and especially with Muslim-inhabited areas, can help them become acquainted with the Persian language and culture and with Islamic teachings and also help them realize that, like Iran, they can use Islamic culture to further enrich their society, language, literature, and culture and can do without the West.
