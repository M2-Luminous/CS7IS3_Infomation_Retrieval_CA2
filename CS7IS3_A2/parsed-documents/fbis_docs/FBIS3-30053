Prime Minister Hosokawa has remained tight-lipped after repeatedly denying the reported meeting with Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who is affiliated with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Their reported meeting is spawning speculation that the prime minister has met with Watanabe with the aim of keeping Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura and other ruling coalition parties members who are distancing themselves from him in check and driving a wedge in the LDP, which has yet to shape a vision for retaking power. One ruling party after another are reacting negatively to the reported meeting between the prime minister and Watanabe. Some members of the ruling coalition parties are raising doubts about the motive behind the meeting, but the truth remains a mystery. On the morning of 24 February, Takemura phoned Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, to ask the latter, "Has Watanabe really met with Hosokawa?" On 23 February, Takemura appeared to have information that "Messers Watanabe and Hosokawa are likely to meet." Unable to confirm the reported meeting from the prime minister because of their chilled relationship, Takemura ran around all morning. In the afternoon, Takemura met with the prime minister to discuss the issue of reshuffling the cabinet, but the prime minister told Takemura, "I have not met with Watanabe." Of course, the prime minister is not at ease. His reported meeting with Watanabe has been seen as an attempt to thrust the "Watanabe card," as his new partner, at Takemura who has been boasting of his close ties with the LDP and revealing his resolve to quit the cabinet in a reshuffle. A senior Sakigake [Harbinger] member, who has been struggling to patch up the Hosokawa-Takemura relationship, is reacting against the reported meeting, saying: "If Watanabe joins the Hosokawa cabinet, our party would back out of the coalition. With Watanabe in the Hosokawa cabinet, the cabinet could not take any steps for changes." Political forces exploring the possibility of forging an alliance with Mr.Takemura, social democrats, and liberals, are reacting against the reported meeting with anger, saying, "It is very disgraceful," (according to a senior member of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan). Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan chairman, Keigo Ouchi, Democratic Socialist Party chairman, and Nakamur, Democratic Reform Federation representative, met with the prime minister on the evening of 24 February to urge the latter to be cautious about reshuffling his cabinet. In this way, they checked the prime minister from contacting LDP people like Mr. Watanabe. The reported meeting is sending a complex ripple to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] that make up the coalition government. Mr. Watanabe is said to share the political belief of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, and it is said that they maintain a behind-the-scenes relationship. A politician close to Mr. Ozawa has emphatically denied Mr. Ozawa's role in the reported meeting, saying, "Mr. Ozawa was not aware of the reported meeting." While the "Watanabe card" has the effect of keeping Sakigake in check and putting the LDP, which has lost its centripetal force, into turmoil, it will complicate the structure of the coalition partners, which are now moving toward a bipolar party structure. It can be said that it is not a good policy for the prime minister to play the "Watanabe card" openly now. Amid moves toward a realignment of the political parties, Komeito, which has been vying with Watanabe for support from Shinseito, has accused Watanabe, saying: "The ruling coalition parties have been attacked so much by him. They cannot forge an alliance with him simply because he agrees with their plans for resolving the tax system issue and other issues" and raised questions about the prime minister's real intentions.
