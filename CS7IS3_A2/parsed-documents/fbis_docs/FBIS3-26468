The figure was decided upon in light of the actual capacity of the current domestic market, said Ma Zhongzhi, a senior official with the State Council's Securities Committee, to the press here today. He refused to disclose this year's projected sum for B shares targeted for overseas investors but said that the issuance of B shares will still be limited to Shanghai and Shenzhen. The securities authorities will, as last year, give each province a certain quota of stocks to issue drawn from the total amount. However, the examination and assessment of the applying enterprises will be stricter to ensure the implementation of the state industrial policy as well as the quality of the listed company, according to Ma. Allocation of this year's quota has not been revealed to the localities, but Ma assured that the securities authorities will arrange the flotation in a "proper and measured" manner. China announced the issuing of 5 billion yuan in stocks last year. However, the flotation did not start until August, after the 30 billion yuan in state treasury bonds was sold out. The continuous and fast-paced listings since the latter half of the year quickly drained the capital pool of individual investors and deflated their enthusiasm about stock buying, which resulted in the doldrums of the stocks market over the past several months. Ma said the state's freeze on trading of the institution-held shares will not be removed before relevant regulations and rules are worked out. "We will see that the institution-held shares issued over the past few years do not flood into the market all at once, even after we have the regulations worked out," Ma said. The trading of state shares is more complex, Ma said. Lifting the ban requires time, although it is the goal. At present, when a state enterprise becomes a share-holding firm, the shares it issues should be in three forms, owned by the state, institution and individuals, with the proportion roughly 5:3:2. At present, all the stocks trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen are individual shares. Meanwhile only six or seven institutional shares are being traded in a special market in Beijing on a trial basis. But the state stopped approval of more such shares listed in the market due to a lack of proper laws and rules. Ma said that the state also will strictly ban the issuance of stocks by enterprises to their own employees before the state publishes relevant rules to guide the activity.
