The cable says: The Jihad Movement has devoted its utmost efforts, both in terms of funds and personal sacrifice, for the sake of raising the flag of Allahu Akbar [God Is Great]. You were the warrior who carried that flag to confront the gathering of infidels, who advanced from various parts of the world in order to extinguish the torch of freedom burning on the Land of the Two Rivers and to subjugate Iraq just as they have subjugated other Arab and Muslim rulers, who now rush to the Black House in Washington in order to request mercy and pardon and to receive the infidels' instructions to strike at our peoples and to mortgage their honour and dignity in return for a cheap livelihood and the existence of a feeble, powerless rule. The cable adds: The Mother of Battles was like the Mu'tah Battle in which the Muslims faced the Romans in Greater Syria [Bilad al-Sham] under the command of Zayd Bin-Harithah, Ja'far Bin-Abi-Talib, and 'Abdallah Bin-Rawahah, may God rest their souls in peace. Later, the command was passed to Khalid Bin-al-Walid, may God rest his soul in peace, who maneuvered and then withdrew. The Mother of Battles was also like the battle of the prophet's grandson, al-Husayn, peace be upon him, who faced injustice without surrendering. Al-Husayn preferred to meet his God and enter paradise than live a luxurious life and remain silent toward injustice and the unjust ones. There was no parity in arms and men. There was only dependence on God and whatever means of confrontation were available. There can be no comparison between spiritual and material values. Spiritual values are linked to God, and fate is ordained in God's Holy Book and in the traditions of His prophet. So those who faced the world with its Persian and Roman empires with the spirit of Jihad faced death for the sake of God. They were not afraid of the enemy's superior power. The nation looks up at you while you still stand lofty, telling free men that Palestine is still Arab. You are the only one among the rulers still considering Palestine Arab. The rulers calmed down and were therefore humbled. They removed Palestine from the nation's map and geography. Damn them. The nation still has men who can achieve glories. The United States will vanish and God's order will prevail, whether the infidels like it or not. The cable continues: During the immortal Mother of Battles we smelled the fragrance of history, recalling Muslim victories in Palestine and visualizing the armies of Khalid-Bin-al-Walid crossing the Syrian Desert to al-Yarmuk on the approaches of Palestine. May God grant victory to Iraq. May God make the Holy Koran your guardian. May God make you the rightly guided leader. May the traditions of God's prophet be your torch with which to extinguish the fire of hatred and Mazdaism. Please, your excellency, accept from the Palestinian people's mujahidin their blessings and prayers for your steadfastness in the face of the enemies. Victory will come soon after the removal of the blockade and its unjust tools. God is all-powerful.
