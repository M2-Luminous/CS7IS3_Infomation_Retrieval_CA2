"The euphoria which all of us experienced in a purely political aspect when everyone advocated sovereignty, is weakening," Karimov said, he pointed out that "political sovereignty appeared to rest on economic issues", adding that economic independence turned out to be more important than the political one and that there was a growing desire to communicate with each other in a purely economic aspect. Karimov drew particular attention to the situation in Ukraine, pointing out that there were times when this republic occupied a kind of an isolated position. "I think that was a mistake," Karimov said. "Today, we strongly need economic cooperation which will promote the solution of political problems," the Uzbek president said in conclusion.
