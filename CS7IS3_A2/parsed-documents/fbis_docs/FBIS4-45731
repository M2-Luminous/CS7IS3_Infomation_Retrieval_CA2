Over five days, the representatives of 130 states, including Switzerland, will discuss how to use and transport toxic chemical substances to ensure greater respect for the environment. Among the issues that will be discussed are the increased production and use of chemical substances in Third World countries. These states often do not have the financial resources and technical know-how to use these products in an environmentally-friendly way. Moreover, these countries are increasingly being subjected to toxic waste exports from industrialized countries. The Swiss delegation in the Swedish capital is led by Rudolf Baerfuss, head of international affairs at the Federal Office of the Environment, Forests and Countryside. According to a press release issued by the Interior Ministry, the conference should decide to increase coordination between the institutions already active in the field of dangerous chemical substances. In addition, chapter 19 of agenda 21 adopted at the Rio summit in June 1992 will be put into effect. The decisions made in Stockholm will be implemented by the secretariat of the international program on the safety of dangerous substances. This secretariat has been placed under the authority of the UN program for the environment, the World Health Organization, and the International Labor Organization.
