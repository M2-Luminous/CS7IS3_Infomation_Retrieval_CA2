While about 120 close supporters of the former LTTE deputy leader were also taken into custody along with him, the Tiger leader Prabhakaran is also reported to have withheld the powers of several others including (Tompranga Yogi), (Baby Subranaigam), as well as, Anton Balasingham. Balasingham's Australian-born wife (Adel), however, is said to be unaffected. One-time second in command of the LTTE, Mahattaya was taken into custody by the loyalists of the Tiger leader Prabhakaran following the death of Sadasivam Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, in January last year. The death of Kittu occurred in an explosion on board an arms smuggling vessel intercepted by the Indian Navy. It was blamed on Mahattaya. According to reports from the North, a section of the people, especially of the fishing village of Valvedditturai where both Mahattaya and Prabhakaran were born, believe that Tiger leader Prabhakaran was wrong in sentencing Mahattaya for treason. Many hail Mahattaya as a great leader who held the LTTE together at the time when Prabhakaran was in hiding in India.
