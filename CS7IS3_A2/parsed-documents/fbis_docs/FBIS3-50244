It discussed acute mutual problems with our government representatives. After the talks both prime ministers --- Valentic and Drnovsek -- held a news conference in the presence of foreign ministers Granic and Peterle. Tomaz Gerden reports: [Begin recording] [Gerden] The first talks following a long freeze in relations have not, as it was also expected, brought any significant changes and progress. Despite this, today's meeting was according to Mr. Valentic nevertheless important. The Croatian Government will strive for the best possible, friendly relations. The trade is particularly important as the economies of both countries complement each other and poor relations harm Slovenia as well as Croatia. Prime Minister Valentic also mentioned the problem of the Krsko nuclear power plant. Croatia does not disavow the debt, he said. It hopes to pay one-third of it in the coming days and the rest gradually, and through compensations in kind if this proves suitable to both sides, until 1 August, when property relations are also supposed to be resolved. Croatia considers the Ljubljanska Banka's debt to several hundreds of thousands of Croatian savers particularly pressing. Our neighbors will respect Slovene property in Croatia. Regarding holiday resorts, especially issues concerning land, they will negotiate in commissions. Dr. Drnovsek assessed today's talks as follows: [Drnovsek] The talks were very intense and very concrete. We discussed all open issues between the two countries and singled out the most important ones. We started with the issue of the Krsko nuclear power plant; we discussed economic relations between the countries and efforts to sign an economic agreement that will also regulate the methods of payment in the shortest possible time. Both sides are interested in switching over to free trade in the next phase as quickly as possible, in much the same way that Slovenia has already agreed with some other countries. [Gerden] They did not discuss drawing of borders separately. Minister Peterle particularly stressed that joint ownership over Piran Bay is not acceptable for Slovenia. A mixed commission will discuss borders on 15 February. On 7 February the governments are expected to meet again. The last date for the regulation of trade and legal-property issues is 1 August. The ministries of both sides will prepare their proposals in a month. Today's meeting of both prime ministers, therefore, reanimated the stalled talks between the two countries. [end recording]
