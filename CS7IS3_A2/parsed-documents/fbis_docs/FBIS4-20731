Something that happened at the end of last week will serve as testimony: on Friday, a delegation of Peace Now activists left for a visit to Hebron. Because of the great tension in the city, which was under curfew, the trip was carefully planned. Members of the movement coordinated the date with the PLO leadership in Hebron, and almost all the heads of the Arab community awaited them. According to the organizers, they had been given a permit by the military authorities. But the visit never took place. An IDF (Israel Defense Forces) roadblock stopped the group outside Gush Etzion, and the soldiers announced to its members that according to the orders they had received they could not let them continue on their way. The Peace Now activists had to give up the trip and return to Jerusalem. At the very same time, the settlers and their supporters continued to pass the IDF roadblocks in the territories as usual. Ever since the IDF authorized Baruch Goldstein's funeral procession from Jerusalem to Kiryat Arba, you still see the settlers roaming about Hebron in their way and receiving guests who do not live there. This is a familiar phenomenon. According to the defense philosophy that has become established in the territories, not only "the Arabs are the enemy," as Major General Sha'ul Mopaz said before the commission of inquiry, but also anyone who does not like the settlers--"anyone" meaning especially the activists of Shalom Ahshav. Why does this happen? Why does the IDF think that visits by Israel left to Arabs in the territories are an intentional provocation that must be averted, while practically any kind of demonstration or other protest activity by the right and the settlers is permissible? In contrast to the standing order to block the way of Shalom Ahshav activists (this is not the first time they have done this), innumerable examples can be brought of activities by the right in the territories, which were carried out with no problems. Anyone really aware of what goes on in the West Bank and Gaza knows that there is just one group of Israelis that the Israeli defense network there considers even worse than Shalom Ahshav--the press. The left and the media are suspected of links with the Arab enemy, and IDF commanders do everything possible to keep them away from the West Bank or Gaza. This reality was created by the settlers, who over the years have become integrated into the defense establishment in the territories. Like the soldiers, the settlers, too, carry arms. They maintain contacts with the army, get updates, receive and give briefings, and come and go freely in most of the defense installations in the territories. Many of them spent their army service on bases in the territories, and fulfil support and security functions along with units of the military government. It would not be a great exaggeration to say that because of these circumstances, they have become masters of the field. As they view it, the army is in the West Bank and Gaza, first and foremost, to serve them. In many ways, the settlers have managed to turn the IDF into an apparatus that guards them not only from the Arab enemy, but also from anyone suspected of aiding the Arabs. At the top of the list, of course, are the left and the hostile media. Even the [military] government's civilian authority, meant to serve the needs of the Arabs in the territories, is forced in many instances to accept the dictates of the settlers. Thus it happens that senior and junior officers who do not get along with the settlers (that is, do not give in to their demands) are denounced in the settlements and on the right as leftists and are unable to go on serving in the West Bank and Gaza. Maj. Gen. 'Amram Matzne'a, who dared one time to condemn the actions of some settlers who made a retaliatory raid on the Dehaisha camp and shot at Arab houses, barely managed to hold onto his job after the leaders of the settlements demanded his dismissal. Who knows, perhaps this episode put Gen. Matzne'a out of the running later on for the position of chief of staff. In contrast, no IDF commander's career has ever been harmed because of things he said or did against the left in the territories, or against the Arabs (unless he exaggerated, the way Res. Gen. Yehuda Meir did during the episode where the Arab youths arrested at Hav'ara were hit and had their bones broken at the beginning of the intifadah). Everyone in the Israeli defense establishment learned the main rule very quickly--not to tangle with the settlers, or with the political lobby on the right that supports them. The labor government, and Meretz, and the peace process have not changed this reality at all.
