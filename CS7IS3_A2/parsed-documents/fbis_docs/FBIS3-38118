As he waited for his flight to New York at Dublin airport he said he thought the United States could play an influential role in resolving the Ulster conflict. "They can encourage the British, without taking sides, and move the situation on," he said. Asked whether he had renounced violence, one of the stipulations for a visa reportedly laid down, Mr Adams replied: "My attitude is quite simple and straight forward -- I want an end to violence." He planned to make a number of speeches while in the United States and his message would be that there is an opportunity for peace. "We are now in a very critical phase in the process towards that. We are not going to squander the opportunity for peace. President Clinton's administration can play a very helpful and encouraging role now." Asked about the still-awaited response of Sinn Fein and the IRA to last month's Downing Street peace declaration, Mr Adams replied: "You can have a response as quickly as the British Government explains where they see the declaration fitting in the overall peace process. While they refuse to clarify the situation they build a road-block to forward movement."
