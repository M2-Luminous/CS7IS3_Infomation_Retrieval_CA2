According to Urinson, military orders have declined by 70 percent and this explains the 25 percent decline in production in the past six months. At the same time the minister noted the tendency toward lower inflation, from 10 percent in February to an estimated 7 percent in June. In the same period the number of people living below the poverty line decreased by 10 million and the population's income in real terms increased by 12 percent. The number of registered unemployed increased by 900,000 to the present total of 1.2 million. The actual number of unemployed is around 4 million or 6 percent of the working population. One of the government's priorities will be to channel the funds saved by closing down unprofitable enterprises into areas of potential growth, so as to meet its commitments stated in the national accord treaty, The second priority is "social support for those in need."
