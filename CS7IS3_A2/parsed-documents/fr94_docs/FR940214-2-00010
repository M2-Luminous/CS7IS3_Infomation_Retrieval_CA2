FR940214-2-00010 FR940214-2-00004 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [ID. # 013194C] Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Public Hearings AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Public hearings on Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for Pacific Coast Groundfish. SUMMARY: The Pacific Fishery Management Council is holding hearings on a proposed Amendment 8 to its Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery management plan (FMP). The amendment would establish an individual quota (IQ) program to cover the harvest of sablefish by vessels with groundfish limited entry permits for longline and fishpot (trap) gear. Harvest of sablefish by: (1) Trawl gear in the limited entry fishery, or (2) longline, fishpot (trap) and exempted gear by unlicensed vessels in the open access fishery, would not be covered by the proposed IQ program. DATES: Written comments on the IQ proposal must be received by March 28, 1994. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for dates and times of hearings. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Lawrence D. Six, Executive Director, Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2000 SW First Avenue, suite 420, Portland, OR; telephone: (503) 326&hyph;6352. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for locations of hearings. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lawrence D. Six, Executive Director, Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2000 SW First Avenue, suite 420, Portland, OR; telephone: (503) 326&hyph;6352. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The fixed gear sablefish IQ program designed by the Council would allocate sablefish QS (quota share_a percentage of the total annual harvest guideline) to persons based primarily on catch history. Each year, holders of QS would be allocated an amount of sablefish IFQ (individual fishing quota_an amount of sablefish pounds for the year based on the amount of QS held) that could be taken anytime during the fishing season. A recent participation requirement would require at least one landing of sablefish or groundfish (to be determined) with longline or fishpot gear between August 1, 1988, and November 13, 1991, in order for a person to qualify for an initial allocation of QS. There may also be a minimum amount of sablefish landings which must be made between January 1, 1984, and November 13, 1991. QS would be allocated to owners of ``A'' permits for longline or fishpot (trap) gear based at least in part on one of the following catch histories: (1) The catch history of the permit owned at the time QS is issued, (2) the catch history of the person as a vessel owner, or (3) some combination of the two. Confidentiality issues may affect the choice among these options and the ability of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to implement this program. Catch history occurring between January 1, 1984, and November 13, 1991, would be counted in determining the amount of QS issued. Under allocation formulas being considered, between 75 and 100 percent of the quota shares would be allocated on the basis of the best five of eight years of catch history. Up to 25 percent might be allocated primarily on the basis of an equal allocation concept. The Council is considering a number of optional provisions for the program including: (1) Caps on the amount of QS/IFQ that may be issued to or accumulated by, a single person and the amount that may be used with a single vessel, and (2) requirements that the QS/IFQ owner be on board the vessel when the IFQ is used. The latter of these provisions implies that leasing would not be allowed. The provision may be combined with restrictions on the acquisition of QS/IFQ by corporations, partnerships and other non-individual entities that do not receive an initial allocation. All hearings will start at 7 p.m. The following are the dates and locations: February 28, 1994 Phoenix B and C Rooms, Radisson Hotel Seattle Airport, 17001 Pacific Highway, South, Seattle, WA 98188 Peninsula Room, Clarion Hotel, 401 East Millbrae Avenue, Millbrae, CA 94030 March 1, 1994 PreMarq Centre, 2065 Highway 101, Warrenton, OR 97146 Travelodge Hotel Resort and Marina, 700 Queens Way Drive, Long Beach, CA 90802 March 2, 1994 Evergreen Room, Red Lion Inn, 1929 Fourth Street, Eureka, CA 95501 March 3, 1994 Captain John's, 8061 King Fisher Drive, Charleston, OR 97420 This hearing is physically accessible to people with disabilities.
