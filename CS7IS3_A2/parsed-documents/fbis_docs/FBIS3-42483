The Transbaykal Military District Press Center organized a meeting between the Air Force unit's flight staff and representatives of the press, radio, and television. Some 30 combat aircraft have been added to the arsenal of the Transbaykal District. The MiG-29 fighters, to which the Russian Air Force is switching, represent fundamentally new combat hardware, currently rated as the best in world military aircraft construction. It appears that we are still capable of producing something to amaze the planet. And while military analysts are trying to define the potential enemy and to determine the army's need for specific types of weapons, the Transbaykal pilots are carrying out their normal duties and rehearsing air combat techniques for repelling massive attacks by enemy aircraft. Incidentally, REUTER recently confirmed the excellent reputation of this aircraft. It reported that Slovakia received a shipment of MiG-29's from Moscow in repayment of a Russian debt.
