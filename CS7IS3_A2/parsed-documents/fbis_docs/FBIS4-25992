Privately, senior officials have voiced doubts over Beijing's surprise announcement this week that the rows over funding for the new Chek Lap Kok airport and the fate of 38 military sites in Hong Kong could be resolved rapidly. Senior government sources said: "Don't put too much store by China's recent statements. We have to wait and see." They said they did not expect those issues -- under negotiation for some years to be resolved so quickly. China and Britain have yet to reach agreement over the future of the military sites, although there has been "good progress" during the 16th round of expert talks. The Sino-British talks will be concluded today. Briefed on the progress of negotiations, the Executive Council expressed reservations over a Chinese proposal that the council provide a written commitment that sites not used for military purposes after 1997 will be turned over to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) for commercial use. Britain had previously insisted on a formal agreement. Another sticking point, sources said, was the budget for the new naval base on Stonecutters Island and facilities of other military sites. Even though the two sides had agreed that the size of the new naval base would be reduced, the Chinese side never spelt out what would be the exact budget for building the naval port and the facilities of other military sites, such as dormitories for the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The sources said the government had a "reasonable" amount in mind and would try to lobby the legislators party by party for funding support. Also yesterday, it was announced that the plenary Joint Liaison Group (JLG) meeting would take place from 21 to 23 June.
