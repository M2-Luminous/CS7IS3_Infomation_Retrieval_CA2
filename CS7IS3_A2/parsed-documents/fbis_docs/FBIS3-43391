Names of prominent people are being used to give credibility to the list without their consent. This undemocratic procedure causes grave embarrassment to people who differ fundamentally with ANC policy and are public figures who do not want to become embroiled in political controversy. The way in which the ANC goes about compiling their candidates lists indicates a shocking disrespect for the individual. These embarrassing incidents also prove that the ANC is still trapped in their one-party-state-of-mind. It is time that they accept that the essence of democracy is freedom of choice. Appointing people on to your electoral lists without their permission is further proof of the ANC's disregard for basic democratic procedure and values. It is indeed a sign of the political bankruptcy of the ANC if they have to revert to these kinds of gimmicks, to draw attention to their candidates lists and to attempt to lend it glamour.
