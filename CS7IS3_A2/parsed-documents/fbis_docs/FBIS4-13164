In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM to be published in its 17 April issue, Rabin said that in a telephone conversation following the Israeli bus blast, he and Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on the need to continue the peace process, because it is the best response to the enemies of peace by the Israeli and the Palestinian sides. The Israeli prime minister affirmed that the objective of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month is to boost the multilateral talks and to attend the signing of the agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, if they reach agreement. Rabin clarified that the peace efforts with the Palestinians must proceed simultaneously along two parallel roads, concentrating on the negotiations to reach agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to confirm that violence and terrorism will not hamper the negotiating process or attempts to reach agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in his interview with AL-AHRAM that agreement was reached between the Palestinian and the Israeli sides in a meeting in Cairo recently that anything that is agreed upon during the talks will be written down and initialed. He pointed out that what Israel is trying to do with the Palestinians is to find a formula for peaceful coexistence without any clear or dividing lines, because there are no dividing lines in reality. In this context, he mentioned the corridor linking Gaza and Jericho. Rabin said he would head for Moscow on April 24 to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin. This visit will be preceded by another visit by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to Moscow. But Rabin ruled out the possibility of a meeting between him and 'Arafat then. Rabin said that Israel tried to start secret talks with Syria but that Damascus refused to cooperate, despite the fact that none of the agreements between the Arabs and Israel since 1977 could have taken place had they not been preceded by secret talks. Answering a question on relations between Israel and the Arab countries, Rabin said that peace between Egypt and Israel broke the hostility between Israel and the Arab countries. He stated: Undoubtedly, Egypt is the biggest and most important Arab country. Peace with Egypt has proven that peace can be established and preserved. On the siege imposed on Gaza and the West Bank towns, the Israeli prime minister denied that there are any instructions banning the entry of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip. He said he agreed to exclude doctors, nurses, and Palestinian employees of international organizations from the ban on entering and leaving the occupied territories.
