Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Comittee, delivered a speech at the meeting. Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, cabled his congratulations. Tian Jiyun said: What is the fundamental reason that after 15 years of reform and opening up China has made great strides in successfully accomplishing its first phase strategic objective and is presently advancing toward the goal of being comfortably well off? My personal experience tells me that it boils down to one thing, namely, the results of reform and opening up and delegation of authority and invigoration carried out since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and carried out under the guidance of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics advanced by Comrade Xiaoping. Adherence to this idea is also crucial to continuing our triumphant advance and to realizing our second and even third phase strategic objectives. We must fully understand that the transformation to a market economy [xiang shichang jingji zhuanbian] is an extremely arduous process; dificulties, obstructions, and complications will be unavoidable. We must take note of and cherish the initiative of the central and local governments, all trades and professions, and the broad masses of cadres and people, which we had a hard time arousing over the past dozen years. He pointed out: We should follow the course set for us by Comrade Xiaoping, making the transformation to a socialist market economy, and in a down-to-earth manner, working steadily and making solid progress, strive to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. In his congratulatory telegram, Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, said: I hope that this conference will contribute to deepening the study and understanding of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to further carrying out the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and that it will play a positive role in deepening reform and promoting development. This conference was jointly sponsored and convened by the China Market Economy Association, the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Societies for Social Sciences, and the Shenzhen Municipal CPC Committee. Wang Jue, chairman of the China Market Economy Association, presided over the conference. The experts and scholars in attendance held lively discussions on thoroughly understanding and earnestly carrying out Comrade Xiaoping's thought on socialist market economy.
