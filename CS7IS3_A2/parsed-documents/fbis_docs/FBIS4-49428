All localities should take effective measures to ensure bumper summer grain harvests and to lay a solid foundation for bumper harvests throughout the year. From 4 to 6 April, Wen Jiabao visited Xushui, Rongcheng, and Dingxing in Hebei to assess the growth of wheat crops, as well as preparations for plowing and sowing on cotton fields. He also visited peasants' households, and held informal discussions with grass-roots cadres, peasants, and people. He carried out investigations and studies on such matters as spring plowing and production, as well as the supply of agricultural means of production. Wen Jiabao said: The overall situation of reform, development, and stability is contingent on accomplishing this year's rural work; on bringing about quite favorable developments in agriculture and the rural economy; and on ensuring the production and supply of grain, cotton, cooking oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in the "shopping basket." All localities should seriously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, earnestly give priority to agriculture and rural work, complete all tasks related to agriculture and rural areas for this year, and create a good economic environment and a stable social environment for the smooth implementation of major state reform measures and for the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Wen Jiabao said emphatically: To accomplish this year's rural work, the most important task of the moment is to carry out spring plowing. He said: Ensuring bumper summer grain harvests as an initial step for the rest of the year could lay a good foundation for this year's bumper harvests. To this end, we must accomplish the following tasks: 1) Making overall plans for spring plowing and production, especially effectively implementing measures for increasing grain and cotton acreage and output, allocating seeds, and supplying agricultural means of production; 2) concentrating on field management for summer crops, popularizing crucial measures for increasing output, and raising unit yield; 3) providing materials, as well as technical and information services, for spring plowing and production, and tightening supervision and management over the market for agricultural means of production; and 4) improving disaster prevention and relief work, and ensuring spring sowing and summer harvesting through drought relief measures. He urged leading cadres at all levels to go into the thick of reality, work in a down-to-earth manner, unearth problems on a timely basis, solve problems, and accomplish this year's agricultural production and rural work. Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, accompanied him during the trip.
