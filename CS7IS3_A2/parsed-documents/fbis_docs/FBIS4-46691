What do they think of their immediate prospects? The spectrum of evaluations is very broad--from the bravura-optimistic type of "people for reform" to predictions of an impending social explosion that border on loud demagogy. However, such ideas frequently prove to be far from reality. This is indicated, in particular, by the results of comprehensive sociological research conducted by Russia's Independent Institute of Social and National Problems in 11 regions of the country. It might appear at first glance that the evaluations of Russians coincide with the gloomiest forecasts: 89 percent of respondents called the situation alarming, a crisis, and catastrophic, while only 5.9 percent called it ordinary. But against this background of clearly expressed social discomfort, data that reflect people's feelings on a personal level look surprising. Every 10th person assessed his own situation as good, 64 percent as satisfactory, and only 20.2 percent as poor. As for personal prospects, here cautious optimism also prevails. A little more than half the people are convinced that their life will improve, or at worst remain unchanged. What is the reason for such an obvious gap between the estimates of the situation in the country and at the personal level? Apparently, a majority of Russians do not believe in the ability of the authorities to ensure an acceptable level of political and economic stability in the country and to guarantee both public and personal safety. This conclusion, in particular, derives from the answer to the question: "What is the greatest danger for Russia today?" Here the picture, in descending order of importance, is as follows: the increase in crime, the impoverishment of the people, the impotence of the political authorities, the growth in unemployment, the worsening of the ecological situation, and sliding into civil war. (Incidentally, the last indicator was much lower than in previous years--in 1992 and 1993 it continuously exceeded 50 percent.) That is, it is perfectly obvious that Russians are alarmed mostly by problems that are being resolved not on a personal level but that require the collective, united efforts of society and the state. The impetus from below is this: You guarantee the external conditions of vital activity, and we will resolve problems concerning our personal affairs by ourselves. The conviction that the current crisis condition of society is serious and will last a long time has replaced the "revolution of expectations." But since this is the case, it will be necessary for us to extricate ourselves. People already do not want that much from the authorities. To the question: "What, in your opinion, should be the role of the state in the life of our country?"--a majority of those polled answered that the state should ensure all citizens a social minimum (inexpensive food products, inexpensive clothing, inexpensive housing, a free education, etc.), but anyone who wants more should get it by himself. In addition, 63.8 percent of respondents expressed the desire personally to engage in business undertakings. But the idea of total liberalism, that is, that the state should not interfere in the life of the citizens and that everyone should depend on himself, was supported by only 4.2 percent of those polled; 13 percent think that the state should help only the weak and helpless. Somewhat more respondents, but also a minority (22.4 percent), are convinced of the need to return to an equalization system in which the state, according to the idea, should guarantee the full equality of all citizens (property, legal, and political). It would seem that the attraction of people to forces of a social-democratic nature should correspond to similar values in the spirit of the idea of a socially oriented market. However, parties of this inclination do not yet enjoy any special influence in the country. The reason for this, apparently, is that influential parties of such an orientation can form mainly on the basis of a powerful national workers and trade union movement (as, incidentally, occurred in West Europe) that comes out under the flag of the idea of social partnership. But in the sphere of economic relations in Russia, the type of hired worker with rationalistic-market thinking has not yet developed as a mass phenomenon. Under such conditions, the creation of a powerful trade union movement that defends the interests of the collective hired worker before the employer and of a national trade union center is very problematical. But on the whole, the notions of which sociopolitical forces are capable of giving the country a better future are distinguished by a lack of clarity and fragmentariness. Of the respondents, 20.6 percent associate their hopes with democratic forces, 18 percent--with the Russian nationalists, and 16.8 percent are setting their hopes on assistance from the West, while 11.5 percent are counting on the Orthodox Church to one degree or another. In a certain measure, the broad spectrum of political preferences--from universalism and liberalism to traditionalism and great power ideas--reflects the state of confusion of the mass conscience. However, more than half the respondents associate hopes for getting the country out of the crisis with social forces of a traditionalist-statehood orientation--Russian nationalists, monarchists, the Cossack Host, and the Orthodox Church. Thus, the political force that will want to claim the role of national leader will be compelled to combine in its political activity the ideas of a socially oriented market economy and traditional national patriotic and state aims. It can be assumed that this political force, in order to win popularity, will have to actively exploit anti-mafia and anti-nomenklatura slogans. This may be a party or movement of a neo-conservative persuasion that adheres to democratic rules and procedures in the struggle and is based on the ideas of a socially oriented market which recognizes the priority of laws and human freedom and simultaneously calls for preservation of the traditions of a strong statehood and the Russian spirit and patriotism.
