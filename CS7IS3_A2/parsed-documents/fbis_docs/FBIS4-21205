Gen. Hermoza said Army personnel who commit crimes while on duty and who allegedly protect traffickers are immediately discharged and taken to a military court. He said: ``In my opinion the Military Court can best investigate these cases. If suspects were brought before a civilian court today, I am sure many guilty criminals would be released tomorrow.'' Hermoza Rios said that only when an Army member is caught red-handed with irrefutable evidence and witnesses to link him to this kind of crime, is he then taken to a civilian court. Following an operation in the Satipo Military Base, Gen. Hermoza spoke to the program ``Dialogue'' transmitted on Channel Two. He said that in the past few weeks traffickers had suffered harsh blows. ``We are all witnesses of the accomplishments of the forces of order during operations that took place in Madre de Dios, Inapari, Manu, and now in Satipo, in which important trafficking networks were dismantled,'' he said. He said the operations carried out in these remote parts of the country follow a strategy ordered by President Alberto Fujimori to eradicate drug trafficking. He added that terrorism is about to disappear in the Huallaga Valley. It is expected that the military front in the zone will eradicate the Shining Path at the same time it ends trafficking. ``These actions have forced the traffickers to move to other drug production and storage centers like Madre de Dios and Satipo where clandestine airstrips for the departure of airplanes that carry drugs have been found,'' he said. Gen. Hermoza said he is not worried with the investigations and criticisms by some media about the struggle against traffickers. He said there is a campaign to discredit ``the Armed Forces'' through unfounded attacks. ``These attacks are not isolated but are made within the framework of a campaign to discredit our Armed Forces and to destabilize the democratic process in Peru,'' he said. Gen. Hermoza said the media will never be censored because freedom of press and expression are the main bastions of democracy. Gen. Hermoza likewise ruled out disagreements between the Armed Forces and the National Police, saying that their drug enforcement task is being carried out in total harmony and coordination. He said that at every military intervention against traffickers a prosecutor and a police representative are present adding that the drugs confiscated during the operation are handed to them. ``There is close cooperation at all levels. It is good to see that unity and discipline are being maintained despite the difficult conditions in which we are carrying out this struggle,'' he added. He added that the successful anti-trafficking policy in Peru is not based on support provided by the DEA but to an appropriate strategy developed by the government through the national Armed Forces. ``Nowhere in the world has a problem like trafficking and terrorism been combated with so much success as it is currently being done in Peru,'' he said. He recalled that in November last year the Armed Forces Joint Command correctly evaluated the government provisions to eradicate terrorism from the country and to consolidate national pacification according to the law. He denied that these actions seek to improve the Armed Forces image in face of the serious charges against some of its members for being involved with drug trafficking. He said the Armed Forces began to participate in the struggle against trafficking and terrorism when the work exceeded the capability of the police force. ``These social scourges represented at a given moment an imminent risk and danger to national security and the survival of our nation, which is why urgent measures had to be adopted,'' he said. Gen. Hermoza said the legal framework established by the current regime has allowed the Armed Forces and the National Police to carry out their task appropriately in the most troubled zones of the country.
