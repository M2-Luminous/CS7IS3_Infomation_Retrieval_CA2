"We have taken note of Russia's proposal, and we will study it," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said by telephone. Moscow had proposed an international conference Thursday to try to find a solution to the nuclear impasse in North Korea. Pyongyang rejected a complete inspection of its suspect nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The conference would bring together the two Koreas, China, Japan, the United States and Russia and delegates from the United Nations and the IAEA. The countries concerned reacted rather coolly to the proposal on Friday. China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, continues to oppose international sanctions against its communist ally, but Western diplomats at the United Nations said Friday that Beijing might sign a declaration on North Korea which would not include sanctions. South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam was expected to arrive in China Saturday for a five-day visit during which he will ask his hosts to help get North Korea to accept inspections of its nuclear installations and to reopen its dialogue with South Korea.
