A UN spokesman had named nine countries, including Australia, what he said would send infantry troops to join the UN force. But an Australian spokesman said that while the government has committed in principle to a peacekeeping mission to Rwanda, it had not decided what form its involvement would take. He said Australia is awaiting an assessment of the Rwandan situation by a UN observer team. The UN plans to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda where hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have died in ethic violence.
