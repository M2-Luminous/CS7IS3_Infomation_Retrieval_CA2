"There is no possibility of a South-North summit in Beijing during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China," Chu said. "An inter-Korean summit is not such a simple matter as to be realized just because the two leaders are visiting Beijing nearly at the same time," Chu said. In order for Seoul and Pyongyang to hold a summit, extensive consultations and preparations must take place, Chu said. At present, there is no possibility that Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song will visit Beijing at the same time, Chu added. Reliable sources in Beijing said Monday that the North Korean president would visit China in May at the latest.
