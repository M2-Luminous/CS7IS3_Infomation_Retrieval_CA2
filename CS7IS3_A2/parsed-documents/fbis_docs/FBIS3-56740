Yavlinskiy told reporters that in his government current Finance Minister Boris Fedorov would chair the Central Bank, while Anatoliy Chubays would remain the privatisation supremo. The leader of the Yabloko parliamentary faction said he had not received any offers to join the government of Viktor Chernomyrdin, but had there been any he would have "submitted a programme of extreme anti-crisis measures in three weeks". However, Yavlinskiy added that he would assume the responsibility "only on condition that the president exerts no pressure and does not interfere". Yavlinskiy believes that First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar had resigned because of the economic situation which had sharply aggravated of late.
