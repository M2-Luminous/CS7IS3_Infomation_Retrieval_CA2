Addressing on Thursday a news conference in Moscow, Churkin gave his assessment of chances that the agreements reached between Croatia and Serb Krajina will be observed. The Russian diplomat described the latest document signed by the warring factions as "a special case" in contrast to previous agreements which had been frequently broken. This time, Churkin stressed, "Russia, the United States, the European Union and U.N. stand behind the parties to the agreement." Thus, "the party daring to violate the accord would challenge not only the other side in the conflict but also to these key members of the world community," Russia's envoy noted. Furthermore, the point at issue at the moment is an all-round agreement, "rather a complicated military-technical document on disengagement of troops and weapons," which contains "quite definite, if not ideal, provisions" about U.N. supervision over its implementation, Churkin emphasised. Commenting on the content of the agreement, the Russian diplomat said it comprised not only the text of the document itself, but also 35 detailed maps signed by the warring factions. "There should not be any room for uncertainty as to what the sides should do to fulfil the agreements," Churkin pointed out. Therefore, Churkin stressed, he is inclined to believe that the agreement will be observed. However, he did not rule out the possiblity of "certain roughness," especially at the most difficult initial stage of troop disengagement."
