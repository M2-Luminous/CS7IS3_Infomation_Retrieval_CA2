It is an extremely dangerous endeavor for those who have emigrated illegally from Cuba by sea. Research is being conducted precisely on this topic by a specialist of the Center for Political Alternatives of the University of Havana. Its deputy director, Antonio Aja, explains: [Aja] "This is an in-depth study of the characteristics of those who emigrate illegally; the motives of the people who make the decision to emigrate illegally; who they are; what their reasons are; and the risks taken once the decision and attempt to illegally emigrate is made." The researcher also spoke about the significance of this act for national security and human life. [Aja] "Emigrating through the Guantanamo Naval Base is not the same as emigrating in a raft." The classification of people who attempt to emigrate by sea was another of the goals of this study. [Aja] "They can basically be classified as young. This is understandable because, first of all, this endeavor requires a certain physical ability." This interview is only an excerpt of a broad subject that we will discuss further in this program over the next few days.
