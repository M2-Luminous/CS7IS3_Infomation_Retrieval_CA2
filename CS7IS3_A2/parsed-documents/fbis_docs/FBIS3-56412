Talking About Derailed Talks Is Premature"] [Text] On Thursday evening REUTER reported a Japanese Foreign Ministry statement on indefinitely suspending Russian-Japanese talks on territorial demarcation. It is noteworthy that this report coincided with the first address by Vladimir Shumeyko as Federal Assembly speaker [as published; Shumeyko is Federation Council speaker], in which he made it clear that there is no territorial problem and that the islands belong to Russia. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov comments on the situation at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request. By the time of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo in October, when it was decided to hold a regular meeting of a working group on the peace treaty (it discussed the territorial question among other things), experts had not been in session for more than a year. At the time the meeting was tentatively scheduled for December. Now, however, according to REUTER, Moscow decided to postpone the talks "indefinitely," citing the fact that many Russian politicians were involved in the election campaign. According to Mr. Panov, this report, which was published a few days ago in a Japanese newspaper, was news to him. Incidentally, the diplomat noted, a number of Japanese mass media have already refuted this information. The meeting, indeed, is unlikely to be held in January, because the sides have yet to resolve a number of technical matters related to its organization. The Russian Foreign Ministry, however, has not sent proposals to Tokyo for an "indefinite" postponement, Mr. Panov said. Moreover, talking about postponement is simply irrelevant because no specific decisions on possible dates of the peace treaty group's meetings had been made earlier. Mr. Panov pointed out that to all appearances a Japanese delegation would arrive in Moscow in February. The meeting's precise date will be announced "in the near future." Commentary When a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that talks on the territorial problem were allegedly postponed at Moscow's request, he cited his counterparts from the Russian Foreign Ministry. They allegedly attributed the delay to the fact that their representatives, many of whom were involved in the election campaign, were not ready for the talks. We may add that the supervisor of the Japanese sector at the Russian Foreign Ministry has also changed in the wake of the elections: Georgiy Kunadze left for Seoul as Russian ambassador, and Aleksandr Panov has yet to get into the swing of things. After all, it is not so important whether the talks will take place in January or February. Rumors about the postponement are only a sign of Tokyo's concern about the results of such talks. The key word here -- "election campaign" -- brings to mind the fact that Russia's foreign policy has been more and more affected by the "Zhirinovskiy factor;" he, having succeeded in his nationalist rhetoric in general, has repeatedly said that the Kremlin is allegedly ready just about to "give up the islands to Japan." At a time when economic populism literally costs a lot and is constrained by the realities of the Russian budget deficit and ever- lasting inflation, political, or rather foreign policy, populism may just as well be chosen as a weapon in the struggle. All the more so because not only has it brought Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leaders great dividends, it has also enabled them to leave the voters in the dark as to the party's economic program. As a matter of fact, addressing the Federal Assembly, its new chief, Vladimir Shumeyko [as published], having successfully evaded all acute angles regarding economic policy, made a point of voicing his support for Viktor Chernomyrdin on the South Kuril islands problem: Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan and the Habomai islands "belong to Russia, and there is no question of their transfer." While he acknowledged that his view diverged from Moscow's official point of view (which boils down to admitting that "the problem exists"), it is clear that any talks about the islands are doomed to a stalemate. Nikita Khrushchev, who officially promised two of the islands to the Japanese, has probably been the only politician who could act without paying heed to the voters. It is also evident that a period started by Mikhail Gorbachev, when the fact of recognizing the existence of a territorial problem (without visible breakthroughs in its settlement) was modus operandi in relations with Japan, is drawing to a close. No arguments about "fostering cooperation on the basis of compromise in the settlement of territorial disputes" will work any longer given a formidable nationalist opposition.
