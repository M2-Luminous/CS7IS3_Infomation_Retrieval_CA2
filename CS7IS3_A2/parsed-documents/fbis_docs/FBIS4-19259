The islands' worst crisis is still unfolding. People are fleeing to Denmark. The vital trawler fleet has been on strike for a week over compulsory fishing quotas that will gradually strangle the industry. But everyone knows who is responsible for the crisis. They are. Torshavn--As always the weather on the Faeroes is unsettled, but the mood is stable, below the freezing point. For over a week the Faeroese trawler fleet has remained in port--in anger over a new fishing quota system that could lead to the scrapping of many trawlers in the near future. It was not until Friday night [11 March] that the Faeroese government presented a proposal that could get the fishermen moving. The quotas will be retained, but the Faeroes will purchase the right to catch another 5,000 tons in the Russian zone of the Barents Sea. The vital trawlers are the first link in the Faeroes' food chain. Fish make up 98 percent of island exports and the 44 trawlers account for 80 percent of the total catch. But the people of the Faeroes are so used to misery and catastrophe that they have scarcely reacted to the paralysis of the industry that must pump life into the entire island community. Some 1,000 workers at fish fillet factories have already been fired or will be in the coming week and the painful effects will spread to every corner of the wind-swept islands until more fish are brought ashore. "I think the Faeroese and Danish governments forget they are dealing with human beings. What is happening just now is simply an enormous catastrophe," said the leader of the strike, Emil Nolsoe, chairman of the trawler owners' organization and a skipper from Sando with a steely glint in his eyes. The depression of ordinary islanders approaches apathy at times in the midst of the Faeroes' worst economic crisis. It is hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people of the Faeroes do not like their new daily life. Shock Therapy After the over-consumption and unrestrained deficit spending of the 1980's when every town had to have its nursing home and its soccer field with artificial turf, the bill must now be paid. And Denmark is very popular in the Faeroes these days. Not only do the islands receive a billion kroner a year in subsidies from Copenhagen, the Danish Government has rescued the foundering banks--and recently Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen agreed to lend the Faeroes 3 billion kroner so the islands could eliminate expensive old loans. The conditions were the fishing quotas and an end to wage guarantees for the highly paid fishermen. The foreign debt amounts to almost 8 billion kroner and although the Danish Government has come to the rescue and suspended payments, an expensive 500 million kroner a year in interest must be paid. The natural catastrophe of fewer fish in the sea--and the fall of the Berlin wall which opened the door for cheap Russian fish--have been a hard blow. The result is 5,000 people unemployed out of a labor force of 21,000. The strike is temporarily sending 1,000 more off the job. A little under 1,000 people are not covered by unemployment funds and live on public assistance. The crisis has meant a wage decline of 10-15 percent. At the same time taxes have risen explosively. Before the first of the year the islanders were paying 10 percent more in taxes than Danes do. After 1 January municipal taxes rose 6-7 percent. An ordinary wage earner pays a good 60 percent in taxes--without deductions. In addition there is a high oil tax and a value-added tax. An unemployed person receives only two-thirds of a skilled worker's pay and the support is close to the absolute subsistence level. "We are well aware that we have only ourselves to thank for our situation," the islanders all say. But they do not believe they will ever be able to pay off the debt. Denmark will be stuck with it--sooner or later. For if unemployment rises further and taxes do not decline, emigration from the islands to Denmark will accelerate. Neither Denmark nor the Faeroes can live with that in the long run. In 1993, 2,700 people left the Faeroes and only 900 returned home. It is people between the ages of 30 and 40 who go to Denmark to get work and more money. The population figure has dropped suddenly from 47,000 to 45,000 and everyone believes the outward flow will continue. "It is an open artery that is draining energy and the future from society. It is the people who ought to get everything going again who are leaving. But the question is whether there is room for that many people here. Whether we have to get down to a population of 25-30,000 to find a natural level," said Aksel Hansen, the grand old man of fishing in the Faeroes. The 70 year old Hansen is one of those who have been hardest hit. In the fall his fish factory in Torshavn harbor would have celebrated its 40th anniversary. But one month before the big day the bank rejected a debt reorganization plan and he lost the factory. Now he has five trawlers but he is still debt-ridden. "Things began going wrong for the Faeroes in the 1970's. Grants were given for ships and fish factories in every single town and it was quite obvious that it was too much. But things went well through the 1980's when fishing was good. At our factory we used the money to improve production and we were also hit when the crisis came," he said. Politicians Detested The trawler owners' confrontation with the politicians of the Faeroes has been reinforced by a total distrust of the elected representatives. "Our politicians are no good," Hansen said bluntly. And a similar refrain is heard everywhere from people high and low. But the anger with the island government fell on deaf ears despite the fact that the strike will probably cost Faeroese unemployment funds 50 million kroner. Just after the strike began a 14-man delegation headed by Prime Minister Marita Petersen (Social Democrat) journeyed to Stockholm on a visit to the Nordic Council. And she did not return until Thursday [10 March], when she rejected the fishermen's demands. The law on limiting catches goes into effect tomorrow. The debt-ridden Faeroese trawler fleet considers the quotas unreasonable. Especially as it will not be possible to let the healthiest ships buy quotas from those in poor shape so they can quit. "The whole quota system is set up so unrealistically that it makes it impossible to make a living. The law has sidestepped the heart of the matter. If the government thinks some ships should be eliminated it is wrong to kill all of them slowly in order to weed some out," said Nolsoe. He feels a deep distrust of the marine biologists who said in 1987 that if a third of the 87 trawlers then in existence disappeared the fleet would have an ideal composition. Now there are 44 left and the biologists are saying again that the fleet should be cut in half. "The fish are there. The supply of haddock and cod is on the way up. We agreed earlier to protect big areas and use larger meshes, but we do not believe quotas will help increase the fish population. I think the Danish Government has acted too hastily and listened to the wrong people. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is being penny-wise and pound-foolish," Nolsoe said. At Tinganes, where the government can be found (at least after its return on Friday) Prime Minister Petersen is well aware that she occasionally makes unpopular decisions: "Everyone is to blame for what has happened. But the politicians have the biggest responsibility. We should have had a different fishing policy, a different housing policy and different rules on taxing interest long ago to avoid acquiring this huge debt. But I can look the voters in the eye and say: We have tackled the problems that exist and have gone against the tide. We stand by what we do." It is an election year and she is considerably more optimistic about the future than people on the street and in the business sector. According to the local government's projections the public debt of 6.3 billion kroner will not rise during the next five years. On the other hand plans call for doing away with private foreign debt in 1998. And at that time things may well move forward again--by virtue of strong growth in the fish supply. "It will be tough to get through this. Especially because people here have enjoyed constant progress for 30 years. This has created a way of life that is hard to give up. So now people are disillusioned and can only see the negative side. Things are not that bad. Some 70 percent of the people are doing quite well." Like most people she regards foreign debt as the biggest problem. But while others hope the debt to Denmark will be canceled because the catastrophe can be limited that way, the prime minister of the Faeroes does not plan to entreat Denmark to cancel the outstanding amount: "If we are to have any hope of regaining our credibility and our credit rating abroad it is decisive not to have our debt canceled. Five years from now things may well be moving in the right direction again." But when will she come to Copenhagen next with her hat in her hand? "I cannot answer that."
