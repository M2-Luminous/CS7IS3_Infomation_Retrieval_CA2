In a statement published today in AL-MUSTAQBAL newspaper, the paper of the Yemeni Socialist Party, al-Bid disclosed that the signs of this serious scheme are represented by the acts of violence, terrorism, and crime from which many Arab and Muslim countries, including Yemen, are suffering. Al-Bid noted that this scheme, which stands against every national and pan-Arab tendency toward unity, takes religion as a guise. He added that reason and religion reject such backward plans.
