[passage omitted] Minister Buwayz pointed out that Israel uses its military forces to carry out assaults to make the resistance feel that it is dependent on the protection of the Lebanese and Syrian Armies. Consequently, it will seek to attain self-reliance by acquiring more weapons, and this will result in confrontation between the Army and the resistance. The deputies then debated the issue, and Minister Buwayz explained that the Israeli assaults have a larger purpose than just influencing the negotiations. He said Lebanon's participation in the peace negotiations was approved by several successive Lebanese governments and was also an inter-Arab and regional decision. He explained that if Lebanon abandons the negotiations, it will find itself isolated. Buwayz noted that Israel might be seeking to make Lebanon withdraw from the negotiations. Concerning the complaints that Lebanon has lodged with the UN Security Council, Buwayz pointed out that a negative atmosphere prevails in that body. He said: The Americans asked us to lodge only a complaint. We are not deceived by UN advice. U.S. views on this issue must be altered. No one understands our issues, and Middle East issues in general, like we do.
