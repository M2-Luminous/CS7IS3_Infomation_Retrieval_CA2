'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in prayer. "Other Palestinians I spoke to also said they saw five," he said, without being able to explain what happened to the killers afterwards. The Israeli army said the killing was the work of one settler who apparently committed suicide afterwards. Another witness, Husayn 'Isa al-Rajabi, 42, said he saw a second settler feed the gunman with ammunition as he raked the worshippers with gunfire. Imam Ibrahim 'Abidin, who was leading Friday prayers, said the shots came from "several directions." "It can only be a planned operation because there were a lot of settlers inside the mosque," he added. A Palestinian told Israeli radio he saw a gunman firing from behind a pillar. "I'm sure that settlers outside the building threw cartridges to the killer who could keep on firing," the Palestinian said. Military radio said the gunman was Barukh Goldstein, a doctor from the settlement of Qiryat Arba'. Settlers from there have made death threats against Palestinians following a rash of anti-Israeli attacks on the West Bank. A Jewish extremist network, mainly from Qiryat Arba', killed four Palestinian students from Hebron and committed several other attacks. [passage omitted]
