Khrushchev, in the estimation of Gorbachev, who began his party career under him, was an inconsistent and limited reformer, but nonetheless sincerely attempted to liberalize the totalitarian Stalinist system. From a subjective angle, it is possible to discern power struggle motives in his actions, but his speech against Stalin soon after the latter's death while his henchmen were still alive demanded great courage on Khrushchev's part, in its consequences "exposed the personality cult," and proved to be far more significant than simply intrigue. This conversation was interesting to journalists in the light of the biography of Gorbachev himself, since he quickly passed from the "palace coup" of 1964 to 1991, when via similar apparatus means Gorbachev himself was twice removed from power: the first time in August -- unsuccessfully, the second, in December -- successfully. The ex-USSR president, who is now unlikely to be brought as a witnesses in the "SCSE [State Committee for the State of Emergency] case," imparted many details of the events, emphasizing the role of Boris Yeltsin in their development. It will soon be possible to read about this in Gorbachev's memoirs, which he has recently sent to his publishers. In their questions the journalists tried to prompt their interlocutor further to project the recurring model of the "palace coup" onto the present day, onto the potential threat of the removal of President Yeltsin from real power. However, Mikhail Gorbachev did not wish to delve into even a theoretical analysis of this possibility. For all his undisguised negative attitude toward Yeltsin, Gorbachev does not allow himself to entertain the idea of his removal from power by other than legal means, through elections, which, however, in his opinion, could take place before 1996.
