The DPJM has also protested because yesterday some other Serbian Orthodox priests were not allowed to enter Macedonia as civilians either, which represents a serious violation of the democratic and constitutional principles of Macedonia, and it is another instance of the tough repression of the population of Serbian nationality, which has already been deprived of its rights. The DPMJ has also protested the irrational and, in its view, irresponsible statements by the Head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church Mihail.
