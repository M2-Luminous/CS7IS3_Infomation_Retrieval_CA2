Yesterday hearings were held on the complaints of independent candidates for deputies, who had been refused registration by the district electoral commission on the grounds of invalidation of some of the signatures collected. Dina Shulgina, chairman of a consumer rights protection society in Kalininskiy Rayon, collected the number of signatures required for registration--more than 2,000, but a small number of the signatures were collected outside the boundaries of the electoral district where she was going to run. The reason was that one of Petersburg newspapers printed some incorrect information on the addresses of buildings included in her district. The number of "outside" votes was not great, but the district commission refused to register D. Shulgina, and the city commission upheld the decision. The city court, in turn, dismissed D. Shulgina's complaint about the elections commissions' actions. Despite the fact that the elections are to be held in just a few days, the rejected candidate for deputy intends to continue her court battle for validation of her candidacy. D. Shulgina's appeal will be sent by mail to the Supreme Court of Russia. It is obvious that it will not be considered in time for the elections. A similar complaint was filed by Vladimir Radushnov, president of Tais-Sport--a St. Petersburg joint-stock company. As the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon district commission established, some of those who signed for Vladimir Radushnov also signed for his competitor in the same district. All these "duplicate" signatures were invalidated. As a result, Vladimir Radushnov came up several hundred votes short of qualifying as a candidate. Nobody questioned the citizens as to whom in fact they support. As experience shows, questionable issues in matters of signature collection are not interpreted in favor of the candidates. It is interesting that court hearings are taking place just a few days before the elections. The mayor's decision, which excluded some citizens from participating in the elections, was recently challenged by Federation Council Deputy Aleksandr Belyayev, who won the case. His complaint was found valid, and A. Sobchak's decision illegal. As we learned, A. Sobchak has appealed the city court ruling at the Supreme Court. Until the complaint is heard in Moscow, the city court decision is not in force. But the elections are to take place on 20 March. And some citizens will be deprived of an opportunity for full participation in them. On these grounds a group of unregistered deputies, as well as the Russian Peasant Party's branch, sent a letter to Russian Electoral Commission Chairman N. Ryabov asking him to interfere in the actions of the St. Petersburg city electoral commission and to postpone the elections. At this point, Moscow has not made its reaction known... Today the city court will hear the Peasant Party's complaint on the city electoral commission's actions. There are five days left until the elections.
