Madame (Carina Causkenarrow), general director of the Chicago Management Association, said: Chicago and U.S. business circles are very glad about the settlement of the issue of China's MFN treatment, which will maintain the strong business ties of the two sides. Our current visit to China is precisely an opportunity to discuss trade and investment between the two sides. Li Lanqing briefed the visitors on the situation of China's economic development. He said: Now that China has opened its door, it will open up wider and wider and nothing can close it. Hence, China will provide greater and greater opportunities for cooperation. He wished that the entrepreneurs from Chicago could find new opportunities of investment and cooperation through this visit. The Chicago Management Association organized, for the first time, a delegation to visit China at the invitation of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
