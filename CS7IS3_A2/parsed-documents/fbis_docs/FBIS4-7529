Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova had visited the IMF, chiefly to discuss the extension to the Slovak Republic of the so-called standby credit. The government will apparently have to decide either to introduce unpopular economic measures or to consider drawing on the standby credit, which would be connected with restrictive measures in the social sphere. [SME] What is the opinion of the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic [AD SR]? [Knazko] We do not want this government to behave like a government that has elections in mind. Although the government's situation is not easy because some departments have deficits amounting to billions [of Slovak korunas], it should establish good conditions for the next government, even at the expense of electoral preferences. It is necessary to explain pragmatically to the citizen where we stand and stop making promises. I am confident that the coalition will come to an agreement. The path toward it will be difficult and complicated, but the decisions will then be all the more responsible and conceptual. Let us not anticipate events. [SME] The present opposition is sending out signals about imminent mass dismissals from the state administration to be carried out by this government. If this is true, which and how many posts will be affected? [Knazko] Professional expertise is the number-one criterion. We have not yet discussed this issue in the coalition, but there cannot be any talk about sweeping or ideologically motivated dismissals. We are not going to make the same mistakes as the previous government; we are not going to make any changes that are not well founded. [SME] Why did the centrist parties--that is, your party and the followers of Moravcik and Cernak--not merge last weekend? The reasons for the failure to merge cited in the media included technical and legislative, but also other, personal, ones. What was the main problem? [Knazko] These matters must be decided by the party's political bodies. I will clearly work toward the liberal, or right, center being formed by a single party that would be capable of representing a genuine counterbalance to other political entities. I do not consider having a number of small parties to be an optimal solution at present. I have discussed my ideas with Messrs. Cernak, Roman Kovac, and Moravcik, and we have essentially agreed that we will strive for unification. I think that differences in programs will be minimal, and we have also practically agreed on personnel issues. The merger between the AD SR and the followers of Moravcik will take place in the very near future. [SME] And what about a merger with Cernak's party? [Knazko] We will definitely remain open to this possibility. This will depend on the decision of Mr. Cernak and his party. Ludovit Cernak's statements to the effect that we do not want to build the new party any further than the district level or that we have only intellectuals at the top and no structures are imprecise and the result of a lack of information. It is self-evident that we have the ambition to build our political structures in the same way as any serious party. [SME] Why then did the three parties not merge this weekend, as heralded one month ago? [Knazko] We can still merge. This also depends on Mr. Cernak's interest in being represented in such a bloc with such an orientation and on his readiness to accept the fact that a person will become chairman of the center party who is the most acceptable from the viewpoint of objective criteria, from the viewpoint of the approaching elections, and from the viewpoint of the post he holds. [SME] Do you think the parties of the center will actually merge or that they will merely form a preelection coalition? [Knazko] The AD SR is contemplating a merger rather than a coalition. [SME] Do you not think your failure to merge right away also with Cernak's group represents a wasted chance? [Knazko] This is everyone's own decision, but it is a pity--for us but also for Mr. Cernak. I believe that the differences from the viewpoint of being oriented toward the European Democratic Union or the Liberal International are not such that they cannot be overcome. The differences between our programs will be equally minimal, so I regard this [separate existence of two parties] as a waste of energy and time. [SME] You and the group around Jozef Moravcik define yourselves as a liberal entity. Mr. Cernak, on the other hand, said on Saturday [26 March] that "the new alternative cannot rest in boundless liberalism with its `dog eat dog' mentality." What kind of liberalism do you represent? [Knazko] Nothing boundless has a place in contemporary society, only in an extreme one. We have already defined some liberal priorities--from the citizen, via the community, to the state, from courage for changes to support for the private sector. Those are our points of departure, in the implementation of which it is necessary to accept our social and economic reality. Our party operates within the context of the Liberal International. It is a waste of time to talk about boundlessness. Rather, we hould build firm boundaries and seek European contacts. [SME] Right-wing parties, not to mention liberal-oriented ones, flopped in the last elections, plainly speaking. There is more and more talk about liberalism at present, yet the poll results do not support this. According to the preelection polls, the AD SR currently has the support of slightly over 1 percent of voters, and Mr. Moravcik's group does not even figure in the polls. How do see the prospects for the liberal-oriented parties in the September elections? [Knazko] I think this political orientation will stop being the isolated voice of individuals and tiny parties. I therefore expect much of the unification of persons and programs. I set great hopes in the membership base growing more numerous and being able, by virtue of the numbers, to assert liberal policies more effectively throughout Slovakia. There will also be far more visible political personalities representing this kind of policy. In my opinion, this is the result of a certain process that was perhaps inevitable. It started in the Public Against Violence movement [VPN] and continued, in part, in the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Through natural crystallization, a certain selection of political personalities took place who will be capable of representing liberal policies. And I have no doubt that this will also find its expression in public opinion polls--in a substantially increased percentage of electoral preferences. [SME] Are you not afraid that the people associated in the AD SR and around Jozef Moravcik will be regarded by the people as HZDS defectors, who have nothing in common except their distaste for Vladimir Meciar? [Knazko] No, not at all. This is a very simplified and demagogic perception of some commentators, by which I do not mean you. We all are defectors from totalitarianism, defectors from the VPN because, without them, the present party structures would not have been created. One of the reasons the HZDS was formed as a broad spectrum movement was to make it possible for new political parties to emerge from it. Some people have supposedly broken away from the HZDS and are now so-called defectors. I consider this, however, to be a very positive process that has not yet ended. Let us return to the defectors. Why use such pejorative terms? These are people whose political views have become crystallized thanks to HZDS policies. These so-called defectors underwent baptism by fire and were forced to defend their views, in defiance of HZDS methods. The HZDS played a positive role in this regard. [SME] HZDS Deputy Chairwoman Olga Keltosova said on Saturday [26 March] that the movement wants to transform itself into a party of the "pragmatic center." In this context, she said that, personally, she prefers liberal values. How do you assess the possibility of the HZDS joining the Liberal International? [Knazko] It does not matter who declares what. What matters is the kind of policy one actually practices. The HZDS has convinced me of many things, except that it prefers liberal values. That is the last thing that would occur to me. Had this been true, we all could have calmly remained in the HZDS.
