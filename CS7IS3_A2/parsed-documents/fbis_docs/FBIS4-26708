They must actively explore new ways for education of party members to further give play to the role of fighting bastions of party organizations at all levels, and the vanguard role of the broad masses of party members. Yin Kesheng added: At present, our reforms have entered a stage of taking strong fortifications characterized by the integration of overall advance with major breakthroughs. New situations and tasks have set new and more demands on the level of our theories, policies, knowledge, and work. Using Marxism, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics in particular, to arm all party members and cadres is now more urgent than at any time in the past. Yin Kesheng continued: In recent years, party schools and organization departments of CPC committees at all levels in our province and relevant departments have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress. They have made marked achievements in using the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm all party members. The fighting bastions role of party organizations at all levels, and the vanguard role of the broad masses of party members have been further brought into play. In the meantime, however, we must soberly realize that under the new situation, some new problems have occurred. The broad masses of our party members and cadres are facing a new and severe test. The more we do to promote reform and opening up and develop the economy, the more we must do to consciously strengthen party building, stick to the correct political orientation, and increase our sense of responsibility and urgency to arm the entire party with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Yin Kesheng stressed: Party schools are schools for educating and training party members and cadres under the leadership of the CPC committees. The work for party schools must conform with the demands of the new situations and tasks. The key in this regard lies in deepening reform. At present and for a period to come, while carrying out reform in party schools, we must devote our efforts to enhance the applicability, aims, and efficiency of the teaching content. Solving difficult and key problems arising in reform, opening up, economic construction and teaching should be treated as a focal point in the scientific research work of party schools. We must make efforts to establish a teachers' contingent noted for its fine quality, strong party character, correct study style, and worthiness of the name of teachers. While talking about the issue of education for party members, Yin Kesheng pointed out: With regard to education for party members, we must persist in combining theory with practice, and strengthen the applicability of the education. We must persist in mainly educating by positive measures, and giving full play to the exemplary role of outstanding party members. We must persist in differentiating one kinds of student from another, and providing education at different levels. We must persist in organically combining education for party members with control and supervision over them. In the meantime, we must persist in laying our stress on constructive work, and treating the work of benefiting party members as a foundation of our education to establish and improve the system and mechanisms for party members' education to push our province's education for party members to a new level. Yin Kesheng called on CPC committees, party work organs, and leading cadres at all levels to approach the issue of party schools and education for party members from the high plane of the strategy for building socialist modernization and a lengthy and peaceful era in our country to truly put these issues on their important work agenda. They must clearly understand the situation and their tasks, and work in a down-to-earth manner to create a new situation in the development of party schools and education for party members in our province.
