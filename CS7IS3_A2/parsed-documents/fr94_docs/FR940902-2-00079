FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dominic Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room B&hyph;133, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 755&hyph;0032; (TDD) (202) 708&hyph;0850. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed Interdepartmental Agreement on HUD's Indian Housing Program sets forth the working relationship among the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHA) in conjunction with the planning and construction of new housing developed with financial assistance of HUD's Indian Housing Program. The Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and guidelines by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision makers and the specific federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing. The Department has been working with the BIA and IHS to revise the existing Interdepartmental Agreement which was published in 1976 and has not been updated to meet the regulatory requirement revisions that affect federal tribal interaction in the Indian Housing Program. The BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) was eliminated from this IA to streamline the agreement among all signatory agencies in the development of HUD Indian housing programs. It is anticipated that the IHS and the BIA will be addressing the BIA-HIP separately. Other sections pertaining to program procedures are more appropriately covered in the program handbook or program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) and have been deleted from the IA. The text of the proposed Interdepartmental Agreement follows: PROPOSED INTERDEPARTMENTAL AGREEMENT ON THE INDIAN HOUSING PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT_OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR_BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES_INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE 1.0␣STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. The purpose of the Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) is to set forth the working relationship among the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) in conjunction with the planning and construction of new Indian housing developments. The above agencies share a common goal to assist Tribes in improving their living environment through the delivery of quality housing and infrastructure. This goal can be more readily achieved with an efficient and integrated utilization of available resources. The Interdepartmental Agreement establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and the guidelines by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision-makers and the specific federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing. 2.0␣GENERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES. 2.1␣ HUD RESPONSIBILITIES. HUD will provide financial assistance for the development and management of low income housing and community developments in Indian and Alaska Native areas through the Traditional Indian Housing Development Program. 2.2␣ BIA RESPONSIBILITIES. BIA will review and approve all required trust land lease issues, easements and real estate appraisals; provide maintenance services to those IHA constructed roads and streets accepted into the BIA road systems in accordance with 25 CFR Part 170; and provide other support, when available, necessary for the timely development of housing. 2.3␣ IHS RESPONSIBILITIES.
