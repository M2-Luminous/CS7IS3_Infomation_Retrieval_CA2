Ministers from the National Independence Party and the Social Democratic Party announced their decision to continue in the government earlier. The ERCP council didn't regard the situation in the Cabinet as a government crisis, but blamed it on personality clashes not rooted in differences over policy. "The survival of the coalition in the parliament confirms that this isn't a government crisis," the party council maintained. "Regarding Laar as the reason behind the disagreements, several younger ministers want to solve the conflict through replacing the prime minister. We think it's politically shortsighted to use the premier's guarantee to the Lekto company's loan as a pretext to replace the head of the government," the ERCP council statement reads. The party council holds the opinion that, in the interests of democratic development, the Pro Patria congress must be given an opportunity to discuss and resolve the differences of opinion between its ministers. Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who resigned on Thursday [19 May], claimed in an interview to BNS that several other Cabinet members from the National Independence Party and the Rural Centrist Party were considering stepping down. Hanni said at a news conference today that she continuously discussed the situation with the ERCP council, but that she never considered leaving the government. "We mustn't attach overmuch importance to what happened, but seek solutions and spend more thought on the future. Pro Patria must itself solve its differences, since a quick stabilization of the situation is necessary with a view to the upcoming elections," Hanni told BNS.
