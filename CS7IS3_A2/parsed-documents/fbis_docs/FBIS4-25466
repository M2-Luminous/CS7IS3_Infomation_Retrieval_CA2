Highlights of the basic policies, announced by MOFTEC Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong at a recent seminar on China's economic reform policies here, are as follows: -- To attract foreign lendings and direct investments by various methods and through various channels. While continuing to accept investments by foreign small and medium-sized enterprises, China will make efforts to attract more direct investments by transnational companies. While using foreign direct investments, the country will continue to apply for foreign loans, especially loans from foreign governments and international financial institutions under favorable terms. -- To continue carrying out the current preferential policies for encouraging foreign direct investment. -- To open more new fields to foreign direct investments. The fields open to foreign investors will be extended from the production sector to the circulation sector, with the opening up of nine new fields, namely, retailing, foreign trade (limited to bonded areas in the beginning), communications and transport, civil aviation, finance, tourism, real estate, culture and education, and social services. Meanwhile, China will further encourage foreign investment in projects related to energy, communications, basic industries and infrastructure, those to introduce advanced foreign technology, upgrade products, cut energy consumption and expand production capacity, those to promote China's exports, those to produce new equipment, new materials and products not available in China, and those to fully or mainly produce exports with major imported raw materials and also without quota limitation. Projects to do harm to social security, national economic development, environment, natural resources and human health will be barred from entering the country. -- To guide foreign investments to expected industries by granting inclined policies for industries, rather than for regions as has been practiced in the past. Foreign-invested technology-intensive projects and new and hi-tech projects that are encouraged by the state and involve large amounts of investment will be offered some domestic markets, so as to make them help upgrade the related domestic industries. -- To improve administration over foreign-invested enterprises.
