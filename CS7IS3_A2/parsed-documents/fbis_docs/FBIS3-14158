Muslim Brotherhood Denounces Clinton's Remarks on Jerusalem HEBRON KILLINGS CONDEMNED, SPEAKERS ASSAIL JEWS, U.S. The 18 March issue of AL-SHA'B continues to report protests against and denunciation of the Hebron killings and denunciation of the Jews and the United States during 'Id al-Fitr prayers in various parts of the country. It devotes part of the front page and all of page 3 to detailed accounts of demonstrations and sermons by Islamic leaders who condemn the "massacre," criticize Arab leaders' weakness, and call for breaking off the negotiations with Israel and for a jihad. The paper notes that security authorities surrounded many of the places of worship and took precautionary measures to guard against further demonstrations in many governorates. Worshipers chanted slogans against the Zionist entity and carried banners demanding revenge against the "criminal Zionists." Islamists took part in demonstrations protesting against the "Jewish delinquency" and weakness of the Islamic rulers. At the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque Square, Socialist Liberal Party [SLP] members and thousands of worshipers chanted slogans against the Jews and demanded that relations with the Zionists be severed. SLP members burned and trampled over the Israeli flag with their shoes and distributed a statement released by the Youths Federation on the "Jewish criminality" and the government's weakness. The Muslim Brothers organized demonstrations in Hulwan, chanting revolutionary slogans against the Jews and their agents. The paper reports that prayers were held in Upper Egypt under the threat of weapons and that the Central Security Forces surrounded the places of worship. In an approximately 270-word report on page 3 about 'Id al-Fitr prayers in Tanta, the paper says over 20,000 worshipers packed the sports stadium in Tanta amid a strict security blockade and that they were joined by women and children. In his sermon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Salamah, professor and dean of the Koran interpretation branch at Umm-al-Qura University in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, focused on the Jews' "treachery" and "affirmed that America is the leader and protector of terrorism in the entire world." He criticized the Security Council and reviewed the tolerance of Islam and the prophet. Over 60,000 worshipers gathered at 'Abd-al-Halim Square, chanting the slogans: "O Jerusalem, we are returning" and "Muhammad's army will return." In an approximately 190-word report on the same page on events in Alexandria by 'Amir 'Id, the author says masses of worshipers staged marches and chanted slogans denouncing the "Zionist carnage," the "languor" of Arab and Islamic regimes, and the Security Council's "collusion." In his sermon, Shaykh Ahmad al-Mahallawi noted the need to apply the Islamic shari'ah and involving Islam in the battle with the Jews. He said that Islam is "inevitably coming" and it will lead the world, provided that "we stick to the injunctions of God's book." He strongly criticized the secularists' domination of intellect and mass media, which make them smear "everything." In western Alexandria, placards denounced the "Zionist massacre" and criticized the government's stance on veiled women and transferring them to desk jobs. Muhammad Hilal files an approximately 240-word report on page 3 on sermons in Kafr al-Shaykh. A mosque imam, Shaykh Faraj Zaki Faraj, denounces the Arabs' "languor toward the Muslim causes, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina and occupied Palestine." The report says the imam asks every worshiper to imagine he has a sister being raped in Bosnia and a brother being killed in Palestine, as was the case in the Hebron massacre, and that everyone should react accordingly. An approximately 260-word report on events in al-Suways on the same page says al-Suways inhabitants lived the night preceding 'Id al-Fitr in a state of fear and panic as police forces deployed in the streets in a provocative manner and that policemen pointed the muzzles of their rifles at passersby. The Hebron massacre was the main theme of 'Id al-Fitr sermons. Islamic preacher Shaykh Hafiz Salamah said the massacre proved that the Arab governments participating in the peace talks are living in a state of "falseness and prevarication." The reports adds: "Shaykh Salamah stressed that jihad is the only way to liberate the Islamic land of Palestine, to establish its independent state, and to avenge the blood of the martyrs who fell as they kneeled before God while performing the dawn prayer." Another 200-word report on the same page from the Aswan correspondent indicates that the security authorities flooded public squares with water, forcing the 'Id al-Fitr speakers to stay away from these squares. In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 2, the paper reports SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speech at the party's conference on 28 Ramadan in which Shukri criticizes the Security Council for being unable to take a stand denouncing the Hebron killings. He criticizes the Egyptian Government, which "trampled over al-Azhar with the feet of its security men who threw bombs at its campus and arrested worshipers just because they wanted to say prayers for the souls of their brother martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque." He also criticizes the government's ban on demonstrations and its "loyalty" to Israel. Discussing domestic issues, Shukri also criticizes the Constitution and government policies. ISRAELI MOSAD ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN MONASTERY ATTACK In an approximately 760-word report on pages 1 and 7 on a recent attack on a Coptic monastery in Upper Egypt, the 18 March edition of AL-SHA'B cites "Asyut leaders" as denouncing the attack and indicating that Israeli Mosad intelligence agency personnel were involved in the incident to foment sectarian feuds between Muslims and Copts. WRITER DENOUNCES MONASTERY ATTACK, ISRAEL, GOVERNMENT POLICY In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 2, the author, Mahfuz 'Azzam, denounces a recent attack on a Coptic monastery in Upper Egypt, discusses the Hebron killings and a recent church bombing in Lebanon, and implicates Israel in the latter incident, citing other writers on the subject. Commenting on the attack on the monastery in Egypt, he says: "In the name of every Muslim in this country, we announce our condemnation of this heinous crime no matter who did it. We emphasize the belief of the SLP and the entire Islamic movement--and indeed all the Muslims in Egypt, parties and groups--that any attack on a church or mosque is an aggression against this nation. We vehemently reject any bigotry against our brother Copts as we reject any bigotry against Muslims." He says that the Israeli Government, "which is established on treachery, aggression, and usurpation of the Palestinian land" has a genuine interest in distracting attention from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque "massacre." He notes that while Israel is engaged in oppression, murder, violence, and terrorism, the president and officials in Egypt declare the need for normalization, dialogue, and peace with Israel despite Israel's countless crimes. This, he adds, takes place at a time when the president and his government refuse the principle of dialogue with the sons of this nation, whom they accused of violating the law and committing violence and terrorism. IRAQI MINISTER SAYS ARABS, MUSLIMS TO BLAME FOR SUFFERINGS Page 4 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 1,500-word report filed by Salah Budaywi on the hardship of the Iraqi people in light of UN sanctions, the high cost of living, soaring prices, and the government's food rationing, citing the views of many ordinary citizens. The correspondent says the Security Council has authorized each individual country in the world to do what it deems fit about releasing Iraqi frozen assets for the purchase of food and medicine and notes that the Arab and Islamic governments should have responded to that resolution and released $4 billion in Iraqi assets frozen at their banks. But, citing Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in response to AL-SHA'B's question, the correspondent says the Arab and Islamic governments regrettably are still ignoring this situation. The Iraqi foreign minister is quoted as saying: "Government leaders, such as those in Spain, Switzerland, and two other European countries, relented and released the Iraqi assets." Therefore, the report continues, he [the Iraqi minister] believes that the main cause of the continuation of the Iraqis' suffering is currently an Arab-Islamic one. SLP OFFICIAL DENOUNCES GOVERNMENT POLICY, DEMANDS CHANGE In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, SLP deputy leader 'Adil Husayn deplores the Egyptian Government's cooperation and "collusion" with the United States and Israel in plots against the Somali and Sudanese peoples. In the introduction, he says: "Rulers in most of the Arab and Islamic countries, of course led by the rulers in Egypt, now publicly and without shame violate the Koran's text. Through their control of the modern media, especially the television, these rulers seek to delude the nation into following their depravity and forgetting God's commandments." He discusses at length the Egyptian Government's contacts and cooperation with Sudanese opposition and the government's stance against an Islamic regime in Sudan, citing the Sudanese opposition's meetings in Cairo and the United States' and other countries' plans to partition Sudan. He says: "We are confident of God's support of the believers and know that the accomplishments in Sudan under the banner of "No god but God" have made Sudan secure in its food and necessary needs. What is more important is that the spirit of jihad has covered the Sudanese nation, which is now able to put up with its affliction." He adds: "With the rush to martyrdom, the Army and the popular defense, which include southerners, now have full control over all the national soil. Therefore, the Westerners have lost their cool and have raised their shrill voice and threats in the past months to intervene directly to partition the south and its surroundings, now that the rebellion has failed to fulfill this mission and the rebellion leaders have taken refuge abroad." Generally he praises the Islamic regime in Sudan and denounces the Egyptian Government's policies toward Somalia and Sudan in collaboration with the United States and Israel. After noting the Egyptian Government's role in Somalia in implementation of "Washington's orders," he addresses that government, saying: "What a bad deal, through which you will lose this world and the world hereafter. But don't ever go near Sudan and conclude a similar deal on it with the United States. If you think you can do something of the sort, I refer you to Almighty God's open commandment and prohibitions. If these injunctions are not obligatory for you, they are binding to us. In the name of these injunctions, our people will not agree to fight Sudan to obey the Americans and the Jews because this nation raises the banner of Islam with all its meanings of piety, strength, and might. This nation will fight you if you seek to embroil it." At one point, he states that the Arabs have lost a great deal through their alliance with the United States in the war against Iraq and that the Gulf States were the first losers. Concluding, the author says that he has written the article on Thursday morning before going to the State Security Prosecution for investigation because, in his words, he is charged with incitement against the government and with trying to bring it down. He says: "I hereby declare to the nation that our entire party admits that it indeed encouraged and will continue to encourage the changing of rulers because this is the only way to improve the situation. There must be a strong and honest government and we want a peaceful change through elections. Do whatever you wish to us but we will continue to do our duty and will not fear your threats. Sufficient unto us is God." MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DENOUNCES CLINTON'S REMARKS ON JERUSALEM An approximately 140-word report on page 7 says that the Muslim Brotherhood has issued a statement denouncing U.S. President Clinton's remarks that Jerusalem will remain the eternal capital of Israel, and emphasizing that Clinton's statements represent a continuation of the "Zionist enemy's" racist settlement policy. The statement says: "The Islamic nations regard with extreme anger the U.S. Administration's stances disparaging the Muslims' right to Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The complete silence of the Islamic world's governments, kings, and presidents is met with bad and bitter responses from the Arab and Islamic peoples." The Muslim Brotherhood, the report says, urged the Islamic nation to denounce the U.S. stance on the Palestinian issue and "show popular anger at that stance, which is partial to the Zionist enemy."
