FR940223-2-00208 FR940223-2-00101 As revised, Principle 3 also allows a college to award student aid on the basis of race or national origin as part of affirmative action to remedy the effects of the school's past discrimination without waiting for a finding to be made by OCR, a court, or a legislative body, if the college has convincing evidence of past discrimination justifying the affirmative action. The Department's Title VI regulations, like the Fourteenth Amendment, do not require that antecedent or contemporaneous findings of past discrimination be made before remedial affirmative action is implemented, as long as the college has a strong basis in evidence of its past discrimination. Allowing colleges to implement narrowly tailored remedial affirmative action if there is strong evidentiary support for it_without requiring that it be delayed until a finding is made by OCR, a court, or a legislative body_will assist in ensuring that Title VI's mandate against discrimination based on race or national origin is achieved. 4. Financial Aid To Create Diversity The Title VI regulations permit a college to take voluntary affirmative action, even in the absence of past discrimination, in response to conditions that have limited the participation at the college of students of a particular race or national origin. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(ii); see 34 CFR 100.5(i). In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, supra, the Supreme Court considered whether the University could take voluntary affirmative action by setting aside places in each medical school class for which only minority students could compete. 7 7 The Court noted that the University ``does not purport to have made'' a determination that its affirmative action plan was necessary to remedy any past discrimination at the medical school. Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 309. The Court considered four rationales provided by the University of California for taking race and national origin into account in making admissions decisions: (1) To reduce the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and the medical profession. (2) To counter the effects of societal discrimination. (3) To increase the number of physicians who would practice in communities lacking medical services. (4) To obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Similar arguments have been advanced in response to the Department's proposed policy guidance on student financial assistance awarded on the basis of race or national origin. The Court rejected the first three justifications. The first reason was rejected as facially invalid because setting aside a fixed number of admission spaces only to ensure that members of a specified race are admitted was found to be racial ``discrimination for its own sake.'' Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307. In rejecting the second contention that the effects of societal discrimination warranted the racial preferences, the Court recognized that the State had a substantial interest in eliminating the effects of discrimination, but that interest was found to be limited to ``redress[ing] the wrongs worked by specific instances of discrimination.'' Id. The third contention, concerning the provision of health care services to underserved communities, was rejected by the Bakke Court as an evidentiary matter because the State had ``not carried its burden of demonstrating that it must prefer members of particular ethnic groups over all other individuals in order to promote better health-care delivery to deprived citizens.'' Id., at 311. With respect to the final objective, the ``attainment of a diverse student body,'' Justice Powell found that_ This clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. Academic freedom, though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment. The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body. Id., at 311, 312. Thus, colleges have a First Amendment right to seek diversity in admissions to fulfill their academic mission through the ``robust exchange of ideas'' that flows from a diverse student body. Id., at 312&hyph;313. 8 However, the means to achieve this ``countervailing constitutional interest'' under the First Amendment must comport with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Medical School's policy of setting aside a fixed number of admission spaces solely for minorities was found not to pass the Fourteenth Amendment's strict scrutiny test, because the policy's use of race as a condition of eligibility for the slots was not necessary to promote the school's diversity interest. Id., at 315&hyph;316. Justice Powell found that the Medical School could advance its diversity interest under the First Amendment in a narrowly tailored manner that passed the Fourteenth Amendment's strict scrutiny test by using race or national origin as one of several factors that would be considered as a plus factor for an applicant in the admissions process. Id., at 317&hyph;319. 8 The Secretary believes that a college's academic freedom interest in the ``robust exchange of ideas'' also includes an interest in the existence of a diverse faculty and, more generally, in diversity of professors nationally, since scholars engage in the interchange of ideas with others in their field, and not merely with faculty at their particular school. A university could contribute to this interest by enrolling graduate students who are committed to becoming professors and who will promote the overall diversity of scholars in their field of study, regardless of the diversity of the students who are admitted to the university's own graduate program. Following the Bakke decision, the Department reexamined its Title VI regulations to determine whether any changes were necessary. In a policy interpretation published in the Federal Register (44 FR 58509), the Department concluded that no change was warranted. The Department determined that the Title VI regulatory provision authorizing voluntary affirmative action was consistent with the Court's decision and that the provision would be interpreted to incorporate the limitations on voluntary affirmative action announced by the Court. 9 Thus, if a college's use of race or national origin in awarding financial aid meets the Supreme Court's test under the Fourteenth Amendment for permissible voluntary affirmative action, it will also meet the requirements of Title VI. 9 The present policy guidance on student financial assistance supplements the 1979 policy interpretation. In the Department's proposed policy guidance on financial aid, a principle was included permitting the use of race or national origin as a ``plus'' factor in awarding student aid. The basis for the principle was the Bakke decision and the Department's assessment that using an approach that had been approved by the Supreme Court as narrowly tailored to achieve diversity in the admissions context also would be permissible in awarding financial aid. 10 10 The Department will presume that a college's use of race or national origin as a plus factor, with other factors, is narrowly tailored to further the compelling governmental interest in diversity, as long as the college periodically reexamines whether its use of race or national origin as a plus factor continues to be necessary to achieve a diverse student body. In response to the proposed policy, many colleges submitted comments arguing that the use of race or national origin as a plus factor in awarding financial aid may be inadequate to achieve diversity. They contended that, in some cases, it may be necessary to designate a limited amount of aid for students of a particular race or national origin. According to those commenters, a college's financial aid program can serve a critical role in achieving a diverse student body in at least three respects: First, the availability of financial aid set aside for members of a particular race or national origin serves as a recruitment tool, encouraging applicants to consider the school. Second, it provides a means of encouraging students who are offered admission to accept the offer and enroll at the school. Finally, it assists colleges in retaining students until they complete their program of studies. The commenters argued that a college_because of its location, its reputation (whether deserved or not) of being inhospitable to minority students, or its number of minority graduates_may be unable to recruit sufficient minority applicants even if race or national origin is considered a positive factor in admissions and the award of aid. That is, the failure to attract a sufficient number of minority applicants who meet the academic requirements of the college will make it impossible for the college to enroll a diverse student body, even if race or national origin is given a competitive ``plus'' in the admissions process. In addition, a college that has sufficient minority applicants to offer admission to a diverse group of applicants may find that, absent the availability of financial aid set aside for minority students, its offers of admission are disproportionately rejected by minority applicants.
