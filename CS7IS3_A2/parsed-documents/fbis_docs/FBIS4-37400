Giant Russian Ilyushin 76 cargo planes carry the weapons via (?Utabani) airport in Bucharest and cross Turkish airspace twice a day, going to Yemen at night and returning empty the next day. According to the sources, the Romanian flights had obtained permission to transport vegetables across Turkish airspace. This has been verified through technological methods by air control units. Since no ban has been imposed on weapons shipments to Yemen, Turkey cannot take any measures to interrupt these flights, the sources said. In another development, AL-ITTIHAD has learned from sources in Cairo that one of the formulas put forward during the meeting in Cairo between the UN secretary general's envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and a north Yemeni delegation was to set up an Arab and Islamic force to supervise the cease-fire under UN auspices. The north Yemeni delegation did not respond to the proposal, requesting to refer it to the government, while the chairman of the southern delegation welcomed it. The paper adds that Brahimi promised to provide UN funds for these troops to give them international status and make the proposal acceptable to all parties concerned.
