First of all, it was Russia's request to the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo. Second, it was the circumstance that the letter was signed by President Yeltsin. Third, it was the fact that it was not just words, but that the proposal and the president's signature were backed by Russia's pledge to send Russian servicemen to Sarajevo in the UN peacekeeping contingent. [Correspondent] Vasiliy Ivanovich, what about the ultimatum? Does it still remain in force, or it can be said that NATO will revise its decision? [Churkin] I do not know what this ultimatum is in general. We are not members of NATO. It is UN troops that are in Sarajevo, not NATO ones, and it is the resolutions of the Security Council that are operating there. I refuse to take into account any time periods or any other elements of any sort of ultimatums. The countdown in Sarajevo now starts from the moment when on Thursday at 1600 the Serbs said that they agree to the Russian proposal and are grateful to Russia that it put forward so bravely and energetically its proposal for the de-blocking of the Sarajevo crisis. [Correspondent] NATO's decision has permitted some reviewers to come to the conclusion that for the first time in recent years a crisis has developed between the young democratic Russia and its partners in the Western alliance, if not a split. [Churkin] I think that there has been no crisis or split as yet. There was a certain episode, a serious one, but one should not dramatize it too much because we are only just learning to carry out equal partnership relations with each other. This episode might turn into a crisis if, in spite of the Russian initiative, NATO takes some kind of reckless, precipitate action that would lead to an exacerbation of the situation in Sarajevo. Well, if somebody made a sudden decision -- and there are people who feel this way in NATO I can say quite frankly -- to carry out air strikes in the area of Sarajevo, then, indeed, we would be faced with a crisis, but for the time being I proceed from the fact that the crisis around Sarajevo will be overcome on the basis of the Russian initiative and we and the NATO states will thus acquire, as a result of this episode -- although it is serious -- important experience in how to build relations with one another.
