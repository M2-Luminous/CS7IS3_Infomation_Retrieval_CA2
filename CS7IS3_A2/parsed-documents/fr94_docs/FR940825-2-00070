Background: A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles. In addition, under an MOU signed in December 1990 with DOE, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. Community involvement is a critical part of ATSDR's and CDC's energy-related research and activities. ATSDR and CDC are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Purpose: The purpose of this public meeting is to update the public on the status of ATSDR's and CDC's community involvement plans, health research, and public health activities and to seek individual advice and recommendations from interested parties concerning these plans. Matters To Be Discussed: Items to be discussed will include: (1) Discussion about the pending charter authorizing the ``Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites.'' (2) Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project findings and implications. Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.
