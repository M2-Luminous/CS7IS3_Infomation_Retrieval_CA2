"But if the volk [people] doesn't vote," Sharon Viljoen tells a caller, "we have nothing". Convincing the volk to vote this month is the uphill battle being waged by the small Freedom Front from its smart new offices in the Pretoria suburb of Lynwood, at public meetings, on the telephone and on "Why you should vote" tape cassettes, available for a donation of R[Rand]5. Relatives make tea and man the phones, and the press secretary straps on his side-arm to double as a bodyguard. The mood of urgent elation infects the group of largely Afrikaner Volksfront defectors -- except perhaps Dr Pieter Mulder, veteran campaigner newly cast from the comfortable, watertight organisation of the Conservative Party [CP]. "No party lists, no voters rolls...It makes me nervous from a profession a point of view. One day, the lines are jammed -- but then, it only takes 20 people to jam the lines." Former AVF [Afrikaner National Front] head and now Freedom Front leader General Viljoen is nervous, too. With no party political background, he cannot appreciate the organisational feat of nine regional offices and a headquarters being set up within a week. Every morning he heads a strategy meeting of his handful of troops and then, as the Front's single greatest asset in this election of personalities, he begins his punishing schedule of between one and three meetings a day. In East Rand towns and beyond, his stern-jawed face adorns every lamppost, courtesy of the at least R400,000 [rand] in election funds the Front has received in terms of the Electoral Act. But, only a few weeks old and tottering to its feet, the Freedom Front is in danger of being hoisted by its own rooi/swartgevaar [red black threat] petard. "We have programmed them for years to see April 27 as doomsday, to believe that to vote is to surrender," says CP MP and now Freedom Front campaign manager Corne Mulder. The Right have also made much capital out of a decades-old fear and mistrust of the "Communist anti-Christ", as the African National Congress is known in these circles. Now the FF has a few weeks in which to convince its followers to vote, and to trust the ANC's word. There are three right-wing approaches to the election, says Dr Mulder: "We can pretend it isn't happening. "Or we can recognise there is a massive tidal wave, 30 stories high, that will hit South Africa 18 days from now. (We can) stand on the beach, put our hands up and say `Stop!'. "Or we can say, how do I use the energy of the wave? To do this I need a surfboard, and I need it fast. "The Freedom Front is that surfboard." [quotation marks as published] Conservative Party MP Tom Langley, top right-wing negotiator and AVF executive member, is a member of the group clinging to the Canute option. But he looks set to climb on the surfboard: Spotted entering General Viljoen's office on Thursday morning, he later concedes he will probably vote -- for the Freedom Front. "My personal opinion is that there is no hope of getting a volkstaat [homeland] before April 27." As General Viljoen tells a meeting in Vereeniging that night: "If there is a volkstaat before April 25, fine. If not, voting is the next best option." As the Freedom Front campaign gathers momentum -- and sheds any association with the neo-Nazi right-wing fringe -- so do the crowds increase. Six hundred at the first meeting in Potchefstroom last week, twice that number if Vereeniging on Thursday. An Iscor executive at the Vereeniging meeting had learned the right-wing lesson well. "I will never vote. It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees." He and thousands of others like him, according to Dr Mulder, cannot get beyond Nelson Mandela's public vow that there will not be a volkstaat -- although Dr Mulder takes ghoulish comfort in the 75-year-old ANC president's rider "in my lifetime." Polls show more than 70 percent of rightwingers are determined to vote -- but not all are convinced the FF is their best option. "I would have considered voting for the CP, the National Party or the Democratic Party," said a Vereeniging pensioner at a Viljoen meeting on Thursday night. "I will listen to the Freedom Front, because I respect the general. But I think a vote for the NP is a stronger vote against the ANC." The Front believes it has in hand a deal which offers not only opposition to the "communist alliance", but the only hope of attaining a volkstaat. Volkstaters this year negotiated crucial amendments to the constitution, allowing for the establishment of a 20-member council whose task will be to convince parliament that a volkstaat is desirable and feasible. No guarantees are given that it will then be established -- but the constitution does specifically provide for any volkstaat boundaries to override provincial boundaries in that event. This constitutional amendment is a window of opportunity granted to the volkstaters; if they do not record enough support on April 27-28, it will close. "If you do not support me, if we do not get massive support, we will get no volkstaat," General Viljoen warned the Vereeniging audience. The only path then open would be the one espoused by rightwingers boycotting the election: insurrection. A 21-one-year-old businessman at Viljoen's meeting, mindful no doubt of the Bophuthatswana execution of Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members, reacted to this option: "If a war starts, I will leave for Holland the next day." To the Freedom Front this national, multiracial election is not a plebiscite of 22-million South Africans, but a referendum of 2.8- million Afrikaners. An accord with the ANC and National Party has been drawn up, allowing special counting procedures at the 1,000-odd polling stations in predominantly white areas, to determine volkstaat support. "The ANC wants to accommodate us -- not because they like us, but they realise that up to 90 percent of the boere [farmers] with a small 'b' are also Boere, capital B," said Dr Mulder. "Our people are the farmers, and the ANC is desperate to ensure food security." For now, his battle is to convince the Right that attaining the dream of a volkstaat is "not just a question of putting up a poster and saying this is our volkstaat".
