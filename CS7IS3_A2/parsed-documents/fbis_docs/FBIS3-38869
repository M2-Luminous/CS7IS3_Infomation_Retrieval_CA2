But it will not be a routine meeting because it will have to reply to the UN secretary general's request to authorize, if necessary, the air strikes which have been under discussion since the Americans suggested resorting to them last August. In addition, it will not have escaped anyone's notice that the EC's Council of Foreign Ministers officially referred the handling of the Bosnian crisis to the alliance. It is true that NATO seems to be the only instrument which can be used if there are to be strikes against targets in Bosnia. But, in the present context, which is that of great pressure being exerted by public opinion following the massacre in the Sarajevo market, it is difficult to avoid the impression that political decisionmaking centers, which still claim to be handling the Bosnian problem, are only too pleased to temporarily pass on the "hot potato" to the alliance. According to a top official, the ambassadors' official meeting this Wednesday (after two days of unofficial contacts and a luncheon for the 16 heads of mission on 8 February) should not give rise to differences of opinion. The preparatory discussions have helped to smooth them over, to the extent that a positive response to Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request is expected. Of course, after publishing in several official communiques their readiness to "launch air strikes," the allies would find it difficult to go back on their promises. London, Ottawa, and even Athens (which on 8 February) flattered itself on having held back the "hysterical improvisations" of the advocates of force) will thus very probably be forced to once again brandish the threat of an air strike. NATO is expected to refuse; but, as a high-ranking diplomat remarked, all aspects of the problem must be taken into consideration. Indeed, there is still a great difference between accepting a state of alert in theory, although this term is not part of alliance jargon, and an actual strike. Therefore, just because NATO gives its formal agreement to placing its forces at the UN secretary general's disposal, that does not mean that the latter will use them. The room to maneuver between these two possibilities remains large; and it is on this that the allies are counting, providing a way out of the embarrassing situation into which the Sarajevo market massacre has placed them. In short, the response of the UN secretary general, whose room to maneuver is reduced because of Moscow's potential veto, could merely be a new transitional stage in a process which has made patience a cardinal virtue. The Western countries hope that the Serbian irregulars will take account of that; moreover, in Atlantic circles, it is stressed that Wednesday's meeting gives nobody the feeling that they are being caught up in a spiral of military action.
