Akifyev, Institute of Chemical Physics imeni N.N. Semenov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 575] [Abstract] Only 7-10% of the DNA in the human genome represents structural genes, regulatory sequences, origins of replication, sequences bound to the nuclear matrix and P-repeats. A theory is proposed that this DNA be regarded as basic genome of the eukaryotic cells. The reason for the excess DNA present in the eukaryotic genome remains enigmatic, but one answer may be that it provides a critical chromatin mass necessary to maintain the structural organization and macromolecular framework for successful mitosis or meiosis. Studies on the human genome could be considerable facilitated and reduced in cost if such efforts were to be solely directed at the basic genome, excluding the non-basic genome from the sequencing efforts.
