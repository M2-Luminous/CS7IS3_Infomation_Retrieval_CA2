State governors agreed with this opinion. The state leaders attended a PRI national dinner to voice their full support for the candidacy of Zedillo Ponce de Leon. They said he was unanimously nominated and that their goal will be victory on 21 August as was the goal under the leadership of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Jalisco State Governor Carlos Rivera Acedes described the decision by the national PRI leadership to nominate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as important. [Begin recording] [Rivera] I think it was important for the National Executive Committee to make this decision. As our candidate Ernesto Zedillo, we too must continue Colosio's campaign and carry on with Colosio's platform. I am sure all PRI members will unite around our party and our candidate Zedillo, and will work intensely to ensure that Colosio's platform is carried on. [Unidentified reporter] Is there merit to [words indistinct] 6 May speech to separate the PRI from the government? [Rivera] Yes, I think that this is definitely one of the principles that should be reinforced. [Reporter] Is Zedillo the most capable? [Rivera] At this time, he is not only the most capable but a person who was close to Colosio. He knew well the principles that candidate Colosio was promoting. [end recording] Guerrero State Governor Ruben Figueroa said Zedillo is a guarantee for victory. He added that Zedillo is as strong and vigorous a horse as Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was. Meanwhile, Maximiliano Silerio Esparza [not further identified] assured that the figure of Luis Donaldo Colosio will help the new campaign for the Presidency. Esparza added that he knew Colosio well, worked very closely with him, and that he has all the respect in the world for the person who was once his party's presidential candidate. He said there will be a very profound campaign and added that he is sure that Colosio will continue helping PRI in this new phase of the presidential campaign. Meanwhile, Puebla State Governor Manuel Bartlett Diaz said a consultation process took place before Zedillo was nominated. He pointed out that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was nominated by generalized consensus. Veracruz State Governor Patricio Chirinos reaffirmed what Bartlett said. He pointed out that Zedillo is a unity candidate. Quintana Roo Governor Mario Villanueva, Morelos Governor Antonio Riva Palacios, Campeche Governor (Jorge Salomon Asad), Tamaulipas Governor Manuel Cabazos, Oaxaca Governor (Diegoro Carrasco), Sonora Governor [name indistinct], and Tlaxcala Governor Antonio Alvarez Lima, among others, made similar statements. The governors were pleased. They agreed that Zedillo's nomination is a logical decision for the campaign strategy. Mario Moya Palencia, former government secretary and current coordinator of the PRI Ideology Commission, pointed out that within the PRI there are no groups disputing power. Proof of this, he added, is that the PRI was able to nominate a replacement, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, six days after the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Moya Palencia described Zedillo as a politician with technical abilities; a man of humble origins who will win the trust of Mexico and the international community. He said that the presidential candidacy of Zedillo will face some risks but they can be overcome. [Begin Moya recording] Presidential candidates run risks. A crazy person could now say let us avenge Colosio by killing another candidate. That is the danger of a violent atmosphere. I think that all of us, especially those involved with the media, must contribute to preventing the emergence of an atmosphere of distrust, violence, and support for armed solutions. [end recording] Mario Moya Palencia also admitted that there will no longer be easy campaigns in Mexico. He pointed out, however, that the historical, sentimental, political, and leadership legacy of Luis Donaldo Colosio, will join Zedillo's campaign. Meanwhile, the PRI labor and peasant sectors pointed out that they have adapted to their party's decision and have voiced with discipline their full support for the presidential candidacy of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. CTM [Confederation of Mexican Workers] President Fidel Velasquez and National Peasant Confederation leader Hugo Andres Araujo agreed that the candidate who replaces Colosio guarantees PRI unity and that PRI will triumph on 21 August. Araujo added that Zedillo is a courageous and energetic PRI member who has a great willingness to continue the ideological project of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Velasquez agreed with Araujo. He said that for the organized labor movement Zedillo represents continuity of Colosio's ideas. The CTM leader added that, like Colosio, Zedillo will be the candidate of the country's working class. These were some of the reactions given at the PRI National Headquarters after the PRI national leadership nominated Ernesto Zedillo as their presidential candidate.
