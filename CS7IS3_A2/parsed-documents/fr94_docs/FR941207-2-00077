The Applicant was organized as a corporation under Maryland law on April 21, 1983 and dissolved as such on April 7, 1993. 2. On June 14, 1983, Applicant filed a registration statement under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act and, on February 21, 1984, registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified investment management company. Also on June 14, 1983, Applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, registering an indefinite number of shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value. This registration statement was declared effective on February 21, 1984. The initial public offering commenced February 21, 1984. 3. Applicant's only security holder was Phoenix Home Life Separate Account B (``Account B''). On August 5, 1992, Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved the transfer of Applicant's assets and liabilities to Separate Account P (``Account P'') of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company (``Phoenix-Home Life''). Account B and its depositor, Phoenix-Home Life, voted all outstanding shares in favor of the reorganization, constituting more than two-thirds of the shares outstanding that was required under Maryland law. 4. As of October 23, 1992, Applicant has one class of Common Stock outstanding, consisting of 1,239,689.6517 outstanding shares. The aggregate net asset value of such shares and the net asset value per share were $13,615,073.83 and $10,9856, respectively. 5. On October 26, 1992, Applicant's assets, consisting only of qualified plan assets, were transferred to Account P, which contains only qualified plan assets. Account B became a contractholder of Account P. Account B and Account P were not required to be registered under the 1940 Act in reliance on Section 3(c)(11) thereunder. In consideration for the transfer, Account P assumed all of Applicant's liabilities and delivered to Applicant full and fractional units of Account P equal to that number of full and fractional units of Account P as determined based on the relative net asset values of Applicant and Account P as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 23, 1992 (the last business day preceding the reorganization). Applicant distributed Account P units pro rata to Account B and simultaneously Applicant's shares held by Account B were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer of assets. 6. No assets were retained by Applicant after October 26, 1992, and no debts or other liabilities of Applicant remain outstanding. Applicant has no security holders to whom distributions in complete liquidation have not been made. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. 7. Phoenix-Home Life, the parent company to the Adviser and depositor of Account B and Account P, paid all of the direct and indirect expenses of the reorganization, including any brokerage fees relating to transactions resulting from the reorganization. 8. Other than as described above, during the past 18 months, Applicant has not, for any reason, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant. 9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 10. Applicant has made all filings under the 1940 Act, including Form N&hyph;SAR filings, for each period for which such filings were required.
