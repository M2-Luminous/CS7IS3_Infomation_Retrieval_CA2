The Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic, announcing the planned boycott request on Dutch television, said it would go out mainly to Muslim countries. Mr. Secirbegovic said that the Bosnian Muslims feel betrayed by Western countries that make pledges but fail to translate them into action. The Bosnian ambassador said the international boycott must be directed against countries that obstruct military intervention.
