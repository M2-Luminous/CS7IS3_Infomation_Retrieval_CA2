According to the report, the Foreign Office received a proposal a few days ago that the next round of India-Pakistan talks be held at the prime minister level instead of at the foreign secretary level. Pakistan has welcomed this proposal conditionally and said that it is ready for the proposed dialogue provided the Kashmir issue is placed on the top of the agenda. However, available report indicates that India wishes to hold discussions only on the Siachen Glacier issue. At the same time, New Delhi has also suggested that Pakistan should not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at the September session of the UN General Assembly. Talking to the JANG, the Pakistan foreign secretary rightly said that our stand on India-Pakistan dialogue is crystal clear. We do not have any objection in principle to the talks, but India will have to fulfill four preconditions to create a conducive atmosphere for the dialogue. The preconditions are: India should reduce the number of troops deployed in Kashmir, dismantle all the bunkers built by the Indian forces around the Hazratbal Shrine, release all the detained Kashmiri leaders, and allow the representatives of the international human rights organizations to visit occupied Kashmir. The conditions set by Pakistan are very appropriate and practicable and any high-level dialogue will be useless if these conditions are not met. In the past, Pakistan accepted many Indian proposals and held negotiations in a spirit of goodwill, but, as everybody knows, all those rounds of discussions remained fruitless solely because of India's refusal to create even the slightest flexibility in its stand on the Kashmir question. Six rounds of foreign minister-level talks were held on the Kashmir issue in 1962. At that time, India agreed to enter into negotiations on Kashmir because it was facing enormous pressure due to its border war with China and all the Western countries had also asked Pakistan not to create more difficulties for India, which, as a quid pro quo, would hold talks with Islamabad to resolve the Kashmir dispute. The eyes of the entire Western world were set on the rounds of discussions that were being held between Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Sardar Swaran Singh, and there was pressure on India to make those talks successful and meaningful. Even then, India could not adopt the path of justice and propriety. Seven more rounds of foreign secretary-level talks have been held in the recent past, but all of them have been meaningless. After the three-day talks in January 1994, India invited Pakistan to hold another round of dialogue, but Pakistan had made it clear that, in spite of being a principled supporter of negotiations, it could not go on holding fruitless discussions. The Foreign Office has thus far not confirmed the receipt of any official invitation from India for the prime minister-level talks, but if India is really interested in negotiations, then it must, first of all, agree to place the Kashmir issue on the top of the agenda of such talks. It must also accept the four preconditions set by Pakistan to create a congenial atmosphere for the talks, because it is not possible for Pakistan to sit around a negotiating table with India while New Delhi continues its oppression and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India will have to give some proof that it is sincere in holding talks and is ready to adopt the path of justice. If the Government of Pakistan receives any formal invitation from India for a dialogue at any level, then it should remain steadfast on the aforementioned preconditions and should not engage itself in negotiations that are not going to yield any positive results. Likewise, Pakistan should also not give any assurances that it will not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at the next UN General Assembly session. India's behavior in the past has not left any room for any wishful thinking on our part and we should not follow a shadow by continuing the process of fruitless negotiations.
