[Fujii] We are in a very delicate stage. Economic indicators in some areas are good; in other areas, they are not so good. We need to make the economy grow for we are at an important stage. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget will be delayed. [Fujii] It should not have a negative impact on people's everyday life. I will ask the Diet to start budget deliberations as soon as possible. I know we have a system which is supplementary to a tentative budget. However, it is too early for us to talk about it now. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The minority ruling government needs the cooperation of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to achieve tax reform. [Fujii] A considerable number of people are beginning to understand that we have no choice but to reduce the income tax and substantiate the consumption tax in order to prepare for an aging society. We are beginning to share common views with the SDPJ. We have no choice but to seek the understanding of the people and the parties. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you no think that a compromise, such as changing the consumption tax to welfare tax, is needed for the coalition to achieve the other parties' understanding? [Fujii] Many people protested against an earmarked tax [mokuteki zei] when the consumption tax was introduced. Many are still against it. We may use the revenue from this tax mainly for welfare services, but I do not know about an earmarked tax. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think administrative reform is needed to increase taxes? [Fujii] We have been seriously trying to achieve administrative reform. The ruling parties are still meeting on it. I hope they will come up with concrete ideas and not abstract plans. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about foreign exchange markets? [Fujii] The fundamental of foreign exchange is to reflect the fundamentals [as published]. This was confirmed at a meeting of the finance ministers and central bank presidents from the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is the appreciation of the yen natural because the trade surplus is a fundamental? [Fujii] I do not think so. The trade surplus is merely one item. I am sure the interest rate level, economic trends, and unemployment rates are also fundamentals. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to tackle the Japan-U.S. framework talks? [Fujii] It is important for us to get the economic recovery back on track by promoting the current economic management plans in order to settle the issue. It is also important for international society to seek economic harmony. We have been trying to ease regulations regarding insurance and financial services. In addition, we also need to ease other regulations as well to act in harmony with international society.
