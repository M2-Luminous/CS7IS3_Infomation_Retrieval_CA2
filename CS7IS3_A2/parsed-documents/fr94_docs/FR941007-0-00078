FR941007-0-00078 FR941007-0-00023 Response: Blocking all QS was considered along with the Modified Block Proposal in the Analysis (see Sitka Block Alternative and Full/Partial Block Alternative). The Council selected the Modified Block Proposal from among the other block proposals because: (1) Like the other block alternatives, it prevented excessive consolidation of QS; and (2) unlike the other block alternatives, it did not interfere with the opportunities currently available to larger operations in the fixed-gear Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries by blocking all QS. The guidelines for FMPs at 50 CFR 602.14 (national standard 4_Allocations) indicates that total parity in allocations is not necessary to comport with fairness and equity. Allocation decisions by the Council may be fair and equitable if those decisions are justified in terms of the objectives of the FMP amendment. The Modified Block Proposal was designed to preserve the way of life for fishermen and their families and the dependence of local communities on the fishery, which are legitimate social factors provided in the guidelines and identified by the Council. Furthermore, the Modified Block Proposal does not discriminate between residents of different states, which is the standard specified at ยง602.14(b). Comment 4: The Modified Block Proposal is inequitable because persons who were initially issued QS who owned/leased large vessels will receive most of their QS unblocked, allowing them to purchase more QS up to the use cap. Persons who were initially issued QS, however, who owned/leased small vessels will be issued their QS in blocks, preventing them from purchasing QS up to the use cap. Response: As explained in the response to Comment 3, the Modified Block Proposal is not inequitable under the guidelines in 50 CFR part 602. Furthermore, although the Modified Block Proposal restricts the number of QS blocks that can be held by a person (up to two blocks per species and area), it does not prevent a person from purchasing QS up to the use cap. For example, if a person is initially issued QS in a block, that person, like a person who was initially issued unblocked QS, can purchase unblocked QS up to the use cap. Comment 5: The Modified Block Proposal creates a monopoly that violates the anti-trust laws. The IFQ Program should be administered under a ``free market'' system. Gear restrictions, rather than limited access, should be used to manage the resource. Response: The Modified Block Proposal does not create a monopoly, nor does it violate anti-trust laws. The Modified Block Proposal was designed to reduce consolidation by ensuring that more persons would hold QS under the Modified Block Proposal than may have held QS without it. The consolidation that may have occurred without the Modified Block Proposal could be more accurately characterized as a process that tends toward monopolistic control of the resource. QS, whether blocked or unblocked, is a harvest privilege that may be transferred. The value of transferred QS is not limited by the program. The value of QS will be determined by market forces, and, therefore, the IFQ Program is administered under a ``free market'' approach. Although gear restrictions can assist in managing a fishery, effective management requires a holistic approach. The IFQ Program is one of the many management tools used by NMFS to manage effectively the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries. Comment 6: The Modified Block Proposal will create different classes of QS holders depending on how much QS each person is issued. The restrictions on the amount of blocks that can be held, along with the various sizes of blocks, may necessitate the use of brokerage firms to facilitate transfers. Response: The Modified Block Proposal does not create different classes of QS holders. As explained in the response to Comment 1, the Modified Block Proposal establishes the criteria for determining whether QS will be blocked and unblocked. A person, if issued QS in a block, is not prohibited from obtaining unblocked QS. The transferable nature of QS will allow persons to hold blocked and/or unblocked QS, as long as the other requirements on holding QS are met. The Modified Block Proposal may increase QS transaction costs because some persons (i.e., those who already hold the maximum blocks allowed) will be required to transfer away one block before another block can be transferred to them. This cost may be exacerbated if the person who is making this transaction has a specific QS amount as a target. The Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal contemplated and addressed this increase in transaction costs for transfers. NMFS concluded from the Analysis that the benefits of curbing excessive consolidation outweighed the increase of transaction costs for transfers.
