The ticket is headed by Fernando Pino Solanas, followed by Mary Sanchez, Carlos Auyero, and Juan Pablo Cafiero. The center-left alliance delayed the release of its candidates' ticket due to a controversy that arose especially over the third place, which was sought by "Juampi" Cafiero, Auyero, and the People's Encounter [Encuentro Popular] party. The two first places on the ticket and the merits of Juan Pablo Cafiero (one of the FG constitutional reform bill's drafters) were not objected to by anyone. The problem was that, according to some leaders, the FG ticket had a heavy Peronist bias with "Juampi" in third place, and the pluralist composition advocated by the FG people was therefore reduced. Afterward, there were tugs of war between the People's Encounter and the New Progressive Space [Nuevo Espacio Progresista] leaders. The New Progressive Space leaders finally managed to place Auyero in the third place. In addition to having a long political record, Auyero is a constitutional law professor. Auyero is followed by Maria Ines Brasesco from the Union of Argentine Women, Dario Torres Molinas from the People's Encounter, and Gustavo Cardessa from the Christian Democratic Party.
