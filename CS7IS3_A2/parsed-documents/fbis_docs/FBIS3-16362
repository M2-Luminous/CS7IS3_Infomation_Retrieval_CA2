This was announced by Viktor Yerin, head of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, at a scheduled news briefing there yesterday. According to the minister, this program has been elaborated on Boris Yeltsin's personal instructions with all Russian ministries and agencies taking part in putting it together. In Mr. Yerin's words, it has a fundamentally new nature, and it is not going to end up in mid-air, as has happened more than once. The program is to be financed mainly by ministries and agencies (with virtually all taking part in it), each taking care of its own sphere. All in all nearly 2 trillion rubles at current prices would be required to implement it.
