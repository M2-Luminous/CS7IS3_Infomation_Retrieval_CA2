"Privatizations are compatible with a government of the right or of the left," Ciampi said in a public television interview, adding that two positive results will come from privatizations: "improved company management and the creation of a wider financial market, which this country needs." The state will not "disappear" from the economic field, Ciampi said: "it will remain part of the economy because it's good for the state to be present in some sectors and because it is the state that sets rules and enforces the rules, leaving the private sector free to work within these rules." Deregulation, according to Ciampi, means "greater freedom to operate, not the total abandonment of all rules." Ciampi stressed that the central bank must retain its autonomy and that the government must provide "direction and guarantees." Turning back to privatizations, Ciampi said that when his government was formed in spring 1993, there had been talk of privatizations for years but that nothing had been done. Now they are under full steam, he claimed, citing the sale of Comit, Credit and part of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property], and plans for the sale of STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] and SME, as well as part of the steel sector. He also predicted that fiscal pressure would drop one percent this year.
