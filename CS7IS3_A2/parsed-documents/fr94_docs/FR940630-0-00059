FR940630-0-00059 FR940630-0-00018 The original proposal provided for installation of equipment that would permit operation of the span by authorized railroad personnel at either portal of the bridge. C&NW has decided to omit the ``portal'' controls, since, should it be necessary to lower the span at the bridge site, the span could be operated from the bridge house on top of the span, or from the signal bungalow south of the bridge. If the span is operated from either bridge site location, the span would not be lowered until the 10-minute warning period, including voice announcements, had been completed, and the local operator had confirmed, either visually or by radiotelephone, that no boats were under or approaching the bridge. Based on the owner's response to comments on the remote operation of this bridge, the Coast Guard is publishing the requirements as proposed. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because a sample group of Illinois River users have expressed no objection to the proposal. Small Entities After considering the submitted comments, the Coast Guard finds that any impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this temporary rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism Assessment The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has reviewed the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of the NEPA Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation because promulgation of changes to drawbridge regulations have been found to not have a significant effect on the human environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
