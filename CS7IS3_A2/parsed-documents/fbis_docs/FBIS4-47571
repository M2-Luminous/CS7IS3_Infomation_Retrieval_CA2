The studies were conducted in order to clarify peculiarities of transplantation immunity after the transplantation of fetal bone with transplant revascularization. It was determined that in all three recipients transplantation of fetal bone tissue of the 23rd to 24th week of gestation with microsurgical revascularization in the recipient zone had not been accompanied by rejection of bone tissue. Immunologic monitoring data were correlated with indices of clinic, laboratory and histologic studies. References 9: 5 Russian, 4 Western.
