The waste stems from chemicals, paint residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be made answerable for it, because the relevant legislation contains loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared. The toxic waste, which Germany is getting back "after long talks," is to be handed over at the Austro-German border. Storage and transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks. In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste to other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562 tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said Schulze-Rickmann, the general manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal of Special Waste, yesterday. In addition, there were several hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were disposed of by producers internally.
