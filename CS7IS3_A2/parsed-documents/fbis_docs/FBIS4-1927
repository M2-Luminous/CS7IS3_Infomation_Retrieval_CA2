The city has offered many kinds of techniques to help local ventures, through technical cooperation or setting up joint ventures, officials in Tianjin said. The Tianjin "Dengta" paint factory, for instance, offered technical help to Xingshan County paint factory in Hubei Province and upgraded the local factory's annual production capability from 1,500 tons to 5,000 tons. That has brought considerable economic returns for local people. With techniques from Tianjin, automobile and steel joint companies have also been established in local areas around the Three Gorges. So far, some 22 projects have been completed. Tianjin was designated in 1992 by the State Council to help 16 counties and regions in Sichuan and Hubei provinces around the Three Gorges areas, where the world's highest dam will be built on the Chang Jiang river. More than a million local residents will be resettled.
