Ljubodrag Stojadinovic warned on Sunday. Col. Stojadinovic said on a Hungarian radio programme that the Bosnian Serbs had no reason why to join the "inconceivable Croat-Muslim federation," which the V.J. spokesman said would not last long. Col. Stojadinovic said that the setting up of the federation would mark a step backwards, that is, a return to how things were when war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The war broke out in 1992 after the Muslim-Croat coalition took a decision on the forcible secession of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the then Yugoslav Federation against the wishes of the Bosnian Serbs and contrary to the republican Constitution which specified that all vital decisions required the consensus of all three peoples in the republic. The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina proclaimed the Serb Republic (R.S.) in 1992 on their historical and ethnic territories. Col. Stojadinovic said that it was the duty of the V.J. to defend the territory and air space of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, at the same time, carefully to follow what was taking place in the immediate neighbourhood, particularly where the Serb people lives. The spokesman said that the V.J. expected the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina to be resolved peacefully, but was ready for the worst, although it felt that the R.S. and neighbouring republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), the Serb state within the administrative boundaries of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, could alone defend themselves. Col. Stojadinovic repeated the official V.J. statement that the four planes downed over Bosnia-Herzegovina early in the week were not part of its air force and that no V.J. pilots were at the time in the area where NATO fighter-bombers had taken action. The incident is quite mysterious, since it occurred in an area where the Bosnia Muslims and Croats are engaged in mutual fighting, Col. Stojadinovic said. He said that NATO representatives should provide the answer to the question whose the downed planes were. Col. Stojadinovic said there would be no danger if the airfield near Tuzla, in north-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, was to be used strictly for humanitarian purposes, but specified that there would be a real danger if the airfield was to be opened by force. The Bosnian Serbs and Russia reached an agreement in the middle of the week for Russian observers to check all deliveries arriving at the Muslim-held airfield near Tuzla. The Serb side has insisted on the control of the air deliveries out of fear that the airfield could be used for illegal munitions shipments to the Bosnian Muslims.
