The territorial structure changed, in particular, as a consequence of trading with the Slovak Republic, where, during the first three months of 1994, the tendency toward a gradual decline in mutual trade began to manifest itself. The measures adopted by the Slovak Government, which consisted of introducing an import surcharge and tightening legislative and technical conditions for imports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, were reflected in a reduction in mutual turnover. In imports, the proportion of mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials increased, while the proportion of machinery and means of transportation declined. In exports, the proportion of various finished products increased, while the proportion of machinery and means of transportation declined. The overall foreign trade turnover in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same period of last year, increased by 4.8 percent; of this, imports rose by 15.9 percent, but exports fell by 4.3 percent. The value of overall imports amounted to 83.3 billion korunas [Kc] and was Kc11.5 billion higher than in the first three months of 1993. The overall value of exports amounted to Kc85 billion, which was Kc3.8 billion less. The balance of trade ended with a surplus of Kc1.7 billion. From the territorial point of view, states with an advanced market economy took a 60.8-percent share in overall foreign trade turnover (European Union [EU] states--42.8 percent and members of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] 12.3 percent). The Slovak Republic took a 15.2-percent share, the countries of the former Soviet Union 10.3 percent, developing countries 7.3 percent, European states with a transitional economy (excluding the countries of the former USSR) 5.6 percent, and states with a state trading system 0.8 percent. In trade with the Slovak Republic, the value of imports in the first quarter amounted to Kc12.5 billion, which was Kc2.5 billion less than in the same period of last year, and the value of exports amounted to Kc13.2 billion--that is, Kc6.6 billion less. Imports declined to 83.4 percent of the level of the first quarter of 1993, and exports declined to 66.5 percent. The balance of trade had a surplus of Kc0.7 billion. Ties established within the former CSFR, when a substantial part of the exchange of goods was accounted for by complementary shipments, are still being reflected in the mutual exchange of goods. However, they are becoming gradually weaker. In the mutual exchange of raw and processed materials and goods, industrial goods were predominant, with a 37-percent share of overall imports and a 31-percent share of overall exports, while machinery and means of transportation had a 20-percent share of overall imports and a 26-percent share of overall exports. Imports from states with an advanced market economy in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the previous year, rose by 23.3 percent, and exports to these states rose by 12.2 percent. The rise in imports, compared with the same period of last year, amounted to Kc9.2 billion, and the rise in exports amounted to Kc5.9 billion. The balance of trade had a surplus of Kc5.2 billion. The trade surplus with EU countries amounted to Kc4.4 billion and with the EFTA member states to Kc1.3 billion. The most important trading partner from these countries was the Federal Republic of Germany, with a 26.1-percent share of the Czech Republic's overall foreign trade turnover. It was followed by Austria (8.6 percent) and Italy (4.8 percent). In imports from states with an advanced market economy, machinery and means of transportation were predominant (42 percent of all of the goods and materials imported); in exports, industrial goods were predominant, with a 30-percent share of overall exports. Czech trade with OECD states flourished; imports from these countries during the first quarter amounted to Kc48.6 billion, and, compared with the same period of last year, had increased by 23 percent; exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion and had increased by 13.8 percent. The balance of trade had a deficit of Kc6.3 billion. Imports from developing countries increased by 28.4 percent, and, compared with the first three months of 1993, exports to these regions increased by 28.8 percent; the balance of trade ended with a surplus of Kc3.4 billion. Machinery and means of transportation accounted for 37 percent of imports, and foodstuffs and live animals accounted for 32 percent. Industrial goods accounted for 59 percent of exports and machinery, and means of transportation accounted for 29 percent. The so-called Asian Tigers--Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia--have become interesting trading partners. These countries had only a 4.4-percent share of overall Czech foreign trade turnover, but the exchange of goods with them is increasing dynamically; imports rose by 44.3 percent and exports by 71.4 percent. In trade with the European states with a transitional economy, excluding the former Soviet Union, imports rose by 32.7 percent and exports declined by 10.5 percent. The balance of trade achieved a surplus of Kc0.6 billion. The largest trading partner from this group was Poland, with a 2.9-percent share of overall foreign trade turnover; it was followed by Hungary, whose share amounted to 1.5 percent. Industrial goods, with a 32-percent share of overall exports, and machinery and means of transportation, with a 21-percent share, made up the bulk of goods exported from the Czech Republic to these countries. The surplus generated in trade with states with a state trading system--the DPRK, Laos, China, Cuba, Vietnam, and Mongolia--amounted to Kc0.3 billion. The volume of imports from these states was 44.2 percent higher than in the first quarter of 1993; of course, exports declined to a mere fifth of the level during the same period of the previous year. This development was a result of the equally large decline in the value of exports to China. The dominant items in overall imports were various finished products (almost 50 percent); in exports, they were machinery and means of transportation (82 percent). Imports from the former Soviet Union increased by 25.1 percent; however, exports declined to 80.3 percent of the level of the first three months of 1993. The balance of trade deficit amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner from this group of countries was Russia with a 13.8-percent share of overall imports; however, it had only a 3.2-percent share of overall exports. In the structure of imports according to the categories of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials were predominant because oil and natural gas come into this category. The share of this category of goods in overall imports was 78 percent. The largest goods category in exports was machinery and means of transportation, which had more than a 35-percent share of overall exports. In the structure of imports according to the categories of goods, in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same period of last year, the share of imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials rose by 1.5 points to 15.5 percent of overall imports. During the first three months of 1994, 1.7 million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes in the same period of the previous year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas (1.7 billion cubic meters) were imported. The share of imports of various finished products increased by 0.9 points to 11.1 percent, and the share of chemicals and related products increased by 1.6 points to 12.9 percent. The share of imports of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points to 30.3 percent, and the share of industrial goods declined by 1.6 points to 15.7 percent. During the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same period of last year, imports in all categories of goods increased, apart from the beverages and tobacco categories. The structure of exports according to the categories of goods in the first three months of 1994 was, compared with the same period of last year, characterized by an increase in the share of exports of various finished products by 3.0 points to 15.2 percent of overall exports. On the other hand, the share of exports of machinery and means of transportation declined by 2.4 points to 23.7 percent. The share of exports of the most significant items, 31.8 percent of which were accounted for by industrial goods, declined slightly. Compared with the first three months of 1993, exports in all categories declined, with the exception of the raw-materials category, excluding fuels and raw materials for the food industry and the various finished goods category.
