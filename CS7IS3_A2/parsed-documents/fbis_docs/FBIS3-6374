Pyongyang earlier sent officials to study China's coastal economic zones, who came to realize that the current Najin-Sonbong free trade zone on the northeastern coast was too regionally closed and less attractive to foreign investors due to insufficient infrastructure, according to a report by the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (Kotra) representative in Beijing. Instead, the North Koreans are expected to designate the northwestern coast bewtween Nampo and Sinuiju, which is adjacent to China, as a new economic zone. North Korea has already started moving residents near the Amnok River and Sinuiju and is preparing to build a railway linking the far Western coastal city with Pyongyang. The Stalinist country is expected to announce the opening of the two port cities on Sept. 9, timed with its 46th anniversary. Once Sinuiju and Nampo are named a free economic zone, the area is likely to draw more foreign investment than the Najin-Sonbong zone in the initial stage, Kotra officials said. The Najin-Sonbong zone is expected to be developed as a center for export-oriented industry and entrepot trade, while the Sinuiju-Nampo area will be promoted as a complex for light industry, the officials said.
