Iturria was elected Durazno mayor twice. He resigned as Durazno mayor late last year to become interior minister, replacing Juan Andres Ramirez, who will be the ruling party's candidate to replace President Luis Alberto Lacalle. Iturria said he would remain in his post until Lacalle appoints his replacement. The Interior Ministry will control domestic security and guarantee the normal development of the elections scheduled for 29 November.
