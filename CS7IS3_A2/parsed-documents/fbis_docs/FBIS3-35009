In its appeal to Washington, Israel is asking that the U.S. Administration guarantee that the understandings reached with Syria, which ended Operation Accountability, are upheld. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: [Begin Raz recording] Last night, Israel signaled -- which may be an understatement -- the gravity with which it regards the katyusha shelling early Wednesday [16 February]. In addition to the sharply worded announcement, which I will read out in a minute, Israel called on the United States to guarantee what it called the understandings that led to the conclusion of Operation Accountability and attempted to convey through Washington the gravity with which it regards the violation of the understandings. The Israeli request was sent to the highest echelons in Washington through several channels. According to what is known, the katyusha was fired by a Palestinian organization called 13 Black September, but Israel says the shelling could not have been carried out without an understanding with Hizballah, thereby pointing an accusing finger at other elements. Operation Accountability ended in response to a U.S. effort to bring about a cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher intervened personally with Israel and Syria to achieve the agreement. Israel's interpretation, therefore, is that the understandings were achieved with Syria, which is responsible for maintaining them. The Jerusalem statement says: The highest security elements take a grave view of the katyusha shelling at Israeli soil, which violates the understandings that led to the conclusion of Operation Accountability. That is the signal and that is the Israeli position in the wake of the katyusha fired before dawn on Wednesday. [end recording] Israeli delegates also relayed a similar protest to the Syrian and Lebanese representatives to the Washington peace talks. Our Washington correspondent Arye Golan reports: [Begin Golan recording] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, head of the Israeli delegation, reminded his Syrian counterpart, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, that although Syria is not directly responsible for the incident, it was a party to the August 1993 agreement between Israel and Lebanon, signed under U.S. auspices following Warren Christopher's mediation. Uri Lubrani, head of the delegation to the talks with Lebanon, demanded from his counterpart, Suhayl Shammas, that Lebanon restrain Hizballah in order to prevent a deterioration in the situation along the northern border. Professor Rabinovich explained to the head of the Syrian delegation the importance of public diplomacy. He said that we know that in its Hebrew-language broadcasts, Damascus Radio uses the term normal peace relations, but that is not enough because these broadcasts do not have many listeners in Israel. On the other hand, he criticized Damascus' refusal to permit Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah to pay a condolence visit to Syria following the death of President al-Asad's son. Had he been permitted entry, Amb. Rabinovich said, it would have been a true gesture, but the Syrians did not use the opportunity to show their good intentions. Al-'Allaf complained about Israeli charges that Syria is making do with a powerless and relatively unimportant pensioner like himself as its representative at the talks. The day, therefore, passed in an exchange of recriminations. [end recording]
