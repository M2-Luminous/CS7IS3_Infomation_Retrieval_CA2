The rally was to have been dedicated to defending the people's standard of living and preparing for the second all-Russian day of protest on 14 April. Even though Moscow's Taganskiy district court just a week ago ruled as illegal any ban on holding such meetings, the press center statement says, the cochairman of the interregional strike committee Sergey Skvortsov was detained and taken to militia station No. 10.
