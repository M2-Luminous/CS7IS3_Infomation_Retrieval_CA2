Sources close to the State Council said the decision was partly motivated by the political consideration of maintaining social stability and preventing unemployment. They said Mr Zhu was also anxious to improve his image with state entrepreneurs and regional cadres, two power blocs that would have a say in the post-Deng Xiaoping succession struggle. The sources quoted the vice premier as indicating that credit policy for the "circulation funds" of industrial enterprises could be relaxed in spite of the ongoing fight against inflation. Mr Zhu said even enterprises losing money should be extended credit "if the funds are being used for the production of goods that can be sold" and if the firms can guarantee loan repayment. "Banks should dispense loans to help maintain the basic living expenses of employees in money-losing enterprises," Mr Zhu said. However, he called upon local governments to cover some of the expenses for paying the under-employed, saying the centre and localities "must join hands in maintaining social stability". Mr Zhu was adamant that funds would not be given to enterprises that had no hope of being turned around and that such units should be declared bankrupt. But he said bankruptcy should only be tried on an experimental basis to avoid social disruption. He has also given instructions that credit be provided for solving the problem of "triangular debts" or money enterprises owe each other. XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) reported last night various ministries and banks would join hands to clear up debts in sectors including coal, metallurgy, electricity, petrochemicals, and lumber. Funds would also be made available for the two hardest hit provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning. Economic analysts said the relaxation of credit could fuel inflation, which the semi-official China News Service described as "still high." The agency said fixed assets investment by state firms in April was 44.2 percent over the same month last year, which was eight percent more than the comparable figure for the first three months of the year. Moreover, from January to April, losses incurred by state-owned enterprises increased by 62.6 per cent over the same period in 1993. The analysts said while pumping money into such enterprises could solve the temporary problem of decreasing unemployment, the measure might exacerbate the budget deficit and fuel inflation without achieving the long-term goal of improving efficiency. Chinese sources said various local governments had resisted Beijing's call that they dig into local budgets to relieve the plight of the unemployed.
