FR941207-2-00061 FR941207-2-00047 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,951] Saft Aerospace Batteries, A Division of Saft America Gainesville, Florida; Formerly Gates Aerospace Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc.; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification notice was issued on September 2, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631&hyph;2). At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation findings show that the Gates Aerospace Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc., was the predecessor-in-interest firm. Many of the workers had unemployment insurance (UI) taxes paid under the former firm. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect this matter. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,951 is hereby issued as follows: ``All workers of Saft Aerospace Batteries, Gainesville, Florida, a division of Saft America (formerly Gates Aerospace Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc., Gainesville, Florida) who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after January 1, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, D.C., this 22nd day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
