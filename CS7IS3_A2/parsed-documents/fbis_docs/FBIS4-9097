FBIS4-9097 "dreeu077_p_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 POLAND Approval of TV Council's Report Postponed Approval of TV Council's Report Postponed LD2004224394 Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish 1900 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004224394 Warsaw TV Polonia Network Polish BFN [Speakers identified by caption] [Text] After a three-hour debate on the annual report by the National Broadcasting and Television Council [KRRiT], the Sejm Culture Commission decided it would not decide today on whether or not to approve it. The deputies decided they would do this only after the constitutional tribunal has ruled whether the president is entitled to dismiss the chairman of the council. The deputies did not clarify if the approval of the report would depend on whether the post was held by Marek Markiewicz or Ryszard Bender. [Zofia Kedziora] It is a total disaster, complained SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] Deputy Izabella Sierakowska about public television. She asked members of the council how they appraised their decision to appoint as head of public television Wieslaw Walendziak, who, according to the deputy's perception, was to have been a wunderkind of the council. [Deputy Izabella Sierakowska] I must say with regret that this child of yours has not been a success at all. [Marek Markiewicz, KRRiT] I do not know, I do not feel too comfortable in the area of obstetrics. I find it hard to say whether the child, in the form of Chairman Walendziak, has been a success, especially in the third month since its birth. [Kedziora] Marek Markiewicz believes that it will be possible to appraise the television only after some time, once the effects of the recent transformations become visible. Deputy Jerzy Wuttke accused the council of making PolSat a monopolist by awarding it the franchise. This is contrary to legislation. Before the council members replied, Deputy Wenderlich from the SLD asked whether the view expressed by the preceding speaker had been his own, that of the BBWR [Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms], or the Belweder's. [Deputy Jerzy Wenderlich] This occurred to me when Deputy Wuttke said with apparent regret that the president's positive role was to all intents and purposes mentioned in only one sentence. [Kedziora] According to Marek Markiewicz, for the moment, the only monopolist is public television, and only a national station can compete with it. [Ryszard Miazek, KRRiT] We face the question whether Polish television is going to be private Polish television or Italian, German, British, or American. We replied as we have: We are building Polish private television--weak at the moment, but it is going to grow alongside Polish capitalism. [Kedziora] It can be expected that the commission is going to examine the council report in late May or early June.
