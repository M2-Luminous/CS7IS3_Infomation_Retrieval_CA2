For a short while, after the 1989 December events (about which we did not know much at the time they occurred) we believed we would be able to start living a normal life, escape from uncivilized poverty and an aberrant international isolation in an era of the most acute "shrinking" of the planet, due to the impact of the formidable progress made in the field of electronics and telecommunication. We had signs long ago that this aspiration was but an illusion (and, in a tragic way, not long after that significant December 1989). But now we are absolutely sure of it. The West has dealt a mortal blow to the Romanians. Or, at least to the naive people who believed that ultimately, salvation from the West would reach us. The West has robbed Romanians of hope. We can advance toward a normal life only through our own efforts and with the indispensable assistance of those we saw living a normal life, that is, the West. It is difficult to evaluate the percentage, but most probably at least half of the contribution must belong to us. That is, we have to start living a normal life, to work hard and become productive, to get seriously organized in order to become efficient, and to be merciless with ourselves in order to be able to confront successfully an equally merciless international competition that characterizes the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the third millennia. We also have to be aware of the fact that the values of democracy and the market economy must be promoted because we indeed need them, and not because somebody somewhere asks us to do so. The second half of the contribution in the aforementioned proportion was expected to come from the West. And a contribution of 50 percent is still not an exaggeration, because this would not have meant immediate money and advice, but rather the adequate political pressure that would direct us, and even drag us if necessary, toward a normal life in those many cases and situations in which the old mentalities and structures fiercely opposed it. Currently the West is announcing officially, even if it maintains a screen of bare words, that Romania is not part of its world. NATO is officially declaring that it has no intention of guaranteeing security for the former communist countries from the new Russian empire, guarantee that cannot exist in reality except if these countries join NATO. But there is something else even more tragic! If such an admission to NATO takes place, this will be achieved in two phases: first the "Central European" countries and never the "East European" countries. The American president who came to Europe to sanction the policy of the West toward the East, communicated to this to Romania through the fact that after his stay in Central Europe he flew directly to Moscow. If we acknowledge the American thesis, namely that Mr. Clinton did not stop in Prague to seal Central Europe's blessing and excommunicate East Europe, then, there can be only one, even more annoying interpretation, for this discriminatory visit as far as Romania's aspirations are concerned. Mr. Clinton went there to appease those who not only thought that the West will help them to emerge from their "eastern condemnation" but also did all they could to change themselves and receive the alms and assistance of the West. It is clear now that there was no question of Romania's admission even being discussed at all. Those who believed that the West's reticence toward Romania was due to the leadership in Bucharest were mistaken. The reality was exactly the opposite. The leadership structure in Bucharest is the way it is precisely because Romania was not considered even for a moment as part of the Western sphere but as part of the Russian sphere. Those who believed that the West would not indefinitely accept that the old structures remain unchanged in Romania and the reform aimed at a market economy has not been implemented, were naive people. The reality is that the West was less than marginally interested in our country, because Romania was not and will not be part of its world. Those who led our destinies -- probably were aware of this -- through the current official NATO decision, experience these days a real triumph. They can prove now that Romania's association to the Western world does not take place not because of them, that is, because of the communist restoration or the blocking of the reform, but because of the West itself, which has showed that it does not want us. As a matter of fact, they did their duty formally and advanced the request to join the NATO, when it was clear that in no way can such a thing come into question. The excommunicatory treatment applied to Romanians -- who, contrary to the Central Europeans, are considered in the West as people from the other side of the fence -- is a shattering additional argument for the "Eastern" statute of Romania. What else can the Romanians do? The ideal reaction -- or better said idealistic reaction -- would be if they obstinately progressed on the path of democracy and of market economy in spite of the leadership in Bucharest which is not really in favor of it. In a way, it would be a case of promoting a "pro-Western" attitude without the West. These are impossible prospects because we did not do it before, not even when it was believed that the West is with us!
