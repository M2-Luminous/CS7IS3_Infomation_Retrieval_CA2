Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the CCCMPS, said: This year is extremely critical for accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economy. This year, maintaining political stability and social security become even more arduous, as does the comprehensive management of public security. Therefore, the responsibility on our shoulders is heavier than before. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of this situation. With a high sense of responsibility for the party and the people, each and every department should play its own role and work hard to ensure the accomplishment of the task. Shu Huaide, member of the CCCMPS and secretary general of the Central Commission on Politics and Law [CCPL], conveyed the guiding spirit of the CPC Central Committee leading comrades. Chen Jiping, vice secretary general of the CCPL, member of the CCCMPS, and director of the CCCMPS general office, gave an explanation on the "Key Points of the 1994 Comprehensive Management of Public Security Work" and the "Opinions Concerning Further Strengthening the Work of Arranging Jobs for and Helping and Teaching Personnel Who Are Released After Serving Their Sentences or Being Released From Labor Education Institutions" jointly forwarded by the CCCMPS and five ministries and bureaus. He also gave a briefing on the plan for setting up positions for special inspectors. CCCMPS members who attended the meeting examined these two documents. Relevant departments exchanged ideas about their plans for carrying out their work this year. Ren Jianxin affirmed the results achieved in the work of comprehensive management of public security over the past year in maintaining social stability and safeguarding the drive of reform, opening up, and modernization. He said: "Paying equal attention to material and spiritual civilization construction" is a basic principle for establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always iterated the great importance of this principle, as has the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. It is a common task for the whole party to conscientiously carry out this principle and correctly handle the dialectical relations between the drive of reform, opening up, and economic development on one hand and political stability and social security on the other. The task is particularly important for major leading comrades of party and government organs at all levels. Therefore, the responsibility system for carrying out comprehensive management of public security should be strictly enforced. Ren Jianxin pointed out: Facing new conditions and problems, party committees and governments at all levels as well as the CCCMPS should further improve their work style and leadership, go deep into the reality of life, immerse themselves among the masses, conduct more investigations and studies, and know how to find outstanding problems affecting political stability and social security as well as those security problems strongly criticized by the people. They should pay close attention to weak links in the comprehensive management of public security and take timely measures to conscientiously solve them. It is imperative to strengthen the analysis of the social security situation; study the development trend of public security problems under the new situation; and formulate effective measures for cracking down on crimes, prevention, education, management, and other aspects so as to control the initiative in the struggle. He said: In carrying out the comprehensive management of public security, it is necessary to further liberate our way of thinking. The most fundamental thing is to follow the mass line in carrying out specialized work and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the great masses of the people, all circles in society, and relevant departments. It is necessary to strengthen giving publicity to comprehensive management of public security and better mobilize and organize the people to participate in this work. Ren Jianxin emphatically said: It is imperative to bring into full play each department's functions in maintaining social stability so as to show the effectiveness of joint efforts. Only when the force of all sectors has been condensed and their work is well coordinated can the special advantage of comprehensive management be really demonstrated. Ren Jianxin said: The work should be focussed on grass-roots units where all measures are expected to be conscientiously carried out. Grass-roots units' basic work in comprehensive management of public security should be strengthened this year through a major project for improving public security in public and complex places in urban and rural areas. The building of party organs at village, township, and neighborhood level should be strengthened. Great results should be achieved in two or three years so that all measures of comprehensive management of public security will truly blossom and bear fruits in grass-roots units. Also attending the meeting were CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Zhang Siqing and Cao Zhi.
