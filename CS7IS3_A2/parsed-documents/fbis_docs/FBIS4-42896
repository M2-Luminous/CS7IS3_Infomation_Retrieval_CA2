This was announced by Federal Environment Minister Jacques Santkin in Luxemburg yesterday. The issue will be discussed at the European Environment Council today. Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark are also rejecting the directive. Santkin took the decision at the request of Flemish Environment Minister Norbert De Batselier, and after a verbal dispute at the interministerial foreign policy conference. According to Santkin, the changes made by the EP to the directive, disturb the balance which was reached at the end of 1993 between environmental protection and the safeguarding of the internal market. This compromise was reached thanks to the European Union's Belgian presidency. As a result of the directive's blocking, the Commission and the Environment Ministers will have to find a new compromise with the EP. [passage omitted] De Batselier and Santkin fear that the amendment could jeopardize the Belgian ecological tax on disposable packagings. [passage omitted]
