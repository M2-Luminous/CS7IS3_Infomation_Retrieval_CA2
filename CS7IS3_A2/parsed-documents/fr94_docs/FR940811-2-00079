FR940811-2-00079 FR940811-2-00049 Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records AGENCY: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). ACTION: Notice of new system of records. SUMMARY: In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, we are proposing to establish a new system of records, ``Individuals Authorized Access to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Data Center,'' HHS/HCFA/BDMS, No. 09&hyph;70&hyph;0064. We have provided background information about the system in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below. DATES: HCFA filed a new system report with the Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives; the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate; the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on August 4, 1994. The system of records, including routine uses, will become effective 40 days from the date published unless HCFA receives comments which would necessitate changes to the system. ADDRESS: Members of the public should address comments to Mr. Richard A. De Meo, Privacy Act Officer, Office of Customer Relations and Communications, Health Care Financing Administration, Room 2&hyph;H&hyph;4, East Low Rise Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207&hyph;5187. Comments received will be available for inspection at this location. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gene Strother, ADP Services Branch, Office of Computer Operations, Bureau of Data Management and Strategy, Health Care Financing Administration, Room 100, Lyon Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207&hyph;5187, telephone (410) 966&hyph;4088. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: HCFA proposes to initiate a new system of records that controls and monitors access to and use of HCFA computerized information and resources, pursuant to the authority of 42 CFR 401.101&hyph;401.148 and section 1106(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306(a). These regulations and directives establish the conditions under which information about the access to and use of HCFA's computerized information and resources shall be made available to the public as well as Freedom of Information Act rules that apply to such disclosures of information. Subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3)) permits us to disclose information without the consent of the individual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosure for purposes that are compatible with the purpose for which we collect the information. The proposed routine uses in the system meet the compatibility criteria since the information is collected for the purposes of assigning, controlling, tracking, and reporting authorized access to and use of HCFA's computerized information and resources. We anticipate that disclosure under the routine uses will not result in any unwarranted adverse effects on personal privacy. Dated: August 2, 1994. Bruce C. Vladeck, Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration.
