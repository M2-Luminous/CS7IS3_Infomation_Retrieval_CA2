All this has taken place very rapidly in front of the government's eyes. In view of our citizens' deteriorating living conditions, difficulties, and suffering, it is a violation of your government's constitutional and national responsiblity to be indifferent toward these conditions and to fail to adopt the required measures to tackle them. Motivated by its national duty and historic responsibility, the Presidential Council addresses this message to you to place you before your responsibilities toward the continued deterioration of the economic and administrative situation and toward citizens' difficult living conditions. Also, there has been noticeable failure to draw up and implement a clear and sound supply, financial, and monetary policy. The Government has also failed to activate the existing laws to curb illegitimate currency speculation, stop price increases, and prevent monopolies. All that has resulted in a great increase in inflation rates, high unemployment, and low wages and incomes. In addition, the state's facilities and departments have witnessed general laxity, carelessness, and negligence. There has also been a noticeable drop in the level of job performance in the state's administrative system and institutions. All the above points are at the heart of the tasks and duties which your esteemed government should have carried out in accordance with the Constitution and in implementation of the policy statement on the bases of which it won the House of Representatives' vote of confidence. All the masses of our Yemeni people looked to you with hope and confidence that you would devote all your efforts and energies to implement that statement to overcome the shortcomings of the transitional period and the failures that accompanied it and to firmly establish the pillars of the modern Yemeni state. Aware of these regrettable conditions, and of the growing suffering that their exacerbation would cause to citizens, the Presidential Council, during its session of 23 December 1993, invited your esteemed government for a joint meeting with the Presidential Council to discuss the current political crisis and the economic situation and to examine ways of tackling that situation. However, most regrettably, the Presidential Council was surprised to receive the brother prime minister's message No. 6/1,241 of 26 December 1993, which conveys an apology for not attending the meeting on the date set by the Presidential Council. Meanwhile, the repercussions of the crisis were escalating and becoming more serious, thus increasing citizens' suffering to such an extent that any delay was intolerable. Suddenly, the national currency plunged to low and serious levels. This coincided with a general paralysis in the state's departments and facilities and with an absence of the government's role. In view of that situation, we hold you fully responsible for the deteriorating situation and for all its repercussions and harmful effects on citizens' interests and the homeland's stability. Brother Prime Minister, Brother Ministers: The homeland is passing through a crucial, historic juncture and works to firmly establish the pillars of its existence and boost its promising march toward a prosperous future, God willing. Thanks to the will of the strugglers and the efforts of all its sincere sons, our homeland was able on 22 May 1990 to revive a gigantic unity which won the world's admiration and respect. All this requires that you stand with responsibility, faithfulness, and sincerity in front of your consciences and responsibility and to side with the issues and interests of your homeland and people and to place the supreme national interest above all selfish interests and all narrow affiliations. If, at any moment, you surrender to such affiliations, the homeland will gain nothing but loss, and you will gain nothing from that but the dissatisfaction of your people, who had expected much from you. You are today before a historic and national responsibility which you should not fail to carry, whatever the justifications may be. We in the Presidential Council will be a support for you inasmuch as you will be a support for yourselves and sincere to your responsibilities and homeland in order to honor the trust and reform the duty. May God grant you success and help everyone in the interest of Yemen and its progress and prosperity under the banner of unity and democracy. May God's peace and blessings be upon you. [Signed] Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council
