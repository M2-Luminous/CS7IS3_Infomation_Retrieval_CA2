At the most, 500 people would be evacuated from Sarajevo this time. On 16 December last year, the Slovene Government decided to evacuate from Bosnia-Herzegovina all Slovene citizens, their spouses, and their children, except men of draft age who have to have the permission of the Bosnian Government. Also included in the evacuation will be also the grandparents of Slovene citizens, providing they live in the same household.
