This was announced by LDPR press secretary Grigoriy Serebrennikov in response to ITAR-TASS request to comment on the report of the ASSOCIATED PRESS news agency. According to AP, Zhirinovskiy appealed to the Alma city executive committee for a change of his original surname of Eidelstein and was permitted to assume his present surname in June of 1964. "Vladimir Volfovich's enemies cannot rest in peace. This time they launched a lie about Zhirinovskiy's bearing the surname of Eidelstein until the age of eighteen, and that, consequently, he is a half-Jew. As evidence, an archival record is cited, which must have been concocted by the special services of Kazakhstan, maybe on personal instructions from Nazarbayev who recently did not allow Zhirinovskiy to come to Almaty to attend the burial of his aunt," Serebrennikov said. Any person who is versed in Russian law in the least knows that first of all, to change one's name one must submit a request in writing. No one has a copy of such a request because they do not know whose handwriting to forge, Serebrennikov said. Secondly, every Soviet citizen is obliged to receive a Soviet passport at the age of 16. Consequently, if Vladimir Zhirinovskiy changed his surname after graduating from school, when was eighteen, he was obliged to get a new passport. No archival records of a new passport have been found anywhere," he stressed. "In the circulated Xerox copies of a record in the register of civil status in Almaty there are many discrepancies. For instance, a wrong address is indicated. And in the so-called archival reference, the year of birth is wrong". The press secretary of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the main evidence of the falseness of the document was the fact that "three days before the alleged change of name, Zhirinovskiy arrived in Moscow to enter a higher school."
