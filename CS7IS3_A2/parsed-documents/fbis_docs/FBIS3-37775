Society, the ruling force, and the opposition accepted this historical fact favorably but with no joy. There are, probably, many reasons. Although boasting of this event as its accomplishment, the opposition did not feel overjoyed because the official move was made by their political rivals. In general, the ruling force does not like commotion. There have also been some doubts: Would it not have been better to remain neutral? Would not this political move, which does not yet have any definite security outlines, cost us too much? How does the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry assess this act? [Linkevicius] First of all, our ministry rates it as a clear and definite decision to look for collective security guarantees in the West. This was no sensation to me or, I think, many Lithuanian people. Despite the constant intimidations from the opposition's propagandists that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] is steering Lithuania toward the East, the country's integration with European economic, political, and, finally, military structures is consistent, and we were not the last to make just another step. I will remind everyone that ours was the first state among the former Soviet Union republics to be admitted to the European Council. It was also the first one from which the Russian Army withdrew. We fell short of being the first in Brussels -- only Romania outstripped us "in the bend." Certainly, the signing of the Partnership program does not yet change anything the next day. We are only drafting the concept. This is by no means NATO membership with guaranteed military assistance in the event of aggression. It is only clear that this agreement will bring us closer to NATO and Western Europe, and will require a qualitative transformation of the armed forces. First of all, our military facilities and ammunition will have to be revamped according to NATO standards. The same applies to the training of servicemen and officers and the functioning of the national defense system. Not everything is new here to us. We have already accomplished something, we have had joint military exercises and so on with the Latvian and Estonian Defense Ministries. We will also train jointly a Baltic military formation that could be used under the U.N. colors. [Sniukas] The president has stated that our partnership with NATO is a process.... [Linkevicius] This process has already begun. A working group headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska has been set up at the government. The Danish and German ambassadors to NATO have already visited Lithuania. Integration moves are being discussed operatively. An officers' group is undergoing a training course in Denmark. British specialists have proposed serious assistance in military training. Sweden has offered the Baltic states considerable assistance in forming the international military corps. I am not saying that this will cost Lithuania nothing. Yes, it will! Maybe, very much. However, how could one assess our security, independence, and our economic and cultural condition after 50 years of dependence.... A conference of Nordic defense ministers will be held in Visby in summer which will be attended by Baltic representatives as well. It is there that the assistance plans will be specified. [Sniukas] The Moscow press has reported that quite a number of jokes are circulating at the Russian General Staff concerning the Baltic states' armored bicycles, the "corn" [reference to outdated light planes suitable for spraying corn fields rather than fighting] air force, and fishing boats armed with machine-guns. Foreign countries are said to propose trash to the Baltic states which pay much for it without consideration. This is how Western "assistance" is presented. [Linkevicius] Certainly, the military of the country in which imperialist feelings are still alive and the nuclear weapons of which can wipe out if not the entire world then at least its half, can mock the first steps of our Defense Ministry. I would not agree, however, that Russian soldiers are morally superior to Lithuanian ones. Every beginning is difficult. Mistakes are made, pilferers take advantage of the situation, and there is much disorder. I do not doubt, however, that Lithuania will be proud of its Army shortly, while the latter will be able not only to march but also will not repeat the mistakes of 1940 which were actually dictated by politicians. [Sniukas] Russian jokes are supplemented by the constant criticism, particularly of the arms purchase, in the Lithuanian press. The press does not doubt that this was a crime, but it is uncertain whether anyone will be punished. [Linkevicius] One should not expect a Solomonic reply. I think that we should distinguish at least two stages in the arms purchase. The first one would relatively include the years 1990-1991 when we did not yet have the international recognition, when each day and hour were full of dangers, and when the National Defense Department was only emerging. Let us remember the years 1918-1920 when the Lithuanian Army bought arms from German soldiers for money, fat, and vodka. The recent situation was also similar. Certainly, the deals of the recent months must be legally and financially justified. I can tell the public that the Defense Ministry leadership will not defend the honor of the regiment. However, it will observe the presumption of innocence until the court judgment. We have reached an agreement on job cooperation with the State Inspection Department and the Prosecutor General's Office. I think that we will learn the truth not only about the arms purchase but also about other deals. [Sniukas] Listening to the statements by Defense Ministry officials about officers' low wages and poor conditions in units, the community may wonder whether our Army is not overly large. We would not resist the big neighbors even if we increased the soldiers' number tenfold. Should we rather improve its quality? [Linkevicius] I think that this question should be addressed to our politicians. It is not the National Defense Ministry that defines the number of armed forces. Do not forget its majesty, the budget, and the finances specially assigned to national defense. To be aware of the exact number of servicemen, the Seimas [parliament] should announce a military doctrine. The latter, in turn, cannot be drafted without a security concept. Unfortunately, our Seimas men and women have not yet discussed this issue. [Sniukas] We have signed the "Partnership for Peace" program with NATO. However, it is difficult to predict any definite benefit except the political one. Meanwhile, Russia surely did not like this move. The community is considering now: Has our security improved or weakened after this? [Linkevicius] We have not heard any statements from Russian officials after 27 January that are cause for concern. First, this agreement is not directed against other countries. Second, I think that leaders of the United States and other countries have fully explained the essence of this agreement to Russia. Furthermore, the gate is not closed to Russia. True, our right-wing press, which speaks through the mouth of the opposition, is full of suspicions toward Bill Clinton and other Western leaders concerning the fact that Lithuania's fate has already been decided and so on. This does not surprise me because suspicion is, probably, the key trait of the current opposition. However, if we approved of these suspicions, then there would be no sense in creating a state at all. As far as I know, the Lithuanian Government trusts the decency of the United States and other big states. Therefore, it has appealed to NATO and wants closer cooperation with the European Union. [Sniukas] Your office is a political one. Given our opposition's clamor, you must be scolded quite often.... [Linkevicius] The press criticizes the ministry more often than me personally. It is difficult to tell which bitter article was inspired by politicians or the editorial board itself. I know the principles of the press because I myself have been a journalist. I understand that spicy material means high circulation and prestige for a publication. Nevertheless, before issuing criticisms, I wish reporters considered whether their articles would discipline an unsuccessful official or provide grounds for foreigners to think how awful the Lithuanian Army is. Journalists sometimes do not realize that definite criticism (often without arguments!) makes all soldiers anxious, impairs their good spirits, and increases their nihilism. I would also like to note one more issue. Journalists have no secrets, while we, the military, must keep many of them. We could reply to some articles but we would then have to declassify certain things. Since we cannot do this, one is left with the impression that the press is always right, while the National Defense Ministry is always wrong. No matter how many troubles -- objective and subjective -- we may have in our armed forces, let us cherish them. Let us scold them, but let us say a few good words as well! [Sniukas] Only some of the conscripts come to the Army today. There is a prevailing opinion among the community that only the children of ordinary parents (I will refrain from using stronger epithets) perform the duty of their homeland defense. They are a type of recruit. I have not heard of children of high officials, Seimas deputies, millionaires, and Gariunai [notorious market-place near Vilnius] boys serving in the Army. [Linkevicius] You are correct to note this. Because we cannot draft everyone, various excuses and advantages ensue. [Sniukas] I can again impart the public opinion, in case you do not know it. "Good children of good men" do not serve in the Army due to bribes and connections. We lament that physically weak and unfit youngsters come to the Army. While they are living a difficult everyday Army life, their contemporaries with strongly built muscles are flying to Beijing, Istanbul, or Amsterdam, enriching themselves daily, and even mocking the Army. Do we not discredit the sacred duty of homeland defense in this way? Does not service in the Army become the job of simpletons? [Linkevicius] I would not use such strong words. However, the problem is serious. Conscription commissions are subordinated to the Health Ministry, and we are unable to control bribes. I will be self-critical -- both our ministry and the Prosecutor General's Office are conniving. We could introduce alternative service, but it is difficult to organize it under economic depression. Military departments at higher educational establishments could train officers in the reserve. [Sniukas] I would propose the following plan of conscription to military service: We should draft the strongest and healthiest persons. If the latter did not want to serve they could ransom themselves for, let us say, 10,000 or 50,000 litai. There would be many such people, while the National Defense Ministry could raise another budget as the one assigned by the state. The money which now flows as bribes into the pockets of commission members would go to the National Defense Ministry account. Certainly, all this should be fully voluntary. Then servicemen would not envy those who have paid the ransom, while the latter would not feel the humiliating superiority. Such a principle could be abandoned after imposing order in the country's legal system, and after economic possibilities for the expansion of Army ranks emerge. [Linkevicius] This is an interesting proposal but it is the matter of the Seimas. [Sniukas] Thank you for the interview.
