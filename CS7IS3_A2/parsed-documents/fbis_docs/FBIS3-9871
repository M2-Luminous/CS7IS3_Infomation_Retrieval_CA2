He has not made the decision yet. Walesa denies that a "quiet agreement" has been reached between him and Prime Minister Pawlak. "I am increasingly more convinced that I will have to fight for it once again," says Walesa, when asked whether he will run in the presidential elections. Who will win the next parliamentary elections? "Definitely not the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]." Walesa does not regret strengthening "the left pillar." He does not regret "any of the main points of his activities." "So it should not put out its left leg for the right pillar," he adds. He also specified that the "screwups" are those "who pretend to be the right wing but who actually are not." In this context, he listed Aleksander Hall. One could also call them a different name; "they are kind of Christian children brought up by the communists." Walesa is waiting for "the right side" to present him with proposals on file-checking and decommunization that he will be able to recommend. "If I did this myself, it would be ill-received." "We will see once again whether I can omit the Sejm. I am saying this seriously," he answered a question concerning the Concordat. He is convinced that the Sejm will not try to limit the president's powers. "If it tries, there will be new elections. I am convinced that a different option will win, and I will contribute to that." Asked whether this is an announcement of dissolving the parliament, he replies: "If a dissolution is necessary, there will be a dissolution." Who will win the next elections? "Definitely not the SLD." "I will do everything wearing gloves, and when they realize the situation, it will be too late," he says. At another moment he adds: "Once again the Politburo wants to have all the power. The Politburo forgets that, in the next term, it will not have all the power. Whatever it will take away from the president today, it will repay tomorrow." If he were to make the decision today, he would not sign the Budget Law. "One cannot deceive the nation over and over. It was supposed to be different," he says. The coalition should tell the nation that "it will not deceive any longer." From "the economic point of view," the president is in despair because he understands that "it was not possible to make a greater move here." He has not made a decision yet. "It will be a well-considered decision. However, today I have great doubts," he stated. He denied that he has a "quiet agreement" with Prime Minister Pawlak. "If such an agreement existed, I would say the situation is pretty bad because he is doing better and I am doing worse, and I do not like that." "Now, the president must know what the agreements are," he added. At another moment, he added that he wishes Pawlak all the best, even though he fears that "the subjects are so difficult that one would need experience, which Pawlak does not have." Asked whether he will run for the presidency a second time, he stated that "if I see sense in my work." "I have not made a final decision yet. I am increasingly more convinced that I will have to fight once more," he added. Asked about PolSat, he said: "I only knew certain things that are coming to light now." He added that he believed that "one could find a cleaner case, more economic for everyone." "This generation of ours is tired and destroyed and will not do much," he confessed. "Communist screwups..." --"that was about everyone, including me," he added.
