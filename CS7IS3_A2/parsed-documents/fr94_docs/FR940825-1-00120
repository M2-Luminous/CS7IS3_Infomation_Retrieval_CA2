FR940825-1-00120 FR940825-1-00009 In prioritizing Tribal efforts, Tribes should also evaluate the expertise and resource requirements needed to implement desired programs. As stated above, Tribes will be given the flexibility of implementing programs in a modular fashion. Thus, Tribes can develop reasonably severable CAA programs to address particular air quality problems and submit them to EPA for approval. For example, a Tribe having a PM&hyph;10 air quality problem may develop a partial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment implementation plan that addresses pollution from existing sources but does not, for example, contain a program governing the review of new sources that propose to locate in the area. EPA would not decline to approve the submittal until the Tribe developed a nonattainment new source review program for PM&hyph;10 or developed a plan for addressing an ozone pollution problem. Similarly, a Tribe having relatively good air quality and anticipating likely new source growth in the area may choose to focus resources on developing a PSD program. The CAA's PSD permit program provides for preconstruction review of the air quality impacts associated with proposed new or modified major stationary sources in areas meeting air quality standards. The permitting process is to ensure that the proposed source employs state-of-the-art control technology, does not cause or contribute to an exceedance of air quality standards, and does not adversely impact National Parks and Wilderness areas. A Tribe may develop and submit to EPA for approval a PSD permit program alone. A Tribe expecting certain categories of new source growth may develop and submit to EPA for approval a PSD permit program addressing those sources or source categories. 19 Under the rule proposed today, if the implementation plan elements or other partial CAA program submitted by the Tribe is reasonably severable and meets the applicable minimum requirements under Federal law, EPA will approve the submittal. 19 As described elsewhere in this notice, EPA will issue PSD permits for any sources not covered by an approved PSD program. 2. Procedures for Reviewing and Approving Tribal Implementation Plans (``TIPs'') The CAA contains provisions which specifically govern EPA's review and processing of the State implementation plans (SIPs) developed under Title I of the Act to provide for attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion. These provisions are set forth in section 110(k) of the Act. The CAA authorizes EPA to amend, by regulation, the procedures governing the review and processing of analogous Tribal implementation plans (TIPs). See sections 110(o) and 301(d)(3). In broad terms, section 110(k)(1) provides the criteria EPA is to apply in determining whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further review and action. See also 57 FR 13,498, 13,565 (April 16, 1992). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V. EPA is required to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a SIP submittal. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination has not been made by EPA within 6 months of EPA's receipt of the submittal. Section 110(k)(1) & 57 FR at 13,565. Section 110(k)(3)&hyph;(4) address EPA's review of submittals that have been deemed complete. For example, section 110(k)(3) provides that EPA shall fully approve submittals that meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act, and partially approve and disapprove submittals that meet only a portion of the applicable requirements. Section 110(k)(4) further authorizes EPA to conditionally approve commitments by a State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain that is no later than one year after the approval. The conditional approval is automatically converted to a disapproval if the State fails to fulfill the commitment. Section 110(k)(2) directs EPA to act on a submittal within 12 months of determining it to be complete. The Act calls for the imposition of sanctions and the issuance of a Federal implementation plan when a State fails to submit a required plan or such plan is disapproved. See sections 110(c)(1), 110(m) and 179 of the Act. Guidance on EPA's implementation of these and related provisions is set out in a July 9, 1992 memorandum from John Calcagni, ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals.''
