FBIS3-49930 "dreeu009__a94027" FBIS-EEU-94-009-A Document Type:Daily Report 13 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Opposition Parties on `Danger' of `Partnership' AU1101214694 Prague CTK in English 2047 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1101214694 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- The American Partnership for Peace project is assessed by the coalition parties, the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS) as a first step towards the desirable cooperation of the Czech Republic with NATO, a poll conducted by CTK today revealed. The government coalition consists of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). This view is not shared by two opposition parties, the KSCM (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) and the Left Bloc (LB) as they consider it danger for the Czech Republic's sovereignty. Vera Zezulkova, a spokesman for the KSCM, expressed fear that the project, as a first step to NATO membership, will make it possible to "engage the Czech Republic in possible future conflicts serving the interest of the powers." She notes that the scheme envisages joint maneuvers as well as stay of foreign troops in the Czech Republic. "This, of course, does not correspond at all to the interests of most Czech people, either with respect to our security or to expenses." A pan-European system of collective security, not NATO, is necessary for "new European Security," Jaroslav Ortman, a deputy for the LB told CTK.
