The TOKYO SHIMBUN, quoting "reliable Chinese sources," said the 89-year-old Deng had been grooming Jiang, 67, as the central figure in a group leadership intended to succeed him. But a recent departure from Jiang's previous "moderate stance" sparked Deng's attack, according to the paper. The paper quoted Deng as saying Jiang, a former mayor of Shanghai, is trying to form a new "Shanghai group." Deng cited Jiang's appointments of top police and military personnel, saying they were made without his being informed, the paper said. Among those cited was the appointment early last year of Jiang's associate Ba Zhongtan to the post of commander of the Chinese people's armed police forces. The paper quoted the sources as saying Deng spoke of the need to fill posts from among candidates "sought on a nationwide basis without building factions." Deng fears Jiang's actions could split the Chinese Communist Party, it said. Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days from April 26, apparently to carry out an inspection tour. The sources quoted by the newspaper, however, claimed the visit was part of an attempt by Jiang to strengthen his power base after being criticized by Deng. Jiang served as mayor of Shanghai between 1985 and 1987 and as secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Shanghai Municipal Committee between 1985 and 1989. During that time he became associated with Ba, who was responsible for security in the Shanghai region.
