FR940721-2-00118 FR940721-2-00067 Phase Two of the SPIP involves assigning specific Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) members and Health Physics staff members to groups of authorized users to assist users in complying with the licensed program and NRC regulations and to provide a conduit for reporting the status of licensed activities to Licensee management. The Health Physics staff will also be assigned segments of the radiation safety program to review and assure compliance with the license and NRC requirements and, as necessary, draft procedures and associated documentation to implement the program. This phase will also include: (1) Development of an internal enforcement program that addresses compliance with radiation safety requirements and establishes protocols for implementing corrective actions; (2) assessment of personnel training and qualifications; (3) evaluation of laboratory equipment; and (4) development of computerized management systems. The Licensee also has committed to hire one additional health physicist to assist with the radiation safety program improvement. Phase Two will be completed by the end of December 1994. Phase Three of the SPIP involves an ongoing assessment of the corrective actions taken in response to findings in Phases One and Two, a second independent audit by an outside health physics consultant and annual audits by the RSO and RSC with reports to the Chancellor, Provost, and Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services. Phase Three will be completed by the end of December 1995. Phase Four involves continuing reassessment of the program. In light of the violations underlying the March 9, 1994 enforcement action, the public health and safety require improvement of the Licensee's radiation safety program. The NRC staff has reviewed the Licensee's SPIP. I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth in its letter of June 20, 1994, are acceptable and necessary and conclude that if these commitments are effectively implemented the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in its June 20, 1994 letter be confirmed by this Order. The Licensee agreed to the issuance of this Order during a telephone call between Mr. John A. Grobe, Chief, Nuclear Materials Inspection Section II, Region III, NRC, and Dr. Susan Langhorst, Radiation Safety Officer, of the Licensee's staff on July 12, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that, based on the Licensee's consent to this Order and the significance of the necessary program improvements described above, the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective. IV Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 20, 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that, effective immediately, license no. 24&hyph;00513&hyph;32 is modified as follows: The Licensee shall complete the specific action items within the time limitations stated in the Safety Performance Improvement Program submitted to the NRC in its letter dated June 20, 1994. If additional time is required to meet a step, a written request must be submitted with the reason for the request and the new timeframe for completion. Until approved in writing by the Regional Administrator, Region III, the previously approved schedule must be met. The Regional Administrator, Region III, may relax or rescind, in writing, any aspect of the above condition upon a showing by the License of good cause.
