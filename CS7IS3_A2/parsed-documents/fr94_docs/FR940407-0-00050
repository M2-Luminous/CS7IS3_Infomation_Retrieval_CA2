FR940407-0-00050 FR940407-0-00010 Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This regulation does not impose any new regulatory requirements in an area not heretofore regulated by the Federal Government, and does not impose any requirements or restrictions on State or local authorities. This regulation specifically provided that it does not preempt any state or local law or regulation setting a lower speed limit applicable to nondisplacement vessel in areas under the jurisdiction of such state or local authority. Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034 of February 26, 1979). Small Entities The economic impact of this regulation is expected to be so minimal that a full evaluation is unnecessary. In fact, the Coast Guard is making this amendment in part in order to avoid causing the existing regulations to have an unintended economic impact on a new mode of commercial operation. Since the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information The regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 162 Navigation (water), Waterways. Regulations In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard is amending part 162 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 1. The authority citation for part 162 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1231; 49 CFR. 1.46. 2. A temporary §162.T139 is added as follows: §162.T139 Nondisplacement vessels under 100 gross tons. (a) Notwithstanding §§162.134 and 162.138(a), nondisplacement vessels 20 meters or more in length but under 100 gross tons may operate in the nondisplacement mode at speeds not more than 40 miles per hour, and may overtake other vessels_ (1) during daylight hours (sunrise to sunset), (2) when conditions otherwise safely allow, and (3) when approval has been granted by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port or District Commander prior to each transit of the area. (b) Except for provisions on overtaking other vessels, the provisions in §162.134 continue to apply. (c) Each vessel operator wishing to operate under the provisions of this section shall submit a schedule to the Captain of the Port Detroit at least thirty days in advance for each anticipated excursion. (d) The schedule shall contain an itinerary for each excursion including dates, arrival and departure times, all destination points, and the nature of the excursion. (e) The vessel operator must confirm each excursion with the Captain of the Port Detroit no less than three and no more than seven working days prior to the intended date of departure. (f) The Captain of the Port Detroit or Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District may deny approval for all future operations during the navigation season due to an operator's failure to comply with any of these requirements. (g) This temporary section does not preempt any state or local law or regulation setting a lower speed limit applicable to nondisplacement vessel in areas under the jurisdiction of such state or local authority. (h) This section becomes effective on 12:01 a.m. on April 1, 1994 and terminates on 12 midnight on November 30, 1994. Dated: March 25, 1994. Rudy K. Peschel, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8373 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
