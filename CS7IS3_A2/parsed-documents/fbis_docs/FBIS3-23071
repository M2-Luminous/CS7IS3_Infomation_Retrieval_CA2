Initial information indicates that Cheik Sahnun received a message about the dialogue between the Army and the FIS and ways of participating in the transitional phase. In that context, sources have told AL-HAYAH that the FIS leaders who have not been released yet, namely Abdelkader Omar, Noureddine Cheghara, and Abdelkader Hachani, have been moved to the military hospital in Ain El Neja [as transliterated] "for important medical tests before their release." They added that the release would be completed before 'Id al-Fitr. [passage omitted]
