The magazine commented: "They are powerful figures in industrial development and represent important trends. Over the next few years, they will play an influential role on a broad scale." When he was interviewed again this time around, Rong Yiren was already the PRC's vice president. Nevertheless, his wise eyes, kindly smile, and cordial tone remained unchanged...[ellipses as received] In the New Post Rong Yiren was elected PRC vice president at the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] on 27 March 1993. It is now fully 10 months later. Rong Yiren said: "I was vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce [ACFIC], and chairman of CITIC. However, I spent the better part of my time on CITIC's business. Now that I have assumed the Vice Presidency, I have resigned my posts as CITIC and ACFIC chairman." "In my position as vice president, I mainly assist the president in some work," said Rong Yiren. As vice president, Rong Yiren has had a very busy schedule of state functions since April 1993. He visited Portugal and Spain, and received and met 88 delegations from various parts of the world, as well as from the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao area. Shortly after the new year began, he met a number of important visitors, such as the Azerbaijani foreign minister, the Zimbabwean foreign minister, U.S. senators, and the Romanian minister of state. Asked whether he was busier than in the past after assuming the vice presidency, Rong Yiren said: "I cannot say that I am busier because I also had a lot of work to do at CITIC, only that my current job is more politically oriented and more demanding." He said: As vice president, I represent national interests and the national honor. In dealing with foreigners, we should brief them factually on China's situation, provide them information on matters that they want to understand, and patiently explain things that they do not quite understand. We should respect both our guests and ourselves, but our main purpose is to enhance and expand international contact and friendship. "President Jiang Zemin Takes My Opinions Seriously" Rong Yiren said: "In performing my work, I often exchange views with President Jiang Zemin. President Jiang Zemin takes my opinions seriously. We cooperate very well." On his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong Yiren recalled happily: "Our friendship has existed for a long time, and our relations have always been good. Our contacts were especially numerous in 1979, when Jiang Zemin was vice chairman of the State Commission on the Administration of Foreign Investment and I was the adviser. "When Jiang Zemin was subsequently appointed minister of the electronics industry and I was the head of CITIC, we also had a lot of contacts relating to our work. When Jiang Zemin was mayor of Shanghai and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, I made a point of visiting with him when I went to Shanghai." Speaking of his domestic tasks, Rong Yiren said that because his previous work had primarily been in the economic field, his main domestic tasks had been to conduct investigations and study to find out about the situation, as well as to review the findings and present them to relevant departments in the form of ideas and suggestions. On top of his busy schedule of receiving foreign guests, Rong Yiren spent a lot of time reviewing materials and studying issues. Last May and November, he successively visited Jiangsu Province and Tianjin Municipality to investigate and learn about the situation there; he gained a lot from those visits. He said: "By and large, my work has proceeded very smoothly." The Year 1993 Laid a Very Good Foundation for Future Development In evaluating China's economic situation in 1993, Rong Yiren said: Generally speaking, 1993 was a year in which we implemented Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, seized opportunities, deepened reform, developed the economy rapidly and satisfactorily, and continued to score success. China's situation underwent tremendous changes after Deng Xiaoping delivered his talks during his tour of southern China in early 1992. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year, we finally reached a consensus regarding the experience we had gained from more than a decade of exploration: to establish a socialist market economic system. Rong Yiren said: The Chinese economy grew at an average rate of around 9 percent annually between 1980 and 1991, and it grew 12.8 percent in 1992 and around 13 percent in 1993. This continuous rapid growth is rare in the world. The reason China scored tremendous achievements in economic construction last year was primarily the result of its emphasis on deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and strengthening macroeconomic regulations and control, which enabled economic construction to proceed more orderly than in the past. At present, China is socially and politically stable, its agriculture continues to reap bumper harvests, its industrial production grows rapidly, its domestic market enjoys brisk business, its foreign trade is active, its people's livelihood continues to improve, and its overall economic strength is increasing. All this has laid a good foundation for further development in 1994 and after. He said: In light of China's basic situation and the intrinsic need for establishing a socialist market economic structure, China's next-step reform will, on the whole, still be carried out in an orderly way, step by step, and actively but prudently. Whenever a reform measure is promulgated, the capability of the state and the people to stand strains will be taken into full consideration so as to foster both economic development and social stability through reform. Speaking of this year's growth rate, Rong Yiren believed the currently set 9 percent rate is well-founded. He said: "Although the rate is a bit lower than that of the last year, it is actually not low. China's economy will follow the course of sustained, rapid, and healthy development. Nine percent is a fairly reasonable rate. The growth rate is set between 8 and 9 percent for the entire Eighth Five-Year Plan precisely because this will help arouse the initiatives of all quarters while ensuring the healthy and orderly progress of economic construction." Rong Yiren stressed: Among reform, development, and stability, reform takes the lead. Without reform, there would be no development. Meanwhile, without stability -- that is without social and political stability -- reform and development would become idle talk. This is why we consider development the purpose, reform the motive power, and stability the guarantee. We hope to promote development through reform. Only with development of the economy and improvement of the people's living standards can there be political and social stability. Moreover, stability will further help deepen the reform. This is the main experience of China's reform and opening up over the last decade and more. It Is Still Necessary To Stress Plain Living and Hard Struggle Today Rong Yiren said: Although we have made great achievements in economic development, we still have a long way to go to reach our goal. We have set the goal to build the country into a moderately developed country within half a century. We still have a long way to go to reach this goal, and we still need to exert considerable efforts. He said: "It is still necessary for China to advocate plain living and hard struggle, and diligence and frugality, and to make further progress with a strong determination." He criticized certain localities for being wasteful and extravagant as soon as their economic conditions improve. He said: "This development is very bad; it should be resolutely stopped." Rong Yiren said: We cannot turn China into a modern socialist country with Chinese characteristics without going through a long period of plain living and hard struggle to overcome one difficulty after another. Our principle is: Strive to minimize twists and turns to make development more steady. Speaking of relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, Rong Yiren said: Hong Kong, as an important international financial and trade region, is closely tied to the mainland's economic development. The considerable growth of Hong Kong's international trade volume in recent years cannot be separated from the mainland's development and support. This is precisely as Premier Li Peng has said: "Hong Kong's economy and that of the mainland have become inseparable." Rong Yiren said: Recently, because of the British Government's failure to keep its words and because of its uncooperative attitude, the Sino-British talks have broken down. This has created certain trouble and problems. It is natural that the Hong Kong compatriots should become worried. However, no matter what happens, the Chinese Government will adhere to the principles of "one country, two systems" and "letting the people in Hong Kong administer Hong Kong." This principle will not change. Together with patriotic compatriots in all circles of Hong Kong, we will adhere to the principle of the "Basic Law" to maintain long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.
