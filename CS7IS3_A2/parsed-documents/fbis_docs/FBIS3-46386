This system will play a positive role in stepping up the pace of linking China's economy with the world economy, and in restoring China's status as a contracting party of GATT at an early date. To open wider to the outside world, China canceled import permits, quotas, and control on some products as well as readjusted and reduced tariff rates on 3,371 taxable items and products in the past year, 1993. Also spurred by its speedy economic growth, China imported machinery and electronic products worth $49.46 billion in 1993, up 41.7 percent from 1992, and far higher than the 29-percent growth of total imports. The total import value of machinery and electronic products accounted for 47.6 percent of the total, up 5 percentage points from the previous year. With the State Council's approval, China officially promulgated the "Provisional Rules Governing the Import of Machinery and Electronic Products" in the fourth quarter of last year and, in the meantime, formulated the supporting "Catalogue of Products Subject to Quotas," "Catalogue of Specific Products," and corresponding rules for implementation. Thus, a new system governing the import of machinery and electronic products was preliminarily formed. According to Xu Bingjin, who is in charge of the State Machinery Import and Export Office, this new management system has brought about significant reform in four aspects: 1. It has largely shrunk the scope of management on the import of machinery and electronic products, and regulated import mainly through quotas, tariffs, openly inviting tenders, and means conforming to international practice. The internationally accepted import quota system will be imposed on a handful of key machinery and electronic products -- the 18 products include automobiles, motorcycles, video cameras, computers, and air conditioners -- which will seriously harm the development of relevant industries, and directly affect the readjustment of industrial structure and product mix in China if they are imported excessively. The 171 kinds of machinery and electronic products, in which China has invested a great sum of capital to develop and manufacture or has imported the technology to produce them and which are still at an early stage of industrial production and need to speed up their development, will be placed in the catalogue of specific products, whose import will mainly be done through international bidding. Meanwhile, the rules on machinery and electronic products temporarily banned from import, and the import permit system for them, all statements of import substitution and relevant measures, the catalogue of products imported under unified and centralized planning, the catalogue of controlled import goods, and the regulatory tax on imported machinery and electronic products have been canceled. It is estimated that if the aforementioned significant lessening in administration is realized, the proportion of import value of state-controlled machinery and electronic products to China's total import value will drop under 10 percent. 2. It has simplified the import procedures by canceling the system of examining and approving the import of machinery and electronic products according to quotas, and establishing an automatic registration system which not only conforms to the international practice but also is conducive to strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. 3. It has increased the transparency of import management. All policies and measures involving import management will be released in time. In addition, all the old documents concerning import management will be screened according to the new management measures; those incompatible with the new measures will be abolished, and those requiring revision or continuing to be enforced will also be announced. 4. According to the GATT rules, it has set up a system of indemnification measures to eliminate or reduce the harm or threat of harm to relevant domestic industries when certain products are increased sharply. Where necessary, temporary measures to limit the import of certain products will be taken according to the relevant rules of GATT and legal procedures of the state. Xu Bingjin told this reporter: From now on, the State Machinery Import and Export Office will focus its work on strengthening overall import management, examination, and supervision of key products in the catalogues of controlled items. As for this year's overall import regulation and control, it will emphasize readjusting the import structure, ensuring the needs for construction of the state's basic industries and infrastructure and the technical transformation of large and medium-sized state enterprises, continuing to control the import of consumer goods, supporting the import of advanced technology and equipment, and supporting export-oriented projects.
