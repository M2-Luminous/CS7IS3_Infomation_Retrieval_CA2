Manuel Fernandez, provincial labor and social security director, stated that the labor committees and local industries are visiting every worker included in this category to determine the veracity of their employment and to assign the new categories. The regulation requires that in order to be certified as self-employed, the worker has to personally make the products, without using middlemen and without employing salaried workers. From now on, only those people who manually and singlehandedly make items will be registered as craftsmen. These workers will be required to acquire their raw materials and market their products through the municipal enterprises of the local industries sector. The decision of the Havana's Administrative Council established a monthly license fee of 100 pesos, but no registration fee will be required.
