FR940920-2-00018 FR940920-2-00007 (A&hyph;331&hyph;801) Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Fresh Cut Roses From Ecuador AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shawn Thompson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1776. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that fresh cut roses (roses) from Ecuador are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the notice of initiation on March 7, 1994 (59 FR 11771, March 14, 1994), the following events have occurred. On March 31, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination. On April 13, 1994, three companies, the Caicedo Group, Hilsea Investments Ltd. (Hilsea), and Quitoflores, requested that they be excluded from any potential antidumping duty order issued as a result of this investigation. Due to constraints on the Department's administrative resources, we were unable to investigate companies requesting to be excluded from the potential order or requesting to receive a questionnaire on a voluntary basis ( See the May 2, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On April 19, 1994, the Department decided to collect constructed value (CV) information from all respondents in addition to home market or, where appropriate, third country sales information ( See the April 19, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On May 5, 1994, the Department issued sales and cost questionnaires to the following four Ecuadorian companies: Arbusta-Agritab (Arbusta), Inversiones Floricola S.A. (Floricola), Florin S.A. (Florinsa), and Guanguilqui Agro Industrial S.A. (Guaisa). These companies accounted for approximately 40 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise during the period of investigation (POI). Although the Department ``normally will examine not less than 60 percent of the dollar value or volume of the merchandise sold'' during the POI, 19 CFR 353.42 (b)(1), due to the limited administrative resources, the Department chose to examine less than 60 percent ( See the May 3, 1994, memorandum from David L. Binder to Richard W. Moreland). On June 7, 1994, the Department relieved all respondents from the requirement of reporting sales of roses imported and/or sold as part of bouquets ( See the June 7, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On June 14, 1994, the Department selected the appropriate third country markets for all four of the respondents ( See the June 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). However, since respondents argued that third country markets were fundamentally different from the U.S. market, it was decided that the final basis for foreign market value (FMV) for the respondents (either third country sales or CV) would not be determined until more information was received ( See the ``Third Country Sales Versus Constructed Value'' section of this notice for further discussion). On June 24, 1994, the Floral Trade Council, petitioner in this investigation, requested a postponement of the preliminary determination until September 12, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1994). The Department granted this request on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 34409, July 5, 1994). Also, on June 24, 1994, the Department instructed respondents to report monthly-average price data for the U.S. and third country markets ( See the June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On July 25, 1994, Floricola, one of the four respondents, submitted an amendment to its questionnaire response. In that amendment, Floricola stated that, based on further review, it did not have viable third country markets. Respondents submitted responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in May, June, and July 1994. Hilsea also submitted a voluntary response to section A on May 26, 1994. Because the Department determined that it did not have the administrative resources to accept voluntary responses, Hilsea's response was returned on June 3, 1994. The Department issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June, July, August, and September 1994. Respondents submitted their responses to these deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June and August 1994. Responses to the September deficiency letters are due later this month. On September 12, 1994, the Department decided to base FMV for Arbusta and Guaisa on third country sales ( See the September 12, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). For a further discussion, see the ``Third Country Versus Constructed Value'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are fresh cut roses, including sweethearts or miniatures, intermediates, and hybrid teas, whether imported as individual blooms (stems) or in bouquets or bunches. Roses are classifiable under subheadings 0603.10.6010 and 0603.10.6090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ( HTSUS ). The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.
