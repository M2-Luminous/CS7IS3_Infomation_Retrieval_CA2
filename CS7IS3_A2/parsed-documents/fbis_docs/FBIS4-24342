Following countless provocations launched by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola against government-held positions, and the indiscriminate shelling of defenseless residents, the Angolan Armed Forces, the National Police, and the Civil Defense had no option but to flush out the men in the service of Jonas Savimbi [words indistinct]. Government forces have been in control of the city of Kuito since yesterday. Jonas Savimbi's organization abandoned more than 200 men killed and large quantities of weapons.
