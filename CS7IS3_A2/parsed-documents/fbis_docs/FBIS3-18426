However, who will be the main players in the new system? There will be at least 456 newcomers in the next legislature. Yet, almost one out every two outgoing deputies has decided to reattempt making his way into Palazzo Madama [Senate] or Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies]. In fact, 489 out of 945 (51.7 percent) are running in the elections. Results will not be known until 29 March, but a list of those who will be absent can already be drawn up now. From the data collected on the lists, a comparison can be made between those elected in 1992 and today's candidates. The result is a turnover index somewhat below 50 percent, and a sort of "new face" list: This is headed -- willy-nilly and by dint of events -- by the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] and the PPI [Italian Popular Party], followed by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], half of whose candidates are newcomers. At the bottom of the list are the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the League. On average, 95 to 96 percent of their outgoing deputies have been confirmed as candidates. There will be, then, 456 missing faces in the new legislature. Those who will stay at home are largely former deputies of the old four-party majority: 193 former DC [Christian Democratic Party] members out of 313, 100 PSI members out of 140, 12 PSDI [Italian Social Democratic Party] members out of 19, and nine Liberals out of 22. Overall, out of the 494 outgoing Chamber and Senate members belonging to the DC, PSI, PSDI, and PLI, 314 have already been excluded from the palace: 63.6 percent.
