Attempting to defeat the RMK at any price, Azerbaijan violates the international agreements it has signed. Particularly, based on the agreement on normal [conventional] armaments in Europe, this country was only allowed to have 220 tanks. Nevertheless, according to the RMK military reconnaissance, the Azeri army has long exceeded the allowed limits. In parallel with this, based on Aliyev's special order, a number of large enterprises in Azerbaijan are producing and modernizing weaponry. "All these alarming military preparations, as well as fast militarization of the economy are originating from the all-Turkish idea of creating a Great Azerbaijan," declared Deputy Commander in Chief of the RMK defense army Murad Petrosyan. "This country has territorial claims to, in fact, all neighboring countries and particularly for the Bolnisi and Marneuli districts of Georgia, southern districts of Dagestan, northern regions of Iran and Zangezur district of Armenia. The RMK has become the first target of the Azeri hegemonists, who receive military-political support of Turkey". On Petrosyan's opinion not only the future of the RMK people, but fortunes of a number of countries in Close East and Transcaucasia depend on the results of the Karabakh-Azerbaijan war.
