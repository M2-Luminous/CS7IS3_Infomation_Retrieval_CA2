It is now 2221, has there been anything new, any new reports since the news conference this evening? [Ganic] No. The fact is that the task has not been carried out the way the NATO ultimatum demanded. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops are still trying to get the job done, but I personally believe they are far from achieving the objective. The task has, therefore, not been achieved in accordance with the NATO declaration. [Kulender] Our state has fulfilled all conditions contained in the NATO declaration? [Ganic] Of course. I would like to tell the listeners that many traps were set for our state in the process of the adoption and implementation of the declaration. The day NATO held their session in Brussels an urgent meeting of military representatives was convened at the airport here in Sarajevo under great pressure from the Belgrade regime. The Serb side offered an ostensibly extremely flexible agreement on the withdrawal of weapons, but an overly vague, imprecise agreement. They insisted that the agreement be signed by 1500 at the latest. President Izetbegovic and I were at the Presidency and we withdrew our delegation for consultations and gave them instructions. We quickly saw through the game. The Belgrade regime's objective was that a report be promptly sent to Brussels from the meeting at Sarajevo airport saying that an agreement had been achieved on some withdrawal or other of the heavy weaponry so that NATO would not pass a specific resolution, that is, an ultimatum. We avoided that first trap. After the declaration was passed, UNPROFOR, that is those who in a certain way control UNPROFOR, insisted that several commissions and subcommissions be formed to implement the NATO declaration and the ultimatum. President Izetbegovic then formed a crisis headquarters whose members are known -- I am the head of the crisis headquarters -- and whose task was to cooperate with UNPROFOR and find a way to avoid all traps set in order to prevent the implementation of the declaration. What was the aggressor's aim and, I must say, the aim of some states who have their troops within UNPROFOR forces? Their aim was to drag us into some negotiations, futile negotiations at the airport, into signing several kinds of agreements in order to make it look -- when the ultimatum deadline expires -- as if we could not agree with the Serb side on the positions, on the details, and on the timing of the withdrawal and make it look like both sides were to blame for the failure to implement the resolution. We adopted a very clear strategy. We said that we understood the NATO declaration perfectly well; we wish to maintain contact with UNPROFOR on a strictly written basis -- we shall go on meeting but, prior to each meeting, we insist that we have written material, questions in writing, and that everything be meticulously documented. This used to drive them insane, but it helped resolve all the problems between us and UNPROFOR. It helped us observe the resolution, and we left it up to them to haggle with the Serb side. Naturally, they failed to accomplish anything with the Serb side over this eight-day period. They have been working on the implementation of the NATO declaration for only two days, which is why this whole crisis broke out. UNPROFOR made a mistake, a serious blunder -- this is yet to be elucidated -- because it used the NATO declaration, the NATO ultimatum, as working material for negotiations with the Serb side. In other words, they fell into the trap set by Belgrade's diplomacy, which has been pulling the strings all along. This was the result -- UNPROFOR's people scattered all over the hills over the past two days discovering weapons and, in a way, trying to collect what could be collected and, to a certain extent, I feel that General Rose -- who has a brilliant resume -- is slowly sinking into the same quagmire and making the same mistakes as his predecessors. The outcome of all this, and this was confirmed by Mr. Akashi who said that 20 percent of the weapons are not under control, is that the approximate locations are known but the percentage of uncontrolled weapons is much higher. Therefore, the NATO resolution has not been respected by the aggressor. We did our job professionally and consistently, and this is a diplomatic victory for us. The Western countries should now decide whether they wish to keep their promises and, of course, whether they wish to base their future policies on the strength of their promises. [Kulender] The Russian troops that are supposed to be part of the UN force arrived in Pale this evening. [Ganic] Yes, they have arrived. I believe, you know, the United Nations rallies most of the world. The Russian troops are part of the UN force, we shall keep that in mind. Russia did not take part, it did not cooperate, it did not even assist in drawing up this NATO declaration. Naturally, this caused a certain degree of wariness, not only here in Bosnia but in the democratic world at large. However, these troops are under Gen. Rose's command and their deployment will compensate for the expectations of the Pale regime [as heard].
