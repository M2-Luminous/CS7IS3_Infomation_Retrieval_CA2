The message said: President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the idea of shaping the destiny of mankind, reflecting the independent demand and interest of the popular masses in the first period when he set out on the road of revolution and applied it to practical activities to build the socialist system centred on the popular masses in Korea. The Korean-style socialism where the leader, the party and the masses are singleheartedly united gives a hope and courage to the world progressive people and clearly indicates the road ahead of the third world countries. We extend firm solidarity with the heroic Korean people confidently advancing along the road of socialism chosen by themselves and express full support to the Korean people in their struggle to realize reunification of the country on the basis of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation. The message wished President Kim Il-song good health and a long life.
