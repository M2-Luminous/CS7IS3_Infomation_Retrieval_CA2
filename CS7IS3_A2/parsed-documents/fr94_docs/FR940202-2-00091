FR940202-2-00091 FR940202-2-00065 A proclamation will be issued to be effective July 1, 1994, making the adjustments to the list of eligible articles that are required by section 504(c) of the 1974 Act and announcing the discretionary decisions referred to in this notice, on the basis of official data covering all of calendar year 1993. It should be emphasized that the information set forth below covers only the first 10 months of 1993. Partial year data is being published now to provide the maximum possible advance indication of adjustments that may be made to meet the requirements of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act and to afford the earliest opportunity for comment on the possible discretionary decisions. List I below shows specific GSP-eligible articles for beneficiaries which have already exceeded estimated competitive need limitations (i.e., a beneficiary supplied over $107,320,423 or $41,621,070 in the case where a beneficiary has been found sufficiently competitive in the product, during January&hyph;October 1993) or have been graduated from the GSP in early years pursuant to the President's discretionary authority. List II below shows beneficiaries which are approaching the competitive need limitations (i.e., a beneficiary accounted for over 42 percent of the value of total U.S. imports and/or over $85,856,338 million or in the case where a beneficiary has been found sufficiently competitive, over 21 percent and/or $33,296,856 million during January&hyph;October 1993). List III below shows beneficiaries which, despite accounting for more than 50 percent (or 25 percent in the case of a beneficiary found sufficiently competitive in a product) of the value of total U.S. imports of an article, may be eligible to receive GSP benefits through the de minimis waiver (i.e., where a beneficiary accounted for more than the applicable percentage limit but the value of total U.S. imports of the item was less that $12,553,356 during January&hyph;October 1993). List IV below shows articles from beneficiaries which are currently ineligible for GSP duty-free treatment but which may be eligible for redesignation to GSP status pursuant to the President's discretionary authority (i.e., a beneficiary accounted for less than 50 percent, or 25 percent in the case of products for which it was found sufficiently competitive, of the value of U.S. imports and the value of U.S. imports of the article from the beneficiary developing country was less than the applicable dollar limit during January&hyph;October 1993). This list does not include articles from India which do not receive GSP treatment as a result of Presidential Proclamation 6425 of April 29, 1992 (57 FR 19067), 6446 of June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26969) or 6447 of June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26981). V.

A party must provide fourteen copies of its statement which must be received by the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee no later than 5 p.m., Wednesday, March 2. Comments received after the deadline will not be accepted. If the comments contain business confidential information, fourteen copies of a non-confidential version must also be submitted.

Disposition of the Review of Worker Rights Practices in Costa Rica and Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review In June 1993, petitions were filed with the Office of the United States Trade Representative that requested a review of worker rights practices in Costa Rica and in Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review. In October 1993, the petitions were accepted and a review was initiated to determine whether Costa Rica and Paraguay were complying with the worker rights provision of section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2462), which requires beneficiary countries to have taken and be taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights (58 FR 53959). At the time that the petitions were accepted for review, United States Trade Representative Kantor noted that, because actions to improve worker rights in Costa Rica and Paraguay were in process, the GSP reviews could be terminated at any time during the review period. In December 1993, Costa Rica and Paraguay were found to be taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as provided in section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, because substantial positive actions had been taken by the Government of Costa Rica and the Government of Paraguay to resolve the allegations and shortcomings listed in the petitions. Accordingly, the GSP reviews were terminated. Frederick L. Montgomery, Chairman, Trade Policy Staff Committee.
