FR940617-2-00018 FR940617-2-00009 To value electricity, we used publicly-available information from Colombia contained in the Departamento Nacional de Planeacion's Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos (June 1993). We selected this source because it provided an electricity rate for industrial use during the POI. To value natural gas, we relied on an average of two published, publicly-available values for our first-tier surrogate countries, Colombia and Morocco. The Colombian value was reported on a FOB Colombian port basis and was obtained from U.S. import statistics for 1993. The Moroccan value was the average price at which natural gas was imported into that country in 1992. The source of this value was the 1992 International Trade Statistics Yearbook, Volume 1, 1993. Before averaging these values, we converted the Moroccan value into a price per cubic meter. To value production labor, we used published, publicly-available values for Egypt from the 1993 Year Book of Labour Statistics, 52nd edition. We used the most recent statistics available, values from 1987, which we inflated to the POI using statistics published by The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94. For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), and profit, we found no publicly-available, published information. In addition, we were unable to use information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for SG&A and profit because we were unable to determine the cost bases upon which the Egyptian percentages were calculated. Therefore, we relied on the statutory minimums of ten percent for SG&A and eight percent for profit (see section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Act). For factory overhead, we also found no publicly-available, published information. In addition, we were unable to use the information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for factory overhead because we were unable to determine the cost basis upon which the overhead percentage was calculated. Furthermore, the statute does not provide any minimum percentage for factory overhead. Therefore, we relied upon information from the second-tier surrogate country of Bolivia provided by the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia. This information was used during the recent antidumping investigation of Refined Antimony Trioxide (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Refined Antimony Trioxide From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 6801, February 28, 1992.) The information is in a cable in the public file for this case ( see La Paz Cable 14178, September 23, 1991). Except as noted below, where necessary, we adjusted the above surrogate country prices for inflation to the POI using the wholesale price indices published for each of the surrogate countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the case of Peru, we used the consumer price index of the IMF because the IMF does not publish a wholesale price index for that country. In the case of Egypt, for which the IMF publishes neither wholesale nor consumer price indices, we adjusted for inflation, where necessary, using statistics published by The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94.
