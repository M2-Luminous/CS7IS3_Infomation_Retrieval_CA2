This point was stressed by Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the General Logistics Department, at today's political work meeting of the General Logistics Department. Fu Quanyou pointed out: The in-depth development of reform and opening requires us to do ideological and political work more effectively; improve education in socialism, patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and fine tradition; strive to enhance the ideological and moral quality of the troops; and to guide officers and servicemen to establish a correct outlook on life and a set of correct values. Fu Quanyou stressed: Arming the minds of officers and men with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and unifying the thinking and action of the troops according to this theory, is the primary task in our present ideological and political work. At all times and in all circumstances, we must guarantee that the troops will resolutely obey the orders of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and must effectively guarantee the smooth implementation of the political and military orders. For the General Logistics Department, the results of the ideological and political work should find expression in the fulfillment of all professional tasks, especially in the enhancement of the support capacity and combat effectiveness of the troops. It is necessary to seriously implement the military strategical principles for the new period, actively converge with the market economy, deepen reforms in the logistics work of the armed forces, and strive to enhance the overall level of the logistics work. The troops should be prompted, through ideological education, to carry forward the five types of revolutionary spirit advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit set out by Comrade Jiang Zemin. More effective work should be done to improve the party style and to keep the troops incorruptible. In particular, people responsible for managing money and materials must be kept under effective supervision. Cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, should be prompted through ideological education to maintain the style of hard work, to take pride in working honestly and incorruptibly, not to seek personal gain and fame, to live plainly and work diligently, and to make selfless dedications. At the same meeting, Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics Department, made a speech on striving for solid results in ideological education and on prompting political cadres to keep a good image. Wang Tailai, deputy director of the General Logistics Department, and Xu Sheng, deputy political commissar of the General Logistics Department, also attended the meeting.
