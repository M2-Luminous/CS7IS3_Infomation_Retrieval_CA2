IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA negotiating team arrived in Pyongyang this afternoon and will begin full-pledged negotiations with North Korean officials tomorrow. In particular, it is expected that, in the forthcoming negotiations with North Korea, the IAEA will demand [chokku] a random choice [imui sontaek] of replaced nuclear fuel rods and separate preservation [pyolto pogwan] of them in special containers, and North Korea will repeatedly insist on its previous position that it will allow this after the nuclear issue is resolved in a package deal through negotiations with the United States.
