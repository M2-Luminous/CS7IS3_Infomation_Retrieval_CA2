This collapse was necessary for the normalization of the situation in our part of Europe and the search for ways to stabilize it. Our centuries-long experience with the existence of the Czech state should help us in our efforts. Western Powers -- Illusion Number One Since the disintegration of the Habsburg-ruled system of states and the upsetting of the power balance in Central Europe, we have been looking to ensure our security outside the Central European space. It is a pure anachronism when people say that the only possible way is to return to the pre-war First Republic's foreign policy concept and get closer to the Western powers -- France, above all. This security system of the First Republic not only failed -- as any child knows -- but also contributed to Germany's being pushed out of Europe. The tragical development after World War I has shown us quite convincingly. Today's Germany is a state with great culture and enormous economic potential; it is a country (unlike us!) with 50 years of uninterrupted democratic tradition that was able to successfully cope with its Nazi past. Since time immemorial, Germany has been our most natural economic, cultural, and political competitor (in the positive sense of the word). In view of our efforts to integrate ourselves into West European security structures -- of which Germany is an inseparable member -- any effort to circumvent this reality by jumping over Germany far to the West is not only a naive but absurd idea, reminiscent of the time before World War II. NATO -- Illusion Number Two It was unrealistic in the time of the First Republic to rely on Western powers in the matter of Czechoslovakia's security, and it would be equally dubious to rely on our early joining of NATO. There are thousands of things that could slow this process down, if not stop it entirely: economic problems in countries waiting for membership -- or in the member countries themselves -- or unpredictable developments in Russia, which is, of course, the most essential thing. Our efforts to join NATO should, therefore, be understood as our attempt at keeping what we have already achieved (in actual fact, this is not likely to change in the future). In our country, we have succumbed, in good faith, to the illusion that the Czech Republic has an exceptional status among other post- communist countries and that we will be the first to be admitted to NATO. However, when judging the overall situation in the European security, the Alliance may put the Czech Republic's membership in NATO in last place on their task list. Central Europe -- Reality Number One Our first efforts in foreign policy should be aimed, in my opinion, at establishing an as-wide-as-possible cooperation with our direct neighbors and at our collective building a politically stable Central Europe as the basis for the security of the Czech state. Cooperation with the Visegrad Four countries (plus Austria or Slovenia) does not have to be institutionalized, but common interests should be chiefly based on wide economic cooperation between these countries, which is what the Czech Republic is basically trying to establish within the framework of the Central European free trade zone, which should also include some military cooperation (for example, joint military training with NATO countries within the framework of the newly accepted Partnership for Peace project). In no case should we look with disrespect at Meciar's Slovakia -- the existence of a politically and economically stable country between us and the former USSR is in the Czech Republic's vital interest! The Czech State -- Reality Number Two Of course, our domestic development and a quick and conflict-free completion of the economic transformation of the democratic state are the most important things. The economic and political stability and power are the basis for every well-functioning society, but we need more than that. We should be aware and proud of the fact that we belong to this country and state, and that we are part of its 1,000-year-long history.
