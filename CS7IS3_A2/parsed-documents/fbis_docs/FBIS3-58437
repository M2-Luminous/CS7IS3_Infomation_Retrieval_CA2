Clinton pledged to get personally involved immediately after the conclusion of his European tour this week. He made the pledge during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and European Commission President Jacques Delors at the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels yesterday. Kasoulidhis stated "the Cyprus government welcomes the fact that President Clinton, personally, and this is a great positive development for Cyprus, will handle the Cyprus problem." He added the Greek Cypriot side should also think hard "as to the way we should responsibly handle our sincere objectives for a just and workable Cyprus settlement." Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis was briefed on what exactly was stated by President Clinton, Kasoulidhis replied he based his statements on press reports from Brussels. He said the government was in touch with the American State Department special Cyprus coordinator and the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus and no further contacts between the Cyprus and U.S. presidents were being fixed.
