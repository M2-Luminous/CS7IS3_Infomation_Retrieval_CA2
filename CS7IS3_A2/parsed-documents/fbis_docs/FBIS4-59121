FBIS4-59121 "drnes091dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Statement Rejects Israeli Claims on Jerusalem Statement Rejects Israeli Claims on Jerusalem TA1005181394 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic 10 May 94 pp 1, 5 TA1005181394 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR Arabic BFN [Text] Jerusalem -- A press release issued yesterday by Orient House [PLO headquarters in Jerusalem] says: The Israeli authorities continue to pursue the fait accompli policy toward Arab Jerusalem by reinforcing a series of practices aimed at enhancing a growing settlement reality in the city at the expense of the Arab presence. These authorities are trying to exploit the so-called (Jerusalem day) to affirm these settlement measures through statements that try to turn facts upside down and ignore the reality on the ground. Naturally, (Jerusalem day), which the Israelis celebrate, means nothing to us other than an occasion for repeating rejected Israeli positions that contradict the substance of the peace process, based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and Resolution 252 issued on 21 May 1968. This resolution affirmed the international community's rejection of Israeli measures in Jerusalem and considered the city to be an integral part of the occupied territories. It has become obvious even to the Israelis themselves that the political, social, and cultural reality which Jerusalem has experienced during 27 years of occupation affirms the failure of all Israeli attempts to unify and Judaize Jerusalem and integrate its Arab residents. The few meters separating Arab Jerusalem from West Jerusalem embody a vast distance as large as the one separating myth from reality and unfounded historic claims based on the principle of force from the brilliant historic reality that affirms the Arab and Islamic character of Jerusalem and the beating heart that it represents to the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nation. The Palestinian side's commitment to the peace process and the ensuing phased agreements necessarily obligates the Israeli side to abide by the principles, steps, and measures relating to the interim and final stages. It should stop the unilateral Israeli measures that are liable to prejudice Palestinian rights, especially those pertaining to Jerusalem, when the final talks are launched. Jerusalem will be a top priority of those talks as the political and historic capital of the future Palestinian state.
