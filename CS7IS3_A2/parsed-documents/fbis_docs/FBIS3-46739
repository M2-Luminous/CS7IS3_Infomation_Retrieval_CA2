Leaders of the government and the seven coalition parties reached the decision to hold the fourth meeting of an economic forum of the government and the coalition, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said at a news conference. The meeting was originally set for Wednesday morning but was called off after the representatives of the coalition agreed on the need for further discussion on proposed income tax cuts and an alternative tax revenue among themselves. At Wednesday's meeting of the leaders of the government and the ruling parties, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata proposed resuming the talks on tax as early as possible to help facilitate the formulation of the fiscal 1994 national budget, Hatoyama said. All the others present agreed to reopen the meeting of the economic committee to continue debate on how to finance anticipated income tax reduction, on which the coalition parties are split, according to the deputy chief cabinet secretary. Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, heads the economic forum of the government and the coalition parties. The panel, formed on the orders of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, met three times in late December.
