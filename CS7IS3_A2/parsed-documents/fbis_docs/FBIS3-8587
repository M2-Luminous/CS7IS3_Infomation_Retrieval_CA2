Toth thus also refuted President Michal Kovac's criticism of the Slovak economy expressed yesterday in his speech. All the important macroeconomic figures are changing systematically, Toth said. Only after they have been stabilized by the Government can a better economic policy be formulated, he added. An economic strategy does indeed exist; its principles were approved by the International Monetary Fund, he said. The opposition "criminalizes" almost all the Government's economic decisions, he stated. Of course the Government cannot influence all business activity; it can only supervise it, he said in response to criticism to the effect that millions of crowns worth of hard currency payments have been leaking abroad, including to the Czech Republic. He admitted that Slovakia has a trade deficit vis-a-vis Russia totalling 30 billion Slovak crowns ($910 million). He reminded CTK that last year the Government lowered taxes on businesses by five percent and plans to lower them still further. Vice-Premier for the Economy Sergej Kozlik said in defense of the Government that the U.S. foreign secretary praised Slovakia for keeping inflation under control, building up foreign currency reserves, and managing the budget deficit. Foreign investment last year rose by 60 percent as compared to the three preceding years.
