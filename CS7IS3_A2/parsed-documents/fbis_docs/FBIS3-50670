Niehaus downplayed the importance of an announcement released by the self-styled Autonomous Movement of Guanacaste for Bread, Work, and Dignity [Movimiento Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan, Trabajo, y Dignidad], which said it was willing to recruit fighters to go to that country. The foreign minister, remarking that the group is meaningless in Costa Rica, said "the statement lacks seriousness." Nevertheless, he warned that if evidence should indicate that any Costa Rican organization is involved in plans to support the armed conflict in Mexico, the government will order the appropriate investigations.
