Journalists asked the president if France had received enough backing from the international community. [Begin Mitterrand recording] Enough, yes. There is a major difference between saying nothing and expressing support. When we asked the question, they all told us that they supported the French initiative. Now, you will ask me, are they supporting us by dispatching soldiers? Some will answer a call for logistical support, others are perhaps getting ready to supply troops, others, it depends. This is not only specific to the Twelve, proposals also came from Africa and from a few other countries. First of all, the deployment of equipment and troops took place in excellent conditions; it was very well organized. The move into Rwandan territory often took place with the very warm agreement of the people, if I can trust what you journalists are writing as well as our own information. [end recording]
