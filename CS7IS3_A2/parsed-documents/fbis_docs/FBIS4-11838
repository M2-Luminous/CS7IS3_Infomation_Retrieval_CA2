This crisis, which escalates and then abates for reasons that are incomprehensible to us, seems to be remote from our area and to have nothing to do with us. As a matter of fact, it is linked to U.S. policies that are becoming clearer and more determined. These policies are generally aimed at preventing proliferation of nuclear arms in various parts of the world on the one hand and at completely controlling arms shipments to the Middle East on the other -- naturally, this is to guarantee Israel's continued superiority. North Korea is not an unlikely source of certain types of weapons for some Arab countries. There are U.S., European, and Russian agreements to "control" arms shipments to the Middle East, but these agreements are subject to the mood in the United States. The United States violated these agreements with the sale of modern military aircraft that it decided to offer to Israel recently as a down payment for starting the peace talks. Twenty years ago, there were doubts that North Korea had a nuclear plan that might be used to produce weapons. But North Korea signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in 1985 and it allowed the IAEA to inspect its installations in 1991. Amid the continuing tense relations between North and South Korea, the North Korean Government decided last June not to allow the IAEA inspectors to check its installations and threatened to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty if the U.S. and South Korean pressure continues. North Korea has played on the nerves of the United States and South Korea: It finally allowed the IAEA inspectors to check some installations but then suddenly prevented them from completing their mission. The United States tried to use this crisis to gain access to the center of the closed society in North Korea, but it failed. The crisis was referred to the Security Council. The United States also tried to use the PRC and Japan to pressure North Korea, but the PRC stated that this crisis must he resolved peacefully without threats. The United States so far has not one single confirmed bit of evidence that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea probably is playing this card for its own purposes in the conflict with South Korea. The U.S. stance seems strange and incomprehensible. It leaves in Israel nuclear weapons the existence of which have been proven beyond a shadow of doubt and searches for nuclear "ghosts" in North Korea. The whole game is intended to serve Israel.
