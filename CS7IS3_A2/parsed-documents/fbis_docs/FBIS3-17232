Pabat by S. Gurova; place and date not given: "Oblast Budget Adopted. Can We Breathe Easier?"] [Text] On 15 March a Session of the Oblast Soviet Voted for One of the Year's Main Issues Budget questions are questions of our life. Much depends on the figures for which the deputies vote: whether we can receive treatment and be taught at the level of the individual of the end of the 20th century, ride urban mass transit, and move, as needed, into new residential neighborhoods. At the oblast soviet session on 22 February the deputies rejected the draft budget. And now a new attempt. This time the decision was adopted. Our correspondent's questions are answered by M.G. Pabat, chief of the oblast state administration financial department. [Gurova] Mikhail Grigoryevich, the second version of the budget is better? [Pabat] Substantially. The amount--10.3 trillion karbovantsy--that the deputies rejected on the last occasion would hardly have been sufficient to cater to half our requirements. In order to fully cover the requirements of housing and public utilities and for there to be sufficient funds for the purchase of prescription drugs, for transport subsidies, and for other needs, the deputies proposed an increase in the amount by a factor of 1.7. Which also will not be enough for everything, of course, but we will not have to accustom ourselves to shortages. [Gurova] From where, for all that, has the increase in funds come? [Pabat] From a reduction in tax payments to the state coffers. Having transferred them to the local budget, the deputies thereby ran counter to current legislation. But they had no choice. When there is not enough to maintain the hospitals and schools, to maintain electric transportation in at least some kind of shape, not to mention replacing it, or to prevent the poor from dying of starvation and to provide them with a roof over their heads, under these circumstances one does not point to the strict pressure of the law. After all, on the other side there is the abyss into which poverty is pushing us. [Gurova] Will these percentages which were withheld from the state budget help us to breathe easier? [Pabat] Alas! The budget is composed of taxes, and where are they to come from if the plants and factories come to a halt? In January the oblast produced 34 percent less than in the same month last year. In February the minus increased to 41 percent. In March it is expected that this figure will be even higher. We will breathe more easily only when an upturn in production begins. [Gurova] What was the subject most discussed when the budget was being adopted? [Pabat] The talk was mostly about social protection, about the pay of employees of the publicly funded sphere. Whatever matter was raised--whether there was a reserve fund, the construction of housing, or the Afghan veterans--the talk continually came back to the calamitous position of the hospitals, schools, and higher educational institutions and, consequently, the doctors, teachers, and lecturers--those on whom the health, intellect, and spiritual condition of the people depend. Despite the fact that the payments to them come not from the local but the state budget, the session still had to decide questions on an increase in pay from general appropriations until the corresponding decrees are adopted at the state level.
