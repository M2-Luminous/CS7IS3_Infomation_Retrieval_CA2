Determinations of the activity spectrum on a series of phages resulted in the identification of the following nucleotide sequence as the target site: (5')-CTCTTCN-> NNNN- (3')-GAGAAGN NNNN-> -, where -> indicates cleavage points. Specificity of Bco116 I identifies it as an isoschizomer of Ksp632 I. Maximum Bco116 I activity was expressed under the following conditions: 10 mM tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl[.sup]2[/], 1 mM dithiothreitol and 60ï¿½C.
