The ceremony was presided over by Army General Raul Castro, second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who moments before the ceremony made exclusive comments for this newscast: [Begin Castro recording] This is the most important event of the century, and Mandela -- I was thinking the other day -- is the greatest leader of the century. I even dare say the greatest leader Africa has had in its long history. As you know, ceremonies such as this are being held in over 150 mausoleums nationwide as a salute to the death of apartheid; the birth of the new South Africa; and to remember our comrades whose blood and effort, as leaders of the ANC including Mandela have pointed out, were instrumental in reaching 10 May, a day such as today. This is a highly moving day for us, a day of deep remembrance and immense gratitude toward all our dead comrades. Once again, this shows that in a third country -- first Angola, then Namibia, and now South Africa -- the effort and the bloodshed were not in vain. They conducted the most glorious internationalist missions. I say glorious because they were probably the most selfless acts in the history of mankind, of a people toward their African brothers, a significant limb of our national identity.
