This was announced by the government's representative for resettlers, State Secretary Horst Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), in Bonn today. The apartments are designed for ethnic Germans who do not want to emigrate to Germany, but who are looking for new homes because of the unstable situation in their home country, particularly in Kazakhstan. The government wants to provide 30 million German marks for these measures and buy houses, build new homes, or grant credits for self-help measures. At present, about 600,000 ethnic Germans are living in western Siberia.
