FBIS4-9998 "drlat066_r_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Peru Navy Link to Narcotrafficker Ministro Alleged Navy Link to Narcotrafficker Ministro Alleged 94SM0288A Lima SI in Spanish 7-13 Mar 94 pp 32-35 94SM0288A Lima SI Spanish CSO [Article signed J.A.M.: "Ministro's Sailors"] [Text] Yurimaguas, the most important river port on the lower Huallaga and one of the great entry points to Amazonia, is also one of the forest capitals around which today operates one of the most active drug trafficking bands. The Huallaga river is navigable to deep-draught vessels up to this point. Beyond the port, upstream, traffic is limited to launches. Distances are measured in launch/hours. The principal product of traffic by this means is basic cocaine paste (BCP), gathered by the so-called "traqueteros." A port captaincy operates in Yurimaguas, which is manned by a detachment of the Peruvian Navy. From August to October 1993, the period within which these events took place, the port captain was Navy First Lieutenant Victor Herrera Sheen. One of his deputies was AP [Peruvian Navy] Lieutenant Pedro Huarcaya Briceno. Huarcaya and Herrera are the central figures in this account, provided voluntarily by a maritime officer [oficial de mar] to the Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking, appointed by the Constituent Democratic Congress (CCD). The investigative group is headed by Julio Castro Gomez of the Democratic Movement of the Left (MDI). Telejo Airport Leaving Yurimaguas going south on the Huallaga, after two hours one arrives at the village of Telejo. In August 1993--according to the testimony of the maritime witness to the CCD committee--a clandestine airport was constructed there under the benign gaze of his chiefs. Shortly before 1993, through the intermediate ports of Garcilaso, Abel Guerra and La Boca, people noticed--and they noticed it because access to the port is open--heavy traffic in iron and cement from Yurimaguas to Telejo. Mention is made of frequent shipments (it is not specified whether daily or weekly) of 50 bags of cement. But there are no important building projects in Telejo. Then why so much building material? "The boat owners and the pilots told us that it was for the airport," said the mariner. The members of the CCD committee asked him specifically if he knew of BCP flights from Telejo. "I knew of an initial flight about 30 days ago (calculating dates, this had to be about mid-September) and of a second flight Thursday at midnight (in mid-October), that is, with night navigation. Between 40 and 50 men worked on the project. But who gave the order to build the airstrip? The "Caletas" The accuser also testified to an intense traffic of raw materials for the manufacture of BCP. He mentioned kerosene, carbonate, sulfuric acid, and calcium. The lieutenants observed this without reacting. The enumeration of the delivery points for these materials by the accuser is interesting. Within the environs of Yurimaguas he indicated the settlement of Shitari, at 15 minute distance, and Santa Elena, Santa Maria, Santa Isabel and Dos de Mayo, within a similar radius. At more remote distances--from two to three and a half hours--he mentioned Shucushuyacu, Yarina, Shazuta and Huimbayoc. The crude paste reaches these locations and is converted into refined paste. The places where these conversions take place are called "caletas." All of these places centered around Huimbayoc form the domain of Waldo Vargas Arias, "capo" of the drug traffic, of Colombian nationality, better known under the nickname of El Ministro. Which Authorities The CCD committee asked the maritime officer for the names of the officials or authorities who knew of the activities he was revealing. "The only names of officers that I could give--he replied--would be those of Lieutenant AP Pedro Huarcaya Briceno and First Lieutenant AP Victor Herrera Sheen. Lieutenant Herrera is the port captain and Lieutenant Huarcaya, chief of personnel, reports to him daily." The witness was asked whether he knew the version according to which the military authorities were providing security to the drug traffickers so that the airplanes could take off without problems. "I had no knowledge of that, but I can add something. One can see--he declared--police officers as well as naval officers having meetings with people connected to the drug traffic. I can mention Mr. Miguel or Luis Farro. This individual is known in the area as a "narco." He has several launches that travel all over the Huallaga. I have even seen two emissaries from El Ministro who came from Huimbayoc to visit my superiors." Detachment in Yurimaguas One of the premises of the maritime officer was that the activities of the "traqueteros" or collectors was by means of the launches. "Did your immediate commander ever order an action against these `traqueteros,' he was asked. "We were never ordered specifically to intervene against `traqueteros.' However, on one occasion we crossed the river to the Huimbayoc area, under the command of Lieutenant Huarcaya." They departed in two launches at 0430, so as not to be seen. But the crossing took place without incident. When they reached Huimbayoc, Huarcaya deployed his people behind an island and ordered them to act. They proceeded to search everyone without distinction. Dollars were discovered, but no drugs. The lieutenant claimed that the money came from drugs and gave the order to seize it. Everyone turned over the proceeds to the chief. Lieutenant Huarcaya kept the booty until the return to Yurimaguas. Only then would he proceed to distribute it, according to the rank of each. Meanwhile, the operation continued. "This is good, and we are going to stay," he ordered. A brothel was operating in Huimbayoc, on the banks of the river, despite the explicit prohibition of the regulations. The naval witness said that the rule is as follows: the entire riverine zone is property of the state and no establishement of that type may operate there. On that tropical night, Lieutenant Huarcaya was the special guest of a certain "Passion." The eight military personnel who accompanied him acted as security. The naval witness and accuser asserted that on that occasion, in addition to the pleasures provided by the service, "Passion" paid Lieutenant Huarcaya the sum of $2,000, so that the patrol would continue to turn a blind eye to the brothel's activities. This is what is stated in the testimony in the hands of the CCD's working committee. Two caches were discovered in the village, the first of about 120 kg and the second of 100 kg of paste in the process of steeping, deposited in plastic drums. "We must not get involved in problems. I am going to fix things with the secretary for discipline of the night patrol, Mr. Alegria aka `Guitarron,' and with the president, Mr. Macedo," was the lieutenant's remark. The detachment went to Yurimaguas. The amount collected was $2,800 ($800 seized on the island and $2,000 paid by "Passion"). Huarcaya tipped the senior technician $60, those beneath him in rank $40, and $20 to the corporal. The intelligence technician, Reynero Gallo, was the one who actually paid out the shares. And the rest of the booty? Naturally, there were complaints. "The matter is closed and do not test my patience," was how Lieutenant Huarcaya dealt with this issue. "Do you know whether any of this money reached higher ranking personnel?" was an important question asked of the naval witness. "No. The only officer of higher rank was Lieutenant Victor Herrera Sheen, who at that moment was in Lima. Lieutenant Pedro Huarcaya ordered the raid while he was alone. He did everything without informing the director of captaincies, Admiral Texeira, and without informing his superiors in Lima. The CCD Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking, directed by Julio Castro Gomez, has been investigating the case since the end of October 1993. [Box, p 35] The Art of Escaping Not only National Police personnel were involved in the escape of the Colombian drug trafficker called El Ministro, on May 1993, but also naval officers in charge of the Yurimaguas Port Captaincy. Also involved in the illegal liberation of Waldo Vargas Arias, in exchange for a bribe of $100,000, were Navy Lieutenants Victor Herrera sheen and Pedro Huarcaya Briceno, officers who were in charge of the naval base at the port of Yurimaguas at the time. This is what is emphatically stated by the maritime officer, who witnessed the events, and who decided late last year to present himself to the CCD Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking to tell the whole truth. According to his testimony, two policemen whose names he does not know but who he could recognize, turned over to Navy Lieutenant Victor Herrera the sum of $8,000. The money was paid so that the naval officers would allow the departure without the required authorization of the boat or launch on which El Ministro, his companion, and two bodyguards made their escape. A Navy quartermaster named Ramirez was an eye witness to the payment of $8,000 and it was he who communicated the fact to the rest of the personnel of the Captaincy. Quartermaster Ramirez also claimed that four days before the arrival in Yurimaguas of the PNP [Peruvian National Police] Investigative Commission, led by General Rodolfo Angeles, the policemen met with the commander of the Port Captaincy. The Commission did not interview either of the two naval officers. Neither did any Navy inspection team investigate the incident. There is only the report of the appearance of a naval inspector who limited himself to checking the Captaincy's administrative work, according to the version of the accuser that was provided to the CCD Working Group. There is more. With regard to the various irregularities that have occurred at the Port Captaincy of Yurimaguas, the assistant technician of the naval police, Jaime Huaman, submitted a detailed report to the deputy chief of personnel in Lima. But the outcome was negative. Informed of the report, Lieutenant Herrera began to harass technician Huaman. The latter's report described the lack of surveillance of drug trafficking in the area and abuses of authority by the two officers. Lieutenants Victor Herrera and Pedro Huarcaya continued on at the base in Yurimaguas until late last year, in spite of having exceeded the six-month period of assignment to the area established for officer personnel.
