[Ilic] Why Bonn? One could say that President Tudjman made the suggestion to continue the talks in Bonn, after Vienna. President Izetbegovic agreed and both sides asked the German side to host the talks. Germany has so far made great efforts to bring about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has the complete trust of both sides. [Announcer] So this initiative to choose Bonn as the venue for the meeting was made by Croatia and not by the German Government? [Ilic] That is correct. [words indistinct] the initiative came from the Croatian side and, one could say, also from the Bosnian side. [Announcer] Ambassador, could the German Government mediate a little during the meeting, even though the Foreign Ministry officially denies this? [Ilic] As far as I can see, the Federal Republic of Germany will in this case not directly participate in the talks; it will only be the host. [passage omitted] [Announcer] We now have the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which envisages a three-way split of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Muslim, Croat, and Serb part. It is obvious that before such a plan is signed all sides will attempt to secure as much territory as possible. Should such a three-way split come about, will Croatia aim to unite with the Croatian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future? [Ilic] Croatia wants, and it is in the interest of Croatia, that Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a whole, a whole state. Croatia does not want to annex anything. Croatia only wants to defend the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious though that the Serbs want to create a greater Serbia and that is where the idea of a breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina emerges. The Croatian side does not want this. [passage omitted]
