According to official figures, the city reached a 12 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP), the second successive year of over ten percent growth. The city saw the so far fastest rate of construction last year. Partially tempted by the city's unsuccessful bid to host the Olympic Games, it hugely boosted investment in infrastructure work. The 10.2-billion government funds [currency not specified] went to various projects, including highways, flyovers, telephone switch-gear, power, gas and heating stations, as well as sewage and rubbish disposal plants and green land. Foreign funds played a major role in renovating the run-down areas of the city. A total of 900 million U.S. dollars of overseas investment flowed into the city in 1993, of which 70 percent went into infrastructure construction and service industries. As the economy grew, the citizens' income increased. The average per capita income reached 5,500 yuan, 24.4 percent higher than in 1992. Its growth rate beat the inflation rate by eight percentage points. Policemen received the greatest increase in income last year. They earned an average of 6,086 yuan annually, up nearly 40 percent over the previous year. They were followed by enterprise workers, who earned an average of 5,955 yuan, up 25.7 percent over 1992, school teachers who earned an average of 5,638 yuan, up 36.6 percent, and government employees with an annual average of 5,482, up 33 percent. The inflation rate stood at 16.9 percent for the year, according to official statistics. The capital city speeded up the development of a new market system. It has pushed four state-owned enterprises onto the international market by issuing their shares abroad. It continued the process of replacing the old government-sponsored housing system with a more market-dependent housing scheme. A total of 120,000 apartments were sold at their market price last year, a four-fold increase over 1992.
