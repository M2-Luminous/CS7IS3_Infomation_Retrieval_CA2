He is in the Afternoon program studio. [Tiltins] Yes. So it happened that, just one hour apart, news conferences on one and the same incident [detention of two Russian generals on 10 January] were held by both the Council of Ministers and the Saeima. But this only shows the seriousness of the incident. Participants in the press conference at the Council of Ministers were Valdis Birkavs, Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs, and Internal Affairs Minister Girts Kristovskis. All the speakers began with apologies, because the incident undoubtedly dented relations between Russia and Latvia. Foreign ambassadors took part in the news conference and both Valdis Birkavs and Georgs Andrejevs stressed that the incident and the action by Andrejs Rucs and his sympathizers had nothing in common with the government's and the Saeima's policy, and that Russia and other foreign countries would understand that. We have already spoken about the decisions which the Council of Ministers took at its session last night. So then, Andrejs Rucs was dismissed and the Prosecutor's Office started a criminal case. At present Rucs' location is unknown. He is being sought. At least Girts Kristovskis said so. The main thing which is to be carried out now is to determine the accountability and duties of each structure. The structures in question are the home guards and the municipal police. The National Security Council is also working on just that. Girts Kristovskis also noted that the Vidzeme municipal police will today hand over weapons to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Rucs, however, is not taking part in that procedure. One of the most important issues in perceiving the seriousness of the situation is Russia's reaction at the time of the incident. It would be worth listening to what Georgs Andrejevs said. [Begin Andrejevs recording] I will just explain what the president personally heard from both General Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, and President Yeltsin's office. Those two sources clearly said that an order had been given, first of all to Defense Minister Grachev to carry out any necessary [word indistinct] measures, that is President Yeltsin's order. Then, obviously, the army commander also gave an order to place in combat order several divisions, including air force and airborne divisions, stationed near Latvia. Such information was not received in Latvia in written form. But there are no grounds to doubt this information. And quite a few occasions are known from inter-state experience that it has not been even necessary to use such physical violence against officers of such high rank for some superpower to begin without prior (?warning) an attack against the aggressor [words indistinct] who was guilty of such violence. I would (?simply) like to tell you that it was much more dangerous for Latvia that General Mayorov practically gave Latvia half an hour to find out where the generals were, and threatened countermeasures here in Latvia. It seems to me that there is big enough here, the Russian army is stationed. [sentence as heard] So then, if anything had happened, if anything (?even worse) had happened when transporting those generals, with an armed conflict beginning between units which would have tried to stop the transport and guards who had an order from Rucs, he himself affirmed that, to shoot at anyone who would have tried to (?defend) and stop the transport, in that case it would have been difficult to foresee the consequences, because if the Russian Army had moved out of its quarters it would understandably have also encountered resistance from the Latvian side [words indistinct]. [end recording] [Tiltins] In conclusion I would also like to stress the main opinion expressed at the news conference: That this incident does not correspond to the policy laid down and carried out by the government and the Saeima. Foreign ambassadors were invited after the news conference to a brief meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
