The session adopted the resolution on the work report of the standing committee of the provincial CPPCC committee, the resolution on the work report of the motions examination committee, and the resolution on the second session of the seventh provincial CPPCC committee. The resolution called on all CPPCC members; the CPPCC organizations, democratic parties, and mass organizations at various levels across the province; and the personages of all circles to work with one heart and soul under the leadership of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and to make positive contributions to fulfilling the 1994 reform and construction tasks. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the session. He said: In the past year, the provincial CPPCC committee held high the banners of patriotism and socialism; conscientiously exercised the functions for political consultation and democratic supervision; positively participated in and discussed political affairs; and did a lot of work and produced wide influence in promoting reform, expanding the scale of opening up, establishing contacts, eliminating contradictions, promoting social stability, promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization and socialist democratic politics, expanding the contacts with the people at home and abroad, and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The provincial CPPCC committee organized its members, democratic parties, CPPCC organizations to engage in the activities of suggesting ways and means particularly for the promotion of progress in the second pioneering work. Thus, many valuable opinions and suggestions were set forth. All this has made positive contributions to promoting the progress of reform and opening up. Gu Jinchi said: The year 1994 is a year to accelerate the setup of the socialist market economic system. The new situation of setting up the socialist market economic system has set new higher demands on the CPPCC work. We hope that the CPPCC organizations at various levels will conscientiously exercise the functions for political consultation and democratic supervision, suggest better ways and means for setting up the socialist market economic system, closely grasp the two major subjects of unity and democracy, and do a lot of work to safeguard social and political stability. We should conscientiously study ways for bringing into better play the CPPCC's functional role in the new situation of setting up the socialist market economic system and continue to create a new situation in the CPPCC work. Sun Qi, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee, made a speech at the closing ceremony. Sun Qi said: During the session, all participants, with a high-degree sense of responsibility and mission, positively participated in and discussed the political affairs in line with the provincial actual conditions of economic construction, reform, and opening up. All democratic parties positively conducted their functions for participating in political affairs and talked freely. This has embodied the close ties of showing utter devotion to and sharing weal and woe with the CPC. I believe that through the concerted efforts of all members, all tasks as defined at this session will be realized successfully, and the provincial CPPCC committee will further improve its work of participating in and discussing political affairs and make greater progress in its work in the new year.
