Yu Hongmo, a scholar of minor ethnic origin who has been taking part in the survey, said the 12-year survey acquired a huge amount of precious first-hand materials about the ethnic peoples in the province and their natural surroundings, and provided a further insight into their life, customs, economics and culture. The 12 ethnic peoples, namely Miao, Buyi, Yi, Tong, Tujia, Yao and others, account for one-third of the province's population. And most of them live in remote mountainous areas. More than 300 scholars, mainly from the Guizhou Minority Ethnics Institute, the provincial academy of social sciences, the Guizhou Museum and other research bodies, participated in the survey, the second of its kind since the 1950s. Yu, who is director of the Guizhou Minority Ethnics Institute, said most of the surveyors are of ethnic background. Their knowledge of the languages and customs of the people surveyed is critical to the success of the survey. The survey shows that the province's ethnic areas hold more than 8,000 kinds of plants and 300 kinds of animals of important economic value. Among them, 67 sorts of plants are rare and endangered species under government protection, and 68 sorts of animals are either near-extinct or special to the region. The survey also found that the ethnic regions, though underdeveloped, possess rich resources of coal, antimony, phosphorus and mercury that are easy to exploit. Based on their survey, scholars have set forth many suggestions on developing local economies, tourism, ethnic language education, and protection of ethnic cultural heritage which have been widely adopted by the provincial and local government, yu said. Since 1983, scholars have published 11 treatises on their survey findings and studies, which provide a precious reference to ethnic researchers at home and abroad. Yu disclosed that the survey would continue in the future, as the provincial government has agreed to provide further financial support.
