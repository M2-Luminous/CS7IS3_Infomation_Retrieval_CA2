First, commodity prices should be kept stable. Intensive restructuring of means of production is now underway while price reform for coal, electricity, oil, food and cotton covers a wide field which will surely have an impact on prices for consumer goods. The state plans to keep the price rise under ten percent this year in line with the actual situation. Other measures for the sake of steady prices will gradually come into force. Second, economic growth should be kept under control. The central government has set the gain at nine percent which is better for China at this stage. Economic growth should not go beyond the financial and material strength nor should it exceed the capability of society to stand such a burden. Comparisions among departments or regions on the pace of economic development and the number of items to be exploited have to be avoided. Third, agriculture should maintain steady development. Judging from a certain period in the past when economic austerity was seen, agricultural problems first of all surfaced and the central authorities paid much attention to this sector. Rural work meetings and agricultural work meetings and those on food and oil work have since last year been held. Important documents were issued on several occasions to call for relations of the heavy burden shouldered by peasants. Priority should be given to the interests of peasants and agriculture this year. Fourth, the currency should be kept stable with the stabilizing of the currency value the main issue. The central bank has had a strong grip on the money supply and having control on the amount of currency in circulation, the central bank can regulate the general demand for currency. Whether the amount of currency in circulation and the value of currency are kept stable is directly related to the stability of prices, society and economic development. Fifth, social stability is considered a must for reform as well as economic development.
