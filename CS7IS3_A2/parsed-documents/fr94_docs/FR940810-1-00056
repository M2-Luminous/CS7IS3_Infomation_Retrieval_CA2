FR940810-1-00056 FR940810-1-00010 Once a decision is made that a Federal regulatory program is necessary for a State, the Secretary must make several determinations before promulgating a program. Section 504(a) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary take into consideration the nature of the State's terrain, climate, biological, chemical, and other relevant physical conditions. This requirement is also set forth in the regulations for the promulgation of Federal programs at 30 CFR Part 736. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.22(a)(1) also provide that if a State has more stringent land use and environmental protection laws or regulations, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Secretary's regulations. If the State's laws or regulations establish more stringent standards than those of SMCRA or the Secretary's regulations, or if the State regulates any aspect of the environment which neither SMCRA nor the Secretary's regulations protect, the Secretary would then specifically preserve those State standards in the Federal program. Thus the Secretary believes that the requirements of §505(b) of SMCRA can best be met by identifying any State laws and regulations which impose equivalent or more stringent environmental controls and by listing them in §903.700(e) of the Federal program. Also, in promulgating a program for a State, Section 504(g) of SMCRA specifies that any State statutes or regulations which regulate surface mining and reclamation operations subject to SMCRA will be superseded and preempted by the Federal program to the extent that they interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRA and the Federal program. This provision is reinforced by §505(a) of SMCRA, which states that only those State laws and regulations that are inconsistent with SMCRA and its implementing regulations shall be superseded by the Federal program. Thus, State statutes and rules regulating the same activities as those covered by the Federal statute and regulations, but which do not provide as much protection as do the Federal statute and regulations are considered to interfere with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and must be identified and preempted. Finally, according to §504(h) of SMCRA, a Federal program must include a process for coordinating the review and issuance of surface mining permits with other Federal or State permits applicable to the proposed operation. The Federal statutes with which compliance must be coordinated in the issuance of a surface mining permit are set out at 30 CFR 736.22(c). State statutes for which a permit is required must be identified in the process of promulgating a Federal program, and the Federal program must provide for coordination with the permit review and issuance procedures required by those statutes. Federal programs are based on the Secretary's permanent program regulations, 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapters A, F, G, H, J, K, L, and M, which implement five essential aspects of the surface coal mining regulatory program: permitting, performance standards, designation of lands as unsuitable for mining, bonding, and inspection and enforcement. These regulations establish procedures and performance standards under SMCRA and form the benchmark for State and Federal regulatory programs. The permanent regulations refer to the ``regulatory authority,'' which is the Secretary under a Federal program. The Secretary has delegated all of his authority under SMCRA to the Assistant Secretary_Land and Minerals Management. (Secretarial Order No. 3013, Nov. 9, 1977, and Order No. 3099, Dec. 22, 1983). With limited exceptions, the Assistant Secretary has in turn redelegated all of this authority under SMCRA to the Director, OSM (216 Departmental Manual 1, November 9, 1977). Thus, the Director of OSM is the official directly responsible for the implementation of a Federal regulatory program. The parts of the permanent regulatory program regulations that must be included in a Federal program are listed at 30 CFR 736.22(b). They include general requirements and definitions (Parts 700 and 701), the exemption for coal extraction incident to government-financed highway or other construction (Part 707), the designation of lands as unsuitable for surface mining (Parts 761, 762, and 769), permits and permit applications (Subchapter G), small operator assistance (Subchapter H), reclamation bonding (Subchapter J), performance standards (Subchapter K), inspection and enforcement (Parts 842, 843, and 845), and blaster training and certification (Subchapter M). Federal programs are promulgated by means of cross-referencing the permanent program rules which set the substantive standards. Cross-referencing avoids duplication of the full text of the permanent regulatory program rules for each Federal program. The proposed Federal regulatory program for Arizona would establish 30 CFR Part 903. Sections within Part 903 would cross-reference the counterpart permanent program rules. For example, for general requirements for permits and permit applications, proposed §903.773 of the Arizona Federal regulatory program would cross-reference 30 CFR Part 773 of the permanent program rules by stating that 30 CFR Part 773 shall apply to any person who makes application for a permit to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations. For each particular permanent program regulation which needs to be modified for use in a Federal program, an additional paragraph or paragraphs would be added under the appropriate section to modify that particular permanent regulatory program standard to make it applicable to the Federal program State or to add additional requirements or standards.
