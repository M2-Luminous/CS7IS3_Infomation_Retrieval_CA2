Since U.S. President Clinton stated that day that "North Korea's replacing of fuel rods is merely a technical violation," the possibility of a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, which has been suspended since July last year, being held sooner or later, has increased. Thus, it is highly likely that according to this policy of Washington's, the North Korean nuclear problem henceforth will again go through a script for the "dissolution of discord" that forecasts negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] based on a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, and improvement in North-South relations. Besides, in the event that the North Korean nuclear problem is resolved smoothly, relations between North Korea and the United States will even develop into such a level as to establish a liaison office in Washington and Pyongyang respectively during the later half of this year. Experts who have been watching the recent nuclear issue observed that the North Korean nuclear problem will proceed on the following three stages in accordance with a simultaneous or separate timetable. The event to take place in the first stage is negotiation between North Korea and IAEA. The IAEA will soon begin negotiations with Pyongyang over the issue of replacement, storage, and measurement of fuel rods. Second is the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. In the event that additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental power station is carried out as a separate work from replacing fuel rods and sample-taking, the United States will view that the conditions for a third round of talks have been met. Taking into account the fact that additional inspection is being carried out satisfactorily, the possibility of North Korea-U.S. talks being held in early June is very great. It is also likely that the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks will be held in Geneva between Kang Sok-chu, North Korean first vice foreign minister, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state. The United States and North Korea have already worked out detailed political and economic issues to be discussed and exchanged with each other. North Korea has established a long-range goal of establishing diplomatic relations with the United States by taking advantage of recent developments of the situation. Under this long- range goal, North Korea will put forward various short-range demands for the improvement in mutual relations, including suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise; recognition of the North Korean political system; improvement in North Korea-U.S. relations; a promise not to launch a preemptive attack on North Korea; elimination of North Korea from the list of terrorist states, and support for a light-water reactor. There is a possibility that North Korea will demand that these pledges be specified in a document, and will propose holding a Kim Il-song-Clinton summit. On other other hand, the United States will likely demand a guarantee for special inspections by the IAEA; prohibition of nuclear reprocessing; the resumption of North-South dialogue for the joint denuclearization declaration; and a complete return of North Korea to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. It appears that the United States has finalized its position in conformity with the agreement with the ROK that there will be no serious problems in accepting North Korean demands if North Korea's nuclear transparency is insured 100 percent. This signifies that if North Korea resolves its nuclear problem, the United States will implement an epoch-making policy on North Korea, including a long-range plan to recognize North Korea diplomatically . This position has been expressed on many occasions by President Kim Yong-sam and U.S. President Clinton. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu also believes that in a long-range view, improvement in North Korea-U.S. relations will be helpful for bringing North Korea out to the international community. The third stage is North-South relations. Experts observe that if the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks proceed smoothly, positive impact will be exerted on North-South relations which have been in deadlock for a long time. In other words, in the event that the third round of North Korea- U.S. talks proceed satisfactorily, the government, which has been maintaining the "nuclear solution-first and economic cooperation-next policy" for the past two years, will highly likely take an appeasement gesture toward North Korea according to the changes in the situation, including granting permission to ROK businessmen to visit North Korea during the later half of the year. How much weight and what degree of importance North Korea will attach to dialogue with South Korea and to improving its relations with South Korea in the course of carrying out dialogue with the United States will decide on the speed of improving North Korea-U.S. relations. This is because both the ROK and the United States maintain the position that the United States' improving its relations with North Korea should be carried out in parallel with improvement of North-South relations. Professor Yi Pom-chun (Songsin Womens University) said: We must clearly express our strong will to North Korea and the United States that without implementation of ordinary and special inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities and mutual inspections between North and South of Korea in a bid to check North Korea's nuclear weapons development, the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States should not be realized, nor should the United States' economic cooperation with North Korea be pushed for. Both the ROK and the United States are attempting to make an appeasement approach to North Korea, stating "Let us solve the problem through dialogue," despite North Korea's intentional foul play, such as the unilateral act of replacing nuclear fuel rods. However, there certainly is a possibility that a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue may get fouled up into a more difficult status according to the North Korean attitude henceforth.
