At a meeting between Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], Azasm, and the National Education Coordinating Committee in Cape Town it was agreed to set up a committee to collect data on white teachers in black schools. A summit meeting will also be convened to investigate the findings and to discuss the way forward. An Azasm spokesman said the committee should meet within the next month. Azasm denied that the campaign was racist and described it as an attempt to get jobs for unemployed black teachers.
