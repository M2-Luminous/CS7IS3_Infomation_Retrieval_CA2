Nova Bila is first because it has become a symbol of Croatian resistance, of the Croatian survival, of the determination on the part of the Croat people of the Lasva valley -- as well as of the whole of the Croatian homeland, and not only Croats in the homeland, but also those in the diaspora -- to survive here and everywhere else where Croats live. Someone said that this used to be a marginal area. The entire Croatian nation used to be marginal. At that critical, historic moment of the disintegration of the Yugoslav dungeon and the socialist hell, no one wanted an independent, sovereign, and autonomous Croatian state. Consequently, the Croat identity in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself was in jeopardy. Despite this, due to the unity of all Croats, we have managed to establish a democratic and sovereign Croatia because the Croats from Herceg-Bosna, from this Lasva valley, from all over Bosnia, fought first to establish and defend the Croatian republic, the Croatian state. This is why later we could offer assistance to you -- humanitarian and other kinds of assistance -- and prevent the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina from falling into the hands of greater Serbia. This is why we supported the creation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, so we could take part, take decisive part in resolving the destiny of the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is why we managed -- to the surprise and awe of the world -- to defend the Croatian state. There was even this miracle that took place here in Nova Bila where doctors, you, defended the Lasva valley from those who wanted to conquer the Croatian areas. Consequently, the doctors performed miracles in God's temple by operating on even the most serious cases. Thanks to such miracles, relying only on our own strength and on our own wisdom, the world had to recognize us. Today, not only do we have an internationally recognized Croatia but we have allies and friends, too, including the United States, the world's biggest superpower, and all over the world, all the way up to China and Europe. The Washington agreement on the Croat-Muslim federation and the confederation of this Bosnia-Herzegovina federation with Croatia has made it possible for you to no longer remain on the sidelines, so the Croat man here in Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer has to be oppressed and subjugated. He can be sovereign in this federation. By relying on Croatia, Bosnia can remain and become ever more Croatian. [applause] Rest assured, what we have achieved is in the interest of all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Rest assured, this is in the interest of the Croatian state which will now survive. We have not allowed, we will never allow new Bleiburgs to take place [reference to massacre of Serbs and Croats by Tito's partisans in 1945]. Croatia is today a recognized country in the world and has powerful friends and allies. The sole problem rests with the fact that even here in Bosnia-Herzegovina we should get used to a situation in which Bosnia-Herzegovina is now a Croatian country, too, in which the Croatian man is entitled to sovereignty in it. Consequently, we have secured the survival of the Croatian state. We have secured the survival of the Croatian sphere in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sovereignty of the Croatian sphere in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are going to restore what has been destroyed. I promise, we are going to build a new modern hospital in Nova Bila in the interest of the Croat people because this area deserves it. Likewise, we are going to build schools and cultural and economic facilities in the interest of the Croat man. No one is going to chase us away, all the way up to remote Canada, America and Australia, any longer. We are everywhere, from the South to the North Pole. We are going to turn our Croatia into a country to which people will return; they are already returning. This has been accomplished by you, by us all. We can be proud of this miracle performed by the grace of God. Our fate here in Bosnia-Herzegovina is in our hands. Trust yourselves, trust the leadership that made this possible. Greetings.
