The president stressed that it is not the Turkish side that has been creating difficulties for the past 20 years and preventing the achievement of a solution. Demirel received Hakki Atun, prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], today. Demirel said that the Cyprus question is the national cause of every single one of the 60 million citizens of Turkey. He pointed out that there has not been any bloodshed on the island during the past 20 years, and that this is thanks to Turkey, not the United Nations. It is Turkey and its kinsmen in Cyprus that have suffered from the lack of solution, he said, adding that the Turkish Cypriots have been isolated and that their only window and door to the world is Turkey. The president explained that the ethnic purge in Yugoslavia was seen in Cyprus years ago. Turkey is carrying out a just defense by protecting and saving the Turkish Cypriot community on the island, he stated, adding: Eventually, everyone will recognize the right to life of the Turkish Cypriot community. [Begin Demirel recording] However, that will not be enough. It will be necessary to guarantee that right to life. It will be necessary to prevent a return to the old days. The times before 1974 when bloody incidents used to take place are a thing of the past now. When it talks of a political solution, Turkey wants to guarantee its kinsmen's security and the fact that there will not be a return to the old days. After that, it naturally seeks political equality. Turkey is so right, and our kinsmen in Cyprus and the TRNC are so right, that it is ridiculous to try to portray their stand as being wrong or unfair. [end recording] President Demirel stressed that it is not Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots that have been creating difficulties for the solution of the Cyprus problem. The TRNC wants a reasonable, just, and viable solution more than anybody else, he said. Demirel pointed out that it is of great importance that the Turkish Cypriot side become economically self-sufficient. The necessary potential for that exists, he said, and Turkey has always supported it. The president stressed that Turkey is making great efforts to resolve the problem politically.
