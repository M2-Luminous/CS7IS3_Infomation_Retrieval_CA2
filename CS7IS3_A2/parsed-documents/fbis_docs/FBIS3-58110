However, despite the crisis hitting both arms producers and aeronautical manufacturers, Aerospatiale is continuing with its preparations for privatization. Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois yesterday presented an initial review of the group's activity. In doing so he failed to avoid the usual speech of the last two years: How the economic crisis and the slowing of activity have hit the group's civil business, while the reduction in military budgets has impacted on arms activity. All told, Aerospatiale had a terrible 1993. However, although coming at the expense of a drastic restructuring and reduced investment (down to four percent of revenues as opposed to nine percent in previous years), company debt should have been reduced by about one and a half billion French francs [Fr]. Although it is still not possible to come up with an exact figure, the result for 1993 should not be as bad as last year. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the new head of the aircraft division, Claude Terrazzoni, who has only just taken up the post, will not have an easy job. It is true that production has risen to about 138 aircraft and a delivery record was broken last December, when 20 machines were handed over to client companies. The outlook for future years, however, looks much bleaker. The balance of new orders to cancelled orders is zero for Airbus Industrie and amounts to some 30 aircraft for ATR. Moreover, 500 aircraft of previous generations, currently "cocooned," have become profitable again thanks to the drop in the price of petroleum products. This should encourage companies to dip into their stocks before they take out new orders. From the military and space point of view, Louis Gallois could congratulate himself on the fact that the French budget was not as bad as had been feared. It would appear that Aerospatiale has faired better than some of its competitors, and, according to its president, it can claim to be the top European missile producer. In addition, the success of the European Ariane rocket launcher has had positive effects for the whole industry, and for satellites in particular. The weighting of these different elements gives an impression of solidity in spite of everything, with orders worth Fr130 billion -- the equivalent of two and a half years' activity. Nevertheless, revenues for 1993 were once more down by about four and a half percent over the previous year, at Fr49.3 billion. It is fair to say that Louis Gallois, without promising "blood and tears," warned that there was no question of reducing the efforts made within the company. All the more so since Aerospatiale is one of the companies that could be privatized and it would be best to improve its situation still further. Its president believes that the operation is not likely to go ahead this year, and probably not in 1995 either. However, an initial stage, with the arrival of new financial partners, could well precede the actual privatization. It would then coincide with the accounts once more balancing out, which Louis Gallois hopes to achieve in 1996.
