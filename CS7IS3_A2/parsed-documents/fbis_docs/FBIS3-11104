Menem and the diplomats accompanying him reportedly asked for a "concrete gesture" for joining that market as a necessary element for unblocking this issue, over which the U.S. laboratories are especially concerned. This happened in Chile yesterday, during President Eduardo Frei's inauguration. Kantor always uses the expression "Clinton told me that..." to keep up appearances and bridge the gap in ranks. As a matter of fact U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor -- who for all practical purposes is the U.S. foreign trade secretary -- yesterday directly increased his government's pressures on Carlos Menem for Argentina to make progress in promulgating a pharmaceuticals bill before 30 April. Kantor cautioned that the possibility that our country might join NAFTA depends on this promulgation. He also cautioned about the risk that our country might be included in the list of nations that -- for Washington -- deserve economic sanctions. It seems that the Argentine rejoinder was: "Our integration into NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement, which so far is made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada) represents a concrete goal, and maybe a clearer sign of this integration might favor the approval of the pharmaceuticals bill." The Argentine rejoinder might have hinted at a softening of conditions by Washington: Perhaps a definition of the NAFTA issue might still not achieve a final approval of the bill, but it might actually achieve a decision by a committee, or in the sessions hall of one of the two congressional chambers. The hard -- as graphically described by an Argentine source -- one-hour meeting between the president and Clinton's official was held at the Carrera Hotel where Menem is staying in Santiago. Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella; Hector Gambarotta, the Foreign Ministry international economic relations secretary; Jorge Herrera Vega, the Foreign Ministry under secretary for international economic relations; North America Department Director Alfredo Morelli; and Argentine Ambassador to Chile Eduardo Iglesias also participated in the meeting. Menem and Kantor met very early, shortly before leaving for Valparaiso to participate in outgoing Chilean President Patricio Aylwin's transfer of power to Eduardo Frei. In fact, this meeting became President Carlos Menem's most important activity, which was not included in the protocol, during his quick visit to Chile. Upon arriving in Santiago, Kantor, the head of the U.S. delegation for the transfer of power, bluntly said: "Chile is the country that is in the best position to join NAFTA." He extolled Chile's economic and foreign policy, which includes precisely the approval of a patents law -- that is, recognition of all the "copyrights" for all types of foreign technology applied in national manufacturing. The increasingly pressing U.S. interest in the approval of an Argentine patents law -- there is an official bill in Congress that meets Washington's basic specific goals -- is specifically linked to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals with an original U.S. formula. U.S. laboratories claim that the lack of recognition of their "copyrights" in our country represents a yearly $200 million loss for them. Kantor's deadline -- 30 April -- is when the U.S. Government will draw up a list of countries that, in the U.S. Government's opinion, do not respect the rules of honesty in their trade operations structures and which, therefore, will be included in the category of candidates for economic sanctions by Washington. The May deadline is also at stake. In May, Kantor himself must define those countries that will be able to initiate the process of joining NAFTA. Chile is clearly the first candidate, but Argentina and Colombia already have status as precandidates [precandidatos]. Menem and Di Tella had confirmed Argentina's interest in joining NAFTA -- this issue has just been discussed in a Mercosur [Common Market of the South] meeting in Buenos Aires -- when they discussed with Kantor Clinton's proposal for an Americas' Summit. Following the presidential inauguration in Chile, and pursuant to the contents of a personal letter from Clinton that Kantor delivered to Frei, it became known that this summit, which is scheduled to define a sort of continental globalization of political, economic, and social strategies, will be held in Miami in December, even though a precise date has not yet been set. During his private talks with Frei on 11 March and on 9 March Menem did not discuss the issue of his new Chilean counterpart's upcoming "private meeting" with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who will visit Santiago next week to lecture. She was invited by Sofofa [Industrial Development Association], Chile's largest employers' enterprise. Thatcher will reportedly be paid $100,000 for her lecture. Curiously enough, entrepreneurs with large investments in our country, like Heliodoro Matte, are among the sponsors of a visit eliciting strong reactions from the Argentine Foreign Ministry. The two presidents also did not discuss what would happen when Thatcher bumps into Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion during their visit to the aeronautical exposition in the Chilean capital.
