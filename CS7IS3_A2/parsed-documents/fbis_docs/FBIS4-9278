I see someone here on my right wanting to ask a question. [Unidentified official] I would like to ask both Chairman 'Arafat and Minister Peres a simple basic question, which requires not a complex answer but a sincere one. To what extent can we view the peace process as truly irreversible? In other words, will the peace process last and become reality, despite calls to replace the Palestinian leadership and the PLO or that of the Israelis? Can a 50-year-old person still hope to live to see the peace process succeed before he dies? Thank you for your consideration. ['Arafat] Peace in the Middle East is not an expression or a newspaper article. There have been all these years of confrontations, particularly with regard to Palestine, which is the land of the three monotheistic religious, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Well, Palestine has long experienced war, throughout known history. I also ask myself the same question, since we are now facing this prolongation of negotiations and talks. We keep negotiating and negotiating and have yet to achieve a basis on which to proceed with implementation of the agreement. Nothing can be achieved on paper alone, but rather in the field. Well, we do not know how long this process will take. Maybe tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the coming week, or the next month. There are no secrets. What we have agreed upon is on paper, with our signatures on it. We hope. We cannot say that it is within our power to give you the final decision. He must decide. He must say. My people and I are under Israeli occupation. They must decide whether they are going to withdraw or not. [applause] They have to decide whether they want to implement what has been agreed upon or not. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that this will come to pass and I know that Mr. Peres has a very broad vision, but I also know that there are extremists, I know they exist, and I am very sincere about it all. Well, they must understand what this peace means. Peace is a very precious goal for all of us, for our children and their children, and for our new generation and for their new generation. Peace is not only a Palestinian need. It is an Israeli need, a Russian need, an American need, and an international need. However, it is mainly a need for the Middle East, which is the most important strategic area in the whole world. If we do not achieve peace -- but we hope to achieve it, because the alternative is too horrible for words -- we will have complete confusion in our region and new Balkanization. This is not a joke. It is bloodshed, it could lead to further bloodshed. Therefore, from here, I call on Prime Minister Rabin and Mr. Peres, who have the upper hand, to look at the (?plight of those who have less power) and withdraw. [applause] [Peres] To answer your question, I must admit that 50 is a pretty dangerous age. If you survive it, you have already accomplished something. However, to answer your question frankly, even if the Palestinians want to change something or the Israelis want to change the world, well, the world is irreversible and we cannot really change it. This is a new world, and we must enter it, since the new world will not follow us. What is the new world? The Cold War is finished, therefore, there is no one left around to finance cold wars. Likewise, communism collapsed. Many of the Middle East conflicts were supported by the Cold War. If there is no cold war, there are no longer conflicts in the Middle East. Second, I do not believe it is really up to us. You know, I keep wondering what led to the collapse of communism? After all, no other party has emerged in the Soviet Union to bring this all about. No, there was no new party or coup d'etat. It was not the military who overthrew communism and no invasion took place, either. What toppled communism, and will always topple dictatorships, is television, knowledge, and the dissemination of information, which nobody can really halt. The young men from Moscow, Baghdad, Jerusalem, or Bucharest are increasingly watching what is going on in the world. Then, they ask themselves: Why are people in some parts of the world happy and rich, while we get up every morning in poverty? I believe that the change does not depend on the leaders or the countries. The world will become more and more democratic and peaceful, because there is a third reason for it all. I do not believe that the extremists have a future. What are they doing? They are killing, and killing, and killing. What then? They have no other alternative. The alternative does not belong to extremism, but to the mothers in Israel and Palestine who do not want their children to be exposed to the same dangers. Chairman 'Arafat, you said that I am an occupier. You must admit that I am a pretty pleasant occupier. There are not many occupiers like me. However, as a so-called occupier, I am firmly taking my seat at the negotiating table alongside you and I hope we will find a political solution, without force and violence, between the Palestinian and ourselves. I told Chairman 'Arafat about the Israeli saying that the better one's neighbor feels, the better one feels also. Gentlemen, I would like to reiterate that the future is irreversible and, in this context, peace is irreversible, too. [applause] [Chiriac] I have two questions for Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat. First, did you make any progress in the peace talks here in Bucharest? And second, do you think that Romania can still play a role in the peace process in the Middle East. [Moderator] Who is asking the question? [Chiriac] Dan Chiriac, from the ADEVARUL daily newspaper. [Moderator] There will be a news conference for journalists later. [Chiriac] Well, this was my question for both Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Shim'on Peres. ['Arafat] Not to forget that we have a very important meeting this afternoon in which we will all participate; His Excellency [President Ion Iliescu] wants to help give further impetus to this peace process. Therefore, as I said several times at the start of my speech at the Forum proceedings, thank you, thank you Romania. [applause] [Official] International investors are convinced that, if there is peace, the Israeli-Palestinian team and the entire Middle East will again become a growing market, a market for the future. We know that this process can be long-term. Is it possible to develop concrete initiatives between Israelis and Palestinians, such as a mixed Israeli-Palestinian bank, or a joint Israeli-Palestinian company for research projects and water exploitation, or other similar initiatives that can facilitate coexistence on concrete technical and financial planes? ['Arafat] At this point, our economy is an economy under occupation, under Israeli occupation, and it is totally linked to the Israeli economy. When they withdraw, we will raise this question then. I do not want to go into detail now, but, regardless of the situation, we are still under occupation. It is no small thing that we have been suffering for 45 years. When the Israelis withdraw and we manage to establish our national authority, then you can come and see. If you listened to my speech, I referred to several future projects and emphasized that it is our right to have a Marshall plan for the region, which has gone through so many wars, as there was a Marshall plan for Europe. Why should we not also have a Marshall plan in our region? We need it. This applies to the peoples in this region, not only the Palestinians and Israelis, but to all the other Arab states in the zone. They also have a right to profit form a Marshall plan. I even departed from my written text to the session in order to emphasize that we need this plan. [Peres] In my opinion, there should be economic and scientific cooperation between us and the Palestinians. We should take care not to replace a market economy with a national flag economy. I believe that there is more money in the world than ideas. We must develop research activity. The Palestinians and Israelis should jointly concern ourselves with this aspect. [Announcer] I would like to remark on an interesting aspect of this question-and-answer session, namely the languages used by the two leaders, the Israeli and Palestinian ones: Shim'on Peres answers both in English in French, while 'Arafat, aside from Arabic, also just answered a question in English. [Official] I have a question for Mr. Peres in his capacity as professor at Cairo University. Does he think that the developments in the region have conformed to projections in the lectures he has written, or does he now have a new slant on developments in the region? [Peres] As professor at Cairo University, let me give you a very concrete example. There is cooperation between Egypt and Israel in the sphere of agriculture. Our Egyptian friends asked us for technology in the sphere of irrigations, drainage, and other fields. The project proved successful. As a matter of fact, Egypt has become a competitor for Israel in this respect. I doubt that the Egyptians feel that they are subjected to domination from Israel in this respect. We are also cooperating with Morocco and other countries. I believe that all of us have two passports: a national passport, linked to history, and a universal passport linked to science. Science is universal. Science knows no frontiers. It must be made available to everybody. One can achieve a lot through science. [applause] [Official] I represent the German Bundestag. I have a question for both Chairman 'Arafat and Minister Peres. You have just referred to the future. However, before I take up that point, I would like to thank the Romanian people for having created favorable conditions -- at a pretty difficult time for themselves -- for the peace process. The experience we have gained here in Europe, at the end of World War II, makes me ask you a realistic question about the time after the conclusion of the peace process. Do you not believe that too much attention is being paid to the conflict rather than to the assistance required after the end of the conflict? Are you not worried about the fact that the world, including Europe, will lose interest in the region? As you know, the attention here is focused on the European Union and on the processes currently taking place in Europe. What is being done to ensure that, after the end of the conflict, you will get assistance from the European Union? What are your expectations from us? ['Arafat] My viewpoint is the opposite of what you said regarding the Middle East-Europe relationship. While U.S. President Clinton characterized [words indistinct] from Greece, up to the Scandinavian countries and Portugal. Regarding the European participation in this aid program -- meaning the European portion, worth millions of dollars -- we note that the European share is the largest. By that, I mean it has the largest percentage. Therefore, nobody can say that Europe is not interested in the Middle East. Europe has an interest in the region and in the aftermath of peace in the area. We are not living somewhere in Hawaii, but in the Middle East. We have shared history, land, and economy with Europe. We have also shared wars, science, and culture. Everybody knows that the Mediterranean Sea has been viewed as a lake between us and you in Europe. Thanks to my bilateral contacts, I noticed that all European countries of the European Union feel the need to help us. They are particularly interested in the evolution of negotiations between us and Israel and in future development plans in the region. I said that in my speech to the conference and I even made references to the private sector. We would like the European private sector to support us and we want to mutually support and encourage each other. Therefore, I suggest you revise your viewpoint and your sources of information. Thank you. [Peres] Well, let me say something as an associate member of the Common Market -- as you know, Israel is an associate member and Palestine is also indirectly associated to the Common Market. In the future, Palestinians will probably also want to become members of the European Union. However, I want to tell you something. Europe has become so productive and efficient that all the Europeans can produce now is unemployment; the more productive Europe becomes, the more unemployed can be found in Europe. Therefore, we ask the Europeans: Why should you spend so much money on unemployment? Why not export these unemployed to help build societies, that is, send them to some social markets? The cost is the same. Why reduce the size of your companies, the number of jobs, and thereby create so many problems? For instance, in the Middle East -- I am not referring to geographic markets only, but to social ones, too -- you should try to help people in the Middle East increase their living standard by setting up and building nuclear plants, roads, and so forth. You can better recover your money that way. This is what the Ford company did. Lenin introduced discipline in this respect. I know that the governments have budgets. We have a state president here who can confirm that to you. Therefore, governments have budgets, but they do not release the money, because all the money is used at the national level. On the other hand, the companies have money but no ideas and companies will never invest money in a region marked by danger and question marks about it. What we would like to suggest to the Europeans is that their governments give guarantees to their own companies, so that the latter can invest their money in new areas. Europe must choose between freezing their own economies and expanding their ideas. I believe that there are great possibilities now and I believe that we agree with the Palestinians in this respect -- that there should be a change in this sphere: Instead of selling weapons to us, the Europeans should give us money to build our homes; the Americans can build bridges, airports, and other projects in the region. I believe this is the real proposal we want to make. [applause] [Announcer] This is the end of the question-and-answer session.
