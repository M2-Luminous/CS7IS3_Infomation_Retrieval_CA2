Therefore, all echelons and sectors, especially grassroots establishments, face numerous difficulties in implementing national defense tasks. What is your opinion about this issue? [Dao Dinh Luyen] In implementing the principle of "state control over society by means of law and constant efforts to strengthen the socialist legal system" in all domains, including national defense, in its capacity as a state organ in charge of overseeing national defense, the Ministry of National Defense has suggested that the National Assembly, the Council of State (now the National Assembly Standing Committee), and the Government review and adopt many important legal documents directly relating to national defense tasks, like the Laws on Selective Service and People's Army Officers and the Regulations on Safeguarding National Defense Projects and Military Installations. At the same time, it has coordinated with the various ministries and sectors in promulgating many interministerial and intersectorial directives to guide the implementation of the aforementioned legal documents. It can be said that those national defense-related laws and regulations have gradually been supplemented to meet the requirements of the new situation. Nonetheless, it is necessary to admit that the existing national defense law and policy are still inadequate and "backward" compared with the changes for the better in the socioeconomic situation and with the requirements of the current national defense tasks aimed at protecting the Fatherland and socialist regime. Many legal documents were promulgated a long time ago and applied to the system of state subsidization and management by the central government and in the situation prevailing during the national salvation struggle. Given the current situation, they are no longer appropriate. This very drawback has to some extent affected the implementation of national defense tasks by the various echelons, sectors, localities, and grassroots establishments. This situation requires adequate investment to formulate laws to institutionalize national defense policies and lines in the the party's resolutions. As an immediate objective, it is necessary to resolve major issues as follows: -- Continued efforts are needed to improve and perfect the national defense budget and set local level-national defense expenditures and funds at an early date. -- Steps must be taken to formulate a policy on science and technology in support of national defense. -- Plans must be worked out to resolve the problems concerning the rear-army policy and military mobilization preparedness. It is important to work out a well-defined management, inspection, and reward mechanism suitable to the implementation of national defense tasks at all echelons to ensure uniform application of national defense policies and lines. [Correspondent] Is there any differences between the amendments and supplements to the Law on Selective Service this time and those in 1990? What are the basic contents and general standpoints of the amendments and supplements this time? [Dao Dinh Luyen] The existing Law on Selective Service was adopted by the Seventh National Assembly on 30 December 1981. The Eighth National Assembly amended or supplemented a number of articles of this law on 21 December 1990. However, in view of the need to build and develop the army and consolidate national defense and security arrangements to effectively defend our Fatherland and regime, we must conduct a comprehensive study to formulate a national defense law that covers many fundamental issues relating to the building of an all-people national defense system and people's Armed Forces... The formulation of such an important legal document requires time and other laws and regulations. Given the changes for the better in all aspects of the national situation, especially in the economic field, we must amend or supplement a number of essential articles that affect most directly the implementation of citizens' selective service. The key contents of amendments or supplements to the Law on Selective Service this time focus on three main issues as follows: 1. Defining the responsibilities of economic organizations, including private business establishments, share-holding corporations, limited partnership corporations, joint business ventures with foreign countries... toward the implementation of the Law on Selective Service of the Vietnamese state. 2. Further clarifying the responsibilities of the local authorities and the Selective Service Council at all levels toward the implementation of the Law on Selective Service. 3. Supplementing or amending a number of systems and policies to make them consistent with the situation and help strengthen the building and development of the army. [Correspondent] Why does the current Law on Selective Service not stipulate the obligations for youth who do not serve in the army? In fact there are a large number of youth in this category who pose a pressing problem in the annual troop induction work. What are the measures to resolve this problem to ensure social justice? [Dao Dinh Luyen] To ensure social justice for those who serve in the army and those who do not is an essential task. However, this is a difficult and complicated problem that cannot be comprehensively and definitely resolved overnight. For example, it is very difficult to organize production activities for youth who are not recruited for the army, especially when we still need more jobs for workers in society. Besides, the state must spend a lot of money to handle this issue. But if we decide that those who do not want to serve the army must contribute money in compensation for their military service, then we must be very careful to ensure justice in this regard. As far as the Law on Selective Service is concerned, it is concentrated only on the policy and a mechanism aimed at improving the daily life of troops in active service, discharged soldiers, and those who are classified as a reserved force so as to ensure justice for these people. As a result, I would like to suggest that the state formulate and promulgate a regulation on appropriate contributions by youth who do not serve in the army in the cause of national defense and construction. [Correspondent] Public opinion at present is very indignant about those who violate the Law on Selective Service (those who are dodging, ignoring the military service obligation, and deserting their units) and are not seriously dealt with by the law. Why is there still a "lenient" policy on this issue and what are the measures to resolve this problem in the days ahead? [Dao Dinh Luyen] The Law on Selective Service stipulates various measures for punishment in this regard, while the Criminal Code also clearly defines measures to deal with law violations and punishments for violators. In reality, we have on many occasions punished and reeducated those who violated the law. However, in some cases, serious and prompt action was not taken against them. The following are some of my observations: -- The local administrations, such as village (ward) and district (precinct) administrative units and other local law enforcement agencies, must take the first serious action against those who have dodged or ignored the military service obligation. In some places and at certain times, the agencies concerned in some localities have failed to satisfactorily carry out this task. Many responsible agencies did not optimally exercise their authority to help the local administration deal with those who violate the law. -- In the army, generally speaking, military units and commanders of legal agencies in the army have promptly and severely dealt with those who violated rules and regulations. One obvious problem at present, however, is that we have failed to deal severely with those who have deserted their units. This is because we do not have a unified measure and a close coordination between the army and the local administration to carry out this task. Although we have taken a number of actions, such as imposing fines or labor punishments against the violators, these measures have not been officially defined in a uniform manner and have therefore failed to deal severely with the violators, while creating indignation among the people. To resolve this problem, in the near future, the Ministry of National Defense will coordinate with responsible agencies to formulate regulations to deal with violators and submit them to the state for approval. The ministry will, on the other hand, cooperate more closely with the local administration and other law enforcement agencies to monitor and deal promptly and severely with those who violate the law. [Correspondent] What policy and measures should the State and the Ministry of National Defense have to make the Law on Selective Service (after it was amended, supplemented, and approved by the National Assembly at this session) widely known by the public, firmly grasped by sectors concerned, and effectively implemented by law enforcement agencies? [Dao Dinh Luyen] The law on Selective Service is one of the key laws of the State. A large number of people are subjected to this law while its implementation is on a nationwide-scale. Improper implementation of the law may impact on the material and spiritual life of the people and the mind and attitude of cadres and combatants. As a result, supervision of the implementation of this law must be close and careful. To seriously and effectively implement the law, proper attention should be paid to the following key tasks: 1. It is essential to improve national defense education and enhance the military service obligation awareness among the people, youth, and reserved forces in various units of the party organizations, state agencies, and mass societies so as to motivate them to enthusiastically implement and abide by the law. Efforts must be made to combine the education task with that of motivating the people to respect and abide by the state laws. 2. We must strive to uphold the responsibility of various echelons, sectors, localities, and military units in implementing the law under the unified guidance of party committees and the management of administration agencies. Efforts must be made to bring into full play the responsibility of branches, sectors, and mass organizations in this regard while upholding the staff role of military agencies in localities. Commanders of various army units must uphold their responsibility in strengthening education and training and improving the daily life of their units. 3. Efforts must be made to satisfactorily implement the army's rules and regulations; and to continue to study, review, and supplement various essential lines and policies to encourage cadres and combatants to actively build the army and the reserved force while enthusiastically improving their training and standing ready for any assignments.
