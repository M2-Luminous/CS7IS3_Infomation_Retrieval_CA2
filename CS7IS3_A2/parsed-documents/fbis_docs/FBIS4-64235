It will remain centered on the economic crisis and political corruption, with the element -- added in the state of the nation debate -- of holding the prime minister directly responsible for both problems. This was confirmed by People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar at the People's Party Standing Committee meeting yesterday. Aznar fired very heavy broadsides against Felipe Gonzalez, and went so far as to say that the head of government "is prepared to ride roughshod over the country provided that he does not resign." The main opposition party will also hold CiU [Convergence and Union] and Jordi Pujol directly responsible for the impossibility of submitting a censure motion against the government. The People's Party leader was sparing of words at the Standing Committee meeting in Madrid, devoted almost exclusively to examining the outcome of the parliamentary debate. Aznar expressed his impression that he "was in touch with the public" in the speech which he delivered in the Congress of Deputies. "We discussed the problems which interest the public," he stated, and the public "are aware that Gonzalez is the problem and that he must therefore go." But, according to the People's Party leader, the prime minister "has a destabilizing stance, prepared to ride roughshod over the country and to create an extremely grave and absolutely uncontrollable institutional crisis rather than resign." Following this diagnosis, Aznar called on his supporters to stay "calm in the face of any circumstance which may arise," and stated that one of the tasks awaiting them is to defend themselves against the biased impression that there are similar levels of corruption in all the parties, and to demonstrate that in this the People's Party members "are not the same as the Spanish Socialist Workers Party." In addition, the People's Party has opened up a new line of argument in order to hold CiU and Jordi Pujol responsible for the impossibility of submitting a motion of censure against the government. The People's Party is responding in this way to the Catalan nationalists' attacks over the weekend. Pujol and Miquel Roca accused Aznar's party of being anti-Catalan nationalist, and called for not a single Catalan vote to be cast for its European slate. The People's Party response is to try to increase the pressure on Pujol's coalition in order to ensure that its support for the government ends up having a cost at the polls. CiU's support for the government was one of the arguments put forward at the Standing Committee meeting to explain why recourse was not had to a censure motion. The other explanation, set forth by Secretary General Francisco Alvarez Cascos, is that a censure motion was of no interest to the People's Party itself. "In the case of a censure motion, you debate and vote on the government's alternative blueprint," Alvarez Cascos stated. "What mattered to us now, what the public were demanding, and what mattered to the country was to debate the situation to which Gonzalez' government has led Spain; not what Spain would be like if the People's Party were in power." Aznar's party did not wish to distract attention from the government's responsibilities in the corruption cases, or forgo inflicting severe damage, and did not do so. This is what Alvarez Cascos told his Standing Committee colleagues. For the future, the People's Party leaves the door open to a censure motion, but states that it it will cross the threshold only if there is a chance of Pujol and CiU moving. The Standing Committee meeting was devoted almost entirely to the outcome of the parliamentary confrontation, which the People's Party deems a complete victory, taking as its basis the opinion polls published by EL PAIS following the last two state of the nation debates -- 1992's and last week's. Aznar's political stature, the party leadership believes, has grown during this time, and the impact of his speeches on public opinion has increased. Also on the basis of the polls, the People's Party believes that an important change has occurred in the public's priorities, which endorses its strategy. Terrorism has disappeared from the first place among collective concerns. The two problems which now worry the Spanish people most are the economic crisis (51 percent of those consulted) and corruption (32 percent). Two years ago, the last-mentioned issue was cited in a predominant place by only 8 percent of those consulted.
