[Shevchuk] Your Eminence, in one of your first interviews after your election as the First Hierarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church by the Synod of Bishops in Kharkov, you said that you were returning to Ukraine to serve the interests of your people. What is behind these words now, a year and a half since? [Sabodan] Our church of Christ has only one goal--to devote all of its efforts to the people among whom we live and whom we humbly serve. Of course, tragic events have broken out in Ukraine in conjunction with the emergence of three branches of Orthodoxy. Many complications have resulted from two patriarchates and two patriarchs existing now. This is indeed affecting our relations. However, we must labor, pray, and be concerned about our people for the Lord to unite us, for accord and peace to prevail in the territory of Ukraine. [Shevchuk] Could you tell us briefly about what your church amounts to at present? [Sabodan] We have 6,000 parishes, 5,000 clergymen, 49 monasteries and convents, 12 theological seminaries that train cadres for ministry, 28 dioceses, and 30 bishops. We favor the acquisition of the status of a national Orthodox church by our church; at present, 15 such churches exist in the world. We should also take into account the mood of the people, who are now tense and frightened with these divisions, unifications, and separations. Unfortunately, the very word "autocephaly" has been compromised. We have yet to work with the clergy, the monks, and our lay members for them to understand that the path to a national church is natural. Other churches, which are currently independent, have also traveled it. We have already repeated our point of view many times--this is about an autonomous, independent church; this must be done through an expression of the will of not just the bishops, but also the clergy and the believers. Otherwise, an even sadder split will result than the one we already have. [Shevchuk] What is your connection with the Moscow Patriarchate at present? [Sabodan] We are an independent, self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church. It is just that, in keeping with the statute, we refer to the name of the Most Holy Patriarch Oleksiy during the high mass. We are thus united with other national churches. The Holy Synod leads our church entirely and completely. The patriarch does not interfere in our affairs on any issue. Recently, he even sent us a letter in which he stated that neither the Patriarchate nor he personally has any claim to either the church lands in the territory of Ukraine or the property and buildings. He testified: All that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church got over a millennium is its acquired property, and it will be the master of it. [Shevchuk] To your mind, are there any prospects for coming together in a United Orthodox Church? Is something being done to this end by both parties? [Sabodan] We have to put our faith in God, because only God, rather than the people, may unite that which is disunited, and save that which is perishing. We now have aggravated relations with the Kiev Patriarchate, or more precisely, there are no relations. There have been attempts at the level of laymen, and they have not worked out. There have been attempts at the level of the clergy and theologians, which, unfortunately, have not been crowned with success, either. We will wait.... [Shevchuk] We have happened to hear repeatedly from the Kiev Patriarchate that it has turned to you with a special appeal concerning unification but that you have not responded to this, and have, allegedly, refused to engage in any dialogue. [Sabodan] Nobody has sent any appeals officially. There was an official invitation to the All-Ukrainian Church Council, which was held in October. However, we could not attend it. We have our own canonic principles, apostolical rules with regard to relations and joint prayer. Therefore, all of this has not been due to some whim. Sometimes they accuse me of being ambitious, of allegedly wanting something special. I do not have any ambitions. I do not have a life other than that of the church, and I think I will not have one until I die. I was elected by the bishops, the people ratified this at the council, and I see my mission as doing everything for the Holy Church that I am capable of to the full extent of my energies. [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, is it true that in the offices "on high" it was proposed to you to unite and to head the Ukrainian Orthodoxy? [Sabodan] There was such a conversation. Just break with Moscow and take over everything. However, as I understand it, and not I alone, but the totality of our Ukrainian Orthodox Church, anything at all may be proclaimed, and we may break with anyone at all, but if there is to be a serious discussion of the future of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, of all Orthodoxy in Ukraine, this should be done in a legitimate manner. Our church should be recognized by all local Orthodox churches. [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, we would like to hear specifically from your lips why your church, in essence, failed to take part in the commemoration of the famine in Ukraine. After all, this fact has caused indignation in certain circles and is still being variously interpreted.... [Sabodan] Indeed, there were such interpretations. We were accused of boycotting the commemoration of this event. This is not true. At the time, I was on a business trip abroad, but three of our metropolitans, members of the Synod, were present both in the Ukraine Palace and at the memorial rally. This has to do with the arrangement we made: We would come onto this stand, but on the condition that this would be a rally rather than worship. When they saw that Filaret, who had been defrocked, proceeded in the capacity of an archpriest and actually led the prayers, our bishops did not come to the podium, because this was, as a matter of fact, a divine service. We commemorated this sad event in all dioceses. I issued an epistle. Therefore, we did take part, and we are pure before God and the people. [Shevchuk] By the way, your priests frequently repeat that the Kiev Patriarchate and its clergy are not canonic. In turn, the latter call you noncanonic. They say that the bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate have been ordained with the blessing of the KGB and communist propaganda.... To tell you the truth, it is not that easy to sort this out from the outside. What would you say about this? [Sabodan] The now late Patriarch Mstyslav did not recognize the creation of this association, of this new church structure in Ukraine, although they consider themselves his followers. What about the specifics of apostolic rules? Yes, to us this is a noncanonic church, and we say this for a reason. Not a single church in the world has recognized the Kiev Patriarchate as a legitimate, canonic church. These are not my conclusions, but rather the reality of life. [Shevchuk] And what about the assertions of the Kiev Patriarchate? [Sabodan] Everyone defends himself. Inquire with them. However, it is necessary to have courage and call things by their names. [Shevchuk] Here is one more aspect. Representatives of the Kiev Patriarchate say that you have illegally seized monasteries, in particular, the Kiev-Pechora Lavra, and that quite recently you tried to take the Feodosiya Church forcibly. Does this conform to the truth? [Sabodan] Together with the people, we consider ourselves--and this is the case--the followers of the church that was created by Prince Volodymyr--the Russian Orthodox Church of ancient Rus. We did not take anything away--we came as successors. Nobody seized the Lavra; it is just that Metropolitan Filaret was not allowed to enter it after he was defrocked. What about the dioceses? At present, it is the practice precisely of the Kiev Patriarchate to seize our churches. For example, they recently seized one in Chernovtsy, and there was an attempt in the Rovno area.... The Church of Intercession at Solomyanka was taken from us illegally.... As far as the Feodosiya Church is concerned, this is how it was. On the morning of 27 December, Archimandrite Valentin, the secretary of Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendych) and eight of the monks, who represented the monastery, came to me and brought all documents and the seal: "We ask to be admitted to the Lavra...." They said: The UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] came by the day before, we cannot endure. I told them that we would not display any aggressiveness. If they wanted to remain at the monastery and become members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in a canonic manner, through penitence, they were welcome to. Then they began to ask that at least someone accompany them. Several monks agreed. They were shown the premises and the chattels; however, we did not intend to have something signed over in a protocol. They held a supplication service at the church and went their own ways. In the middle of the day, 20 priests of the Kiev Patriarchate came: Where are the Russkies, what did they do here? And they closed the church. This is how it all ended. We did not intend to seize it. This is not our position. This is not the way of the church, although our people make many complaints to me: Enough of being silent, they say, we should storm it.... Everybody, beginning with the bishops, accuses me of passivity, of not provoking some kind of aggression. They say that we should meet violence with violence. However, an interdenominational war would begin in that case. God forbid. I do not want to be involved.... [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, what is your assessment of the withdrawal of five bishops from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev Patriarchate and their switch to your church, which has already been publicized in the press, especially of Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendych), the administrator of affairs of the Kiev Patriarchate, who had started out in the UAPTs [Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]? [Sabodan] As far as Metropolitan Antoniy is concerned, he has not approached us--neither me personally nor our Church. He has not asked in writing or verbally to be accepted. I do not know his whereabouts. VECHIRNIY KYYIV reported that he has been assigned to the Saratov Diocese. This is not true. Four bishops have approached us: of Vinnitsa--Spyrydon, of Kharkov and Poltava--Roman, of Zhytomir and Ovruch--Sofroniy, and of Yagotin--Ioan. We accepted the last two. [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, to tell you the truth, I did not expect you to give this interview in the Ukrainian language. It is a pleasure to hear it from you. A question in conjunction with this: Why is then instruction offered in Russian in theological seminaries in which the boys are, for the most part, from rural areas? [Sabodan] Subjects such as the history of Ukraine and the history of the Bible are taught in Ukrainian, but there are problems. It is not easy to provide textbooks in Ukrainian for the process of instruction within a short period of time. However, we are working on this, and we will gradually switch to Ukrainian.... [Shevchuk] Why do your priests preach in Russian in the rural churches? What is this, a requirement? [Sabodan] Precisely, a decision was made by the Synod last year: Where the people want it, where the majority accepts the Ukrainian language as that of the service--go ahead.... [Shevchuk] What would you like to say in summation of our conversation? [Sabodan] I have already told you: We should pray primarily for them to see the light, so that there will not be these acts of violence in which some people's deputies got involved and still get involved, beginning with the famous decision whereby the Supreme Council determines what is or is not canonic in the Orthodox Church. For example, is the Kharkov Council canonic or not? It would be ridiculous if it were not so serious. This cannot happen in any civilized state. Now there is the decision about having services alternately. This is a new conflict; this will not happen without violence. It is precisely the interference from deputies, especially in Volyn and the Rovno area, that brings about a terrible fight and anger among the people. If such interference from the state continues, nothing good will come out of it; it will be a calamity for our Ukrainian people, who are facing so many problems--moral, ethical, cultural, and political--to begin with. What if there also is a calamity in the church? Unfortunately, as a matter of fact, it already exists.... I would like to finish this conversation of ours with the wish that God might enlighten our government and all of us, the people in and outside of the Church, so that the method of violence be eliminated from our lives altogether, because it will bring about horrible things. Then it will be too late.... If it is resolved by violence, I, for one, will have difficulty continuing to hold back our people. They will not listen to me at all. [Shevchuk] Well, thank you for the statements that we heard from the horse's mouth. It is possible that some of the questions were not quite pleasant for you, but I believe they are timely. Our present-day life and our readers bring them up.
