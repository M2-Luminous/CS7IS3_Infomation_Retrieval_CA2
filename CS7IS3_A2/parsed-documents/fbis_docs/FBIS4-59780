In a telephone interview from Cairo with our correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi, Dr. Sha'th said reports received from the Gaza Strip and Jericho show things are going very well. The same applies to the reports he received from Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli negotiations team, he added. Asked about 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg, in which he called for jihad to liberate Jerusalem, Dr. Sha'th said there are things which are sometimes interpreted in an exaggerated manner. Dr. Sha'th said the PLO decided to form the Palestinian authority at this stage from those who have already been chosen until the other members of this authority are named. He added that negotiations on the transfer of powers to the Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank will begin after the blessed 'Id al-Adha.
