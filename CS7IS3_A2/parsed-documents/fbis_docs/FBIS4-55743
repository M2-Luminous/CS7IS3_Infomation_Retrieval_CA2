The program covers new trends in cooperation between the Czech Republic and the EU. The principal change is the PHARE shift from only technical assistance to support for specific projects, particularly in transportation and the environment. Great attention will also be paid to the preparation of Czech institutions for future integration into EU structures. According to Pavel Bratinka, the key sphere is private business, with an emphasis on restructuring industry and developing small and medium-size enterprises. Another sphere on which PHARE will concentrate is education. The project also intends to assist in reinforcing the social net. It is expected that a total of 60 million ECU's (approximately 2.04 billion korunas) will be spent on new obligations of the PHARE program.
