Tzou and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- Representatives from Chile and New Zealand Wednesday [23 March] expressed strong support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). They also hoped that Taiwan's GATT entry would help boost bilateral trade ties, Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) told reporters here. Huang is in Geneva for a series of bilateral tariff negotiations with GATT members. Ernesto Tironi Barrios, Chile's chief negotiator, said he supported early GATT entry for Taiwan based on Taiwan's current economic and trade situation and its efforts to speed up tariff and taxation reforms. Barrios, who asked Taiwan to cut import duties on 27 agricultural and 37 industrial products, reportedly was pleased as most of his requests met with favorable responses from the Taiwan delegates. Chile is a major exporter of apples, pears, peaches and brass. Chief New Zealand negotiator Alastair Bisley, who issued a list of 300 items for tariff reductions, also asked Taiwan to levy a single tax on imported beef and eliminate its current multi-tier system. Both Barrios and Bisley expressed concern that Taiwan is still protecting its agricultural sector by imposing quantity controls and area restrictions on farm imports. Although Taiwan has pledged to adhere to GATT's fair-trade practices and applied to join GATT as a developed country, Huang, leader of the Taiwan delegation, noted that some of Taiwan's industries are not fully developed and still require some protection. "We hope that Taiwan's non-tariff trade barriers can be transferred into tariffication in seven years which complies with the free trade spirit of the Uruguay Round trade accord," Huang told his counterpart negotiators. Besides Chile and New Zealand, Taiwan officials have negotiated with representatives from Hungary and South Africa since Monday. Both Hungary and South Africa said Taiwan should eliminate non-tariff trade barriers like regional restrictions and quantity controls. They added that Taiwan's prohibition on the import of red beans, green beans and animal internal organs is not acceptable. Taiwan negotiators will meet with officials from Turkey and Australia Thursday and Friday for more bilateral tariff talks. According to Huang, 21 countries have requested tariff-reduction negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these talks will be key to Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade body. Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer under the name of "the Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
