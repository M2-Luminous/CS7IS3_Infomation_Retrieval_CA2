FBIS4-54674 "dreeu086_k_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-086 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 CROATIA Dispute of Shareholders, Privatization Fund Dispute of Shareholders, Privatization Fund 94BA0256A Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA in Serbo-Croatian 14 Apr 94 pp 6-7 94BA0256A Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by Miomir Strbac: "Transformation Conflict in 120 Pictures"] [Text] The Privatization Fund's right to increase the value of its principal and the buyer's ownership package by approving additional capitalization of enterprises is viewed by small shareholders as robbery, and by the presidents of commercial courts as "a flagrant violation of rights," but the fund retorts that "they are interpreting the law in a hostile manner and undermining the state." The dispute over additional capitalization, which was sparked by the case of Split's Dairy, is currently before the Constitutional Court, and 120 buyers are in doubt as to whether what they have bought will be granted them. The case is called U-171/94, and it is just now in the process of being resolved by the Constitutional Court. The problem that is being dealt with within the covers of the documents with that designation, in dry lawyers' language, is designated as "additional capitalization--entry in the registry." In practice, however, during discussions of that same subject completely different expressions are being used, and thus some people are talking about theft and robbery, others about a flagrant violation of the rights of small shareholders, and yet others think that the statements of the former (and to some extent the latter) are "a hostile interpretation of the law equivalent to destruction of the state." Just the harsh words used in those verbal clashes indicate that this is a hot dispute, and when it also turns out that the "former" are small shareholders (and a large number of ordinary citizens), the "latter" are the presidents of Croatia's commercial courts, and the "yet others" are the Croatian Privatization Fund, it is clear why the entire problem has been transferred to the Constitutional Court, before too much of a public hue and cry could be raised and before teams of supporters could be formed. From Disputes to Arrests Nevertheless, while the constitutional judges, in the peace of the country's highest judicial institution, are leafing through and analyzing the materials they have received, the polemics, nervousness, and conflicts outside of that court building have not stopped. Furthermore, one of the incidents that have emerged in the dispute over the case of "additional capitalization--entry in the registry," namely Split's Dairy, resulted a few days ago in the arrest of the protagonists of that additional capitalization, Sinisa Caktas, Ivo Cecuk, and Ferri Toth, with an uncertain outcome. At the same time, as many as approximately 120 transformations in Croatia have been completed following the model over which the "constitutional war" has been started, and so now a big question mark is written over each of them. Let us go in order, then. Everything started back in February 1993, when amendments to the Law on Transformation restricted the right of employees and other privileged groups to purchase shares to 50 percent of the assessed value of an enterprise. The Privatization Fund, to which the rest of the shares were required to be transferred, however, was given the right to sell them to the highest bidder after publishing a public advertisement for that purpose. Sales of shares following that model started in mid-1993, and as a rule the bidders, along with buying an offered package of shares in a given enterprise, also offered additional capitalization in varying amounts. At that time such an arrangement seemed indisputably good and desirable, both from the standpoint of the buyer of the shares, the Privatization Fund (and thus the state), and probably also the small shareholders. In fact, it turned out, logically, that investors are not willing to invest hundreds of thousands or millions of German marks [DM] in shares in any enterprise without obtaining a majority ownership and management package. That was ensured precisely through additional capitalization, which increased the firm's capital and expanded the shareholder stock, which was 50 percent larger in the buyer's hands. As far as the state is concerned, its calculation was that additional capitalization meant fresh capital that would help restructuring, modernizing, and developing the firms sold, and would accelerate desirable privatization. For the same reason, employees were supposed to believe that additional capitalization and privatization would bring them new economic vitality, a more certain future, and higher wages. The Shareholders Do Not Believe It We say "were supposed to believe" because it soon turned out that at some enterprises the small shareholders, above all, believe that through the decision on additional capitalization of their firm without their consent, the fund was unfairly seizing control over the enterprise and their own fate out of their hands, and leaving them at the mercy of a private businessman who, as he saw fit, could declare them surplus, dismiss them, pay them badly, or disband and sell off "their" enterprise. Those are the cries with which the first protests began--i.e., at the level of raising an uproar over justice and robbery--and since they began very soon to embrace ideas about the Privatization Fund's illegal action and arbitrary action in all this, the fund decided to protect itself. At the end of last year, without any opposition whatsoever from the Assembly deputies, it proposed and obtained an amendment to the Law on Transformation that authorized it to increase, by its own decision, the principal of an enterprise being transformed into a stock company by the amount of additional capitalization that was accepted. It seemed that everything was now all right, as least as far as the legal aspect was concerned. As ill luck would have it, the Zagreb enterprise Pismorad appealed to the Croatian Constitutional Court to investigate the legality of that legal authorization for the fund, and then the presidents of all the commercial courts in Croatia met in Zagreb on 9 February. This was, therefore, a group that from the legal standpoint can discuss very authoritatively a subject like "additional capitalization--entry in the registry." On 11 February Vladimir Gusin, president of the High Commercial Court, sent the conclusions from that meeting to all subordinate courts, with instructions to inform all judges and employees at court registries with them, but also the Croatian Constitutional Court, the government, the Ministry of Justice, the Assembly, the Public Legal Defender, the Privatization Fund.... In those conclusions, analyzing the legal provision that allows the Privatization Fund, by its own decision, to increase the principal of an enterprise in the process of transformation by the amount of the additional capitalization accepted, the presidents of the commercial courts also say the following: "This provision of the Law on the Transformation of Socialized Enterprises is in direct violation of the provision in article 49, paragraph 4 of the Croatian Constitution, which says, `Rights acquired through the investment of capital cannot be reduced by law or any other legal act,' as well as the provision of article 48, paragraph 1, which guarantees ownership rights. By applying the disputed provision of the Law on Transformation, the Croatian Privatization Fund is flagrantly violating the shareholders' rights, since by converting the additional capitalization proposed into additional shares, it is depriving the other shareholders of the right to participate in additional capitalization, and proportionately reducing the other shareholders' already acquired rights and the amount of their investments." The consequences are also explained using the example of a firm where small shareholders have acquired 50 percent of the shares and management rights, but when the fund sells the rest of the shares and the buyer accepts additional capitalization, "not following the procedure in the Law on Commercial Companies and the means of additional capitalization regulated by the company's charter, he acquires majority rights, and what happens in practice is that he replaces management bodies, decides on dismissing workers, and so forth." Illusion of Fresh Money The presidents of the commercial courts also took the position that the claim that additional capitalization brings "fresh blood," i.e., fresh money, into the economy is unacceptable, and "an illusion for the uninformed," because in the vast majority of cases the funds for additional capitalization come from loans from domestic banks, and thus that represents merely a transfer of existing capital, and not an infusion of new capital. "For the above-mentioned reasons, we are pointing out to the registry courts that any entry of additional capitalization carried out in that manner is unconstitutional and illegal, and we recommend delaying entries in the manner described until these issues are discussed at the proper level." It was not necessary to wait long for the fund's reaction. It was sent in the form of an extensive letter signed by the fund's president, Ivan Penic, as soon as 25 February, to the same addressees as the positions of the commercial court presidents. The fund, naturally, rejects all the judges' ideas, and there are two key postulates in its arguments. The first is that the purchase of preferred shares (up to DM 20,000), limited to 50 percent of the enterprise's value, is not a collective right of the small shareholders, but rather the personal right of each of them, which remains equally even after additional capitalization. The second one is the postulate that the fund, by accepting additional capitalization, is increasing the enterprise's principal before the completion of the transformation, "when a stock company has not been founded, and thus one cannot consider the criticism about a flagrant violation of the shareholders' rights, since while there is no stock company, while it has not been entered in the court register, there is also no shareholder status; instead, this is a process of transition in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Transformation." The Fund Strikes Back In the conclusion of the letter, the fund also recommended to the commercial judges that before uttering bold assertions about unconstitutionality and illegality, they could discuss disputed issues at the level of the competent state authorities, and that they were obligated to apply the law with which they disagreed until the Constitutional Court, possibly, thought differently. In the end, on 28 February the whole problem reached a meeting of the government, after which the president of the High Commercial Court instructed all the lower courts to resume the blocked entries of enterprises with additional capitalization in the registry, since "in the event of abuse there is the possibility of intervening by deleting those entries." Thus, this is how things currently stand (entangled and confusing, to say the least) with the case of "additional capitalization--entry in the registry" at the level of the state authorities. And in real life? Even worse, because it has been possible for months now to buy shares from the Privatization Fund and obtain additional capitalization, spending around DM1 million, without any problem. Legally, however, sometimes it is possible to regularize such a transaction by entering its results in the court registry, and sometimes it is not. There have also been situations in which it is possible in some places, but not in others (at the time when the Split Commercial Court was refusing to register the "additionally capitalized" Dairy, the Zagreb courts consistently registered identical cases). The worst thing of all, however, is that the buyer, whether he has registered the additionally capitalized enterprise or not, still has hanging over his head the sword of Damocles of the possibility that his arrangement with the fund (as we have said, so far about 120 of them have been concluded) might be declared unconstitutional. Then, once again, even though he claims complete innocence, he will suffer, because overnight he will lose what he bought. Small Shareholders Keeping Quiet It is not difficult to judge how much that kind of "legal security" of privatization here is a "good advertisement" for potential investors to loosen their purse-strings. The Privatization Fund nevertheless seems to be sure of itself: Without any doubt whatsoever in the outcome of constitutional case U-171, it is continuing official announcements of the sale of shares and additional capitalization under the terms in the controversial articles of the Law on Transformation, guaranteeing the buyers ownership rights and court registration. The problem, however, is that the fund, no matter how self-confident it is, cannot give anyone a guarantee of what the Constitutional Court's decision will be, and so its guarantee that the enterprises will be registered is shaky. And the small shareholders? For the time being they are mostly keeping quiet, awaiting the Constitutional Court's verdict. It does not matter whether they are doing so because of a headache from confrontation with the legal labyrinth in which nothing is clear to them anymore, or because everything is clear to them, and so their heads ache from helplessness.
