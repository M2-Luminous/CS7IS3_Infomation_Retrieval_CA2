I. A Review of Our Work in 1993 The year 1993 was one in which this session of the provincial government started its work, and also one in which the people of the entire province strived to overfulfill tasks for national economic development and advanced on the road of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics. During the year, under the leadership of the provincial party committee and with the supervision and support of the provincial people's congress and the provincial CPPCC, we conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress, put into practice all major policy decisions made by the central authorities on strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation in the light of Hubei's realistic conditions, constantly deepened reform, expanded the scale of opening up, seized favorable opportunities, accelerated development, and attained encouraging new achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. The province's GDP was 108.1 billion yuan, representing a record increase for the past eight years of 12.7 percent; the total industrial and agricultural output value stood at 213.2 billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent; and financial revenue amounted to 11.47 billion yuan, a 21.8-percent increase. The per capita income used by urban dwellers for living expenses was 2,191 yuan, up by 516 yuan; while the per capita net income of peasants increased by 105 yuan to 783 yuan. Our targets of "three surpasses and one enhancement" set at the beginning of the year were all fulfilled. A review of our work of the past year shows that we focused our attention on the following major issues, which has successfully brought along the development of the whole province: 1. Vigorous efforts made on structural readjustment helped enhance economic development and efficiency. To achieve the goal of high yield, fine quality, and high efficiency, the agricultural sector stepped up the intensity of structural readjustment. As a result, the production of grain, cotton and cooking oil remained basically stable, while the development of the diversified economy was clearly expedited. The total agricultural output value for the year reached 46.7 billion yuan, up by 6.7 percent, of which the output value of the nonfarming sectors was up by 4 percentage points, accounting for 39.7 percent of the total agricultural output value. New strides were taken in readjusting the industrial product mix and the enterprise structure. Our plan for new product development was fulfilled in a comprehensive way, and 800 enterprises adopted the share-holding system. The industrial output value for the year amounted to 166.5 billion yuan, up by 21.3 percent. The investment structure was further optimized. The fixed-asset investment for the year stood at 34.88 billion yuan, up by 44.9 percent, while investment in agriculture, energy, transport, and telecommunications went up steadily. 2. Close attention was paid to the development of township and town enterprises and the development of the individual and private economies, and major breakthroughs were made in cultivating new economic growth points. The provincial party committee and government called separate meetings on the work of township and town enterprises and the work of the individual and private economies with a view to improving and perfecting policies in these fields. A campaign of emulating, learning from, catching up with, helping and in turn surpassing each other was set off in all localities, giving a great impetus to the development of township and town enterprises and the development of the individual and private economies. The total output value of the province's township and town enterprises reached 90.8 billion yuan, while the sales volume of the individual and private economies totaled 13.82 billion yuan, up by 68.8 and 71.1 percent respectively. 3. Efforts were made to step up the development of energy, communications, and other basic industries and facilities, thus easing "bottleneck restrictions" to a certain extent. Encouraged by the provincial meeting on the power industry, all localities tried to pool funds to accelerate power construction. During the year, generating capacity increased by 1.45 million kw, thus easing the tightness of supply of electricity. Basic transportation facilities were being constantly improved and special attention was paid to the construction of a number of projects, including the Yihuang Highway, the Wuhan Tianhe Airport, the Chang Jiang Highway Bridge, and Enshi Airport. 4. We seized the favorable opportunity of opening up the Chang Jiang to the outside world, and further expanded and deepened opening up. With the implementation of the state's strategy on opening up and developing the Chang Jiang, more foreign investors began to show interest in Hubei. In order to seize this favorable opportunity, the provincial government successfully held a large-scale economic and trade fair in Hong Kong, at which a large number of contracts on cooperative projects were signed. Meanwhile, large-scale activities aimed at attracting foreign investment were also carried out in all localities, thus opening up a new situation in Hubei's introduction of foreign investment. Cities like Wuhan and Yichang in particular have become hot investment spots for major companies and financial groups based in foreign countries as well as in Hong Kong and Macao. The number of newly approved foreign- invested enterprises across the province was 2,188, 943 more than the previous year. The total investment amount entailed by all projects stood at $4.84 billion, up by 190 percent, of which foreign investment totaled $1.94 billion, with $530 million already put into use, registering a 160-percent increase. Remarkable results were attained in foreign trade and export. The total export volume reached $1.686 billion, representing an increase of 22 percent. 5. Strides were taken to implement major policy decisions of the central authorities on strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation in the light of Hubei's realistic conditions, thus ensuring normal national economic operation. Shortly after the central authorities issued the No. 6 Document, the provincial party and government promptly called a provincial meeting on financial and monetary work, at which the guiding principle of two "unswervings" was defined and a "Suggestion on Implementation of the No. 6 Document of the Central Authorities to Improve and Strengthen Macroeconomic Control and Regulation" was issued. As a result, the arbitrary practices of granting loans, raising funds, and establishing monetary institutions were effectively stopped. With a view to making flexible use of capital which was already in short supply and attaining greater progress under difficult situations, governments and monetary departments at all levels worked in close coordination, strengthened the collection and regulation of funds, satisfied the demands for purchasing agricultural products, and put an end to the practice of issuing IOUs. Remarkable results were attained in mobilizing the masses to deposit more savings in banks. By the end of December, the savings deposits balance across the province reached 79.852 billion yuan, an increase of 18.042 billion yuan over the same period of the previous year, of which the savings deposits newly added during a four-month period from August to December accounted for 56 percent of the total, registering an increase of 6.573 billion yuan over the same period of the previous year. The year-end loans balance was 116.261 billion yuan, 17.9 billion yuan more than the end of the previous year. 6. A well-coordinated development was brought to the economy and social undertakings, and the living standards of the people were further improved. Great headway was made in applying scientific and technological achievements to economic development. Of the province's 550 scientific and technological achievements at the provincial level and above, 39 were given national awards and the utilization rate stood at 80 percent. Education developed in a comprehensive way. Elementary education was further stepped up, while vocational and higher education constantly improved. Sports were further developed. Nine athletes from Hubei won world championships at international meets during the year, while another three broke world records on six occasions. Progress was also registered in the fields of literature and art; the press and publishing; radio, film and television; the social sciences; public health; family planning; and environmental protection. Alongside the development of our economy, markets flourished, enjoying brisk buying and selling. The volume of retail sales for the year amounted to 55.654 billion yuan, registering an increase of 21.1 percent. 7. Simultaneous attention was paid to "two types of work" with a view to reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal system. Education was carried out in depth on the party's basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; while activities were launched with the aim of cultivating new practices in trades, emulating Lei Feng at various working posts, and building "two civilizations" units as well as civilized households. As a result, the ideological and ethical qualities of the vast numbers of masses were enhanced. Through their study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" in particular, the people of the entire province further strengthened their consciousness and confidence in taking the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Governments at all levels submitted regular work reports to the standing committee of the provincial people's congress, briefed the provincial CPPCC on recent developments, solicited opinions of all sides on major issues, and thus further reinforced democratic supervision and decisionmaking procedures. The campaign of "cracking down on crime" continued. Heavy punishments were swiftly handed down to a number of major criminals according to the law, thus bringing a favorable turn to social order. Strides were made in lightening the heavy burden of peasants and protecting their legitimate interests and rights. The anticorruption struggle was carried out in depth, and a number of large and serious cases were cracked, bringing about new breakthroughs in the building of clean government. Fellow Deputies, We attained tremendous accomplishments last year. It is the people of all nationalities of our province who, through their hard work and concerted efforts, have made all these achievements possible. On behalf of the provincial people's government, I wish to express heartfelt gratitude to the vast numbers of cadres and masses working on all fronts across the province as well as to the officers and men of the People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police stationed in Hubei. I also wish to express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and those residing abroad and to all our international friends who care about and support Hubei's construction! While affirming our achievements, we must also recognize with a sober mind that there have been failings and mistakes in the work of the government and that there are still problems and difficulties in our way ahead. These are chiefly the following: Capital supply and demand remain imbalanced, and a considerable number of medium-sized and small enterprises are faced with great difficulties in their operation and plagued by heavy losses; commodity prices have increased by a large margin, making life more difficult for workers in enterprises in which production has been totally or partially suspended, and also for peasants in certain mountain areas; social order was not as good as expected; the situation in family planning still remains grim; and corrupt practices, formalism, and bureaucracy existing among a minority of state workers have impaired the close ties between the government and the masses. We need to pay close attention to and to adopt effective measures to solve all these problems. In reviewing our work in the past year, we believe that earnest efforts need to be made in the following fields this year in order to consolidate and develop the present sound situation in reform and opening up: First, to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, it is imperative to regard development as the last word. At present, Hubei is enjoying favorable opportunities and conditions for further development. We must seize these favorable opportunities and go all out to accelerate economic development. We should give vigorous support to those localities which have the conditions to speed up construction and which have the capability to expedite construction through arduous efforts. With a view to creating a sound social environment wherein development is justified and commendable, a policy should be adopted toward localities, enterprises, and individuals of remuneration for their outstanding contributions to economic development, thus giving form to a unifying force in our effort to speed up economic reform. Second, it is necessary to continuously deepen reform and expand opening up, and bring about a faster and better development of the economy. Since reform and opening up are a strong motive force to push forward economic development, we need to step up the intensity of reform, and rely on reform to bring along the whole situation. We must integrate economic development with reform and opening up in an organic way, focus our efforts on reinvigorating state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, deepen reform in all sectors, speed up the development pace of an export-oriented economy, and inject greater vigor into our economy. Third, we must put the enhancement of economic efficiency in first place, and seek unity between speed, efficiency, and development potential. We must put an end to practices such as blindly seeking high output values, engaging in overlapping construction of poor quality, and extensive management; exert great efforts to optimize the economic structure, push forward technological progress, and improve operational management; and regard, in real terms, the enhancement of economic efficiency as the focus of our economic development. Fourth, we must correctly handle relations between reform, development, and social stability. Reform is a motive force of development while development is the goal, and social stability is the prerequisite for both. Under the present situation wherein reform is intensified and development accelerated, we must take into consideration the endurance capacity of all social sectors, and correctly handle relations between reform, development, and social stability. We should not stress stability to the neglect of reform and development, nor can we only emphasize reform and development to the neglect of social stability. What we should do is integrate the three in an organic way and make them complementary to each other. Fifth, we should "pay simultaneous attention to two types of work," attaching equal importance to both. Efforts to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal system with a view to maintaining political and social stability are a fundamental guarantee for pushing forward the building of material civilization. To ensure smooth progress in all fields of endeavor, we should unswervingly pay simultaneous attention to the building of material and spiritual civilization, attaching equal importance to reform and opening up on the one hand and to the building of clean government and the crackdown on all crime on the other. II. The Goal of Struggle and Major Tasks in Economic Development in 1994 The year 1994 is vital not only to Hubei's plan to push the national economy onto the first new step in the nineties, but also to our efforts to promote reform. At present, our province is enjoying favorable opportunities and a sound situation for further development. The national economy has joined an "express line" of development; following Wuhan and Huangshi, Yichang has become another open city, thus bringing a major change to the overall setup of opening up; and preparations for the Three Gorges project are well under way. Meanwhile, the state has readjusted the setup of the automobile industry and speeded up the 10-million-tonne transformation of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, thus providing us with more new opportunities. In fact, Hubei has been pushed to the forefront of reform and opening up in the central and western regions. The development of the situation has set objective requirements for Hubei to speed up its reform and construction and to play a greater role in the country's overall economic setup. The whole province should have a greater sense of historical responsibility and mission as well as the sense of urgency in accelerating reform; seize the present favorable opportunities; step up the intensity of reform, opening up, development, and implementation; and attain greater accomplishments in the new year. The following is the general guiding ideology for our future economic work: We should unswervingly follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the party's basic line, conscientiously implement the spirits of the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, act in accordance with the requirements raised by the sixth provincial party congress, seize the present favorable opportunities, expand the scale of opening up, consolidate the basic position of agriculture, bring into full play the pillar role of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay close attention to major economic growth points, do a good job in strengthening such weak links as the light and textile industries, step up the building of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, promote scientific and technological progress and carry out structural readjustment, strive to enhance the efficiency and quality of the economy, and bring about a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development to Hubei's national economy. The overall goal of struggle is to "overfulfill plans, catch up with other parts of China, mount a new step, and bring about new breakthroughs to all industries and trades." In other words, Hubei should overfulfill one year ahead of schedule all tasks set out in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, strive to keep pace with the country's average national economic growth rate, and successfully mount its first new step in the nineties. The following are some major targets for this year's national economic development: GDP is expected to reach 118.4 billion yuan, up by 9.5 percent, of which primary industry will gain an increase of 5 percent; secondary industry, 12 percent, and tertiary industry, 11 percent. The total industrial and agricultural output value is forecast to be 241 billion yuan, registering a 13.1-percent increase; and total financial revenue to be 13.1 billion, up by 8.84 percent if calculated in terms of comparable items. The income of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises and the per capita net income of peasants are expected to increase by 15 percent and 100 yuan respectively. The total volume of retail sales will be controlled at below the country's average level. To fulfill or overfulfill this year's tasks of national economic development, we must break with conventional practices, work out new ideas and adopt new measures, and bring about new breakthroughs. First of all, we need to have new ideas in developing our economy. Fundamentally speaking, this means that we should transform the economic operation from extensive management to intensive management, and open up a development road characterized by less input, more output, good quality, high efficiency, and fast accumulation. Second, we need to make new breakthroughs in policies. The most urgent task for the time being is, in line with the usual practices of the market economy, to promptly work out a number of concrete policies and methods on enlivening the economy; and to give a free hand to and encourage grass-roots units, enterprises, and the masses to try their best to boost the economy. Third, new moves and measures should be taken in our work. That is to say, we need to accomplish a number of major tasks in order to bring along the whole situation, and to base the high-speed economic development on a solid foundation. The focus of this year's economic work is to grasp one key issue, bring about five large- scale breakthroughs, start three major motivation projects, and alleviate four conspicuous contradictions. This means that we should focus our efforts on state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; bring about breakthroughs in the development of the diversified economy, township and town enterprises, tertiary industry, the individual and private economies, and the export-oriented economy; start as soon as possible a number of major projects, including the 1-million vehicle project, the 10-million-tonne steel transformation project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, as well as auxiliary projects serving the Three Gorges project; and ease the tight supply of capital and remove bottleneck restrictions in the fields of energy, transportation, and telecommunications. In line with the above goals of struggle and development plans, our economic work this year will be focused mainly on the following issues: 1. With the aim of increasing the income of peasants, we should stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and cooking oil; bring about breakthroughs in the development of a diversified economy and the development of township and town enterprises; and enliven the rural economy in a comprehensive way. Since agriculture has the power to bring great order across the land, we need to put agriculture in a primary position in our economic work. This year's total grain and cotton outputs are expected to reach 23.5 million and 500,000 tonnes respectively. The total agricultural value is forecast to be 49.5 billion yuan, representing an increase of 6 percent. In view of market demand, we will make vigorous efforts to boost the production of fine-quality grain and cotton, as well as side crops in high demand, such as soya beans and corn; and continue to guide agriculture along the development road characterized by high yields, fine quality, and high efficiency. Continued efforts will be made to build a number of counties into major production bases of commodity grain and cotton, as well as to set up agricultural demonstration zones of "two highs and one excellence"; to open up more "grain fields with a yield of one tonne per mu," "cotton fields with a yield of 200 kg per mu," and "farm fields which can produce an output value of 1,000 yuan per mu"; to vigorously spread the use of high-yielding and highly efficient crop-raising patterns; and to enhance the plantation efficiency of grain and cotton. We will conscientiously implement the series of preferential policies extended to agriculture by the party, protect the enthusiasm of peasants in production, firmly establish the concept of fighting natural disasters and striving for harvests, make careful preparations for the prevention and control of all kinds of natural disasters, and strive to reap an overall agricultural harvest this year. Breakthroughs should be made in the development of a diversified economy, for it is a fundamental way for peasants to increase their income, to get rich, and to lead a fairly comfortable life. Efforts will be made to increase the output value of diversifying operations to 31 billion yuan, accounting for over 62 percent of the total agricultural output value; and to increase the per capita net income of peasants from diversification by more than 60 yuan. We will bring into full play Hubei's advantages in mountain and water resources; focus our efforts on cultivating pillar industries; and accelerate the production of products in high demand in both the domestic and overseas markets, including livestock and poultry, aquatic products, tea, mulberries, Chinese medicinal herbs, and fruits. Continued efforts will be made to tap the potential of the aquatic industry and gain a newly increased output value of 1 billion yuan, which makes up 10 percent of the total agricultural output value. It is necessary to expedite the development of animal husbandry, forestry, fruits, and special local products; and turn them into highly competitive sectors in the shortest possible time. All localities should act in the light of local conditions, increase input in agriculture, set up production bases which can make use of local natural resources, step up the processing industry in light of market demand, develop a number of pillar industries and fist products, and gradually achieve the goal of every township and village having its own highly competitive industry or product. Mountain areas are required to successfully put into effect the practice whereby each person is responsible for one mu of cash forest. We should take further steps to motivate the enthusiasm of all rural households in developing a diversified economy, expand the scale of the courtyard economy, enhance the development level, and engage ourselves in running green enterprises. It is imperative to make breakthroughs in the development of township and town enterprises by reinforcing relevant measures. This year's output value of township and town enterprises is forecast to be 125 billion yuan, registering an increase of 37.7 percent. We should implement in a thoroughgoing way all preferential policies which are designed to support the development of township and town enterprises, continue to increase input in such enterprises, raise funds through various channels, and strive to input an additional amount of 4.5 billion yuan into township and town enterprises this year. Vigorous efforts will be made to acquire the state's special-purpose loans earmarked for the development of township and town enterprises in central and western regions. We will continue to implement the policy of providing support in terms of working capital and loans at discount interest, and give a stronger backing to those township and town enterprises which enjoy "three highs" and which are engaged in earning foreign exchange through exports and producing substitutes for imported goods. Efforts will be accelerated to set up master files for projects carried out by township and town enterprises, as well as for highly competitive products; to attract more foreign investment; and to enhance the grade and level of township and town enterprises. It is necessary to continue deepening the reform of township and town enterprises; vigorously develop share-holding cooperative enterprises; facilitate the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture; strengthen enterprise management; and enhance the economic efficiency of enterprises. This year, we plan to give form to a number of new enterprises which enjoy an output value of 1 billion yuan, organize a number of enterprise groups, build a number of small industrial zones, and develop a number of leading enterprises in agricultural and sideline production. Strides will be made in closely integrating the development of township and town enterprises with urban construction with a view to speeding up the process of urbanization of rural areas. It is imperative to pay simultaneous attention to the practice of selecting the best qualified and to the work of giving assistance to the poor, and to successfully fulfill the "eight-seven" aid-the-poor campaign [a national campaign aimed at giving great support to poor areas, especially old revolutionary areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, and remote border areas; helping them extricate themselves from poverty and get rich; and providing 80 million people across the country with sufficient food and clothing within the seven years from the present to the year 2000]. We will conscientiously carry out all preferential policies designed to support the development of poor areas, continue doing a good job of the project of "providing sufficient food and clothing," help poor areas develop a diversified economy, and assist them in finding more ways to get rich. Meanwhile, we will also encourage all sectors of society to give unit-to-unit support to key areas, thus accelerating the pace of poor areas extricating themselves from poverty and getting rich. 2. A high-speed growth will be maintained in industrial production on the basis of enhancing efficiency. This year's provincial industrial output value is planned to grow by 15 percent, with a production to sales rate of over 95 percent. To fulfill this arduous task, we must adopt powerful and effective measures to ensure a high-speed industrial growth. First, we should exert great efforts to run well state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Because Hubei's stable economic growth mainly relies on large and medium-sized enterprises, we must regard the work of running well state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises as the central issue of this year's work: 1) Preferential measures will be adopted in capital supply to satisfy the rational needs of large and medium-sized enterprises in production and operation; 2) we will step up the intensity of reform and enliven various kinds of enterprises in different sectors. We are planning to revitalize enterprises by transforming them into share-holding cooperative enterprises and by shifting their production to tertiary industry, or through introduction of foreign funds, organization of enterprise groups, and leases and auctions; 3) with the aim of lightening the burden of enterprises, all their irrational burdens should be thoroughly screened. Efforts will be made to absolutely reduce the irrational burdens of enterprises, thus creating a sound external environment for enterprises. Second, with a view to expanding the operational scale, we will accelerate the building of the "giant project." To enable key means of production to flow toward highly competitive industries, enterprises, and products, we will mainly rely on large and medium-sized enterprises, on joint property rights, and on readjustment of product mix to integrate technological transformation and development with enterprise reform; accelerate the development of a large number of economically strong major enterprises, companies, and groups; and greatly enhance the level of Hubei's scale operation and improve its competitiveness as a whole. This year, while continuing to consolidate and improving existing enterprise groups, we will step up our efforts to organize a number of large and medium-sized enterprise groups which have output values exceeding 500 million, 1 billion, and 1.5 billion yuan. We will unremittingly carry out a product strategy, continue to do a good job in the development of both 100 key products and 4,000 new products, and strive to push the fund rate of output value of new products to 13 percent. Third, we will intensify technological transformation, and rejuvenate the light and textile industries. At present, with relatively large stocks and a large number of employees, the light and textile industries are generally plagued by outdated equipment, backward technologies, products of inferior quality, and poor competitiveness. In view of this situation, we must regard the transformation of the light and textile industries as a major issue in our efforts to save enterprises, stabilize society, and bring into play Hubei's advantages in stocks. Through updating and upgrading the light and textile industries, we can successfully bring improvement to and enliven industry. This year, we should put the focus of technological transformation on motivation for the "plan to rejuvenate the light and textile industries" and, based on highly competitive products, select a number of state-owned enterprises to carry out technological transformation with a high starting point. The provincial authorities have decided to raise funds, totaling 1 billion yuan, to set up a foundation for the rejuvenation of the light and textile industries within this year. All localities are also required to squeeze out more technological transformation funds to step up the intensity of transformation of the light and textile industries. Fourth, we will pay close attention to newly started major development projects with the aim of bringing about a sustained growth in the industrial economy. For a certain period in the future, we will focus our efforts on the following major projects which can bring along the whole situation: We should seize the favorable opportunity as the state is readjusting the setup of and issuing policies on the automobile industry, and rely on the Dongfeng Automobile Company to accelerate the development of Hubei's automobile industry, striving to turn Hubei within the coming decade into a major automobile-producing province with an annual output of 1 million automobiles; based on the "10-million-tonne" transformation project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, we will promote joint operation and cooperation among iron and steel plants within the province with a view to building Hubei into a first-class major steel-producing province; seizing opportunities provided by the Three Gorges project, we plan to vigorously develop industries as well as products related to the project, and bring about greater development to a number of related industries, including metallurgy, machinery, and building materials. Fifth, it is imperative to reinforce the management and enhance the economic efficiency of enterprises. Based on the implementation of the "Law on Product Quality," we will reinforce the basic management of enterprises in a comprehensive way. Activities aimed at "transforming the mechanism, paying attention to management, improving internal training, and enhancing efficiency" will be launched in all industrial enterprises, with a view to enabling enterprises to concentrate their attention on their own operation and development; to improving their economic results; to attaching equal importance to strengthening management and to making up deficits and increasing profits; and to striving to reduce the number of loss-making enterprises and the total amount of losses by 10 and 15 percent respectively within this year. 3. Efforts will be made to step up the intensity of investment, optimize the investment pattern, and pay close attention to key construction. This year, Hubei's society-wide fixed-asset investment will be 45 billion yuan, an increase of 29 percent; while the investment rate will stand at 30 percent. To optimize the structure of fixed-asset investment, we will increase input into technological transformation; use a small increment to revitalize a huge stock; and strive, through several years of hard work, to bring about a fundamental change to the technological quality of Hubei's traditional pillar industries, such as the light and textile industries as well as the engineering industry. The focus of basic construction is to continue reinforcing the building of basic industries and facilities, including agriculture, energy, transportation, and telecommunications; give full support to the Three Gorges project and do a good job in the resettlement of residents in the dam area; pay close attention to the implementation of 21 major system projects; and strive to start 54 and complete or initially complete 19 projects within this year. To step up the intensity of investment, we must try to raise funds through various channels. We should seize the present opportunity as the state is reforming its investment and fund-raising structure; help large and medium-sized projects prepare for state investment which the state earlier promised to inject; and make first-phase preparations for construction projects which plan to acquire state investment. We will try to introduce more direct foreign funds for such large-scale projects as the Second Phase of the Hanchuan Power Plant, the Huanglongshi Airport, the Yihuang Highway, the Fufa Glassware Plant, and the 400,000-tonne wax-splitting project; try hard to issue 1.3 billion yuan worth of securities in Hubei, a task assigned by the state; and earnestly work out measures to ensure the auxiliary supply of local funds for key projects. 4. Breakthroughs need to be made in the development of tertiary industry, thus giving shape to a new setup of industrial growth. The stagnant development of Hubei's tertiary industry is a major factor restricting the economic development of the province; on the other hand, it is also a field in which we can tap potentials to accelerate economic development. Therefore, we must adopt effective measures, and strive to bring about breakthroughs in the development of tertiary industry. We should focus our efforts on the development of industries and trades which need less investment, enjoy faster returns and better efficiency, have a capacity for absorbing more labor power, and are closely linked with economic development and the livelihood of the people. Moreover, we will also speed up the development of such industries as commercial services, monetary information, communications and telecommunications, real estate, and tourism. Further steps will be taken to make more flexible use of policies. The examination and approval system will be turned into a registration system, and all social sectors will be urged to make greater investment in and run tertiary industries in various ways. Meanwhile, we should encourage governmental workers as well as surplus staff of enterprises, who are the subject of reductions during structural readjustments, to engage themselves in tertiary industries; encourage enterprises of tertiary industries to merge with industrial enterprises which are closing down; support industrial enterprises in running tertiary industries; accelerate the development of the first batch of tertiary industrial groups; further relax control over tertiary industry prices, grant more loans to tertiary industries, and extend preferential policies to newly established tertiary industries. Breakthroughs need to be made in the development of the individual and private economies, for they constitute a major force for the development of tertiary industry. We will conscientiously carry out the decision of the provincial party and government on accelerating the development of the individual and private economies, and take more steps to mobilize the enthusiasm of all sides in bringing about further development. This year, we will strive to reach the development goal of "taking three big strides in three years" one year ahead of schedule, pushing the total sales volume of the individual and private economies to 30 billion yuan and the total number of persons engaged to 2 million. 5. Efforts will be focused on key issues so as to speed up the pace of market building. To develop a socialist market economy, we need to have a perfect market system and smooth circulation channels. We should act in accordance with the requirements for the building of general markets and circulation; continue to set up and perfect more marketing and circulation networks; and focus our efforts on building, in major agricultural production zones as well as in large and medium-sized cities, a number of markets for bulk agricultural products and wholesale markets for means of production which enjoy effective functions and have an influence on the entire country. We will try to set up grain and cotton futures trading markets in Wuhan; a number of large-scale trading markets for means of production, mainly steel sheets, automobiles, and cement, in places like Wuhan, Huangshi, Ezhou, Shiyan, and Xiangfan; and a number of border trade markets in border townships and towns including Jinzhou, Enshi, Yunyang, Xiangfan, Huanggang, and Xianning. It is imperative to accelerate the cultivation of the monetary market, and gradually build Hubei into a regional monetary center. While continuing to expand the operational scale of banks and to open more banking credit businesses, we will expedite the development of trusted investment companies, professional insurance companies, and urban and rural cooperative banks; try to persuade three newly organized state policy banks to set up representative offices in Hubei; try to organize and build Hubei's own regional development bank; expand international monetary business and try to have more overseas and foreign monetary institutions set up monetary organs in cities such as Wuhan; expand the trading scale of all kinds of securities, and support large enterprises, including the Dongqi Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Geheyan Power Station, in listing in stock exchanges to raise funds in huge amounts; and try to have the state set up a securities exchange in Wuhan as soon as possible so that Hubei can become a securities exchange center and a "pool" for capital in the central and western regions. Vigorous efforts will be made to develop the labor, personnel, and technology markets with a view to rationalizing the circulation and optimizing the allocation of means of production. We will allow non-labor departments to set up labor markets, accelerate the establishment of a number of standardized and perfect employment service centers and agencies, and open up step by step a number of windows for the labor market in coastal areas, border areas, and areas outside China. It is important to expedite the cultivation of the technology and personnel markets. We will encourage all major technology development bodies to enter the market in various forms, build up unified and open technology information systems and propagation networks across the province, and set up markets for technology, patents, and personnel in a number of cities, including Wuhan. 6. It is important to implement the strategy of "rejuvenating Hubei through the application of science and education," and enhance the overall quality of both the national economy and laborers. Conscientious efforts will be made to carry out the "Law on Scientific and Technological Progress" with a view to closely integrating science and technology with the economy. On the basis of continuing to strengthen basic research and develop high and new technologies, we will focus on spreading the use of applied research as well as scientific and technological results, and on accelerating the process of turning scientific and technological results into real productive power. We will continue to bring up leading figures in rural areas who can guide peasants to get rich through the application of science and technology. Efforts will be made to center scientific research and development around pillar industries and industrial products, and to expand channels for integrating science and technology with economic development by using methods of the market economy. In line with the principle of "stabilizing one field while a giving free hand to others," we will further relax control over the work of scientific research institutions and personnel, so that more scientific and technological forces can be directed toward the main battlefield of economic development. A technological progress mechanism combining market, scientific research, and production will be gradually set up in enterprises with a view to turning enterprises into main bodies of scientific and technological development. To enhance the quality of laborers, the most essential factor is education. We will carry out in depth the "Outline on the Reform and Development of China's Education," put education in a strategic position and give priority to its development, increase input, deepen reform, and vigorously promote the cause of education. It is imperative to continuously readjust and optimize the structure of education, conscientiously implement the "Law on Compulsory Education," reinforce elementary education, vigorously promote vocational and adult education, steadily develop higher education, and try hard to improve school-running conditions. It is important to conscientiously carry out the "Law on Teachers," earnestly protect the legitimate interests and rights of teachers, and reinforce the building of the contingent of teachers. We will also grant greater autonomy to schools in handling school-running affairs, develop school-run industries, and encourage and support all social sectors in making donations to schools and in running nongovernmental teaching institutions. Intellectuals are playing a specially important role in the modernization drive. We should have full confidence in the vast numbers of intellectuals politically, give them a free hand in their work, take good care of their lives, cultivate in the entire society a sound social practice of respecting knowledge and qualified personnel, and create a favorable social environment for intellectuals to display intelligence and wisdom in work. Handsome rewards should be given to intellectuals who have made outstanding contributions. We sincerely welcome people who have studied abroad to take part in Hubei's construction in various ways, assuring them of preferential treatment and allowing them to come and go freely. The final goal of economic development is to constantly improve the material and cultural lives of the masses of people. This year, thanks to the salary reform, workers and staff of administrative organs have seen increases in their income, while the income of those working in enterprises will also increase with the development of production. Moreover, the income of peasants has also increased as a result of the growing rural economy and increases in the purchase prices of agricultural products. While trying to increase incomes, we will continue to improve the living standards of urban and rural residents, pay attention to the "shopping basket" project and the construction of urban facilities, accelerate the development of public health, improve the prevention and treatment of local diseases such as snail fever and Keding disease, vigorously promote cultural undertakings, and bring about a fairly great improvement to the quality of people's lives. What merits special notice is the relatively difficult situation of the masses who live in poor areas as well as workers working in enterprises which are plagued by poor economic results and which have suspended production entirely or partially. Governments at all levels should adopt positive measures to help them solve difficulties. Family planning, land management, and environmental protection are China's basic national policies. We must conscientiously implement these policies and try to achieve outstanding results in the work. The birth rate in our province has exceeded the country's average level in recent years; therefore, we must adopt effective measures to put an end to this situation. Results in population control will constitute an important part of the appraisal of the work results of party and government leaders at all levels. It is imperative to strictly implement laws, rules, and regulations on family planning, to focus the family planning work on rural and urban floating populations, and to firmly control the birth rate within the scope specified by the state. We will value land highly, strictly control land earmarked for basic construction, put into practice the system for the basic protection of farmland, build up a farmland compensation mechanism, and enhance the utilization rate of land. We will unswervingly fulfill the strategic task of "afforesting Hubei within 10 years," and basically open up all uncultivated mountains this year. Continued efforts will be made to protect all kinds of natural resources, prevent industrial pollution, and bring about a well-coordinated development to environmental protection and the economy. III. Speed Up the Pace of Reform and Carefully Carry Out Reform in All Fields This year is a crucial one for making key breakthroughs in reform and pushing forward reform as a whole. The state has promulgated reform measures one after another on the management structures of finance and taxation, the monetary industry, investment, planning, and foreign trade, as well as on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. Successful implementation of all these reforms are of vital importance to the establishment of the framework of a socialist market economy. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen leadership over reform, carefully organize reform in different fields, and ensure that all reform measures put forward by the central authorities can be smoothly carried out in Hubei. 1. Efforts will be made to actively and steadily push forward the structural reform of macrolevel management. First, the fiscal and taxation reform. This reform consists of three parts, namely, reform of the taxation system, the system whereby tax revenues are shared by central and local authorities, and the system of enterprise profit distribution. Reform in the above three fields is the most difficult and most important part of the entire reform, for it has a great bearing on the setup of interest distribution. Therefore, in order to succeed in all these reforms, we need to make careful plans. The general principle of the structural reform of tax division designed for all prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures by the provincial authorities is: Rationally divide revenues and expenditures in accordance with the principle and goal set by the central authorities concerning the local system of tax division and in line with the principle of seeking unity between administrative and financial powers; pay persistent attention to both overall design and phased implementation; successfully dovetail new structures with old ones; and gradually put the new into effect. After the system of tax division is adopted, the original financial structure will remain functional in principle, with a view to safeguarding the immediate interests of all localities. While doing a good job in the reform of the financial and taxation structure, we need to pay close attention to this year's financial work, ease contradictions between revenue and expenditure, and create conditions for a smooth implementation of other reforms. We will conscientiously carry out the new taxation system, strengthen the collection and management of taxes, and submit tax revenues to the state treasury in strict accordance with the stipulations of the tax division system. We should adhere to the principle of restraining all financial expenditures, and strictly observe restrictions set out in the budget. Financial departments at all levels should be responsible for balanced revenue and expenditure and none is allowed to go into the red. Second, reform of the financial structure. The main tasks of financial reform are: Further transform the functions of the People's Bank; pay close attention to the establishment of policy banks, and transform existing specialized banks according to the general principles of commercial banks; actively and steadily develop the system of cooperative banks; make preparations for the open market operations of state treasury bonds and foreign exchanges; do a better job in running existing capital, securities, and foreign exchange swap markets; and conscientiously accomplish all work relating to the adoption of unified exchange rates. The tight supply of capital still remains a conspicuous contradiction in Hubei's economic development this year. Therefore, we must adopt effective measures to ease the situation. While continuously doing a good job in attracting savings deposits of all kinds, we will try hard to expand bond and insurance business, run well the money- lending market, expand sources of capital, and pool more funds for economic development. Further efforts will be made to make flexible use of capital in stock, accelerate the circulation of funds, and enhance the utilization efficiency of funds. It is necessary to continue to readjust and optimize the credit structure; try to satisfy rational demands for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products as well as the production and operation of state and provincial key construction projects, foreign trade operations, and trades and enterprises which enjoy sound economic efficiency; and ensure the normal operation of the national economy. Third, reform of the investment structure. The focus of this year's reform is: Grant greater decisionmaking power on investment projects, and gradually build up risk responsibilities for legal person investments and bank loans. Enterprises are granted autonomy in making decisions concerning competitive project investments, and are responsible for all potential risks. Banks have the decisionmaking power on granting loans and are responsible for their own profits and losses. By using economic methods, we will improve control and regulation over the overall scale and the structure of investment; perfect the fund management of welfare investment and set up a provincial-level welfare investment contract system; expand the fund-raising channels as well as the operational scope of provincial-level investment companies, and increase their financial strength in operation; and improve the government's financial investment methods, and turn nonreimburasable investment into compensatory share-holding investment. Fourth, reform of commodity prices. This year, the state is to appropriately readjust the prices of energy, grain, and cotton. With the addition of the impact produced by last year's price rises, it is an arduous task to keep price rises under control. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen leadership over price control, carefully organize the implementation of reform measures, and strive to bring price rises below the country's average level. To alleviate pressure produced by price rises, we should, on the one hand, try hard to increase effective social supply, especially the supply of agricultural and sideline products; on the other hand, adapt ourselves to the new situation resulting from changes in the mechanism of price formation, set up a reserves system for a number of consumer goods which are closely related to the basic needs of the masses, such as grain, pork, eggs, and sugar, as well as key means of agricultural production; and use economic means to make timely readjustments to market prices. 2. Focus will be placed on the establishment of a modern enterprise system, and enterprise reform will be deepened in a comprehensive way. Establishing a modern economic system is the goal of enterprise reform and a fundamental method for revitalizing state-owned enterprises. We should seize the present favorable opportunities in reform; continue implementing the "Enterprise Law" and "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Enterprises"; do a good job in three internal reforms on the labor, personnel, and distribution of enterprises; have the courage to explore effective ways to establish a modern enterprise system, and provide the high- speed economic growth with a strong motive force. The provincial authorities plan to carry out experiments with the modern enterprise system in 50 selected large and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, including the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, the Dongqi Company, the Jinmen 400,000-tonne wax-splitting project, the Qingjiang Development Company, and the Houwang Group; and allow about 10 qualified enterprises to list on stock exchanges or to issue stocks outside China. These influential enterprise experiments will surely bring along the development of related enterprises. We will continue to transform enterprises into share-holding cooperative enterprises, and try to push the number of share-holding enterprises to 1,000 this year, thus laying the foundation for the adoption of the modern enterprise system in state-owned enterprises. It is imperative to vigorously push forward the structural reform of property rights, pay close attention to appraising properties and funds as well as defining property rights, settle claims and clear up debts, accelerate the establishment of the property rights exchange market, trade-in idle assets of state-owned enterprises and auction off enterprises, and standardize trading behavior. The provincial authorities will set up a supervisory committee on state-owned assets, and experiment with the practice in 40 assigned pillar enterprises with a view to reinforcing supervision over state-owned assets. 3. Vigorous efforts need to be made to push forward reforms in the social guarantee and housing systems. The focus of reform in the social guarantee system is to further expand the coverage of pension and medical insurance. The pension and medical insurance of urban workers and staff should be jointly borne by units and individuals, combining overall social arrangements with individual accounts; while in rural areas where conditions allow, a pension and insurance system based on individual savings accumulations will be carried out on the basis of the peasants' own will. It is imperative to develop and perfect the rural cooperative medical care system; expand the coverage of job-awaiting insurance; gradually set up a unified job-awaiting insurance system covering workers and staff of state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as well as Chinese staff in foreign-invested enterprises; improve management services over the social insurance of retired and job-awaiting personnel of enterprises; and gradually reach the goal that enterprises are engaged in providing social welfare. It is important to conscientiously implement the "Decision of the State Council on Accelerating Reform of the Urban Housing System," and speed up the pace of urban housing reform. We will adhere to the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to the sale, lease, and construction of residential houses"; and focus our efforts on the sales of houses, mainly public ones, in an active and steady way. We will step up efforts in fulfilling Hubei's housing program as part of its efforts to attain a fairly comfortable life, expedite the construction of urban residential houses, alleviate the tight supply of residential houses in urban areas, and put into practice a housing provident fund system in a comprehensive way. Housing reform is expected to be unfolded in all counties (cities) across the province this year. 4. Efforts will be made to speed up the pace of institutional reform. We should speed up the pace of institutional reform in order to suit the needs of the economic structural reform. In line with the general arrangements of the State Council, the provincial authorities have put forward the general guiding ideology and requirements for Hubei's institutional reform: In line with the principle of separating the functions of the government from those of an enterprise as well as the principle of simplification, uniformity, and high efficiency, we will focus our attention on changing the functions of the government, strengthen the work of comprehensive departments, abolish or merge certain specialized economic departments or organs with overlapping functions and duties, cut down the staff and structural levels of administrative organs, and turn them into highly capable and highly efficient organs. In line with this requirement, all administrative organs across the province are expected to start the institutional reform this year and ensure that the work can be totally accomplished next year. IV. Step Up the Intensity of Opening Up, and Increase the Proportion of the Export-Oriented Economy in the Entire National Economy The goal of struggle for Hubei this year is to realize "two surpasses" and "four breakthroughs"; in other words, we plan to overfulfill the task for foreign exports set out in the Eighth Five- Year Plan one year ahead of schedule; attain a growth rate that is higher than the country's average; earn a total of $2 billion of foreign exchange from exports, registering an increase of 18.6 percent; set up 1,500 new foreign-invested enterprises, pushing the total number to 5,500; utilize $1 billion of foreign investment; and attain a total output value and sales revenue of over 4 billion yuan in foreign-invested enterprises. To realize the above goals, we should pay special attention to work in the following fields: First, we should strengthen the building of export-oriented industries and their production bases, and further arouse the enthusiasm of all sides in developing an export-oriented economy. 1) We are determined to develop in the coming several years three to five major fist products which can bring about a total export volume of over 100 million yuan, thus upgrading and increasing the batch production of exported products. The provincial authorities will set up a special fund for technological renovation to give key support to the development of export-oriented industries. 2) Relying on pillar export enterprises, we will break barriers between regions and trades; organize and set up a number of large-scale industry-trade, agriculture-trade, and technology-trade enterprise groups which are economically strong and are under intensive management; grant them autonomy in handling foreign-related operations; and push them directly into international markets. 3) We will strive to persuade the state Import-Export Credit Bank to set up a representative office in Hubei, try our best to establish financial companies specialized in import and export businesses, and provide powerful financial support for the development of the export-oriented economy. 4) It is necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of "five contingents," vigorously open up diversified international markets, inject greater vigor into exports, and give shape to a setup of large-scale foreign trade and opening up. 5) Further efforts will be made to run well exchange-earning foreign-invested enterprises, support state-owned and collective enterprises in developing exchange-earning products, try hard to enable township and town enterprises to open wider to the outside world, develop an exchange-earning agriculture, and give shape to a number of new exchange-earning contingents. 6) Strides will be made in further expanding economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries, thus bringing along Hubei's export of complete sets of equipment, technology, and related products. 7) It is necessary to continue opening Wuhan and Huangshi Port to foreign vessels; open ports in Yichang, Shashi, and Xiangfan as soon as possible; and provide better services for the development of the export-oriented economy. Second, we will intensify the utilization of foreign investment; and make better and greater use of foreign resources, technologies, and markets. We will bring into full play the leading role of Wuhan as well as the favorable conditions of open cities including Wuhan, Huangshi, and Yichang; make good, flexible, and sufficient use of preferential policies specially designed for open cities; attract more foreign businessmen to invest in our province; and bring along the exploration and development of the Chang Jiang economic belt. We will adapt ourselves to new situations resulting from the taxation reform; and, based on the total capital investment laid down in previously promulgated policies, step up efforts to amend, perfect, and reiterate preferential policies which aim to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in Hubei, thus setting their minds at ease. It is necessary to introduce more foreign investment for development zones of all kinds at different levels, attract foreign businessmen to make concentrated investment in large-scale development projects, establish small development zones with various features, and develop a number of large-scale, highly efficient, high-tech projects which can produce foreign exchange in large amounts. Further efforts will be made to expand the cooperative fields in which foreign investment is utilized, guide foreign businessmen to participate in the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, and engage ourselves in a number of large-scale projects. We will select a number of our best enterprises and best products to set up joint ventures with foreign investors, and speed up the pace of utilizing foreign funds to transform and "graft" state-owned enterprises. Vigorous efforts will be made to consolidate already attained results in opening up, pay close attention to the implementation of projects which use loans of foreign governments, and do a good job in the follow-up of contracts which were signed at the economic and trade talks held in Hong Kong last year. Earnest efforts will be made to run well existing foreign-invested enterprises, appropriately solve problems cropping up during the development of foreign-invested enterprises, and make a success of every foreign-invested enterprise we have set up. It is necessary to further consolidate cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan; vigorously open markets in Europe, the United States, and Japan; and expand the scope of introduction of foreign investment. This year, the provincial authorities are planning to again hold large-scale economic and trade talks in France with a view to promoting Hubei's cooperation with West European countries. It is imperative to strengthen the building of open windows; set up more open windows in foreign countries, areas outside the Chinese mainland, and China's coastal areas; and expand the development channels of the export-oriented economy. We will give full play to the role of foreign-related departments, such as foreign affairs offices, overseas Chinese affairs offices, tourist agencies, and foreign-related propaganda departments, with the aim of giving form to a unified force for the development of the export-oriented economy. We will step up efforts in formulating remuneration policies which are aimed at encouraging the development of the export-oriented economy; and give encouragement and rewards politically and economically to individuals who have made contributions in introducing foreign investment, to units which can earn large amounts of foreign exchange through exports, and to foreign trade companies and localities which have attained outstanding results in exports. We will set up authoritative leading groups for the work in different fields, headed by vice governors in charge and attended by principal leaders of all relevant departments; establish work organs to strengthen the coordination and management of foreign-related economic and trade work; simplify the examination and approval procedures on foreign investment projects by adopting the practice of "one joint office using only one chop"; and provide the development of the export- oriented economy with a powerful organizational guarantee. V. Simultaneous Attention Should Be Paid to Two Types of Work With a View To Further Strengthening the Building of Socialist Spiritual Civilization, Democracy, and the Legal System Strengthening the building of spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system is an essential requirement for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the process of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, we must consistently uphold the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to two types of work, attaching equal importance to both," and strive to enhance the building of spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system to a new level. Vigorous efforts will be made to promote the building of spiritual civilization. An important task in the building of spiritual civilization is to arm the people with scientific theories, guide them with correct publicity, mold them with a noble spirit, encourage them with fine works of literature and art, and bring up generations of well-educated and well-disciplined socialist new people who have high ideals and high moral standards. To attain this goal, we need to strengthen ideological and ethical education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; vigorously advocate social and professional ethics; and continue to carry out in-depth activities including establishing and advocating new practices in industries and trades, emulating Lei Feng at work posts, and becoming advanced units and outstanding households in building two civilizations. It is imperative to further strengthen ideological and political work; guide the people, especially the young people and children, to establish the correct ideals, beliefs, outlook on life and values; advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle; and try hard to establish a sound general mood in society. Cultural workers should uphold the principle of "two serves" and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously promote the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation, actively use for reference civilization results of foreign countries, create more fine works which have both a rich flavor of our times and special features of Hubei, and enrich and enliven the cultural life of the masses. To promote sports, we should bring about a coordinated development between athletic and mass sports, and strive to enhance the physical fitness of the people of Hubei through sports. The press and publishing and radio and television departments should uphold the principle of unity, stability, and encouragement; engage mainly in positive propaganda; strengthen propagation and coverage of reform and construction, and provide the people with a correct guide to opinion. Centering around the establishment of a socialist economic structure, we will strengthen social scientific research, and provide a smooth progress of reform with a theoretical guarantee. To promote spiritual civilization, we should concentrate our efforts on the building of it. We will conscientiously implement cultural and economic policies; strengthen the building of cultural, sports, radio and television, publishing, and audiovisual facilities; and pay special attention to the construction of a diving pool and a satellite up- link station. Earnest efforts will be made to strengthen the building of socialist democracy and the legal system. Governments at all levels should conscientiously carry out resolutions adopted by the people's congresses and their standing committees at the same level, voluntarily subject themselves to supervision, give full play to the role of the people's consultative conferences in providing political consultation and democratic supervision, and give rein to the bridging functions of a number of mass organizations, such as trade unions, youth leagues, and women's federations. Efforts should be made to open up more channels for the people to express their views and opinions, give play to the roles of experts and policymaking consultative organs of all kinds, and make policy decisions in a democratic and scientific way. Further efforts will be made to strengthen the building of the legal system; formulate and perfect administrative rules and regulations which aim to protect reform and opening up, strengthen macroeconomic control and regulation, and standardize microeconomic behavior; and work out laws and regulations for major economic activities to follow. It is important to further perfect the administrative system of law enforcement and supervision; carry out official duties according to the law, and firmly put an end to failure to act according to the law, failure to strictly enforce the law, and failure to affix responsibility to violators of the law. Great efforts need to be made to improve all facets of public security, strictly combat all kinds of criminal activities and economic crimes according to law, and continue to carry out the campaign of "eliminating pornographic activities" and "stamping out six evils." Efforts will be made to launch concentrated campaigns and special-purpose struggles on different scales to crack down on crimes and social evils that the masses particularly resent. We will continue to uphold the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to cracking down on and preventing crimes, taking both stopgap and radical measures, and putting stress on effecting a permanent cure," strictly implement a responsibility system among leading cares for the comprehensive improvement of public security, mobilize the masses to effect prevention and solving of crimes, carry through to the grass-roots level all measures for improving public security, and create a sound social environment for the masses of people in which they can live and work in peace and contentment. Meanwhile, to safeguard the stability of society, we should attach great importance to mediating and handling contradictions among the people, and settle problems before they get out of hand. Strides will be made to conduct extensive education on the importance of national defense, increase public awareness of the need for it, and make a success of the work with regard to the militia and the reserve service. Continued efforts will be made to strengthen the building of the Armed Police and public security contingents. It is important that the Army supports and cherishes the people while the government supports the Army and gives preferential treatment to families of servicemen and martyrs, with a view to consolidating unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people. We should consistently show concern for and support the building of our Army. Efforts will be made to bring into full play the important roles of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed Police, the public security forces, and the vast numbers of militiamen in maintaining social stability and promoting the modernization drive. It is the common responsibility of the people of the whole province to consolidate and strengthen unity between nationalities. We should carry out nationality policies in a comprehensive way, uphold and perfect the regional autonomy of minority nationalities, grant more support to areas inhabited by minority nationalities, and bring about a common prosperity among all nationalities. VI. Further Emancipate the Mind, Improve the Work Style, Pay Close Attention to Implementation, and Ensure Comprehensive Fulfillment of This Year's Tasks of National Economic and Social Development This year, we are faced with arduous tasks and work in reform. To ensure a comprehensive fulfillment of all tasks, we must further emancipate the mind, forge ahead and open up new paths, improve our work style, and make a success of the work in all fields of endeavor in a creative way. Ideology leads to action. Without emancipation of the mind, there will not be any new ideas, new moves, or new breakthroughs. Under the present new situation in particular, in which the economy is being accelerated and reform is being deepened comprehensively, there is a greater need for freeing the mind. First, we should conscientiously study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm leading cadres at all levels with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and seek unity of understanding and action in the entire province. Through the practice of "study, practice, restudy, and more practice," we can master the spirit and essence of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, constantly acquire more knowledge about the market economy, enhance our ability to keep a rein on the whole situation, and improve the standards and work efficiency of the leadership. Second, we need to firmly establish the concept of centering around economic construction, and enhance public awareness of the need for development. It is necessary to urge all localities and departments to earnestly proceed in their work with the grand goal of catching up with and surpassing the country's average level and bringing about greater economic development; and to encourage them to translate the goal into their practical work by working out new ideas, arrangements, and measures, with a view to combining the efforts of all sectors of our province to accelerate economic development. Third, we should further increase public awareness of the need for reform and opening up as well as the spirit of having the initiative to open new paths; earnestly act in line with the principle of "three beneficials" raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and use it as a standard to check and guide our ideology and actions; break through old conventions and barriers; create a more relaxed environment for grass-roots units and the masses to carry out reform and development; and encourage and guide the masses to have the courage to open up new paths, to experiment with new ideas, and to do what our ancestors never did. Meanwhile, we also need to be good at protecting the enthusiasm of grass-roots units and the masses in reform and opening up, and respect the spirit of initiative of the masses. To fulfill all development goals set for this year, it is vitally important to earnestly improve our work style and bring about real improvement to our work in a down-to-earth manner. We will continue to conduct and perfect all good practices carried out last year, namely "the year of implementation"; and turn them into a common practice and common system with a view to achieving more practical results in our work. To accomplish all major tasks in this year's reform and construction, the provincial government has worked out a concrete work schedule, and the governor and vice governors are to take charge of and be personally responsible for work in different fields. All localities and relevant departments are required to work in close coordination, assign leading cadres to take personal charge of specific tasks with feasible measures, check out their work results at the end of every year, and not stop until our goal is reached. We will reward those who have successfully accomplished their tasks, and punish those who fail. Facing all these arduous tasks, complicated situations, and numerous difficulties in this year's reform and construction, leaders must go down and carry out their work at the grass-roots in order to make a success of it. Leaders at all levels should take the lead to improve their work style, extricate themselves from numerous meetings and piles of documents, reduce unnecessary social entertainment, concentrate their attention on handling major issues and solving practical problems, take the initiative to go down and carry out official business in grass-roots units and among the masses, energetically encourage the practice of conducting investigations and studies, watch out for and promptly discover symptoms of unhealthy tendencies, make policy decisions in a decisive manner, and gain the initiative over the whole situation. It is necessary to change the functions of the government in line with the institutional reform, simplify procedures for handling affairs, and enhance work efficiency. It is imperative to further straighten out administrative discipline and improve the work style of the government, put an absolute end to violations of previously issued orders and bans, and ensure the smooth implementation of government decrees. A deepened reform and opening up needs greater efforts to combat corruption and advocate clean administration. The provincial party committee has named this year "the year of building clean administration," in which new clean and honest practices are expected to be introduced. All government workers, especially cadres at the county (department) level and above, should be clean and well-disciplined, and act strictly in accordance with all stipulations on maintaining clean government. We should strengthen auditing work, give play to supervisory functions, continue to investigate and crack serious cases, and make public a number of typical cases so as to show our people the determination of the party and the government and gain their confidence. Continued efforts will be made to absolutely put an end to unhealthy trends, such as arbitrarily raising funds and collecting fees, traveling overseas at the expense of the state, and purchasing luxury limousines and building luxury houses against relevant regulations. Organs directly affiliated to the provincial authorities should play an exemplary role in the campaign of combating corruption and advocating clean administration. Principal provincial leaders and cadres in charge of organs directly under the provincial authorities should take the lead in accomplishing whatever they demand that their subordinates accomplish. The anticorruption campaign is a long-term struggle, and leading cadres at all levels must have the courage to take personal charge of this struggle, pay consistent attention to it, and carry out the struggle in a down-to-earth manner. We are determined to achieve real results and make substantive headway in this struggle this year. Fellow Deputies, Now is an excellent time for our province to catch up with and surpass the country's average development level. Our national economy has joined the "express line" of development, and we are faced with many major opportunities to expedite economic development. The constant deepening of reform and opening up, in particular, will surely inject greater vigor and life into future economic development. It is totally possible, as well as justified, that we should and can attain major breakthroughs in development, and we are fully confident of realizing this goal. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the provincial party committee, let us closely rally around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, emancipate our minds, work with one heart and one mind, forge ahead to open up new paths, carry out our work in real earnest, and strive to achieve this year's grand goal of "overfulfilling the plan, catching up with other parts of the country, mounting a new step, and attaining new breakthroughs in all industries and trades"!
