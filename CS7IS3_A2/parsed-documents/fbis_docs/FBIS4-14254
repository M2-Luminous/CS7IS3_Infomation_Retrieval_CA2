It is not Iraq that has shared Lebanon's occupation with "Israel" for almost 20 years. It is not Iraq that imposes on Lebanon its presidents, ministers, and Arab and international policies. It was not Iraq that bombed the Lebanese Presidential Palace at Ba'abda with its military aircraft, nor did it use its heavy artillery to shell the Lebanese Defense Ministry at al-Yarzah. Iraq did not abduct anyone in Lebanon, nor did it assassinate Kamal Junblatt and scores of other prominent politicians, journalists, and intellectuals. The history of the Iraqi Army is not tarnished by the crimes of the invasion and occupation of Lebanon or by the crimes of annihilating Lebanese. On the contrary, it is a history which is proud of the Iraqi Army's participation in confronting the Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 1978. Iraq's relations with official and popular Lebanon are well known and very clean. They have always been based on respecting Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and independent options. These relations have never been of the type that foster the division of the land and the people. This is well understood by all Lebanese Muslims and Christians, as well as all politicians, both the traditional ones and the leaders of the nationalist parties. Iraq did not make a big of issue of the incident in which the enemies of Lebanon's unity and sovereignty blew up the Iraqi Embassy in Beirut in an unprecedented crime during which the Iraqi ambassador to Lebanon, several diplomats, and scores of other martyrs fell victims, although the protection of Iraqi diplomats accredited to Lebanon was the full responsibility of the Lebanese authority. Before the embassy explosion, several Iraqi officials also fell as martyrs through assassinations in Beirut in 1980 and 1981. It is not the Iraqi armies that have occupied Lebanese territory since 1976 following an invasion blessed by Washington and Tel Aviv and in which Muslims, Christians, and Palestinians were massacred not in any clashes with the Zionist occupier, but under coexistence and full coordination with that occupier. Iranian guards did not enter Lebanon with all their weapons and funds through Iraq and with its blessing and protection, nor did these guards set up their authority, banks, and establishments through coordination and suspicious deals with Iraq. It was not Iraq that turned Lebanese territory into a den for terrorism, kidnapping, and blackmail operations to split a few dollars with the gangs of kidnappers who were charged with this temporary role according to certain policies and timings and for purposes which were known to the Lebanese authority which stood by like a spectator. Are the present official Lebanese claims, measures, and accusations sufficient to hide all these facts?! Will the smart ones in Lebanon succeed in diverting the Lebanese people's attention from the true enemies of their sovereignty and unity in Damascus and Tel Aviv, from those who are responsible for the death of the sons of Lebanon in the South, Beirut, Jabal Lubnan, the North, and al-Biqa'?!! Lebanese shrewdness, inspired by the Damascus leaders, will not change facts. Iraq is busy with very well-known enemies, the enemies of all Arabs. Everyone has his known position and objectives.
