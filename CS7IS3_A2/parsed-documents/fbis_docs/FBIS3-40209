The forum was attended by experts and supervisors from more than 40 units in the ministerial system. MEI Deputy Minister Zhang Jinqiang [1728 0093 1730] gave an important speech at the forum. Also present were Director Wu Xiaolong [0702 1420 7893] and Deputy Directors Xu Shuncheng [1776 7311 2052] and Wang Jianzhang [3769 1696 4545] of the General Planning Department, Director Li Houbin [2621 0624 7001] of the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department, Director Li Dasheng [6786 1129 0581] of the Basic Product and Major Projects Department, and Deputy Director Chen Zhengqing [7115 2973 3237] of the Computer and Information Promotion Department. Zhang Jinqiang analyzed in his speech recent achievements and existing problems of China's electronics industry. He emphasized conceptual planning for the Ninth FYP and 2010. He pointed out that plans for the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth FYPs were all formulated under a planned economics system and carried a heavy planned-economy flavor. While planning for the Ninth FYP, we are faced with a very different setting. First, as the socialist market economy matures, the market is playing an increasingly stronger role in the allocation of resources. Second, when China joins GATT, the domestic market and the foreign market will merge to form a greater market. With these premises, we must be innovative conceptually and practically in our planning for the Ninth FYP. We must on the one hand learn from the previous FYPs and on the other hand seize the opportunity of the new reform situation in China and adjustment of the international electronics industrial structure. We should formulate a plan for the greater industry and the greater market. The plan should be authoritative and of a guiding nature. He stressed the following five major points: (1) Strengthen macroscopic control and practice industry-wide management. The plan should be beyond departments and ownership. It should be an industry-wide plan for state-owned, collectively-owned, private, and foreign businesses. (2) Implement the new ``16-word'' development strategy. (3) Make fundamental changes in ideology, both in job function and in development approach. (4) Lead the development with systems engineering and network engineering. Here he described in detail 20 major projects in the ministry. (5) Pay attention to key products, key enterprises, and key regions. Li Houbing described the main functions of the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department and progress in technical planning. He also analyzed the relationship between industrial planning and technology planning and the importance of technology to the advance of the electronics industry. Wu Xiaolong expressed three opinions. First, the main point of planning is no longer how to divide the money and materials. With limited financial resources, the state resources must reside on major engineering projects. Second, we must properly handle the relationship between domestic and foreign issues and make full use of the ``two resources, two markets.'' Joining GATT will place Chinese products on equal footing in competing with foreign products. We must therefore aim high and pay attention to economic efficiency. Third, we should avoid repetition. The attending experts listened to the presentations of Zhang, Li and Wu and conducted wide-ranging discussions on communications, television broadcasting, computers and software, microelectronics, basic products and military applications. They made the following recommendations for the Ninth FYP and 2010: I. Methods for Speeding Up Development (1) New Understanding of the ``16-Word'' Strategy We must first adhere to ``market orientation'' and organize our production and macroscopic control according to the market supply and demand. We must change the old practice of paying attention only to production and ignoring management, and centering all activities on the plan and not the market. In the meantime, we must use efficient industrial management to promote consumption and direct the market. Second, we should combine the strategy of ``using the foreign market to stimulate the domestic market'' and the development model of ``using offense as a defense.'' We need to carry forward the development of some basic industries in China by exporting. For example, we can proceed to produce HDTV receivers that meet U.S. standards for the U.S. market and by so doing develop domestic HDTV receivers and related industries in China. (2) Strengthening Industrial Management and Information Guidance We should avoid duplication, improve industrial management, and include all enterprises, including village and city enterprises and ``tri-investment'' enterprises into the management system. To enhance management, MEI should implement several constraint and control measures. Examples are the right to formulate product and technical standards, and to certify equipment. They recommended a reform of the State Radio Regulatory Committee so that it may transcend other departments and become more efficient. (3) Establishing China's Own Industry The strength of the industry is in its products. There can be development only when the products meet the needs of the customers. We should make the development of the ``Golden Card'' a major business in China. If MEI itself is buying the ``Golden Card'' from foreign countries, then the banks can also buy it and there would be no need for MEI to develop it. China was practicing importing during the Sixth and Seventh FYPs and cooperation during the Eighth FYP; now it is time to establish our own industry and stop relying on others. (4) People as the Key to Development Much more attention should be given to people and stability of the ranks. In recent years people in enterprise units are flowing toward joint-venture and independently owned businesses, offices of foreign businesses in China, and toward the eastern coastal areas. This human flow has left many business units with technical staffs trained in the 1950s and 1960s. There is now an alarming discontinuity in human resources, which is extremely detrimental to the development of the electronics industry. The forum recommends that MEI perfect its reward system, formulate corresponding policies, and stabilize ranks. This has a direct impact on the realization of goals set for the Ninth FYP and 2010. (5) Reconciling Research and Production Speed up the reform of the old scientific research system, establish national high-tech venture capital foundations, let the state share the risks and benefits with the enterprises and the research institutes. Pay attention to basic research and technology reserves, provide protection via investment policy. II. Development Trends for Ninth FYP and 2010 (1) Communications and Television The trends in communications and television are digital technology, multi-media, software, and system networking. In the short term, analog mobile communications products will still be the lead product in the Chinese market, and we must quickly master the technology for mass production. For digital mobile communications products we need to excel in research and follow this technology. Fiber-optic communications will be centered on the development of synchronous fiber-optic technology. The main task in microwave communications is to improve the volume, quality, and reliability. Satellite communications will again be based on digitized transmission. Developments in television will include a CATV system based on fiber-optic transmission. Digital TV will be gradually commercialized and China needs to conduct research and technology tracking for [digital] HDTV. (2) Computers and Software The unification of computers and communication characterizes an information society. Parallel processing is an important way to improve computing and will be the trend for future mid-size and main-frame computers. Software and information services are capturing a greater share in the computer industry. The triad of software, systems integration, and services is the main trend in software development. Multi-media will become practical. Magnetic recording will move toward greater volume and density and magneto-optical disks will find broad application in computers. Computer security will receive increasing attention. Software operating systems will be based on Unix and Windows. Software development should move toward public-domain applications and development tools should move from single to integrated. Development methods will go from the traditional methods toward object-oriented approaches. The Ninth FYP should emphasize notebook computers. China has already made some progress in workstations and the efforts should continue. The software industry should stress application software, especially high-level software packages. The technology for software tools and systems software should be tracked. (3) Microelectronics The future development trends in microelectronics are integrable, programmable FPGA [field-programmable gate array] technology, MOSYS systems, hybrid ICs, and quantum devices. Development emphasis for the Ninth FYP should be placed on the following items: When introducing new technology for the low-grade or medium-grade products already on the market, the emphasis should be on the novelty and not on the high tech. Practice secondary integration using existing foreign technology and products. Strive for breakthroughs in the design of ICs. Pay attention to packaging and broaden the applications of microelectronics in the automobile industry. (4) Basic Products Production of components will continue to move toward miniaturization, thin-film usage, and large-scale integration. Mass-production technology will receive great attention. Emphasis in the Ninth FYP should be as follows: In component production, chip-type components are yielding the mid-grade market in favor of low-grade, high-consumption components and high-grade products with high added value. The development of sensors and transducers should stress silicon-on-sapphire [SOS] transducers with high stability in a high humidity environment, low-voltage pressure-sensitive resistors, and thin-film Hall devices. The emphasis in electronic components should be hybrid ICs, electronic power meters, electronic cards, and heat sensors. Electronic functional materials should stress sensing materials, precision electronics ceramics, high-density and low-noise magnetic recording materials, fiber-optic materials, high-energy-density rare earth permanent magnetic materials, and new types of acousto-optic materials. For relays and connectors, China should first develop relays and connectors used in communications and television, solid-state relays and chip connectors, ICs, and multi-layer printed circuit boards. Second, China should mass-produce black-and-white and color TFTs [thin-film transistor LCDs] and monochrome and black-and-white STN [supertwist-nematic LCDs] used in opto-electronics. Third, in the area of electronic equipment and special facilities, China should emphasize communications equipment and equipment for precision manufacturing. (5) Military Electronics Modern war has placed a higher demand on electronics technology. Experts at the forum made forecasts for the needs in China's command systems, navigation guidance systems, friend-or-foe identification systems, information systems, aerospace systems, and traffic control systems, and identified the key technologies for each system.
