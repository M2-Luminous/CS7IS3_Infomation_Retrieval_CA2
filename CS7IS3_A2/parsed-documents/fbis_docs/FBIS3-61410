P. Shilov and A. B. Yusov; UDC 546.799.6] [Abstract] In a previous work it was demonstrated that curium can exist in the hexavalent state. Where microquantities of this substance were sufficient for the proof of valency, larger amounts of curium (VI) are needed for purposes such as (VI)/(V) pair potential, absorption spectra, states of existence, etc. In the present work an attempt was made to oxidize curium (III) in solutions of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate saturated with N[.sub]2[/]O and treated with _g_-radiation from Co[.sup]60[/]. It was assumed that oxidation of curium (III) to curium (IV) would lead to disproportionation to form curium (VI). However, curium (III) fails to oxidize on radiation. Oxidation of curium (III) with sodium perxenate in cold sulfuric acid was also unsuccessful. References 8: 4 Russian, 4 Western.
