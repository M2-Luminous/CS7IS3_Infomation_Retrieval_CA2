According to a Central News Unit report at the session a report was submitted to the president on the latest developments on Iran's outstanding debts and the successes achieved. Owing to the country's foreign currency reserves situation it was decided that, to fight the corruption perpetrated by foreign currency dealers and to stabilize the exchange rate, in addition to providing foreign currency for [the import of] goods which qualify for official bank rates, the banking system will provide, at 50 rials below open market rates, all the foreign currency required by importers who have registered, or will register, at the Commerce Ministry to import in return for export. The banking system will also purchase the foreign currencies earned from exports, if the exporters are willing, at the same rate. A Central Bank statement will be issued on this soon.
