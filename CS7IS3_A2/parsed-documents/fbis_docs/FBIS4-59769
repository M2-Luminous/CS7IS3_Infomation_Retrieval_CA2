In her opinion, his remarks are an extravaganza stemming from profound frustration at having achieved less than he had wanted, or perhaps from a dread of coping with reality while living in fantasy. Interviewed by a Qol Yisra'el correspondent this morning, Minister Aloni said the peace process would continue, and even 'Arafat would not be able to jeopardize it, because the Palestinian people want peace. If he continues daydreaming and does not withdraw his remarks, Israel may take time out and possibly pursue negotiations with other members of the Palestinian leadership -- serious, level-headed people representing the Palestinian people, with whom we have become acquainted in the course of the negotiations.
