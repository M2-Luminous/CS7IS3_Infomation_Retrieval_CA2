As is the custom, he chose a passage from the Koran, this time the first passage of Chapter (Sura) 2. In this chapter, the prophet Muhammad blasts the "Children of Israel" for being a stiffnecked people with uncircumcised hearts, as Moses already told them in his time, a people that breaks covenants, a faithless and treacherous child. These things are proven, the Koran says, by the events of the golden calf and the rebellion of Korah, and later by the persecution of many of the prophets. These characteristics are deeply engraved in the Jewish character. Muhammad goes on to say that he learned this to his detriment when the pact between the Jewish tribes and the Muslim community in the city of Medina in the Arabian peninsula collapsed, when those tribes did not live up to their commitments. Thus far, the sacred text. And Bassam Jarar adds: "and is this not just the way we know them in Palestine: a harsh and devious people, with hearts of stone, cunning and cruel--and when it comes down to it, there is no difference between an Oriental Jew or an Ashkenazi." These words are on an audiocassette circulating widely in the territories, and cassettes by other preachers from the Arab countries, some sold even in Israel, say very similar things. They pass on, in fluent language and to a large audience, the array of images (myths) that Islam has built up about the Jews since its dawn. Two acquaintances of mine, both moderate men, one from east Jerusalem and the other from Gaza, told me that they sat with a group last week and listened to Egyptian tapes of commentary on Chapter 2 of the Koran, and found it "amazingly relevant, really speaking to our day." And indeed, about the cruelty of that thick-bearded man wearing the yarmelke and carrying the gun--the stereotypical character from the Arab cartoons of Jews in general and settlers in particular--there is no argument; and slyness, he demonstrated in the way he slipped into "Isaac Hall." But is it really just him? When they preach about the details of the incident from the viewpoint of that second chapter, it becomes clear to the Muslim believer that slyness and treachery are something all Israelis have in common. As though by chance, say Palestinians in a style reminiscent of "Hagashash Hahiver"; as though by chance, half the guards were missing that morning; as though by chance, the metal detectors were not working precisely then; as though by chance, the closed circuit TV was not covering all the halls of the cave that morning; as though by chance, the guards who were there did not notice the murderer slipping into the Muslim prayer area; as though by chance, the General Security Service [GSS] did not warn of a possible attack by Kach extremists, and did not sound the alarm that the Cave of Makhpela was a potential target of attacks by Jewish opponents of the Rabin-'Arafat agreement. The Palestinians are all the more suspicious because two groups are involved here: the border police and the GSS, both part of the unholy trinity, as Hamas calls it, which keeps the residents of the territories in a state of fear (the third group is undercover agents disguised as Arabs). "This typical Jewish way of breaking their word" was what led to the horrible event that has already taken its place in the Palestinian and Muslim pantheon of horrors next to Dayr Yasin, Kfar Qasim, Sabra, and Shatila. In those cases, too, a Muslim will claim, the two-faced Jews had no shortage of excuses: in Dayr Yasin, it was the work of the rejectionist groups; in Kafr Qasim, the muttered words "Allah Yirhamu" were taken as a clear command to kill peaceful citizens; in Sabra and Shatila, the Christian phalangists were the ones who committed the massacre. All this comes to teach us the seriousness of the incident, and the broader context of which it is part. But as philosopher Karl Popper said, human reality is surrounded by plastic hoops; it is limited, but yet still has a measure of flexibility. That is, basic data (economic, demographic, technological, and even mental, such as the Muslim myths about the Jews) determine the framework that binds and distincetly limits the range of possibilities open to human societies. But man is a creature of reason and understanding and has certain degrees of freedom and flexibility. He can maneuver the range of possibilities he is given, and more than just once even break past it and turn it on its head. Clearly, to really use this potential to the fullest, the opportunities must be there, but also, and especially, there must be leaders who will guide society so that it can make the most of the opportunities and get beyond the "plastic hoops." The unforgettable example of this was the Sadat initiative. Sadat took advantage of the "window of opportunity" that had been created by the stalemate in the 1973 war, and by American patronage in the detente era, thatled to peace with that very same Jewish people whose stubbornness and treachery he and his predecessor 'Abd-al-Nasir had said so much about. Menahem Begin, who proved a fitting partner for the Egyptian president, caught the ball in the air, returned the gesture quickly and easily, and at the end of a process filled with pitfalls, proved that Israel was capable of keeping its signed commitments and withdrawing from Sinai and its settlements by the appointed time. The historically negative image of "the Children of Israel" was dealt a heavy blow, at least in the eyes of the Egyptian leader and most of his people. And though sinkholes still exist, the Muslim opposition in Egypt is no longer as capable as it once of profiting politically from this image. More and more contact with reality seems to be able to change group perceptions; and it is all the more likely, when there is a strong motivation to let this happen. Such a motivation does exist among the Palestinian public, as Hamas itself admits: tired from years of intifadah that caused loss of life for some, and bodily harm and loss of freedom for others, continuous interruption of the processes of normal life, damage to the standard of living (because of commercial strikes, the closure, lack of investment). And beside these motives, there is also this positive side--that modest hope that burst into sight in the Palestinians' spontaneous demonstrations in the streets in the middle of September. Though our legal advisers say that: "90 percent of the work of formulating the agreements is still before us," it is imperative to finalize immediately the details of putting the Rabin-'Arafat agreement into effect without quibbling over petty details (like symbols of sovereignty). And on the only subject still on the agenda, i.e., "tariff envelope," is it not possible, with no other choices, to agree to start with a complete separation of the two economies, and afterwards negotiate a gradual and mutual opening up, until the point is reached where both sides are comfortable? This is, as the "nationalist" commentators say, the only Jewish and only moral response to the Hebron massacre--swift signing of the application agreement, and withdrawal of forces within weeks once it is signed. A step like this would offset the influence of the bloodbath a little, even though the scars will not heal soon. Gestures like freeing more prisoners or opening PLO offices will do no more than dull the pain. Only carrying out the Oslo agreement in the field will renew faith in the political process, will not in any way crush the stereotype of the treacherous Jew, but it will take out a bite out of it in a practical way. The "plastic hoops" of the world of myth were tightened around us by the murderer from Qiryat Arba', but it is still possible to heal them and regain our freedom of action. In spite of everything, the historic conjuncture is still shining its light on the peace process.
