It is expected that in the next few years the number of migrants could exceed 6 million. Will Russia be able to give them the necessary economic aid and moral support? Today the reality is such that refugees are in a parlous situation. For example, 6,000 people who suffered during the events in Sumgait and Baku have been temporarily accommodated in boardinghouses, hostels, and hotels in Moscow and Moscow Oblast for five years now. They are now threatened with eviction onto the street. The joint-stock companies which have become the buildings' owners have applied for court orders. Court rulings have already been made on some applications. Other refugees expect the same fate without any hope of defense. This was discussed at a news conference at the Russian-American Press Center. For five years Moscow has been paying for refugees to live in hotels, and at current prices this is a fantastic amount of money. But it turns out that the only alternative to this is evicting people from the city. Apartments are found for arriving workers under the quota system, for errant former first secretaries of some krays and oblasts, and for former people's deputies of the Soviet Union for whom the people simply cannot nurture warm feelings, but there is only one sentence for refugees -- eviction. On 18 May at Odintsovskiy Rayon Court in Moscow Oblast it was decided to evict the Bagdasarov family -- consisting of a woman who has undergone a serious operation and her two daughters. The same fate was suffered by the Smirnov family from Kaliningrad near Moscow. The court decreed: eviction without alternative housing. Actions to evict refugees without giving them alternative housing are a violation of human rights, the Russian Federation Constitution, and international acts signed by Russia, the conference participants noted. The Moscow and Federal Migration Services, which are supposed to safeguard refugees' interests, are siding with those who are evicting them and are submitting to the courts evidence of refugees' refusal to travel to some other regions. But at the conference the refugees produced a whole file of documents -- refusals to accept them in the cities and villages to which the Migration Service had sent them. Meanwhile the Moscow Government, which has many of its own unsolved problems, including a waiting list of thousands of Muscovite families needing housing, is taking its own measures to get rid of the refugees. Specifically, the opinion is being circulated that Moscow is full of refugees who are creating a criminogenic situation in the city. But, as was noted at the conference, this information is clearly an exaggeration. According to Ministry of Internal Affairs data the resettlement of refugees in Moscow is 2.2 times less than throughout the country as a whole. Nevertheless, confrontation between the refugees and the Moscow authorities is intensifying, and not in favor of the refugees. Against the background of such a sorry picture the appearance in Russia of refugees capable of defending themselves in some way arouses special interest. On 2 June the first congress of organizations and enterprises of refugees and displaced persons opens in Moscow. It is being held by Russia's "Compatriots" foundation. Prudently excluding the capital and its oblast from its field of activity, the foundation has for several years been helping to create compact refugee settlements and provide work for them in other Russian regions. The "Compatriots" foundation now comprises 700 small resettlement enterprises and 32 branches in which refugees and settlers work as well. The foundation gives interest-free credit over five to seven years to those prepared to engage in enterprise for themselves. They themselves must earn money for housing. And the refugees do earn it. In Belgorod Oblast they assembled and sold 43 buses, and with the money earned they constructed 19 cottages. In Lipetsk they produce nails, in Pereslavl-Zalesskiy they produce ceramic crockery. Foundation President Boris Sergeyev believes that the most important thing for the refugees is to integrate themselves and not to be parasites. This is why, the foundation's president explained, refugees make up no more than 51 percent of the work force at their enterprises, the remainder being locals. As far as I understood Sergeyev, the regions must realize that the "bundle of belongings is not the only thing a refugee brings with him to his new country of residence: Einstein was a refugee." This is precisely the inscription on one of the posters of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
