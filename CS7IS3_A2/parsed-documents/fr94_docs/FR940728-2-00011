FR940728-2-00011 FR940728-2-00009 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;583&hyph;822] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Class 150 Stainless Steel Threaded Pipe Fittings From Taiwan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce EFFECTIVE DATE: July 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michelle Frederick or Karla Whalen, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0186 or (202) 482&hyph;6309, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that imports of Class 150 stainless steel threaded (SST) pipe fittings from Taiwan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since our preliminary determination on March, 1, 1994 (59 FR 10784, March 8, 1994), the following events have occurred: In March 1994, Yih Tai Industries Co., Ltd. (Yih Tai) and Enlin Steel Corporation (Enlin) requested a public hearing. Enlin, Ta Chen Stainless Pipe Co., Ltd. (Ta Chen) and Yih Tai submitted cost of production and constructed value questionnaire responses in March, 1994. The Department issued supplemental cost of production and constructed value questionnaires in April 1994. Responses to these supplemental questionnaires were submitted by Enlin, Ta Chen and Yih Tai in April and May, 1994. We conducted verifications of Enlin, Ta Chen, and Yih Tai's sales and cost questionnaire responses in Taiwan, and in Long Beach, CA as well for Ta Chen, in April and May, 1994. Enlin, Ta Chen, and Yih Tai submitted case briefs in June. Petitioner did not submit a case brief. No rebuttal briefs were filed. The requests for a public hearing were withdrawn. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are Class 150 SST pipe fittings, defined as cast or forged stainless steel products used to connect pipe sections with an ability to withstand normal pressure service (150 pounds per square inch (psi) at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 300 psi at ^20 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit) as well as resistance to corrosion or extreme temperatures, or prevention of metallic contamination to materials in the system. Included in the scope of this investigation are both finished and unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings of any size. Unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings are defined as those products that have been advanced after casting or forging, but which require threading and machining to finish the fittings; finished Class 150 SST pipe fittings are defined as those products that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees, reducers, etc. and have been further advanced after casting or forging, and require no further processing to be acceptable as a finished product to the end user. Class 150 SST pipe fittings are composed of alloys including, but not limited to, 304 and 316, and are manufactured in the shape of 90-degree elbows, 45-degree elbows, street elbows, tees, crosses, couplings, reducing couplings, half-couplings, caps, square head plugs, hex head plugs, hex bushings, unions, locknuts, and welding spuds. Excluded from the scope of investigation are SST pipe fittings manufactured in the shape of nipples. The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7307.19.9030, 7307.19.9060, 7307.19.9080, 7307.22.1000, 7307.22.5000, and 7307.29.0090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these investigations is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is January 1, 1993, through June 30, 1993. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. All three respondents reported that they sold merchandise in the home market or third-country market identical to that sold in the United States. Accordingly, none provided difference in merchandise (difmer) information in their sales listings. ( See Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Class 150 Stainless Steel Threaded Pipe Fittings from Taiwan, 59 FR 10784, March 8, 1994) for further discussion. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales to the United States of Class 150 SST pipe fittings were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. Enlin did not report cost of production data for a small number of third country products. This information was required in order for the Department to determine whether Enlin's third country sales were made below the cost of production, as discussed below. Therefore, for the small number of Enlin's U.S. sales that would have been compared to sales of these products, we calculated margins based on best information available (BIA) in accordance with 19 U.S.C. ยง1677e(c). As BIA, we used the highest, non-aberrational margin calculated for any of Enlin's reported U.S. sales of the subject merchandise in accordance with Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France 59 FR 14136, (March 25, 1994).
