In this paper, the impact of CFD validation with wind tunnel is discussed. That is going to bring the needs for high accuracy of test data, and that will finally lead to more accurate new test technique, e.g., magnetic suspension, free from the mount interference of high RN low speed wind tunnel, actually very useful for the low risk aircraft development. Also, wind tunnel facilities in FHI aerospace division are introduced. With CFD technology and test technology, FHI has the capability of wide range class airframe development; from low speed small target plane to space-vehicle. As CFD becomes more and more powerful, we now must re-examine the role of wind tunnel testing and perform revalidations and re-evaluations. In this article we introduce the reader to some viewpoints of airframe manufacturers to wind tunnel tests and CFD. We hope this will enable the reader to better understand how CFD research is progressing, in connection with wind tunnel testing. We omit here in detailed discussion of CFD development and implementation as that was covered in the previous symposium.[.sup]1[/] 1. Problems Surrounding Wind Tunnel Tests and CFD The questions most frequently encountered in connection with CFD and wind tunnel testing are the following two. - Do CFD and wind tunnel testing agree? - Will wind tunnels be replaced by CFD? (That is, if CFD gets a lot better, will we cease building wind tunnels?) The answer to the first question is clear, namely that CFD which does not agree at all (i.e. does not coincide in physical terms) has no technological value, nor is there a method for completely computing the motions of air molecules. In other words, the issue is the degree to which they agree. In answer to the second question, if CFD were "almighty" we would not need wind tunnels, but such a state of affairs is still far in the future. (Landahl, for example, says that, in terms of the calculations for reproducing turbulence movements in their entirety, where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]4[/] it would take a year or so, and where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]6[/] it would take about 100 years.[.sup]2[/]) We think that wind tunnels will be used for some time to come, at least in design verification. CFD currently is being used in design work within a framework of "agreeing" fairly well (i.e. with its effectiveness demonstrated), with wind tunnels still used in final verifications. However, there has at least to be some kind of continuity between the results of wind-tunnel tests, on the one hand, and CFD, on the other. So we wind up doing verification checks on CFD with the wind tunnel. 2. Verification Checks While it is undisputed that wind tunnel tests are physical phenomena, CFD is from start to finish a simulation of physical phenomena. Accordingly, CFD is always compared to and verified by wind tunnel tests, which are physical phenomena. Basically, when CFD is set up, specific verification checks are done due to so-called standard problems, but when the continuity with the design is considered, one ends up carrying on verification checks with wind tunnels that are nearby. We cannot have the answers agreeing with only one wind tunnel, so we wind up doing verification checks using data from a number of wind tunnels. This, of necessity, involves us in verifying one wind tunnel against another, and, furthermore, fully verified CFD takes on the property of being usable in verifying the accuracy of wind tunnels in a certain range. Conversely, wind tunnel test precision is improved during the course of CFD verification, in which sense we can hope that the broad-based combination of CFD and wind tunnel testing will result in advances in aerodynamic design technology. 3. Wind Tunnel Test Reliability In Table 1 we represent categorical reasons for attributing reliability to wind tunnel test data. We think that the concept of "seeming to be reliable" probably comes from the "fact that many tests are conducted," which is listed last. We get a sense of all being well that does not necessarily agree with the physical exactitude because of a number of things, such as that we are somehow or other able to design aircraft after conducting many tests, that we can appreciate the continuities with other wind tunnels and understand the comparisons with various and sundry derived values, and that we obtain data which can be physically interpreted, etc. However, when it comes to comparison/verification checks on CFD data, physical exactitude is in fact demanded, and we come face to face with the problems which wind tunnels naturally have. Typical problems are illustrated in Figure 1, for none of which have we found determinative solutions with Japanese wind tunnels. We cannot disregard these problems when we come to consider CFD verification checking. We will now discuss each one briefly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Wind Tunnel Problems i) Wind Tunnel Wall Interference This is particularly pronounced in two-dimensional wind tunnels. In Figure 2 we illustrate a practical wall-interference compensation (angle-of-attack compensation) which we use. Using the relationship whereby the change in angle of attack _D__a_ is directly proportional to C[.sup]l[/], we obtain the compensation value by comparing the change in pressure integral drag to C[.sup]l[/] with the change in the wake survey values. If the ratio between chord and wind tunnel wall height is made small, the interference amount can be reduced, but we need a correction in the angle of attack of something like 0.6ï¿½ with C[.sup]l[/] = 1 even when the ratio is 1:10, which is not a quantity which can be disregarded. There is also the effect of the side-wall boundary layer, and we have to incorporate computations which include the wall model when conducting exact verifications. Figure 2. Wall Interference in Two-Dimensional Wind-Tunnel Tests ii) Support Interference Whenever wind tunnel tests are planned, one must always face the issue of how to support the model. Taking the case of a space shuttle vehicle, diagrammed in Figure 3, the drag of the base has a strong effect on the total aircraft lift/drag ratio. However, since the base pressure (base drag) is very different depending on whether a top support or back support is used, it is important to conduct final free-flight verifications. In research on aft fuselage flows, the method of supporting both main wingtips is sometimes employed (Figure 4), that does not mean that it is possible to eliminate the interference which develops between the main wing and the walls at both tips. Expectations are high for magnetic suspension technology in wind tunnels, but it will no doubt require computations with models which include supporting members in conducting the comparisons of exacting wind tunnel tests and computations before that technology becomes widely used. Figure 3. Support Interference Effects on Base Support Figure 4. Measuring Aft Flows, Example of Results The RN effect, as is well known, is particularly pronounced in flows which include subsonic C[.sup]Lmax[/] separation, etc., and the impact on airline design is great. In ordinary wind tunnels, however, due to inadequate RN, it is not possible to determine the stall characteristics and C[.sup]Lmax[/] well, which brings an element of risk into the flight tests. In order to verify the effectiveness of CFD in aircraft design, it will probably be necessary to verify the continuity between actual flight level RN and ordinary wind tunnel level RN, but we have no wind tunnels in Japan with such high RN. From the perspective of the manufacturer, who must fly the actual aircraft, innovative experimental techniques are employed to make up for this RN insufficiency. Here at FHI, since the development of the T-1, we employ a turbulence grid which artificially increases turbulence and simulates separation conditions at high RN (cf. Figure 5). As shown in Figure 6, in the case of a straight wing aircraft, the lateral instability at stall demonstrated without the turbulence grid disappears when the turbulence grid is attached, so that we can predict low risk during flight tests. However, with a swept-wing craft, the lateral instability at stall does not disappear even when the turbulence grid is used, and we find out that some kind of device like a fence is necessary. Nevertheless, this kind of technique is an expedient, and in the future we will need to have high-RN low-speed wind tunnels for higher-precision development. Also, we do not believe that CFD can adequately function in this area at present, and we must await further research. Figure 5. High-RN Simulation Using Turbulence Grid Figure 6. RN Effect and Leading-Edge Device We can summarize much of what was said above on CFD verification as in Table 2. The strict comparison of two-dimensional chords and two-dimensional wind tunnel tests contains nonsensical elements somewhere, but "two dimension" is useful taking design concepts from two dimensions to three dimensions, and we believe the verification is meaningful in terms of grasping the correlation between 2D CFD and wind tunnel tests and determining the scope of effectiveness. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Wind Tunnel Tests at FHI The current status of CFD was treated in the previous symposium,[.sup]1[/] but we now discuss briefly the wind tunnel testing capabilities of Fuji Heavy Industries. We hope that this, and the previous treatment, will give a better understanding of "wind tunnels and CFD at FHI." FHI currently operates six types of wind tunnel and water tank facilities with which we can conduct various kinds of tests from low speeds to Mach 4. We believe that we need, at minimum, the equipment to allow us to perfect basic airframe designs in house (cf. Table 3). Table 3. FHI Wind Tunnels i) With the high-speed wind tunnel (Figure 7 [not reproduced]) we can conduct tests from M = 0.2 to 4, with the measurement section measuring 0.61 meters square. Full-craft six-component tests and various other tests are performed (cf. Figure 4). Since this is a suction type of wind tunnel, there is little turbulence, maintenance is simple, and the operating rate is high. Over an 11-year period we have conducted some 15,000 blows with this facility. ii) The low-speed wind tunnel (Figure 8) measures 2 m x 2 m, has a normal speed of 50 m/s and a maximum speed of approximately 80 m/s. This facility is used in full-craft shape force and pressure tests, flutter tests, object dropping tests, ground effect tests, and rotor tests. This wind tunnel is very compact for its capabilities. Figure 8. Exterior View of Low-Speed Wind Tunnel iii) The smoke wind tunnel (Figure 9) has a 0.2 m x 2 m measurement section and uses smoke for flow-line observation. It also features three-component, pressure measurements at wind speeds up to 40 m/s, and is useful in the development of airfoils for use at low RN.[.sup]3[/] Figure 9. Exterior View of Smoke Wind Tunnel iv) The simplified wind tunnel (Figure 10) has a measurement section that is 0.6 m x 0.6 m and is used in visual 3D tests at wind speeds up to 15 m/s. It is useful in tests in which lasers are used to make eddies visible. Figure 10. Exterior View of Simplified Wind Tunnel v) The shallow-bottom water tank (Figure 11) simulates flows of up to M = 5 in a thin water tank. It is useful in quantitative pressure measurements as well as in intuitively understanding the behavior of supersonic and hypersonic intakes.[.sup]4[/] Figure 11. Exterior View of Shallow-Bottom Water Tank vi) The visualizing water tank (Figure 12) has a 0.4 m x 0.6 m measurement section and uses water flows of 50 cm to 50 cm/s [sic]. It is useful in making the 3D eddy sites around the object visible. Figure 12. Exterior View of Visualizing Water Tank Thus we have various kinds of wind tunnel facilities. As for a large-scale wind tunnel such as is needed for highly precise development work, however, we must look to the installation of facilities such as the aforementioned high-RN low-speed wind tunnel in public institutions. 5.
