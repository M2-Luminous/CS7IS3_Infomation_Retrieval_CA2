FBIS4-48493 "drafr098_d_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Commentary Notes Government Plan To `Silence' Station Commentary Notes Government Plan To `Silence' Station MB1905195394 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro in Portuguese 1200 GMT 19 May 94 MB1905195394 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro Portuguese BFN [Station commentary] [Text] In its veiled efforts to destroy democracy in Angola, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government is seeking to silence the only voice opposed to the regime -- Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel] -- and then use its disinformation apparatus to bamboozle the Angolan and international opinion at will. How many times have the Angolan and world opinion not been deceived by the news media in the service of the MPLA government? How many times has that news media not insulted those Angolans who do not subscribe to the ideology of the ruling party? How many blatant falsehoods carried by the Angola National Radio and the People's Television of Angola have to be corrected by Vorgan? Vorgan is here to tell the truth to the Angolan people. Vorgan is here to inform the Angolan and international opinion about the program of action of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] that the MPLA government wants to silence. Vorgan is here to expose the historic crimes that men in the service of Eduardo dos Santos commit daily against Angolans. Vorgan can be received on your radios to counterattack the dirty and slanderous propaganda disseminated by the news media in the service of the totalitarian and insensitive ruling party -- the MPLA. Vorgan is here to protect the Angolan people and to challenge the rumors spread daily by Eduardo dos Santos' gang who would like to see supporters of UNITA and its leaders on the run. Vorgan is here also to back other voices opposed to Jose Eduardo dos Santos' totalitarian regime. Vorgan has for many years now been the conduit of God's message to all Angolan Christians. Vorgan is the link uniting all Angolans who want a united and single Angola which is equal for all, in a real and genuine democracy free of hatred, treason, and division. Vorgan is the free voice of free Angolans. Only detractors of democracy and dictators like the MPLA government leaders are interested in silencing UNITA's radio station -- the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel -- in order to serve their Machiavellian interests. Forward with a free press! Long live peace, freedom, and democracy! Long live our president, Dr. Savimbi!
