Africa should not be neglected or marginalized." Qian made the statement at a press conference held here today at the end of his visit to Kenya. He said, "though Africa faces many difficulties, it also has its own strong points. Africa is not hopeless its future is bright." On his current East Africa trip, he said he has come to see developments in the region by himself and promote bilateral relations between China and the countries he visits. On the major problem facing African countries, Qian said African countries are not able to concentrate their efforts to develop economy, adding many problems cannot be solved without real development of economy. He said Africa is under great political and economic pressures from the outside world. Under such circumstances there are turmoil and unrest in some African countries. "Without stability, it is hard for them to develop economy," he pointed out. On the democratic process in South Africa, Qian expressed his hope that the planned non-racial general election on April 27 will take place on schedule and a new democratic non-racial South Africa will be established. "China is willing to develop relations with a new South Africa in various fields on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence," Qian said. As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Africa, Qian said South Africa should follow international regulations. "It should not have diplomatic relations with China and China's Taiwan province at the same time." On the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Lesotho, Qian said this has once again demonstrated there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and the attempt of the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" has no popular support and will never succeed.
