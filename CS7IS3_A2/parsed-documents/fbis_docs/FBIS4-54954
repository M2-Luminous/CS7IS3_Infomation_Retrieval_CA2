Their demands consisted of an annual rent for the flooded land, compensation for the flooded houses and other buildings, an organized transfer to other areas, and long-term loans. As seen, some of these demands cannot be met and are unreasonable. The democratic government considered some other demands to be reasonable and promised to put them into effect. For this reason, four ministers of the democratic government held a meeting with the strike commission yesterday. After lengthy discussions on these problems, they asked the commission to liberate the occupied building. After this meeting, several strikers abandoned the strike. More than half of them categorically refused to leave and attacked the public order forces, as they attempted to evict them according to the law. Consequently, 26 persons were wounded with stones and other hard objects -- of whom 14 were from the Public Order forces -- with two suffering fractures. The Public Order Ministry stresses that certain extremist elements stand behind these offenders, who are former Labor Party leaders and collaborators of the secret police and who, besides this, have today committed the grave crime of blocking the national road. The Public Order Ministry stresses that measures according to the law will be initiated against the persons responsible.
