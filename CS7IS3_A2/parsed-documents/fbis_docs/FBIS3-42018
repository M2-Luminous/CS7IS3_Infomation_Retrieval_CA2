The president acts consistently in the spirit of the resolution, passed by the country's Supreme Council, on Ukrainian ratification of the well-known treaty on the destiny of the nuclear weapons on its territory, the head of Kravchuk's press service pointed out. The occasion for the conversation at 0930, during which a real official statement was made, was the coming visit to Ukraine today of U.S. President Bill Clinton for a meeting with Kravchuk.
