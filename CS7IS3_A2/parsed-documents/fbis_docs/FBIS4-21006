Syria's Tishrin daily denounced "the refusal of US congressmen who are close to the Zionist lobby, and who do not really like the Syrian-US rapprochement, to remove Syria's name from the list." Such behavior was "proof of hostile and aggressive intentions against Syria," which had taken the necessary steps to curb the transit of drugs across its territory, the paper said, adding that Syria was not a producer country. Tishrin recalled that in April 1993 a law was adopted requiring the death penalty for those convicted of growing, producing and trafficking drugs. A White House statement on Friday said that Syria had done little to combat drug trafficking. The State Department had initially wanted to exempt Syria from the list to reward it for helping to press the Palestine Liberation Organization back into peace talks, The New York Times reported Friday. But legislators denounced the State Department's maneuvering, given Syria's poor record in stopping the opium trade in the al-Biqa Valley in Lebanon, an area largely controlled by Syria, the Times said. Mindful of the explosiveness of granting concessions to Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled lower-ranking officials who had recommended the exemption. Syria is due to resume bilateral peace talks with Israel later this month.
