Statistics released by the ministry's investment commission show that outward investment totaled U.S.$1.66 billion last year, up a whopping 87 percent from 1992, while approved foreign and overseas Chinese investment shrank 17 percent to U.S.$1.21 billion, resulting in a U.S.$450 million investment deficit for Taiwan. The United States remained the top destination for Taiwan investors, absorbing about U.S.$380 million last year, which is nearly twice that of 1992. Singapore, however, was on top of the growth among all Taiwan capital recipients. Taiwan manufacturers invested about U.S.$70 million in the Southeast Asia country last year, representing a 6.9- fold jump from more than U.S.$8 million in 1992.
