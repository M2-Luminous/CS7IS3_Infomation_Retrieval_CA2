FR940804-2-00030 FR940804-2-00010 On July 13, 1994, the Department issued to each respondent a supplementary questionnaire regarding Section D of the Department's original questionnaire. The due dates for Acenor's and Roldan's supplementary responses have been extended until August 3 and August 4, 1994, respectively. Consequently, this information will be received too late for purposes of the preliminary determination, but will be analyzed, verified, and considered for the final determination. On July 26, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondents requested that the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination is affirmative. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other SSB grades which Roldan sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna), a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy, requested that the Department reconsider the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna, we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was not raised by any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure consistent treatment of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations. Related Party Sales On April 21, 1994, Roldan reported sales made to both related and unrelated distributors, and unrelated end users in the home market. We compared related party prices to unrelated party prices using the test set forth in Appendix II to Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Certain Cold-rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina, 58 FR 37062 (July 9, 1994), and determined that the sales made to related parties were not at arm's length. We subsequently requested that Roldan and Acenor report all sales made by their related parties to the first unrelated customer in the home market. These sales, reported on June 29, and July 1, for Acenor and Roldan, respectively, were submitted too late to be properly analyzed for use in the preliminary determination. On June 13, 1994, Roldan submitted a revised home market sales listing including Roldan's sales to both related and unrelated parties. However, for the preliminary determination we did not use portions of the revised sales listing containing related party sales because we found certain discrepancies between the related party sales data contained in respondent's original and revised responses. However, we intend to clarify these discrepancies prior to verification and consider respondent's revised related party sales listing for the final determination based on verification findings. Therefore, for purposes of the preliminary determination, we only used the portion of Roldan's sales listing pertaining to sales made directly to unrelated parties in our analysis. For Acenor, we compared prices to a related party with prices to unrelated parties using the test referenced above and determined that the sales made to the related party were not at arm's length. Accordingly, we used only sales made directly to unrelated parties reported in Acenor's June 29, 1994, sales listing. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of SSB from Spain to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible. United States Price For both Roldan and Acenor, we based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and exporter's sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated. We made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Spain, in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993). (See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France, 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994). We re-calculated the VAT for both Roldan and Acenor because the methodology they employed in reporting the VAT was not clearly defined. The VAT will be examined at verification and re-analyzed for the final determination. Roldan We calculated PP based on CIF delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage and handling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling (including insurance), U.S. inland freight and U.S. import duties. We made no adjustment for freight charge differentials claimed by Roldan because of the lack of data on the record concerning the nature of the adjustment claimed. We intend to obtain further information and to verify the reported data. We will revisit this issue in our final determination based on verification findings. Acenor We calculated PP based on ex-factory packed prices to unrelated customers. Accordingly, we made no adjustments to these reported prices. Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets with respect to sales of SSB during the POI.
