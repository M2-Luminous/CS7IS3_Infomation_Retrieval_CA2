[Ouchi] The issue cannot be settled by merely withdrawing his remarks. In view of the fact that his remarks have had a serious effect on various concerned countries, he has to take the blame for making them. And it is appropriate for him to decide to resign. It was extremely inappropriate for him to say that "[the Nanjing masscare] is a fabrication." [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the effect on the political situation? [Ouchi] The new cabinet has just been formed, the Hata administration will have to undergo a serious ordeal such as attacks by opposition parties. And the cabinet will have to overcome various trials. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a new parliamentary group, "Kaishin" [Innovation], has caused the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the coalition. Mr. Chairman, was this idea worked out by you? [Ouchi] That is correct. Since gaps were noted between the SDPJ and other coalition parties, there was a danger that these gaps could lead to the breakup of the coalition. Therefore, setting aside my own personal feelings, I had been thinking of forming a stable parliamentary group. It would have been undesirable for conflict to arise every time the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) development of nuclear weapons is brought up. With the idea of forming such a parliamentary group in mind, I called a meeting of the party executives on 22 April. Then, I directly informed General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa (of the the DSP) and Representative Ichiro Ozawa (of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) of this idea and asked their views. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How did Mr. Ozawa respond at that time? [Ouchi] Very simply, he said that "he would agree to the idea." When I asked him if "he was opposed to the idea of including Sakigake [Harbinger]," he answered that he "was not opposed to it." Therefore, I thought it was all right to go ahead with the plan. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Did you talk to Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the SDPJ? [Ouchi] I said to Mr. Murayama: "In viewing the situation from a broader point of view, we intend to form a parliamentary group composed of the Japan New Party, Sakigake, DSP, and Shinseito, although it would be impossible to win the SDPJ's immediate understanding." In response, Mr. Murayama said: "Yes, that is right. Why do you not go ahead with the plan?" I asked for his understanding that this group would be formed with four parties. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Maintaining that the act "constitutes a breach of faith," the SDPJ has seceded from the coalition. What do you think of this? [Ouchi] It would be understandable if they seceded from the coalition because of a disagreement in policies. However, since the administration is different from the parliamentary group, I do not think it is a good reason for them to secede from the coalition. I think that the decision was made basically because of their original intention to cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and it just so happened that the forming of a new parliamentary group has given them a good excuse to secede from the coalition. It is contrary to the fact to say that our decision was "a complete surprise" to them. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the change of the administration this time? And what role will the DSP play in the future realignment of political circles? [Ouchi] If the realignment of political circles should be based on the new electoral system, it will be a task involving all political parties. Now that the SDPJ has become an opposition party, it will be difficult--when viewed from the standpoint of common sense--for the SDPJ to promote regrouping of political parties through its cooperation with the LDP. The realignment should not be carried out without following some principles. What is most important is that an accord should be reached on basic policies. With our political ideology, characteristics, and policies, it is always possible for our party to play the leading role in promoting the realignment of political circles. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa cabinet was criticized for allowing its operations to be managed under the leadership of Shinseito and Komeito. It seems that such a tendency will be further strengthened under the Hata administration. What is your view on this point? [Ouchi] When the idea of the National Welfare Tax was brought up without going through sufficient deliberations, we dauntlessly asked for the idea to be revised. In the Hata cabinet are many cabinet members who are members of Shinseito or Komeito. Nevertheless, in aiming to create an open cabinet we will do our best to promote cooperation within the cabinet. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] As a result of the issue of forming the new parliamentary group "Kaishin," some members of the DSP as well as labor unions that support the DSP have raised the issue of the chairman's responsibility. What do you have to say on this point? [Ouchi] The idea of forming the parliamentary group was based on the unanimous approval at a meeting of the party organ. If criticism is based on the result, the idea has certainly led to the unfortunate result of the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. However, none of our party members are opposed to the idea of forming the group. With regard to the issue of my responsibility in dealing with this matter, I would listen to criticism with modesty. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Have you ever thought of any concrete plans to take responsibility? [Ouchi] It will be necessary to think about how to take responsibility. However, I do not think it is proper for me to take responsibility right now. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the "Kaishin" group become a political party before the next election? [Ouchi] For the time being, it will be a floor group in the Diet that supports the Hata administration. If a relationship of confidence between each other should develop, the coalition parties will play the central role in the realignment of political circles. It will take considerable discussions before the group can be developed into a new party. Viewed from the standpoint of size, we cannot say that the realignment has been completed when the size of all the political parties that have joined the coalition this time is taken into consideration. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties are already engaged in discussing the possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives or calling for a no-confidence vote on the cabinet. What do you think of it? [Ouchi] Some people may have such views. However, since the opposition parties are willing to cooperate in the enactment of the budget and other bills, I do not think that for the time being the management of state affairs will be hampered. During this period, measures will be worked out to strengthen the coalition, and I will make efforts to this end. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Which system does the DSP intend to support, the system of two major parties or the system of multiple parties? [Ouchi] An urgent question lies in preparing for a situation in which there will be several political parties, and also in creating two administrations (that can be replaced by each other). I do not have any idea that multiple parties should be reorganized into two major political parties.
