Baku "openly spoke against bringing separating forces into the region, which is the backbone of Russia's peace plan," Acting Chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Karen Baburyan told Interfax on April 14. Therefore, he considers that it was not by chance that the start of a new offensive by the Azeri army in northern Nagorno-Karabakh and activation of peacekeeping efforts of the international community, and in the first place of Russia, "seeking the soonest end of bloodshed as the first step toward the beginning of talks" coincided. In Baburyan's opinion, the prospect of Russia's military presence in the conflict zone alarmed the Azeri side which is aiming to disrupt a meeting between the warring sides at the highest level prepared with Russia's mediation.
