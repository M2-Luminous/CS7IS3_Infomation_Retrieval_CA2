FR941011-2-00100 FR941011-2-00064 Office of Scientific Review (HNS15). (1) Directs and carries out the scientific and technical merit review of research training, research support, research center, research conference, and research program project grant applications; (2) originates and coordinates policies and procedures of the Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease, Genetic Basis of Disease, Pharmacological Sciences review committees, Minority Access to Research Careers and Minority Biomedical Research Support review subcommittees, and any necessary ad hoc committees; (3) conducts the search for the most qualified and representative individuals to serve as members of review committees and site visitors; and (4) organizes and coordinates site visits and scientific and technical merit reviews. Division of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biological Chemistry (HNS2). (1) Plans, directs, and administers a program of research grants, contracts, and institutional and individual fellowship awards designed to support research and research training that: (a) Enhances therapeutics through increased understanding of drug action and improved methodologies for the generation of drugs, (b) fosters the integration and application of physiological and biochemical research in addressing clinical problems such as those that occur as a result of trauma and burns; (c) fosters the development and application of chemical and biochemical techniques to biological problems, as well as the development and application of theory derived from chemical and biochemical principles; (2) analyzes national research efforts in anesthesiology, biochemistry, biotechnology, chemistry, pharmacology, physiology, trauma, burns, and related areas, and makes recommendations to assist the National Advisory General Medical Sciences Council, other advisory committees and groups appointed to participate in decisions about areas of new or continuing program emphasis, or to determine relative scientific merit of grant applications; (3) identifies and stimulates research areas in anesthesiology, biochemistry, biotechnology, chemistry, pharmacology, physiology, trauma, and burn in which increased effort would most effectively contribute to better understanding of biological processes in normal and diseased states and to the generation of new therapies; (4) manages an inter-institute intramural postdoctoral staff fellowship program with research efforts in pharmacological sciences and clinical pharmacology; and (5) advises universities, other centers of medical research, and professional and lay organizations about the content and research needs of the Division. Division of Genetics and Developmental Biology (HNS3). (1) Plans and directs a program of research grants, contracts, and institutional and individual fellowship awards to support research and research training directed toward gaining a better understanding of the processes and mechanisms of inheritance with the objective of designing better methods of prevention, treatment, and control of genetic disease in humans; (2) analyzes national research efforts on the problem of human genetic disease as a generalized phenomenon involving common mechanisms amenable to study on the basis of a broad fundamental research approach, and makes recommendations to assist the National Advisory General Medical Sciences Council or other advisory committees or groups appointed to (a) participate in decisions about new or continuing areas of program emphasis, or (b) determine the relative scientific merit of applications for grant support; (3) maintains surveillance over new research developments and identifies the need for research in the area of genetics and developmental biology; and (4) advises universities, other centers of medical research, and professional and lay organizations about research needs and requirements of the Division.
