"After the budget is endorsed, in the near future this might become a reality," he said. According to Soskovets, the state intends to boost the development of more advanced technologies for the armed forces and advocate a liberal approach to the realisation of military exports. Soskovets pointed out that exporting weapons, the government will take into account political interests of the state, and the liberalisation of exports will be beneficial for manufacturers. Soskovets pointed out that the government will offer defence enterprises an opportunity to independently work for exports. "However, the state does not intend to sell a number of military hardware constructed on the basis of absolutely new high tech, which affects the country's defence," Soskovets said.
