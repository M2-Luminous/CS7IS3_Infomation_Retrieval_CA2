He pointed out: rectifying unhealthy tendencies in government departments and in various professions and trades is one of the three tasks in combating corruption in an in-depth, lasting, and effective manner. As it has a direct bearing on the personal interests of a vast number of people, on the image of the party and government, and on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability, all government departments, professions, and trades are urged to attach a high degree of importance to work style rectification, to consolidate work style rectification achievements, to exert greater efforts to deepen the work, and to score even better results in work style rectification. On 24 and 25 March, Comrade Wei Jianxing presided over the work style rectification forum attended by some ministries and commissions of the State Council with a view to implementing the CPC Central Committee's and the State Council's arrangements for combating corruption this year and to studying main issues, setting up goals, and adopting necessary measures in this year's work style rectification. Attending the forum were responsible persons from the Agriculture Ministry, Railways Ministry, Public Health Ministry, Construction Ministry, Public Security Ministry, Power Industry Ministry, Posts and Telecommunciations Ministry; the State Education Commission; the People's Bank of China; the General Administration of Customs; the State General Administration of Taxation; and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Also attending the meeting were State Councillors Li Guixian and Luo Gan; and responsible persons from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and from the Ministry of Supervision. At the conclusion of the forum, Comrade Wei Jianxing stressed: The key for carrying out in-depth work style rectification lies in leaders of professions and trades attaching importance to the work. Practice has shown that leading comrades in party and government departments and in professions and trades who personally take charge of the work style rectification, who are good at integrating work style rectification with reform and administrative tasks in their departments, who are skillful at integrating clean-administration building with honest performance of official duties, always produce good results with work style rectification in their departments and in their professions and trades; failing that, it will be impossible to achieve anticipated goals and the arrangement and the call for work style rectification will end up as a haphazard and uninspiring one. Comrade Wei Jianxing stressed the need for leading cadres to attach importance to work style rectification and to adopt proper methods in profoundly carrying out work style rectification. He called on all to pay attention to the following four areas. First, stress important points and set clear and definite goals. He said that as work style rectification is a long term task, setting too many and too sweeping tasks to be accomplished in one stage should be avoided; instead, one should first select one or two important issues, then set clear and specific goals, and go on producing results in a down-to-earth manner. Second, explore a full set of scientific methods for verification. Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out that ideological and political work, corruption combating work, and work style rectification are like economic work, scientific and technological work, and administrative work; they not only require quality analysis but also quantity verification; some of the work results may be verified; measures to ensure the success of the work and conditions needed to accomplish the task may also be verified. If we fail to explore a full set of scientific methods, and if we limit ourselves to making uninspiring calls and to presenting unimpressive reports, then we will be unable to provide suitable guidance in various areas of work. Third, show how the policy works. Units which do an excellent job in work style rectification must be commended and their experience promoted; units failing to perform well in work style rectification must be criticized and be given time for improvement. Fourth, treat the root cause and symptoms of the problems at the same time. To deal with problems which have emerged in the course of work style rectification, efforts should be increased to raise ideological level, to improve administration skills, and to constantly raise the working level. Comrade Wei Jianxing called on leading comrades at the CPC Central Committee organs to do an even better anticorruption and clean-administration building job and to take personal charge of work style rectification in their own departments and in their professions and trades. To further deepen the nation's work style rectification, he also called on them to set specific goals; to explore scientific verification methods; to work out rational policies; to adopt sound systems; and to employ scientific methods.
