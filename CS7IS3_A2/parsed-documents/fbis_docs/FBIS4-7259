Few clauses of the accord affecting Korea were changed, except the agricultural sector, during the last week's ministerial conference in the Moroccan city as the accord formulated on Dec. 15 last year has remained untouched. But wider opening of the domestic car market became a hot issue at bilateral trade ministers talks with the United States and the European Union (EU). Observers viewed that Korea will be obliged to open the car market wider as the two countries have insisted on it. Environment and labor issues are expected to be closely linked with trade as the Green Round (GR) and Blue Round (BR) are expected to be the next global issues to the Uruguay Round which has created a world trade "watchdog," the World Trade Organization (WTO). The observers forecast that the two issues will be an obstacle to expansion of Korea's exports with environment protection and labor rights in Korea are still below the standard of advanced nations. First of all, domestic auto manufacturers are expected to face a flood of foreign cars in view of strong pressure from the United States and the EU to allow easier access of their manufacturers to the Korean car market. U.S. automakers insist that Korea lower tariff rates on foreign cars from 10 percent to the 2.5 percent imposed by the U.S. government and that the acquisition tax on deluxe cars valued at 70 million won or more be slashed from 15 percent to 2 percent. They also called on Korea to advance the abolition of restrictions on the acreage of indoor exhibition of their cars slated for Jan. 1, 1996, and on advertisements in domestic media. Advanced nations are expected to put more pressure on Korea to open its markets wider through bilateral and multilateral negotiations on the occasion of the inauguration of the WTO as seen in the automobile sector. In this changing environment, domestic business groups have been forming teams exclusively for trade negotiations on both group and subsidiary firm levels, while allocating more trade negotiation experts. Samsung Group has installed an environmental research institute in the secretariat office to prepare for possible green ground negotiations and has increased the number of trade negotiation experts in subsidiary firms to cope with frequent anti-dumping suits in advanced nations. Hyundai Group has diverted some 50 trade experts in Hyundai Corp. to automobile and shipbuilding subsidiaries which are expected to face an uphill battle with foreigners. Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo and Pohang Iron and Steel Co. have been training trade experts by region and commodity. But analysts said that the UR accord will be favorable to domestic manufacturers, except agriculture, the wholesale and retail sector and intellectual properties. They forecast that exports will increase sharply but imports will not grow as fast as the exports do. Steel and petrochemical manufacturers will benefit most as tariffs will be reduced to zero in 10 years. The steel industry, in top notch shape in competitiveness, is expected to increase products due to a gradual tariff rate cut to zero, while benefiting from decreasing tariff on raw materials of iron ore and coking coal, the analysts said. The petrochemical industry will witness similar benefits as tariff rates of trading partners are high at 20-200 percent compared to 9 percent imposed by Korea. Tariff rates are to be cut gradually to zero over 10 years. In the electronics sector, Korea's exports are predicted to increase, while foreign products are expected to rapidly make inroads into the domestic market as well. A plus factor is that more than 60 percent of domestic electronics production are exported. In particular, more than 90 percent of semi-conductor production is exported. In the textile sector, Korea's exports will be little affected for the time being as an import quota exists for 10 years with each item gradually being liberalized in import as demanded by Korea in the Uruguay Round talks. But the domestic textile industry needs to switch from low-price items to high value-added ones to turn away any challenges of developing nations. But general machinery is expected to flood the nation as Korean manufacturers heavily depend on foreign products, the analysts said. Scrapping subsidies will only drive domestic makers out of their domestic markets, they said.
