A responsible source has stated the following: In an attempt to cover up its shelling of residential quarters and hospitals in the capital, Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah, and other cities with Scud missiles -- whose use in wartime against civilians and civilian installations is prohibited -- the gang of apostasy and secession within the leadership of the Socialist Party has claimed that the two missiles that fell yesterday evening on Aden airport, which houses military targets and from which the warplanes under the control of the secessionist gangs take off daily to bomb the civilians and the members of our Armed Forces, hit the homes of citizens and caused damage to them, injuring some of their inhabitants. We doubt such a false claim could fool anyone. And this will also not justify the ugly, heinous crimes of this gang, which will not be forgotten by our people. Since this criminal gang ignited the fighting in Yemen, the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy have abided by the orders of the brother chairman, Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to ensure the safety of civilians and their property, no matter what crimes the secessionist gang commits against secure cities and defenseless civilians. The source said the Armed Forces do not possess Scud missiles, which the secessionists claimed that the forces protecting unity and legitimacy used in operations to hit Aden airport.
