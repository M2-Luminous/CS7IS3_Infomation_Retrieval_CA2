After 12 hours of talks in Brussels, they agreed to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they withdraw from Sarajevo within 10 days. The ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed consideration of all military and political implications for the West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of weaponry to UN forces. Tonight's historic declaration also threatens air strikes immediately if any shelling resumes in the wake of last weekend's street market massacre which killed 68 civilians. Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision will not endanger three key goals: - The continuation of humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of Sarajevo. - The maintenance of the peace process. - The containment of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former Yugoslavia. Mr Weston had insisted that air strikes had to be seen to be of practical benefit and not just punitive retaliation in response to last Saturday's [5 February] atrocity. Only if air strikes can be justified as of practical military benefit to safeguard lives and help end the war can the NATO allies rely on support from elsewhere in the world. The talks lasted much longer than expected. Greece insisted from the start that it did not want any involvement in the air strikes which, if they go ahead, are likely to be launched from Italy and from aircraft carriers. Argument raged throughout the day over the precise terms of the ultimatum, with the Americans pressing for a tighter seven-day deadline and a requirement to withdraw heavy artillery 20 miles. An announcement from Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serbs were already preparing to pull back by noon tomorrow did not deter the NATO allies. Officials at NATO headquarters said such pledges could not be relied upon and would play little part in tonight's final decision. The most reluctant signatories to tonight's agreement remain the British, Canadians and Greeks, and hopes remain high that the Serbs will fulfil all requirements and avert a NATO response which -- even with the best military soundings from on the spot -- could have unforseen consequences. Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who has just taken command of UN Forces in Bosnia, has been instrumental in supplying his political masters with the necessary strategic information for a tough political decision to be taken. Britain's endorsement follows recognition that Saturday's massacre was "a turning point," in the words of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. [The declaration made clear there would be no extension of the deadline offered to the Serbs. [It called for "the withdrawal or regrouping and placing under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] control, within 10 days, of heavy weapons (including tanks, artillery pieces, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, missiles and anti-aircraft weapons) of the Bosnian Serb forces located in an area within 20 km of the centre of Sarajevo and excluding an area within 2 km of the centre Pale." [The allies also called on the Bosnian government to hand over its heavy weapons to UN control within the same deadline. ["Ten days from 24 GMT February 10 heavy weapons of any of the parties found within the Sarajevon exclusion zone, unless controlled by UNPROFOR, will, along with their direct and essential military support facilities, be subject to NATO airstrikes which will be conducted in close co-ordination with the UN Secretary General and will be consistent with the North Atlantic Council's decisions of August 2 and 9, 1993." [The declaration authorised air strikes, at UN request, against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo, from 0001, Friday, February 21, which were determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets in the city. [At British insistence the final communique made direct reference to the need to secure a negotiated settlement, and pointed out "the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a step toward the placing of Sarajevo under UN administration, in comformity with that plan." [This met the British demand that air strikes must be in the context of improving the situation and not merely exacting revenge. [The 13-paragraph document demanded "strict respect" for the safety of UNPROFOR and other UN and relief agency workers throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the right of free access for them to Sarajevo. [The allies also expressed "indignation" at "indiscriminate attacks which have once again struck the people of Sarajevo in recent days." The siege of the city was continuing, "and that consequently the Bosnian Serbs bear the main responsibility for the tragic loss of civilian life that results from it." [A key element in NATO deliberations was the longer term consequence of air strikes. [Mr Hurd made clear earlier this week that "one day of satisfaction" was not justified without advance knowledge of what happens on the second day and the third day. [Britain's troops on the ground in Sarajevo would be vulnerable if the Serbs launched retaliatory strikes. [But NATO aircraft and spy satellites have been monitoring all Serb gun emplacements, ammunition dumps and command centres for months and believe they can isolate key targets if necessary and pre-empt any effective retaliation. [Already eight RAF Jaguar fighter aircraft are on stand-by in Italy with a further four available in Britain, plus six Navy Sea Harriers from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal in the Adriatic. [But the hope in the Foreign Office tonight was that the NATO threat would be enough to convince the Bosnian Serbs to ease their stranglehold and make life more tolerable for Sarajevo's beleaguered citizens while efforts towards a negotiated peace acceptable to all sides carry on.]
