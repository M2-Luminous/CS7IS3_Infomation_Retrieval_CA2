The flotation began last Wednesday and by Monday a total of 20 billion yuan ($2.3 biilion) worth of three- and five-year bonds will be issued to 10 financial institutions, said Yao Zhenyan, president of the bank. Instructed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, these institutions will also buy 8 billion yuan ($920 million) in bonds next month. The bank is planning to issue 65 billion yuan (S7.5 billion) in bonds this year. The rest will be sold in three batches in the second half of this year, Yao said. The institutions buying the bonds are the Shanghai and Shenzhen branches of the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, the Construction Bank, the Communications Bank, the Everbright Bank, the Industrial Bank of the China International Trust & Investment Corp and the Post Saving and Remitting Bureau. The paperless bonds cannot be traded in the market or among banks, but they can be used as collateral when borrowing money from the central bank. The issue of financial bonds is an important way to ensure that the bank, which went into operation on July 13, has enough capital to support the country's key construction projects. More capital will come from the national treasury, which has promised 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) of registered capital over the next four years. Relying on the financial bonds and State allocations, the bank this year is planning to supply 80 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) in low-interest loans for infrastructural construction. About 40 per cent of the loans is expected to be granted in the first half of this year, Yao said, adding that the money raised through the bonds will be channelled to projects within several days. The bank's loans will be used for developing the country's key infrastructural projects and the basic but overburdened industries that have been hindering economic growth. This year's beneficiaries include 345 large and medium-sized construction projects such as the giant Three Gorges Dam, the Beijing-Kowloon railway and some big power stations. To raise more capital, Yao said, his bank is quite willing to co-operate with international financial sources. At first, the bank will be responsible for the relending of some loans from foreign governments and international financial organizations. It is also likely to issue bonds overseas if it gets the approval, of the State. Yao said many overseas financial institutions have expressed their wishes to help the bank issue overseas bonds. Furthermore, Yao said, the bank will also seek commercial loans from overseas banks. He said the bank will set up some affiliates in foreign countries in the future. Establishing the State Development Bank is an important part of the country's financial reform. It is aimed at ensuring the smooth flow of capital to key State projects and providing the central government with a powerful tool to rein in excessive investment in fixed assets.
