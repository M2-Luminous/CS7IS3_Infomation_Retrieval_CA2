The Japanese and Nepalese Governments have agreed on a program to equip the accident-prone airport with radars and other facilities as well as train air controllers, the officials said. The Transport Ministry sent a controller and an engineer Thursday to Kathmandu for training the Nepalese. The government also plans to invite 30 to 40 controllers from the airport to Japan for training. The planned refurbishing of the control facilities will be completed around fall in 1996. The poor safety level at the airport came into the spotlight in 1992, when two plane crashes within a two-month period killed nearly 300 people. On July 31, 1992, a Thai Airways Airbus crashed into a Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the airport, killing all 113 people on board, including 21 Japanese. On September 28, a Pakistani airliner carrying 167 people crashed in a rainstorm near the airport, killing all aboard. Kathmandu airport is considered tricky by pilots, who have to spiral down to the runway to avoid surrounding mountains. The airport has no radar and planes are guided in by radio beacon.
