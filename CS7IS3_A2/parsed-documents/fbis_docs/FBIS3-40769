He told reporters here that he noticed a change in the perceptions of the politicians in the country on the Tibet issue over a period of time, and attributed this to the decline in "moral spirit, self-confidence and courage" among politicians of the post-independence era. However, he said, more stronger feeling and seriousness was being witnessed among the Indian intellectuals and the student community on the sovereignty of Tibet. Referring to India's policy on China in regard to Tibet, the Dalai Lama said India was "over-cautious." He said India accepting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet was a "mistaken commitment." "At least India should describe Tibet as an "autonomous region" of China, like the British, he felt and disclosed that Indian legal experts on various occasions had questioned and confronted the stand of the Indian government in this connection. The Dalai Lama appeared apologetic towards the Indian government's predicament and said "It is not easy for a big nation like India to effect change in policy on an international issue as it involves various factors and aspects." On the collapse of the eastern bloc, the spiritual head said the collapse of communism had both positive and negative effects on the Tibetan issue and their fight for freedom. When asked about the opinion on Tibet in western countries and America, the Dalai Lama replied that several western nations, including America, had confirmed the fact that Tibet was an "occupied land" and both the houses of the United States had accepted this. He expressed his deep gratitude to the government of India, and especially the government of Karnataka, for their support to the Tibetan refugees settled in the state. "The Tibetans in India have preserved their culture and spirituality, all because of positive help rendered by the state and Union government," he said.
