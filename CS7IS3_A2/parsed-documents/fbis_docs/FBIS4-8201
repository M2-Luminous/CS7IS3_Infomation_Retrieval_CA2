The mines were layed during the day outside at least three arms depots where Serbs had earlier placed their heavy weapons under UN control. Two depots were located north of the city at Vogosca and Radava and one, to the west, near Blazuj, a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said. UNPROFOR had suspended all movement of its forces, spokesman Rob Annink said. Meanwhile, all checkpoints leading to the city were closed and even the head of UNPROFOR, French general Bertrand de Lapresle, had to skirt around a Serb-held area to reach Sarajevo airport from where he flew to Zagreb. An attempt to organize a meeting between De Lapresle and Serb commander General Ratko Mladic was called off after Bosnian Serbs broke off all contacts with UNPROFOR Sunday night in the wake of a first North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike against their forces outside besieged Gorazde. A second strike was carried out Monday. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday suspended its air bridge to Sarajevo and a spokeswoman said UNHCR would reassess the situation Tuesday before deciding whether to resume airlifts of injured Bosnians out of Sarajevo to the Italian airforce base at Ancona.
