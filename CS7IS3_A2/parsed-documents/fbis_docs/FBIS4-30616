According to the survey, two-third of them initially expected to make greater business profits this year, and they hoped that their business would recover. However, only 7 percent of these respondents said that they will earn higher profits even if the dollar remains at the level of 100 yen. On the other hand, nearly 40 percent of them said their business profits will decline. As for the economic situation as a whole, 15 companies said that the economic recovery will be delayed, while 14 companies expressed concern that the economy will deteriorate again. It can be said that they consider the situation to be very serious. When asked about measures to counter the yen's appreciation, 17 companies plan to increase their overseas production, while 13 companies plan to expand their imports of parts from foreign countries. They intend to deal with the yen's current appreciation by reducing costs through increasing both overseas production and the imports of parts. If they increase production at their plants abroad, it is feared that this will cause industrial stagnation in Japan. For example, there are concerns that this will affect domestic employment and technological development. As for domestic employment, only 30 percent of these respondents said that they are going to maintain their current number of workers. On the other hand, nearly 60 percent of them said that they are going to decrease the number of their employees. On the question of by what percentage they intend to reduce their work forces, we got answers from nine companies. While nine companies plan to decrease their work force by less than 10 percent, one company plans to decrease its work force by 30 percent. If major companies promote rationalization, this will affect subsidiary companies. It is feared that the domestic employment situation will become more serious in the future.
