The prime minister said afterward that the two basic issues discussed at the meeting were Egypt's economic ties with world and regional countries and the Sugar Company's projects, especially since the company has foreign investment ventures. He said that the company head explained these projects. The prime minister said these projects include setting up a number of sugar factories in African and Middle Eastern countries. He praised the sugar company, which he said enjoys a very strong position and has industrial equipment and a design center that can fulfill Egypt's needs. He said sugar prices currently rise and fall according to the production costs and that there are no problems on this matter. He noted that an integrated study on customs is currently being compiled and that it will be discussed next week with sugar exporters, importers, and producers to determine whether sugar will be subject to customs fees. The prime minister said a similar meeting will be held next week to discuss customs fees on fertilizers between officials from the Ministry of Industry and Economy, national fertilizers companies, and customs experts.
