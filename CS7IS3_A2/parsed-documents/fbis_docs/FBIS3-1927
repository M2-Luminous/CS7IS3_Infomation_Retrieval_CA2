The representatives summed up and exchanged experiences of launching the campaign to learn from Lei Feng under the new circumstances of expediting reform and opening up and establishing a socialist market economic structure. They pledged to more conscientiously take the lead in learning from Lei Feng and to bring into full play the role of militiamen in building two civilizations. Taking part in the forum were advanced representatives, who take the initiative to implement the party's policy encouraging efforts to become prosperous and, after becoming better off, remember the state and collectives by leading others onto the road of common prosperity; who seek neither fame nor wealth and work selflessly at ordinary posts; who enthusiastically render services for others and set a good example in fostering new socialist customs and habits; who risk life to protect the life and property of people; and who safeguard motherland unification and national unity and make active contributions to promoting stability and development of the frontier region. They will attend special report meetings on their advanced deeds in the capital.
