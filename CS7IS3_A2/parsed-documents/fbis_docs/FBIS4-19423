The Belgian blue helmets will leave Rwanda, but not before Tuesday [19 April], to give Ghana time to relieve them. Earlier this morning, Jacqueline Pollack spoke to Colonel Gilbert Hertog, spokesman of the Defense Information Service: [Begin recording] [Hertog] The Belgian unit which is currently at the airport is preparing its final return to Belgium. [Pollack] You said yesterday that the blue helmets would leave Kigali at the beginning of the week. What day does this mean? [Hertog] It is difficult to say exactly when they will leave. They will leave as soon as possible, but without undue haste. In the context of the UN peacekeeping operation in Rwanda, the unit will be relieved tomorrow by the Ghanaians. In principle, they will begin their withdrawal on Tuesday at the earliest. [Pollack] Once they have begun to leave how long will it take them to pull out of Rwanda? [Hertog] We expect it will take about 12 hours to leave Rwandan territory. [end recording] The blue helmets will be evacuated overland toward Tanzania. They will leave by road because this enables the whole contingent to depart together, and at less expense, the Defense Information Service explained yesterday. About 100 refugees will be accompanying the Belgian blue helmets, mostly Europeans. The Belgians and the United Nations have therefore come to an agreement. The political decision to pull out comes from Brussels, but the military order comes from New York. We spoke to Foreign Minister Willy Claes: [Begin Claes recording] The general in charge of military operations at the United Nations in New York has asked Canadian General Dallaire, the UN commander in Kigali, to give the Belgian blue helmets the military order to evacuate Rwandan territory. In other words, it is not our Belgian Lieutenant General Charlier who is giving the blue helmets the order, but the UN command ordering the blue helmets, who happen to be Belgian, to pull out.
