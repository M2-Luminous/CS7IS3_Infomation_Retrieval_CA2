[Begin Rubinstein recording] We are leaving for a very official trilateral -- Israeli-Jordanian-American -- meeting, which is a continuation of previous trilateral meetings. It will deal with commercial ties and development of the Jordan Rift Valley, which are real and complex issues. What other issues on the periphery of those talks will be discussed? We meet with the Jordanians on all sorts of things linked to the agreed upon agenda, but I think that the main focus is in those trilateral talks. What chance does such a meeting have? The likelihood is there will be slow progress -- like the negotiations with Jordan in general. These negotiations can be implemented, but are constantly under pressures, which do not come from Israel, but from the other side. We try to make as much progress as possible, taking into account those pressures. [end recording] That was Elyaqim Rubinstein prior to his departure for Washington.
