They have held extensive meetings to become familiarized with current situation in Cuba. (Ernest Whasthle), member of the presidency of the committee of the party and senator of the Federal German Parliament, gave his opinion on the blockade that for more than three decades the United States has imposed on Cuba: [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] Our delegation agrees that this embargo should be eliminated in the interest of the Cuban people, and we will do everything we can to contribute to the lifting of the U.S. embargo. However, we must stress that we do not have enough pull to influence the decisions made by the U.S. Government. However, I can say that we agree with the many groups, some of which are in the United States, that think the embargo should be eliminated. [end recording] The Social Democratic Party delegation from northern Hessen visited Santiago de Cuba Province where they held meetings and talks to strengthen future relations. [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] We selected Santiago de Cuba for our meetings for a definite reason. This region and ours have similar structures. We have conducted a very broad and constructive political dialogue. This dialogue should be continued at the provincial level. We also expect that our visit serves to encourage the Social Democratic Party to establish ties at a higher level. [end recording] During their stay, the delegation visited several institutions and economic and social centers of interest, which will allow them to have a panoramic view of the current Cuban situation.
