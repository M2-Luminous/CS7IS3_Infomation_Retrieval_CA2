They had certain doubts and worries which I have proceeded to answer and clarify. Seeking to maintain an atmosphere of seriousness and responsibility in connection with the dialogue for peace and reconciliation, allow me to state the following: 1. Today, with the authorization of the president of the republic, I met with the region's military commanders to request their support and establish the specific conditions of safety required by the meeting in previously agreed upon terms. The Mexican Army has notified me it is prepared to provide all the guarantees required for the meeting's safety and success. 2. We all know that the problem we face is extremely complex, that in-depth political decisions are at stake in the dialogue. The truly important thing is not the spectacular character of the event; it is the political meeting and its substantial points. Its political essence is what matters and that viewpoint should drive the process. 3. I am worried that I still cannot tell you the dates for the dialogue for peace and reconciliation. I know the level of public expectation which prevails because I have shared with you the anguish of waiting. I understand the media you represent and you have professional and personal schedules and plans. I can assure you that the dialogue will not occur within the next 48 hours. If someone has to travel he can do it at will. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, I will remain in Chiapas State for the next few days as an expression of my determination in favor of a dialogue and political solution to this conflict. Thank you.
