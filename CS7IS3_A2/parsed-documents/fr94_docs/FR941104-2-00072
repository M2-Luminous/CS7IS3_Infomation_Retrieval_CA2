SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration, Olympic National Park, Washington describes and analyzes a proposed action and four alternatives for restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and its native anadromous fish runs. Under the DEIS's proposed action, the Secretary of the Interior would remove both the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams to accomplish the above restoration objectives. The other alternatives are no action_continuing to operate the dams without anadromous fish mitigation; dam retention_operating the dams with the addition of mitigation; remove only Elwha Dam; and remove only Glines Canyon Dam. This document and analysis have resulted from the passage of Public Law 102&hyph;495, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992. The DEIS has been completed by the National Park Service in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Lower Elwha S'Klallam Tribe. Impacts are analyzed on the following topics: sediment, anadromous fish, marine resources, vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, recreation, socioeconomics, dam safety, flooding, and hazardous materials.
