In his opinion, the visit demonstrates an increased interest by the international community in the settlement of the Karabakh problem. The Armenian spokesman thinks it is indicative that for the last two and a half years Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president, has arrived as a member of the CSCE mission. Armenia would like to see in this joint mission the symbol of expanding cooperation between the CSCE and Russia in uniting initiatives in the interests of the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, Aram Safaryan said. It is absolutely obvious, he thinks, that the degree of hostility between the conflicting parties requires an adequate interference by international authorities who have weight and influence on the conflicting parties. We think, the Armenian spokesman continued, that Russia is the only country at present that will agree to have a contingent of peace-making forces in the conflict region to disengage the forces. He said not only Russia but also some other countries could participate in the contingent and admitted that it was obvious that the willingness and readiness of Russia alone to resolve the conflict was not enough. Without such organizations as the United Nations and CSCE, it is difficult to imagine a comprehensive and long-term settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, Safaryan said.
