FR940127-2-00096 FR940127-2-00068 The value of the Telecommunications Basket will initially be calculated once a day either by an affiliate of Lehman Brothers or by an independent calculation agent (``Pricing Agent''). These values will be disseminated to investors once a day after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The portfolio value, for any day, will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities. 17 In addition, if the Pricing Agent is an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers has undertaken to implement certain surveillance and compliance procedures with respect to the dissemination of the portfolio value, requiring that the portfolio value be announced only through public dissemination and restricting the access of the affiliate's trading desk to the portfolio value determined by the affiliate. 18 17 The procedures for determining the prices of the components of the Global Telecommunications Basket will be the same as those approved by the Commission for MITTS ( see MITTS Approval Orders, supra note 7). Specifically, the market price used for calculation of the portfolio value is the last reported sale price if the portfolio security is listed and traded on a national securities exchange, or is traded through NASDAQ/NMS. If the portfolio security is a security of a foreign issuer or is an ADR that is not listed on a national securities exchange in the U.S. or is not a NASDAQ/NMS security, then the market price is the last reported sale price on the securities exchange on which the portfolio security is listed having the greatest volume of trading for the preceding calendar month as determined by the Pricing Agent, provided that if such last reported sale price is for a transaction that occurred more than 4 hours prior to the close of such exchange, then the market price is the average of the last available bid and offer price on such exchange. If a foreign-issued portfolio security is not listed or trading on any securities exchange or if the last reported sale price or bid and offer are not obtainable, then the market price is the last reported sale price on the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market with the greatest volume of trading as determined by the Pricing Agent. However, if such last reported sale price is for a transaction which occurred more than 4 hours prior to when trading in such OTC market typically ends, then the market price is the average of the last available bid and offer price of the three most active dealers, as selected by the Pricing Agent. See Letter from John Riley, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 13, 1994 (``January 13 Letter''). If the Pricing Agent is required to use the bid and offer price for a portfolio security to determine the market price of such portfolio security, then the pricing Agent will not use any bid or offer price announced by the Pricing Agent or any other affiliate of Lehman Brothers. See January 6 Letter, supra note 6. 18See January 13 Letter, supra note 17. Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will entitle holders to receive annual coupon payments based upon the percentage change in the value of the Telecommunications Basket from the beginning to the end of the year. If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the holder will receive not less than 100% of the original principal amount of the security. Like the MITTS listed on the NYSE, Telecommunications Basket SUNS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be able to cash-out of their investment by selling the security on the Amex. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Telecommunications Basket, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Lehman Brothers. 19 19 Lehman Brothers will deposit registered global securities representing Global Telecommunications Basket SUNS with its depository, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in DTC. See January 13 Letter, supra note 17.
