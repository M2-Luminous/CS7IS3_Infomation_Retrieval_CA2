"Japan is deeply concerned about this issue," the official quoted Hosokawa as saying during a meeting with U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar at his official residence. "But dialogue between the United States and North Korea seems to be going in a favorable direction, and we are closely watching its development," Hosokawa reportedly said. Washington said Wednesday that Pyongyang has agreed to allow international inspections of all seven of its declared nuclear facilities. Hosokawa also spoke of the need for Tokyo's close contact with Seoul and Washington to get North Korea to erase international suspicions about a clandestine nuclear program, the official said in a briefing to reporters. Nunn, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, called Japan-U.S. security one of the most important issues in the world and said it must be further enhanced. Hosokawa, echoing Nunn's view, reportedly vowed Tokyo's continued host nation support for U.S. forces in Japan, saying Japan wants to do everything it can in the field. Earlier in the day, Nunn and Lugar met with Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi Nunn and Lugar, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arrived in Japan from Russia on Thursday for a three-day visit. They will leave for South Korea on Saturday.
