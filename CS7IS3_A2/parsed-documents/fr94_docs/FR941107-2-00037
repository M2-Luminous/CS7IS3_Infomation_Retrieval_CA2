FR941107-2-00037 FR941107-2-00010 United States Price We calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination. Foreign Market Value As noted in our preliminary determination, we initiated a COP investigation on May 9, 1994, based on an allegation by the petitioners ( see decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 9, 1994). On the basis of petitioners' allegations, we gathered and verified data on production costs. Because Hevensa's COP response was not due until after the date of the preliminary determination, this information was not considered for the preliminary determination. A. Calculation of COP In order to determine whether prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP in accordance with 353.51(c) of the Department's regulations. Our calculations of COP were based on the sum of Hevensa's submitted costs of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and packing, except in the following instances where we determined that the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. Specifically, we: 1. Recalculated depreciation expense based on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed assets; 2. Disallowed Hevensa's claimed foreign exchange gains on client accounts receivable; 3. Reclassified foreign exchange gains and losses on the purchase of input materials from financing expense to cost of manufacturing; 4. Recomputed general and administrative expense and interest expense using a cost of sales figure adjusted for depreciation expense and exchange losses on material purchases as noted in 1 and 3 above; 5. Included the same amount of value-added tax (VAT) in home market COP as is included in the domestic sales prices; and 6. Added the additional charge incurred by Hevensa for the production of the Grade C product, as negotiated with its contractor. B. Test of Home Market and Third Country Sale Prices After calculating COP, we tested whether home market and third country sales of silicomanganese were made at prices below COP. We compared product-specific COP to reported prices that were net of movement charges, discounts, rebates, direct and indirect selling expenses, and inclusive of VAT. If over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that product and calculated FMV based on constructed value (CV). In order to determine that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis on a product-specific basis: 1) if a respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or 2) if a respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period of time. C. Results of COP Test We found that more than 90 percent of Hevensa's third country sales of Grade C fines were sold at below-COP prices over an extended period of time. Hevensa provided no indication that these below-COP sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. Therefore, we disregarded all third country sales of Grade C fines. For U.S. sales left without a match as a result of disregarding these below-COP sales, we based FMV on CV. We found that more than ten percent but less than 90 percent of Hevensa's sales of Grade B silicomanganese lump, size 5 ’ ’ x 1 ’ ’, were sold at below-COP prices over an extended period of time. Therefore, we excluded from the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the merchandise's cost of production.
