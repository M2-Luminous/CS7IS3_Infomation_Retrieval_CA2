Within this framework, and with Russia's active support, the Cyprus Government will work toward holding an international conference. Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis went to Moscow at the invitation of his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, to discuss the issue of an international conference. In a statement about the prospects of such a conference, Mikhailidhis said it is a serious proposal considering that the initiatives so far have failed. In a statement to reporters at Larnaca Airport, Mikhailidhis said his talks in Moscow will focus on the Cyprus issue, the UN secretary general's latest report, and the fact that the report includes some specific Russian proposals on the future course and developments following the failure of the confidence-building measures initiative. The foreign minister mentioned that apart from the Cyprus issue, he will also discuss a series of bilateral issues and expects to sign interstate agreements on various issues that are already being studied and that will be finalized and signed during the visit. The minister said our side considers the talks in Moscow as very significant for two main reasons: There is serious and worthwhile Russian activity in the international political scene and a strong Russian interest in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis stressed that these facts are very significant at a time when the Security Council, particularly the permanent members, will deal with the next step after the deadlock of the confidence-building measures and will evaluate the various options. He said: We believe that Russia can play an important role since Cyprus has maintained friendship and cooperative relations with Russia for many years. Mikhailidhis then responded to questions from journalists: [Unidentified correspondent] Apart from the international conference, Russia also proposed visits by the representatives of the five UN Security Council permanent members to the Nicosia-Athens-Ankara triangle. Do you believe that this idea can gain ground today? [Mikhailidhis] I believe the idea of negotiations between the UN Security Council permanent members and the sides that are involved in the Cyprus issue is a very serious proposal that has prospects. In any case it is a beginning toward the final goal, which must be the international conference. Our position was made clear through statements and meetings I had with the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members. We believe that the UN secretary general's report has a very significant conclusion: That the Turkish side has no political will to resolve the Cyprus issue or to reach an agreement on any initiative. Therefore, the next step must be decided through negotiations. We see these negotiations happening through the permanent members, which is the proposal that you have mentioned. [Correspondent] The U.S. and British proposals are obviously in favor of continuing the confidence-building measures procedure, and the Russian interest is a counterproposal to this effort. Do you believe things will finally move toward an international conference? Is this possible? [Mikhailidhis] Maybe it is natural for countries that have invested many efforts on promoting the confidence-building measures initiative to feel that they must exhaust all efforts, but our side has made its position crystal clear: We believe the issue ended with the submission of the final 21 March UN document. It was later seen that our position was correct. Further discussions aiming to clarify or explain points or any other procedure that took place since then has been fruitless. They were delayed by the submission of the report, and gave Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas the opportunity to further delay the procedure and the UN secretary general's initiative. In his report, the UN secretary general himself says there is no prospect for the confidence-building measures. So, we believe it is useless and damaging to continue with meetings or discussions on the confidence-building measures. Currently, we must deal with only one issue: the lack of political will by the Turkish side. We must also answer these questions: How will the Turkish side's negative stance change, how will the lack of political will change? We must not take any steps before clarifying these issues because it could be a step that would complicate the problem and reduce the persuasiveness of the procedure itself. [Correspondent] Can you comment on Denktas' latest provocative statements about "disarmament" and a "Nonaggression Pact" between the Republic of Cyprus and the pseudostate? [Mikhailidhis] Denktas said something that he has repeated many times. He has only one goal: The recognition of separate sovereign rights for both communities, which is an indirect but clear recognition of the pseudostate. He also made similar efforts during the talks on the confidence-building measures. He believed the two communities should finally agree on the measures based on their sovereign rights. We find this unacceptable. Separate sovereign rights do not exist for us. We believe in what the UN resolutions say: a single sovereignty. Therefore, his reference to the disarmament issue once again stems from his position of recognition for the pseudostate and two states that will search for some form of a pact either of cooperation or nonaggression. Our side will not discuss issues of separate sovereignty. There is only one sovereignty. Now, on the safety issue. If the Turkish Cypriot leadership feels there is a safety issue then there is certainly a safety issue for our side--the presence of the 35,000 Turkish troops. Let us discuss the safety issue but not the separate sovereignty issue. [Correspondent] We also heard the option of an appeal to the UN General Assembly. How do you handle this? [Mikhailidhis] The National Council studied the options listed in the UN secretary general's report and made various suggestions. The Council will continue and conclude its meeting on Wednesday. I do not want to comment on any option before the National Council concludes its meeting. All options are open to evaluation. [Correspondent] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias visited Moscow and you recently met with him. Has an international conference on Cyprus been prepared in any way and what do you believe are the chances for such a conference? [Mikhailidhis] Naturally, the Greek foreign minister and I exchanged views on Russia's role in this stage and on issues related to the Cyprus problem that would be raised during Papoulias' visit in Moscow. It was very important that Papoulias' visit preceded mine and I believe that now we will be able to have a complete picture on Russia's intentions and interest as well as its evaluations. About the prospect of an international conference, I believe it is a serious proposal considering that the initiatives so far have failed. Currently, there is no prospect for new initiatives, new texts, or new documents. We have tried all of these over the past 20 years. Now we must approach the substance of the matter, the presence of occupation troops, the presence of settlers to Cyprus. That is, we must deal with those facts that support the lack of political will by the Turkish side. In time, we will find out if some countries agree or disagree, but we will work in this direction. Answering a question on the latest resolution of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], Mikhailidhis described it as a tremendous step forward because it includes all the elements that we wanted to include. It refers to President Glavkos Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal, the issue of an international conference, and the withdrawal of Turkish troops and settlers. The NAM gave a strong message at a critical time when we needed it.
