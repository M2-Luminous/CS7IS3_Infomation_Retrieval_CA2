Speaking at the ninth Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in Sydney, Senator Evans said the situation in North Korea was worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear-armed North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security threat to the region. [Begin Evans recording] For the North Koreans, the choice is really a pretty straightforward and simple one -- to remain in the NPT and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards, or, alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost universal international censure, but, in time, a package of severe and damaging sanctions. [end recording] The five-day Sydney conference will discuss the latest developments in nuclear technology and the region's demand for nuclear energy over the next 50 years.
