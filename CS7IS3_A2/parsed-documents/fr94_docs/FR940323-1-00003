Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class D airspace at Aurora, Colorado, to correct an error in the Class D airspace description. During the airspace reclassification process (57 FR 38962; August 27, 1992) the language designating the Class D airspace as part-time was inadvertently omitted. This action would correct that error. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth is now ``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_ (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (Air).
