As of today, representatives of the five large enterprises who accompanied Premier Li Peng have signed four agreements, two contracts, and more than 20 letters of intent on economic cooperation in petroleum, natural gas, construction, metallurgy, textiles, electronics, and other industries. At a recent meeting with the entrepreneurs' delegation, Li Peng said: This is the first time a Chinese entrepreneurs' delegation has accompanied a state leader on a foreign tour. This is a beneficial experiment: good results have been achieved and we may continue the practice. In developing economic and trade cooperation with Central Asian nations, Chinese enterprises should give play to their own strengths and fully use the resources of the countries with which they cooperate. Cooperation must be on a equal and mutually beneficial basis, and we must take reality into consideration and pay attention to the economic results of cooperation. Li Peng also pointed out: We must pay special attention to the quality of Chinese export products and must prevent counterfeit, fake, and substandard products from entering Central Asian markets. At the same time, we should protect the Chinese people's legal business activities in the area and crack down on speculation and profiteering. Li Peng stressed the importance of building a modern "silk road" between China and Central Asian countries, saying that, without a free transportation channel, it will be difficult to greatly develop economic and trade relations with these countries. Zheng Hongye, head of the Chinese entrepreneurs' delegation and president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade; and persons in charge of China Construction Engineering Corporation, China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, China Steel Industry Trade Group, China Textile Products Import and Export Corporation, and China Electronics Products Import and Export Corporation, who accompanied Premier Li Peng on his visit, jointly held a news conference this afternoon to brief reporters on their companies' trade talks results. They unanimously said: Chinese and Central Asian countries' economies are highly complementary to each other and the potential for cooperation is huge. As the cooperation climate improves, the level and quality of cooperation gradually will be raised. Chinese enterprises should be farsighted in developing economic cooperation with these countries.
