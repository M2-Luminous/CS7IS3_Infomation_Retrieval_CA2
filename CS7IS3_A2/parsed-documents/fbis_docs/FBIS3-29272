The following are the major changes made in the military over the past year: The establishment of an atmosphere for discussions in military camps; the disbanding of the officers wives associations; the increase of personnel driving their cars as opposed to using chauffeurs; the establishment of a self-regulating leave system; the removal of unnecessary paperwork; proper guidance for environmental protection; and the reduction of the military office of protocol at Kimpo Airport. Among these changes, the new system for the smooth communication between officers and enlisted men in military camps presents a striking contrast to the past authoritarianism. The Army, Navy, and Air Force frequently hold various get-togethers and forums ranging from staff officers meetings to soldiers free discussions, with an unprecedented activeness in helping facilitate smooth verbal communication between officers and enlisted men. Participants of these meetings freely express their own opinions, in contrast to the past when both officers and enlisted men could hardly put their thoughts into words because they were studying their officers' faces. Soldiers came to often sharply point out their commanders' merits and demerits. The military authorities explain: An atmosphere for free discussions has been vitalized mainly because most soldiers were born in or after the seventies, when the country was rapidly growing, and belong to the new generation and because over 80 percent of them are high school or upper secondary school graduates. As the officers wives associations, which had played the role of channel for asking personnel favors among military officers, has completely been disbanded over the past year, the phrase in vogue "A colonel's wife is a general" has become an archaic saying. Activities of the wives associations led by the wives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force chiefs of staff included some positive ones. They supported helpless people and paid visits of inquiry to soldiers. The associations, however, were disbanded and their official activities have been completed forbidden since last year when it was revealed that they influenced military reshuffles. At present, the Navy and Air Force strictly control all visits to the chief of staff office by the officers and their wives. As the system of assigning some soldiers as chauffeurs for generals was removed last year, their families and even generals drive their cars when they are using them for unofficial purposes, creating an increase of personnel driving their cars instead of using chauffeurs. Despite the military service regulations' guarantee for leave, officers and soldiers could not take their leave in the past, because they had to read their commanders' mind. "Taking leave by reading their commanders' mind" has became old-fashioned these days, because most officers and soldiers seems to believe that taking their leave is a kind of the continuity their work performance. For an example, Cho Kun-hae, chief of the Air Force, could not take his summer leave last year, but most of his staff members enjoyed their leave without reading their chief's mind. Red tape, which has been regarded as a traditional bad habit of the administrative organization, has been gradually improved. The Army, Air Force, and Navy have set up computer networks and computer terminals in their military units to reduce inefficiency of their administrative activities caused by the excessive work needed to prepare many documents. They have decided to gradually expand the method of approval through computers. The Army's understanding of the environmental pollution issue, which was neglected by people over the past years, has been largely changed. As a result, the Army has recently set up a new section, which will mainly deal with environmental issues, to actively participate in preparing for the prevention of air pollution. It has set up space to separately collect garbage and to recycle the used resources and has established a sewage disposal plant. Moreover, the Defense Ministry has largely cut the size of the military protocol office at Kimpo Airport. This office has created the social disharmony between the people and the Army by giving priority seating in airplanes to military personnel and in clearing customs at Kimpo Airport. Accordingly, it has closed the VIP room in the domestic airline waiting room. The VIP room at the international airline waiting room is being operated by a small number of military personnel.
