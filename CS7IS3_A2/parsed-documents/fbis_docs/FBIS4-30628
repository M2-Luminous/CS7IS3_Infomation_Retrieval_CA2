Currently, the nationwide rice stock stands at 850,000 tonnes, while in previous years, it stood at between 1.4 and 1.5 million tonnes. However, people are urged not to be alarmed because as many as 650,000 tonnes of rice loaned to several friendly countries will be returned to Indonesia. The Philippines and Cuba will each return 200,000 tonnes of rice to us. Whether we admit it or not, agriculture is a complicated and fundamental issue for us. While farmers play an important role in supporting development and national stability, it is not easy for them to produce food due to the vagaries of nature, such as pests, long droughts, and floods as well as a limited area of cultivation. Some people have even blamed the food-producing subsector as a source of inefficiency or unemployment demanding our special attention in our efforts to combat poverty. What is strange is that the economically weak farmers seem to subsidize the industrial sector and other members of the society with stronger economic clout. In this connection, (Jurgen Habbermash) may be correct when he said that human interaction based on professional interest only is basically wrong. He cited the example of Karl Marx, who failed to understand that human interaction was based on the need of human beings to communicate; because of this, Marx also failed to realize his dream, namely, to liberate the oppressed people. This being so, it is obvious that the Indonesian archipelagic concept and its basic principles should be popularized and translated into action for the sake of national development because all development sectors are equally important; all scientific disciplines have equal potential; and all fields of work have equal status. No government of any country in this world dare scrap the agricultural sector, even if its industrial sector is highly developed. This shows that agriculture is one of the important ways to maintain and safeguard the survival of an independent, united, and sovereign nation among other nations.
