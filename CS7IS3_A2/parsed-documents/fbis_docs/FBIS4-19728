When asked why he had decided to normalize relations with China as early as his April 1993 appointment, Juppe replied that it is impossible to continue quarreling with China for obvious economic, political, strategic, and demographic reasons. Moreover, he said, the dialogue with China had been broken off in the absence of "major differences in foreign policy," since the sale of French aircraft and frigates to Taiwan did not justify a two-year quarrel, and might be compensated by sales to the PRC. When the interviewer pointed out that no important contracts are expected from the visit, Juppe noted this was not a "commercial" trip, and that it was only aimed at improving the political climate between the two nations. "P.S." then asked whether Chinese violations of human rights would pose a problem. Juppe observed that such violations pose no problem for the United States, which has not revoked most-favored-nation status for China. While France does not "renounce any of its principles," Juppe continued, "we must not close the door in China's face, or else we would quarrel with three-fourths of the planet." Juppe also contended that China has accomplished "some progress" in human rights, and that events in that country will "make the system of repression untenable." When asked whether France was wrong in supporting Chinese dissidents after 1989, Juppe said it was not, and noted that while France must let China know that the present situation is not satisfactory, an equilibrium must be found between "indifference and excessive zeal." Despite Prime Minister Balladur's affirmation that his China visit achieved his "political objectives," he nevertheless suffered a "half-failure," because his trip was designed to combine the "irreconcilable" objectives of restoring relations and promoting commercial interests, Jacques Amalric writes in the 12 April Paris daily LIBERATION. By dispatching businessman Jacques Friedmann to Beijing as early as July 1993 to negotiate the normalization of Sino-French ties at the cost of ending military sales to Taiwan, Balladur--egged on by Rally for the Republic leader Jacques Chirac--placed himself in a "position of inferiority," appearing as the mere spokesman of large industrial interests, Amalric continues. Meanwhile, the prime minister's entourage is arguing "without much conviction" that France is now on an equal footing with its competitors in vying for important contracts with China; it is also presenting as a "semivictory" the fact that no invitation to visit Paris was extended to Chinese Premier Li Peng. However, these contracts will be dearly paid for, first by French taxpayers--since France is only second to Japan in granting "privileged" credits to China--and also in terms of France's image in an Asia that is "watching Beijing's least moves through a magnifying glass," Amalric concludes.
