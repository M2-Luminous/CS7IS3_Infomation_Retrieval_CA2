Wang Zhongyu stressed that the operation of the new structure has been basically normal as measures related to the reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange structures are gradually being implemented. For a period to come, it is necessary to devote special efforts to improving state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to make further efforts to do a still better job in the transformation of enterprises operational mechanisms and the establishment of new mechanisms, conscientiously carry out pilot projects regarding the introduction of the bankruptcy system, sort out and clear debts, replenish funds at enterprises' disposal, reduce production output with a view to cutting stocks, reduce deficits and increase profits, and strengthen enterprise management so that state-owned enterprises will improve their conditions. The State Economic and Trade Commission called its first overall economic operation coordination meeting a few days ago. While assessing the country's current economic situation, officials in charge of more than 10 ministries and commissions of the Chinese government attending the meeting showed extremely great concern for the present state of state-owned enterprises. A report filed here earlier said that China's state-owned enterprises continued to see increased losses, with losses increasing by nearly 80 percent from January to March, and as many as 45 percent of state-owned enterprises operating at a loss. Referring to this report, Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this was due to a misunderstanding. He disclosed that the number of enterprises in China which had stopped operations or were operating under capacity accounted for about 10 percent of all enterprises, and enterprises which have stopped operations made up about 4 percent. Since state-owned enterprises now practice the "general rules governing enterprise finance" and "codes for enterprise accounting" and have introduced production cost accounting with a view to aligning domestic accounting practices with accounting systems abroad, some expenses that used to be chargeable to enterprise profits in the past are now listed as production costs. This in turn resulted in a decrease in enterprise profits on the books. Wang Zhongyu emphasized that state-owned enterprises' actual profits had increased, and the number of enterprises operating at a loss had decreased. During this coordination meeting, Wang Zhongyu suggested that the performance of state-owned enterprises should be assessed from three aspects: --The state has applied many new policies and measures to state-owned enterprises over the past few years, and party committees and governments at all levels, as well as enterprises themselves, have done a lot of work, and, as a result, state-owned enterprises have improved their position. --Some enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in production and operations which should draw great attention and should be solved in real earnest. Solutions to these problems require some mandatory conditions to be fulfilled and this takes time. --State-owned enterprises can survive and thrive, and the government is full of confidence about the reinvigoration of state-owned enterprises.
