FR941230-0-00076 FR941230-0-00015 As stated above, FRA intends to have new kits and forms available by February 28, 1995. In anticipation, FRA will provide replacement kits on a one-for-one basis at no charge. In order to accomplish an orderly kit changeover, railroads are asked to provide FRA with information as to the number of kits to be replaced, the mailing address where the new kits are to be sent, and the name and telephone number of a responsible officer at each location, no later than January 10, 1995. This will ensure kits are distributed to the locations most advantageous to railroads. In compiling this list, railroads should consider the composition of the new replacement kits. Each replacement kit will contain only three individual specimen boxes instead of the current five. (FRA's existing list is obsolete due to operational changes and consolidations that have occurred since the last kit replacement in 1990). Railroads should send the required information in writing to Mr. Lamar Allen, FRA Alcohol and Drug Program Manager, 400 7th Street S.W., Room 8314, Washington, D.C. 20590 (202) 366&hyph;0127. In order to facilitate kit replacement, FRA would appreciate if railroads could provide the listing on a diskette in WordPerfect as well. Donald M. Itzkoff, Deputy Administrator, Federal Railroad Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32092 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;M
