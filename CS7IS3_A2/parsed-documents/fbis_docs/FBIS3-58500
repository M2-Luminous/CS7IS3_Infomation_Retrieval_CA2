Yasushi Akashi delivered his assessment on a NATO proposal to use air power to relieve trapped Canadian UN troops in the eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla Airport in Bosnia's northeast. The UN official, who asked not to be named, said Akashi gave his report Monday to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali who must authorise any air operations in Bosnia. Informed sources said Akashi argued against using warplanes in Srebrenica since the Serbs had given their agreement in principle to the rotation of the Canadians and only technical points remained to be resolved. Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday his self-proclaimed "parliament" has decided to allow UN troops into Srebrenica to relieve UN soldiers trapped there for the last six months. Diplomats in Geneva said the Serbs were wary of allowing the rotation to be used as a pretext for strenghtening the UN military presence in the besieged enclave. Karadzic, cited by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, said Dutch UN troops scheduled to replace the Canadians in Srebrenica would be allowed to go in "as of tomorrow" provided they were "the same number and with the same weapons." However, he ruled out any reopening of the Tuzla airport. Akashi said that the reopening of Tuzla airport, closed sice May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills, was not worth the effort since land access to the city was often possible, the sources said. They said Akashi further maintained that any air raids could unleash Serb reprisals against UN troops protecting relief operations in Bosnia. Butrus-Ghali met Monday with Akashi and other top aides and ordered plans drafted to unblock Srebrenica and Tuzla Airport, a spokeswoman said. But she gave no sign whether he would authorise NATO air strikes. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit last week proposed using warplanes in Srebrenica and at Tuzla Airport after failing to agree on air strikes to end the siege of Sarajevo as it offered to do in August.
