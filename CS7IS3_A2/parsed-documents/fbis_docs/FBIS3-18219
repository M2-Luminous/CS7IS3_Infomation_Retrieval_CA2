They said that Austria was negotiating a new package on its terms of entry into the Union, Finland was also considering a new offer. A senior Norwegian official said talks involving Norway had been suspended until next week. A senior official of the EU's executive European Commission was pessimistic about the chances of an agreement on Tuesday. "There has not been enough progress," he said. A spokesman for the EU's Greek presidency said: "We have problems still with all four countries." But German and Dutch diplomats said agreement on the terms of entry into the EU were remote unless the applicants made big last-minute concessions. The year-old negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped up at midnight Monday night after a final four-day session that started on Friday. The officials would not say whether solutions were within reach on the major problems still blocking agreement, which involve Norwegian fish and truck pollution across the Austrian Alps. Austria was insisting on retaining strict limits on truck traffic across the Austrian Alps until 2004, which the EU maintains would contravene its rules of free movement. Norway was still refusing to allow EU fishing fleets increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of Oslo's price for joining the Union. Finland was holding out for the right to extend aid to all its farmers, in contravention of EU agricultural policies. And Sweden was pushing for a gradual phase-in of its contributions to the EU budget. The negotiators were also expected to delay a decision on another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's balance of power towards its richer northern members, and increase the influence of its smaller ones. The EU had set the Monday midnight deadline so that membership accords could be ratified in time for the applicants to join the EU next January 1. But officials said the deadline could possibly be stretched to March 10. Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries join the EU together, rather than leave Norway and possibly Austria out of the initial enlargement.
