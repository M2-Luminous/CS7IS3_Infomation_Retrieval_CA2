What is happening now is a final destruction of the peace process. ['Umar] As national institutions in the area, what sort of measures or decisions will you be adopting in the aftermath of this incident? [Al-Husayni] First of all, we summoned the foreign consuls in Jerusalem to appraise them of the gravity of the situation and convey to them our position and demands, which began with disarming the settlers and providing international protection for the Palestinians. The Israeli Army is unable to do so. Apparently, it has a specific mission, which is only directed against the Palestinians and provides adequate cover to the settlers to do whatever they want. Hence, first of all we demand the disarming of the settlers; second, international protection; and third, other measures must follow to ensure Israeli withdrawal on the basis that no settlements will remain on Palestinian soil. ['Umar] Do I understand from your remarks that you support Mr. 'Arafat's statement this morning, which he made after the incident? [Al-Husayni] In fact, until now we have not received any details of this statement, but I believe that as far as the current peace process is concerned, modifications must be introduced in the agreements that have been reached. We have tried as much as possible to take a step forward, although not complete a one, in order to advance the peace process. However, what has happened today proves to us that such a step will not be fruitful. Now, we want the talks to deal with a final solution. We do not believe there is need for an interim stage, because an interim stage will lead to further bloodshed and losses.
