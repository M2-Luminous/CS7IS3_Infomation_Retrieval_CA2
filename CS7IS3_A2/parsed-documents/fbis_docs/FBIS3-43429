These barricades had the effect of paralyzing activity in the city. In some suburbs the barricades were removed by gendarmes, but in others the situation remains tense. UPRONA [Union for National Progress] president, Nicholas Mayugi, in a declaration he has just issued, expressed his lack of solidarity with the organizers of these operations. Here he is: [Begin Mayugi recording] The executive bureau of the UPRONA Party and its parliamentary team have just learned from the radio and that barricades were set up on some roads in Bujumbura on the morning of 6 January for the purpose of stopping workers from going to the various service districts. We have also learned that writings have been distributed on behalf of a coalition of opposition parties. The UPRONA executive bureau and the UPRONA parliamentary team inform national and international opinion that the sabotage actions and the organization of this Operation Ghost Town, which seems to be the objective [as heard], have been decided and implemented without the knowledge of the leadership of UPRONA. That is why UPRONA's executive bureau and the parliamentary team express their total lack of solidarity with all the perpetrators of these deplorable acts which today are stopping people from going to work, going to see their doctors and honoring their commitments. [passage omitted] We make a strong call to all our militants and the entire Burundi people to refuse any call for disorder, indiscipline, violation of the law, violence or subversion. We call for peace, dialogue, and discussionss, in order that the task of re-establishing peace and carrying out reconstruction will become easier. We call upon those of our militants who could be lost to heed our call for peace and discipline, and to cease sowing divisions, as hatred and chaos lead only to grief, disintegration and self destruction. All party members who hear our call should mobilize themselves for unity, peace, and work and keep away those who want to mislead them, acting in unison, for the restoration of peace in unity and nonviolence. Thank you. [end recording]
