Copa] [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (DPA) -- Cuba is determined to continue with its nuclear plans even though the construction of its most important project, the Juragua Electronuclear Plant, temporarily suspended in 1992, has yet to resume. In response to a question asked by a DPA reporter, an Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs (SEAN) source said the country's plan was drafted with multifaceted goals. In 1983, Cuba began building two 440-megawatt nuclear energy reactors in the area of Cienfuegos, on the south-central coast of the island approximately 300 km east of Havana. On 5 September 1992, when President Fidel Castro announced the halt of "the construction of the century," one of the reactors was 90 percent completed and scheduled to begin operating in late 1995 or early 1996, while the other one was only 20 or 30 percent completed. The project, which is estimated to have involved an investment of $1.1 billion, would have been a big relief for Cuban authorities, who lack hard money to buy the necessary oil for the operational use of their thermoelectric plants. For his part, Dr. Daniel Cordoniu, executive deputy secretary of the SEAN, said that, together with nuclear energy (production of electricity stemming from the fusion of the atom) [passage as received], another method being developed is the use of radioisotopes and radiation in diverse fields. In addition to being used in biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and health, which are priority areas in the country, these nuclear techniques are being applied both in the food program and in open support of diverse industries, the researcher said recently on Cubavision's "Open Agenda" program. In that sense, he also mentioned other areas, such as nickel-bearing, sugar, and oil industries, without ruling out the use of nuclear techniques in environmental activities related to tourism. Engineer Gilberto Salazar, who is also executive vice secretary of the SEAN, praised the production of radiopharmaceuticals (components that are introduced into the body for diagnostic and therapeutical purposes), which have permitted substituting imports in 1993. He explained that this progress was achieved by the Center of Applied Studies to Nuclear Development (CEADEN), which is also taking part in preparing certain components. That technique is virtually irreplaceable in the studies of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and the excretion of medicine (pharmacodynamics), which is essential for registering new medicines, Salazar stated. After noting that the preservation of the Juragua plant has been achieved satisfactorily with the Basic Industries Ministry as investor, Codorniu confirmed that alternatives are being sought to complete the project. Cuba and Russia are willing to contribute foreign capital to put the Juragua plant in operation, which will net the island a savings of over 800,000 tons of oil annually. Diplomatic sources in Havana and Moscow agreed that there is great interest in this regard and that French authorities apparently are considering possibly financing the project jointly with Russia. The weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL, which is edited in Spanish, English, and French, recently revealed that the Russian Government granted the island a $30 million loan to maintain the project. The necessary funding to obtain an automation system for the plant's only reactor, however, is pending.
