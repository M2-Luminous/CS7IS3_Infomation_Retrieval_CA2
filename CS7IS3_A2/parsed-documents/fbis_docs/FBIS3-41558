Japan made the offer at the fourth meeting of a working group on the environment, one of five working groups operating in the multilateral track of the current Middle East peace process. The startup funds would go toward a $9 million desertification control program proposed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Japan served as the chair country for the meeting, at which it was decided to hold a meeting next February in Cairo to draft a set of standardized basic principles or ``codes of conduct'' for regional governments to adhere to when dealing with environmental issues. Also considered was the establishment of an environmental agency by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories set to be self-administered under the recent accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Forty-three countries and two international organizations participated in the meeting. Syria and Lebanon skipped the session.
