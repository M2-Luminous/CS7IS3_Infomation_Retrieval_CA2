In an interview with NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG, Defense Minister Villiger and Foreign Minister Cotti explain why, for reasons of security and foreign policy, the federal law on the participation of Swiss Forces in peacekeeping operations deserves to be supported. The interview with the two ministers was conducted by Thomas Haeberling and Bruno Lezzi. [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Why should Switzerland participate with troops in UN and later maybe even CSCE peacekeeping operations? [Villiger] Blue helmets do not wage war but give peace a chance wherever arms remain silent, where there is a truce, or where a conflict has not yet erupted. UN peacekeeping forces have been a tried and tested instrument to fulfill this task for 30 years. This is also absolutely clearly in the interest of our country. I am thinking, for example, of the preventive stationing of troops in Macedonia; after all, if a conflict were to break out there, we would be bound to receive large numbers of refugees. Tasks of security policy, which directly benefit also Switzerland, cannot generally be left to others in the long run, particularly since I am convinced that small neutral countries are destined for credible mediating functions. [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, how do you see this issue? [Cotti] From the foreign policy point of view I can only support what Mr. Villiger said. Blue helmets are a new form of good services, which has become even more topical over the past few years -- quite certainly also in connection with the fall of communism, which I would like to describe as something like a geological stratum. This geological stratum suppressed latent conflicts in many parts of the world; they could not erupt. The danger of a worldwide nuclear conflict has certainly diminished, but there are many more very cruel local conflicts. This is why demand for these services has increased. [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] The opponents to this bill sometimes claim that in many cases blue helmets are useless. Let us take Somalia or the former Yugoslavia as examples. It has been claimed that the blue helmets have even created additional problems. What is your reaction to that? [Villiger] This is simply not consistent with the facts. It is obvious that not every UN action has been successful. Failures aside, there is an impressive series of successes. The arguments brought forth by the opponents are biased because they always mention those countries where something is going wrong at the moment, whereas they fail to talk of those actions of obvious benefit. Moreover, blue helmets do very useful work in the humanitarian sphere, save lives, and secure the supply of vital goods. Of the current 17 UN missions, only three are taking place in combat areas. It is symptomatic that successful blue helmet missions do not make headlines or get any television coverage because they do not offer any reports that are out of the ordinary. [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, one subject that always gives rise to debate is our neutrality. Will Swiss blue helmets threaten our foreign policy maxim or, put differently, will neutrality be undermined through Swiss participation in blue helmet operations, and might not its function as a security strategy be lost in the event of a change of the strategic situation? [Cotti] Not only are blue helmets compatible with neutrality, but in a new overall political environment, neutrality even demands a service such as the blue helmets. That it is compatible with neutrality is more than obvious. Mr. Villiger has said that before. Swiss blue helmets would only be sent to places with the agreement of all parties to the conflict who would have to ask for our presence. We would never go anywhere against the will of any party. The condition of nonpartisanship has to be fulfilled. Mr. Villiger quite rightly said that no country can more rightfully be regarded as nonpartisan than a neutral one. We have rendered good services in many instances: with UN observers, election observers, and with functions such as those being looked after by Colonel Arbenz or Ambassador Brunner. Against the background of the great demand for peacekeeping missions, blue helmets are nothing but the normal, updated implementation of our policy of neutrality. [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Does this apply to the sphere of security policy, too? [Villiger] I would like to clearly emphasize what Mr. Cotti said. History proves the importance of this view. Up to 1990, it was neutral countries that bore the main burden of blue helmet missions: Sweden, Finland, Austria. And in those 30 years nobody even had the faintest doubts about the neutrality of these three countries. This allows us to conclude that blue helmet operations strengthen the foreign policy qualities of neutrality. [passage omitted]
