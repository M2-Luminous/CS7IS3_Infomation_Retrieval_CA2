With exciting discoveries being made one after another in the Tarim Basin, the region is providing high hopes for China's oil future, at a time when the nation has become a net oil importer. Over the past five years surveyors have found nine oilfields and 34 oil structures in the basin. The biggest discovery is a 100-million-ton oilfield in the middle of the basin. Experts estimate the basin's total reserves of oil and natural gas at 18 billion tons, about one fifth of the nation's total reserves. Last year the basin produced 1.6 million tons of crude oil, ranking 11th in the country's top oilfields list. The authorities expect that the basin's oil production will reach 2.1 million tons this year, and five million tons by the end of 1996. In another development, the region's gold production has climbed from the second from the bottom to the ninth among all the Chinese regions. With gold deposits found in more than half of the region's 80 counties and cities, local sources said, the gold rush reminds people of that of the California in the last century. Xinjiang is also rich in copper, a metal that is in short supply in China. The potential reserves are estimated at more than 10 million tons. Some experts predict that the Axili Copper Mine at the foot of the Altay Mountains will soon become the second-largest in China, after the Tongxing Mine in Jiangxi Province. Figures released by the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and Mining show that the region boasts reserves of 43 kinds of minerals, including oil, natural gas, gold, coal, copper, salt, precious stones and rare metals.
