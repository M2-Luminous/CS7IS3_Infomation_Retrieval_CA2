FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 22, 29, September 9, 30 and October 28, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 37466, 38586, 46620, 49913 and 54170) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48d and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Hanger, Magnetic 5340&hyph;00&hyph;916&hyph;4206 5340&hyph;00&hyph;916&hyph;4207 5340&hyph;00&hyph;916&hyph;4208 5340&hyph;00&hyph;916&hyph;4209 Services Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Border Station Main Building 588 (1st floor), East & West Headhouse, Primary Pedestrian Building, 801 East Ysidro Boulevard, San Diego, California.
