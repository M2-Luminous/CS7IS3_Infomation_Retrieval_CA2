The radio agency NOVYNY asked [name indistinct], first deputy head of the State Committee for Nuclear Power, to comment. According to him, the problems with nuclear fuel supplies from Russia are due to the lack of funds for energy resources. To secure this year's supplies of fuel and spare parts for Ukrainian nuclear power plants, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles. At present, the State Committee for Nuclear Power does not possess such a sum. The Committee leadership believes that this problem could be resolved when the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow is implemented.
