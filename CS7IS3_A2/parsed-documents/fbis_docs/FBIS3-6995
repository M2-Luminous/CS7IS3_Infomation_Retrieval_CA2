A leader of the third faction that emerged from the splintering of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) charged that pro-Sison stalwarts have fielded a special armed unit in Metro Manila. "We are appealing to former comrades at the top hierarchy to stick to friendly competition," said the third-bloc leader, who insisted on anonymity at the moment. "But they should be forewarned that we have the capability to hit back if attacked first," he said. The third faction, composed mostly of former members of the CPP National United Front Commission (NUFC), made known its breakaway from the 25-year-old Maoist party on Saturday [19 March]. Claiming to have its own fighting force and peasant-worker mass base, the group vowed to pursue a debate with rival factions to resolve festering questions of strategy and tactics. The mainstream CPP is reportedly headed by Armando Liwanag, believed to be an assumed name of party founder Jose Maria Sison. It has retained strong control over the New People's Army. Another group of party dissidents based in Metro Manila and parts of Rizal declared "autonomy" from the central leadership in July last year. Headed by Carlos Forte, the group controls an armed wing, the Alex Boncayao Brigade. The party's splintering came after a plenum held by the CPP Central Committee in 1992 reaffirmed the Maoist strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside through an extensive guerrilla warfare . The plenum repudiated the line of quick victory through urban uprisings and premature formation of regular guerrilla formations espoused by anti-Sison leaders. A spokesman from the CPP's "caretaker NUFC" denied prospects that the bitter squabble over party politics would lead to an armed encounter. "We are very confident that ringleaders of these two (Forte and third-bloc) factions will soon fade into irrelevance as their followers are slowly realizing that they have been misled," the spokesman said. "Their political bankruptcy will push them into isolation and the party would have become stronger even without lifting a finger against them," he added. The third-bloc cadre said a platoon-size unit has been "operationalized" by the CPP Central Committee after its members completed commando training recently in Batangas. Tagged Edgar Jopson Brigade after a former student leader who was slain by soldiers in 1982 in Davao, the unit is allegedly composed of selected communist gunmen from Central Luzon, Southern Tagalog, Bicol, Samar and Mindanao. Meanwhile, a leader of the National Confederation of Labor (NCL) yesterday clarified that his group's formation has nothing to do with the ongoing rift within the CPP. Ibarra Malonzo, NCL secretary general, told the INQUIRER that majority of the federation's union affiliates have never been part of the CPP or its sympathizers. Although they used to be affiliated with the militant Kilusang Mayo Uno [May First Movement], Malonzo said "we never considered we were part of the CPP or the national democratic forces." The INQUIRER reported the other day that the third communist faction was believed to have been instrumental in the setting up of NCL and another political alliance, the Siglaya. Siglaya and NCL leaders said their groups are "two totally different organizations from different initiatives."
