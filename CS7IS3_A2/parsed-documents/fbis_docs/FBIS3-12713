The report was denied by a spokesman for President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) in Sanaa, the northern capital. The spokesman for the Defence Ministry, which is controlled by Salih's southern rival, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, said units of the northern first mechanised division attacked a base of the southern Fifth Infantry Brigade at Harf Sufyan, north of Sanaa, late Saturday. "Twelve members of the (southern) brigade were killed and about 30 others wounded," the spokesman said, adding that the northern troops prevented the wounded from being evacuated. The base was still ringed by northern troops Sunday. A spokesman for al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) confirmed that the attack took place. Military mediators from Jordan and Oman drew up a five-point plan on Sunday to halt clashes between northern and southern army units in which at least 20 people were killed last week. Officials in Sanaa said the mediators called on the opposing sides to ban new troop movements, return to their positions before the clashes, free prisoners and return the weapons seized, dismantle checkpoints and halt the media campaign against each other. The GPC, which ruled the former North Yemen, and the YSP, which ruled the south, decided to share power when the country was united in May 1990, but the armies were not merged. Salih and al-Bid have been locked in a political dispute since August, when al-Bid refused to take up his duties as vice president in the northern capital Sanaa, demanding major economic, political and security reforms. A reconciliation agreement signed in Amman on February 20 has failed so far to end the crisis, and at least 20 soldiers have been killed in clashes in the southern Abyan province.
