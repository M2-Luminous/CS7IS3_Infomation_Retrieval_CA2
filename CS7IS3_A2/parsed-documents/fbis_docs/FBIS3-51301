Manuel Camacho Solis, peace commissioner for reconciliation in Chiapas, announced today in San Cristobal de las Casas that he had received the documents in which the EZLN agrees to dialogue with the government and announces that it will state its official response on 18 January. In a series of documents sent by the EZLN to the press, the rebels announced their acceptance and expressed congratulations for the cease-fire ordered by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and for the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis. The EZLN declared war on the Mexican Government on 1 January when it occupied four mayors' offices in the Chiapas State in confrontations which it said left an unofficial toll of 200 dead in the 11 days of clashes, after which Salinas de Gortari announced the unilateral cease-fire.
