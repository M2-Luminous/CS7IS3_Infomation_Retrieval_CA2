Hsu, the deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and leader of the Taiwan delegation that left for Beijing last week for the fourth round of talks with mainland negotiators on cross-strait technical issues, boarded the plane for Taiwan Thursday empty-handed. The talks centered on three non-political technical issues -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution of cross-strait fishing disputes. Although the Taiwan negotiators made the biggest concessions possible, Hsu said, the talks once again failed because of Beijing's continued reluctance to recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction rights. SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho, while regretting that no agreements were reached during the talks, called for higher-level dialogue in the future. He said negotiations would not be effective simply because of the use of "eloquent" or "effective" negotiators, but require sincerity and consensus from both sides.
