FR940314-2-00145 FR940314-2-00075 Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Filing of Petition; Di-n-hexyl Adipate, Etc. AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that di-n-hexyl adipate, ortho-dichlorobenzene and para-dichlorobenzene be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Publication of this notice is in compliance with Notice 89&hyph;61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing relating to these petitions must be received by May 13, 1994. Any modification of the list of taxable substances based upon these petitions would be effective October 1, 1990. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for a public hearing to: Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044 (Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (Petition), room 5228). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petitions were received on December 27, 1989. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. Di-n-hexyl adipate HTS number: 2917.39.20.00 CAS number: 110&hyph;33&hyph;8 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals ethylene, methane, benzene, and nitric acid. Di-n-hexyl adipate is a liquid produced predominantly by reaction of n-hexyl alcohol with adipic acid in the presence of a catalyst. n-hexyl alcohol is produced from aluminum, natural gas (via hydrogen), and ethylene (via triethylaluminum). Oxidation of the intermediate mixed trialkylaluminum with air produces a mixed aluminum alkoxide, which is hydrolyzed to produce a mixture of alcohols, from which n-hexyl alcohol is recovered by distillation. Adipic acid is produced from benzene (via cyclohexane) and the methane in natural gas (via hydrogen). Oxidation of cyclohexane using air and nitric acid in a two-step process produces adipic acid. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: 6 C 2 H 4 (ethylene) + 1.5 CH 4 (methane) + C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2.33 HNO 3 (nitric acid) + 2.83 H 2 O (water) + 1.75 O 2 (oxygen) + 0.67 Al (aluminum) + 2.02 H 2 (hydrogen) __> C 18 H 34 O 4 (di-n-hexyl adipate) + 3 H 2 (hydrogen) + 1.5 CO 2 (carbon dioxide) + 2.33 NO (nitric oxide) + 2 H 2 O (water) + 0.67 AlH 3 O 3 (aluminum hydroxide) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 76.6 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $4.67 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for ethylene of 0.58, a conversion factor for methane of 0.05, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.33, and a conversion factor for nitric acid of 0.29. Ortho-dichlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.61.20.00 CAS number: 95&hyph;50&hyph;1 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and chlorine. Ortho-dichlorobenzene is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine with benzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 Cl2 (chlorine) __> C 6 H 4 Cl 2 (o-dichlorobenzene) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.55 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.57 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 1.03. Para-dichlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.61.30.00 CAS number: 106&hyph;46&hyph;7 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and chlorine. Para-dichlorobenzene is a solid produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine with benzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 Cl 2 (chlorine) __> C 6 CH 4 Cl 2 (p-dichlorobenzene) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.55 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.57 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 1.03. Dale D.
