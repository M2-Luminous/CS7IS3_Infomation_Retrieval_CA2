The seminar, which was organised by the Institute of Policy Studies, asked whether the fact that Pakistan has made a nuclear device should be declared to the world or should be kept vague. Those who enlightened the audience included: the former Joint GOAS, General (Retd) K M Arif; the director general of ISI, Lt General (Retd) Asad Durranl; the former federal minister and ambassador to Washington, Abida Hussain; Senator Khuralud; Dr Tahir Amin and a former ambassador, Dr S M Koreshi. The speakers were also united in the belief that nuclear non- proliferation would be welcomed if it were universal, but any selective application of the principle should never be accepted. Without going into controversies concerning who capped the programme, General K M Arif said the important question to ask was, why was it capped? What was the aim? Was it done to get US aid or to get the Pressler Amendment scappred? General (Retd) Asad Durrani said ambivalence is better than declaration because declaration would diminish the effectiveness of the threat. He said the Pakistani nuclear threat was based on assumption. The retired general said that India believes that we have the capability and the will to use it. He said the enemy is hesitant about launching a crackdown in occupied Kashmir because of this deterrent. If one side, he said, is conventionally weaker than the other side, it must rely on the strength of deterence. A genuine deterrent, he said, would function at every level-both conventional and nuclear. Durrani said that the US linkage of Pakistan's nuclear programme with that of India has helped in many ways. The negative effect, he said, would be if India agreed to denucle-arise its capability. Then Pakistan would have to give up its deterrent, and that would leave Pakistan on an unequal level with India's conventional weapons. Syed Abida Hussain said that during her tenure as ambassador to Washington she went through a very strange and rather humiliating experience. She said the peosple in the US are very crude, and they don't care for others, especially those who are useless for them. She said she landed in the US with the idea that the US was Pakistan's friend, as they jointly struggled against the Soviet Union for Afghanistan, but for the US Afghanistan has already become history. During her stay in Washington she said, she suffered severe criticism and hatred of Pakistan and the Muslim countries. North Korea, Pakistan and Kazakhstan are three countries which are the constant target of their criticism in this regard. The other thing she experienced there was that the Americans used the terminology of Muslim "fundamentalists," militants and "the Muslim threat." Dr Tahir Amin, professor of international relations at Quaid-e Azam University, said was between Pakistan and India had been averted on several occasions because of the nuclear deterrent. He raised three very important questions. Why are governments in Pakistan weak, and why do they compromise on national issues? What is the extent of American penetration in Pakistan? And what changes have taken place in the world, and what will their implications on Pakistan be? He said the national interest is defined by a small military bureaucratic elite which is approached by outsiders, and they always compromise the national interest defined by themselves. He said no political government has the capacity to with stand such pressures.
