Pamfilova, former minister of social protection of the population of Russia, by Galina Valyuzhenich, under the rubric "Moment for a Moral Choice"; place and date not given: "Why Ella Pamfilova Left"] [Text] We can hardly name a statesman whose resignation was received by the common people as painfully as the departure of Ella Pamfilova from her position. Her name is associated with the notions of kindness and justice which the people now lack so badly. This is why people are calling, writing, and coming to us. Some ask with hope: "Is it really true? Could this be yet another rumor?" Others, aware of a good relationship between herself and our editorial office, plead: "Could you influence her?" A group of retirees visiting the editorial office was more categorically minded: "We will not let this happen: We are collecting signatures, we will go to Yeltsin himself. See what she has thought up--to abandon us!" Hope, regret, pain, and disappointment ("she betrayed us")--everything has become intertwined. Even when I was in the lobby awaiting her return from the president they approached me with just one request: Persuade her, talk her into staying on. To tell you the truth, I was certain that the president would not accept her resignation. However, he did. [Valyuzhenich] Ella Aleksandrovna, did you not decide to resign the ministerial post on an impulse? [Pamfilova] No. It was neither on an impulse nor "to keep others company." I thought about this step for a long time, and it was not simple for me to take. My departure is a protest against disgracing the idea of the current reforms, which are becoming increasingly criminally-distributive, officialdom-oriented in nature. In essence, dealing with the consequences of an inconsistently implemented policy, I spent two years putting out fires. I consider it dishonest to participate in the implementation of a policy which I do not subscribe to and for which I cannot be held responsible, and my responsibilities are too great. It is impossible to protect the people without an opportunity to influence the elimination of the main causes engendering their defenselessness. Destructive processes are mounting in the social sphere. The system of compensation for labor in sectors financed from the budget does not make it possible even for healthy young men with high levels of qualification to support their families. The phenomenon of a suicide epidemic has appeared, mainly among the men of the household. Stressful situations--fear of losing a job, lack of funds for the most basic existence--anger people. As they get embittered, parents frequently take out their anger on their children. Do you know how many children now run away from home to escape the wrath of their parents? I know. What is happening to the technical professionals, who were initially democratic and progressively minded, those who are not adept at stealing and engaging in speculation?... People are sinking to the bottom, becoming alcoholics, and growing brutal. Work-related injuries are increasing; more and more disabled children are being born. Therefore, the ranks of my wards--those who are morally and physically crippled, orphans, invalids, and beggars--are being replenished every day, if not every hour. Rather than a nondescript mass, I see specific people with shattered lives behind the passionless numbers of statistical reports which few are concerned about. Perhaps this is the reason why it is so painful for me to witness how our unsinkable bureaucracy is getting fat against the background of the growing impoverishment of the people. A situation is possible whereby retirees will be unable to receive even the retirement benefits guaranteed to them in the environment of a slump in production and nonpayments by enterprises, when less and less money is being taken in by the Retirement Fund and the number of retirees is increasing. How will I look people in the eye? I do not want to be responsible for the mistakes and miscalculations of others. My departure is not a betrayal of the people who expect help from me. It is a fight for them. As I see it, it would be a betrayal to fail to live up to their expectations, to give hope--and as a result fail to provide the barest necessities. My departure is a form of protest by which I would like to attract attention to the fact that social policy cannot be reduced solely to emergency measures aimed at eliminating particular social evils, and that the measures currently proposed by the government will only worsen the situation. [Valyuzhenich] History is aware of various forms of protest all the way to self-immolation; however, hardly anyone will be able to reliably determine how effective they are. Would you perhaps have a greater opportunity to influence the coordination of the policy pursued if you remained a minister? [Pamfilova] The whole point is that I would not. I have already said repeatedly that the functions of sectoral ministries have been reduced to the level of dispatchers. All major policy decisions are made behind closed doors, by a narrow circle of advisers close to the prime minister. We have been assigned the roles of extras. Verbal populism in the government milieu is growing, but when it comes to making specific decisions everything that does not reflect the interests of certain corporate groups is torpedoed. The last election made us understand that many mistakes were made in the policy pursued. It would appear that we should have sat down and analyzed them. Alas, nobody did this.... The meetings of the government still consider small, narrow issues. At times, the situation borders on the absurd. For example, I cannot get an appointment with Chernomyrdin. Indeed, do not look surprised. I do not remember how many times I have signed up.... On one occasion I could not stand it and came to see him on Saturday without an appointment. So, what do you think? I waited by the door for a whole day.... It even became hard to write in the press. Recently I called a press conference at the government press center, at which I was sharply critical. After I left, the journalists were instructed to provide no information in the press. My outrage with all of this has reached the limit. Under such circumstances, how can I influence policy coordination and the making of vital decisions? Even while holding the position of minister I was bound hand and foot. What could I actually do if I retained my position? Open free canteens for the increasing number of beggars, shelters for the homeless, and orphanages for stray children? "Hack out" bonuses on top of retirement benefits and allowances which depreciate instantly, before they get to their recipients? For example, we had a great fight to increase the bonus for retirees effective in February, and we ensured this. I am ashamed to mention the amount--8,000. And this is happening in the environment of our inflation! How would you like me to look old people in the eye? What am I to tell them? This is just one example of the implementation of a strict financial policy. However, should it be tightened at the expense of minimum social guarantees? Is it really hard to understand that a social explosion is just one step away from this policy? I am pained and annoyed by my failure to convince the government that social policy is not an inflationary factor, not an impediment to reforms but rather the heart, the engine of them. Recently I was called from a boarding school for crippled children and told that there was nothing to feed the children. They were down to one barrel of pickles. Can you believe this?--I did not even have an opportunity to help them because, you see, I am "not supposed" to dispose of funds allocated from the budget at my own discretion. For a whole year I hacked out $2 million for an orthopedic prosthesis factory in order to manufacture hands, feet, and footwear for the handicapped.... A whole year! Meanwhile, they are blowing hundreds of millions of dollars on repairing the White House and purchasing imported furniture. What is this? Is this not a feast in a time of famine? No sooner had I left than they took away from the Social Support Fund, which reports to the ministry, the former party dachas in Uspenskoye which had been transferred to it at one point. We had leased out the dachas and organized recreation for crippled children with the proceeds. The money will now be pumped out of the dachas by those who deposit it in personal accounts at foreign banks. Under the pretext of the election results, powerful "advocates of the state," for whom the main point is to preserve the system of allocation by officials as the principal source of gain, are now getting a grip on power. They are concerned about the redistribution of large properties, privatization, laundering of petrodollars generated through illegal transactions.... Do they have time for the suffering of the common man? At present, the grabbing instinct is as developed as ever because there are things to grab. Compared to current abuses, those of the past appear to be child's play. Meanwhile, there is much talk about fighting corruption in the upper echelons of power, but all of this is verbiage, verbiage, verbiage.... The same corrupt bureaucracy bound by mutual guarantees holds sway. I believe that those in power should set their moral, ethical standards very high, and should share with the people many of our objective differences. The authorities should be pure and honest. Only in this case will people respect and support them. [Valyuzhenich] Your civic position is understandable. However, as they say, one always chooses the lesser of two evils. [Pamfilova] I do not want to choose an evil, do you understand? I want to reverse the situation. [Valyuzhenich] Do you believe that in the Duma you will have a greater opportunity to influence social policy? [Pamfilova] I have no great delusions as to this. At any rate, I will not be responsible or pay for the mistakes of others. However, I do not intend to give up and acknowledge my powerlessness. I have the energy for a fight. As you will understand, I did not seek personal gain when I resigned from my position. I think that they will now throw stones at my back; I have spited too many people: I interfered with someone "privatizing" a state dacha, with someone else pocketing a handsome sum, and dared to "criticize" someone.... Of course, it would have been more advantageous to continue in the position of minister. Some people even warned me that I was supposedly bringing my personal career to an end.... However, everyone has a moment when he makes a moral choice, and I have made mine.
