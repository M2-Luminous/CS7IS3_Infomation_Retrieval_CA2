The labor minister says that although urban and suburban minimum wages were increased to 15,000 and 12,5000 bolivares respectively, those raises represent an additional expense of only 10 billion bolivares. He points out, however, that the pay raise granted by the previous administration to the government's professional and technical employees will have a greater impact on the state's passive assets. Meanwhile, the Caldera administration is working to guarantee that resources are available to cover the raises granted to professionals and technicians, which are retroactive to 1 January.
