FBIS4-56776 "drlat090__a94025" FBIS-LAT-94-090-A Daily Report 5 May 1994 ANNEX Cuba Further on Decree-Law Further on Decree-Law PA0505152494 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1254 GMT 5 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0505152494 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [By Javier Rodriguez] [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- Cuba took a new step today in its national offensive against any type of criminal activity by enacting the decree-law that calls for the confiscation of goods and assets obtained through illegal enrichment. The official provision, which was published this morning in the newspaper GRANMA, reflects the decision adopted by the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) [ANPP] this month, charging the Council of State with adopting exemplary measures against those who acquire property illegally. Popular protests, staged by worker meetings throughout the country, and popular condemnation reported by the media demanded stiff sanctions for speculators and those responsible for exploiting state funds. Also, it was demanded that money hoarders [macetas], individuals who, through their participation in illegal ventures and black market activities, get rich and negatively affect the interests of society in general, be dealt with sternly. The decree-law provides for the confiscation and expropriation by the Cuban State of the goods and properties, without any right of indemnification to persons who, directly or through third parties, increase their possessions illegally in amounts beyond their normal income. The confiscation process will be directed against property owners, holders, or bearers of the goods and assets, including third parties who benefited from them and who, in a simulated manner, appear to be owners. One of the articles states that any resolution of this type cannot be appealed and will be turned over to the public prosecutor, who will determine what measures will be taken to confiscate goods or properties, provided sufficient elements are available following the pertinent investigations. Among the final provisions is the determination that the decree-law's implementation will be retroactive, given its relation to social, public, and national needs. One of the most obvious expressions of the criminal acts that will deserve sanction is the illegal sale of houses and vehicles, an action which has been detected of late and was denounced during the ANPP sessions and in worker meetings. A recent meeting of the presidents of the Provincial Administration Councils, local power organizations, concluded that hundreds of vehicles and thousands of motorcycles, which were sold as incentives to manual and intellectual workers, wound up in the hands of money hoarders through illegal operations. The illegal sale of such vehicles was carried out, disregarding the initial sale contracts signed, which established that the state has the right of preference to buy them if the owner decides to sell. Similar instances occurred with many homes, violating the existing principle that the right of personal property does not authorize its use as a means of enrichment because the country's objective is to satisfy family needs, providing a home to whomever needs it. With the decree-law, the government also responded to the reiterated demand of the people that harsh penalties be meted out to black market speculators, who sell staples at exorbitant prices, many times obtaining the products from cooperatives or state entities. It was explained that investigations will be carried out by competent organizations before the established sanctions are applied in order to prevent injustices. It was noted that, above all, the people must remain watchful in the process to combat criminal actions.
