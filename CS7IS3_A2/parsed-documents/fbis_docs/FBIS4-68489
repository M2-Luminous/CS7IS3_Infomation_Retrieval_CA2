Yuli Oglayev, an associate professor of Kalmyk State University and the leader of the opposition, called the condition of society in the initial hours following Ilyumzhinov's statement on cancellation of the republic constitution one of shock: "Just as in all of Russia, our life before 11 March was hard but peaceful. Kirsan blew up the peace." The explosion resulted in the creation of a public Committee in Defense of the Constitution, Citizenship, and Human Rights, which representatives of 16 parties and movements joined, and the convocation by them of the Extraordinary Congress of the Nations of Kalmykia. Communists, democrats, and nationalists united for the first time in order to defend the republic Constitution, which each of them viewed as serving their interests. However, neither the congress nor the two rallies in front of the parliament building (on the first occasion 500 people attended, on the second--about 1,500) interfered with Kirsan Ilyumzhinov seeing the endeavor through to a victorious end. On 5 April the Constitutional Assembly of Kalmykia voted almost unanimously in favor of the draft proposed by the president as recently as three weeks ago. The Code of the Steppe replaced the Constitution of the republic. Attempting to prove the illegitimacy of what had happened, representatives of the opposition gave examples of ways in which citizens had ended up as delegates to the Constitutional Assembly. They had gotten there in an undemocratic manner, by directives from on high. At present the public committee intends to contest the outcome of the voting which was favorable to the president in the Constitutional Court of Russia. In Ilyumzhinov's words, introduction of the draft pursued several objectives: to determine the level of ethnic self-awareness, to figure out the groups held together by "anti-Kirsan sentiment," to find out the attitude of other republics toward anyone that "goes back" to Moscow and the response of Moscow itself to such, and finally, to verify how his own entourage "takes a punch." As the president stated, "my suppositions were borne out 100 percent." In the opinion of the president, the level of self-awareness turned out to be quite high. He believes that state and party officials have formed the previously quite languid opposition together with new leaders from among the professors and representatives of the Ayrat National Party. "Weaklings" were revealed among his confederates: Kirsan's former best friend, the editor of IZVESTIYA KALMYKII, Koneyev, came out with a protest against the Code of the Steppe (he was forced to quit of his own accord). They also replaced the leader of the republic TV and radio who, in the opinion of the president, was not on the ball. The poet David Kugultinov, whose outrage was promptly transmitted on ITAR-TASS channels, calmed down after a talk with Kirsan, and spoke with inspiration in defense of the presidential draft at the Constitutional Assembly. In the process, some people in the audience had to wipe away tears. The official response of Moscow is not quite clear at this point. The republics have responded to the Kalmyk demarche in a very guarded manner, especially Tatarstan and Chechnya. In the assessment of both independent analysts and those from the opposition, the Code of the Steppe perceptibly reinforces the power of the president, which is far from weak to begin with, and ordains much closer legal and economic integration within the framework of Russia than was previously the case. Responding to a question about when Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, to whom the right to schedule the convocation of the Khural is delegated under the new main law, will do so, the president responded: "I have set a time for myself, but we will still consult the parliament." Members of the parliament for whom the Khural means the end of their activity in political life will possibly try to delay this time. However, Kirsan Nikolayevich intends to insist on as early as the beginning of next year. For all most extensive powers of the president, the Khural in particular remains a legislative straw at which those unhappy with the current state of affairs may very well grasp and try to implement their plans to "contain" Ilyumzhinov, and if it works out, use a referendum for new presidential elections. In the opinion of experts, for now the opposition's chances are not good: The population of Kalmykia is more concerned with its own everyday problems rather than political battles on high, and faith in a strong leader as personified by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has not ultimately been lost. Does the president have something to boast of on the anniversary of his election and the adoption of a new law? According to data from the republic administration of statistics, a recession is being registered virtually everywhere. Sales on the market have fallen 30 percent; freight carriage by motor vehicles is down to one-half; in the villages they are slaughtering cattle; of 5,200 unemployed, people under 30 account for almost one-half. To be sure, according to data from the same administration of statistics, the crime rate in the republic went down 18 percent last year, and the president stated officially that he has put an end to racketeering in Elista (which incidentally was confirmed by merchants at stands operating around the clock). Stratification in terms of assets and unemployment is the most serious problem in Kalmykia, which has been aggravated precisely in recent years. The gates of the Monitor demonstration combine are closed; the workers have been on furlough since January. Most of those who worked at the Zvezda plant where the labor biography of the Ilyumzhinov brothers began are also taking a break. However, Ilyumzhinov is upbeat despite everything. He promises that the largest tanning factory in the Caucasus will be started up. The Lockheed company, which intends to build a large international airport in the vicinity of Elista, should begin operations in the same month. However, the plant is indeed half a step away from "burying China and Germany under Kalmyk products," whereas everything concerning the airport is still hazy. Elista is quite clean; old ladies with brooms are seen in the morning. The city is quite festive--the president pays for concerts on a square in front of the parliament building which have already been visited by the "stars." Milk is 500 rubles a liter, and hardly any beggars can be seen. However, many people expected more of the president. At present Ilyumzhinov frequently reminds us that his program of transformations is devised for five years, while only one year has passed so far.
