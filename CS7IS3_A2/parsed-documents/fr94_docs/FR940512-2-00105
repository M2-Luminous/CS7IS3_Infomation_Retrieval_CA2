FR940512-2-00105 FR940512-2-00055 8. The other Adviser is Ernst & Young (E&Y) a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was retained by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the New Plan with respect to the proposed transactions. E&Y represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, and that it undertook a thorough evaluation of the proposed transactions which included an investigation of the decline in commercial real property values in San Diego over the past several years, an overview of current and historical market conditions specific to medical office properties, an overview of the currently local economy and real estate market conditions, and an evaluation of the Property's rate of return and long term potential. In a written report to the Trustee, E&Y concluded that the New Plan's receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases, will constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and beneficiaries of the New Plan. E&Y states that it determined that the Property offers the Plan a secure rate of return above market rates, with a likelihood of continuing stability well into the future. E&Y represents that through market research it has determined that the Property is located in a market area which has achieved stability after the declines in San Diego real estate markets during the 1980's. E&Y states that the Property has good long-term potential as a plan investment and that the New Leases provide a protected, favorable rate of return on the investment in the Property. E&Y represents that factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following findings: (A) Rental under the New Leases will always be no less than the Property's fair market rental value, as determined every two years, and may not be decreased, so that the rate of return of approximately 15 percent is assured and is substantially higher than the prevailing market rate of approximately 10 percent; (B) The New Plan is protected by the Employers' indemnification of the Plans for all claims, demands, and liabilities arising from the Employers' occupancy of the Property; (C) The triple net provisions of the New Leases will protect the New Plan's return on the Property from all costs and expenses associated with the Property; and (D) The interests of the New Plan under the New Leases will continue to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employers' performance of obligations under the New Leases. E&Y also represents that it determined that the New Plan's 57 percent interest in the Property constituted approximately 6.25 percent of the value of all assets held by the New Plan as of February 1994, and that this low composition of real estate investments minimizes risk to the Plan's investment portfolio. E&Y represents that its evaluation of the proposed transactions also included consideration of alternatives available to the New Plan with respect to its interest in the Property. E&Y states that the investments that would be available for the New Plan's investment of cash, in the amount of and in lieu of its interest in the Property, would provide returns significantly reduced from the return offered by the Property. E&Y also states that any prospective sale of the Property would be unlikely to generate cash equal to the fair market value of the Property, due to the costs involved and the lengthy, aggressive marketing required by current economic conditions. E&Y concludes its report with its finding that its ``de novo'' analysis of the proposed transactions indicates that it is in the best interests and protective of the New Plan's participants and beneficiaries to accept the interest in the Property and proceed with the New Leases of the Property to the Employers. 9. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The transactions enable the participants of both Plans to continue to share interests in the Property and its lease to the Employers pursuant to the New Leases, under the same material terms and conditions of the Original Lease; (2) The interests of the Plans will be represented under the New Leases by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which has represented the Original Plan under the Original Lease and which will continue to monitor performance of the terms and conditions of the New Leases on behalf of the Plans; (3) The New Leases, under which rent may not be reduced, will provide a favorable return, net of all costs and expenses, of no less than the Property's fair market rental value; (4) The New Leases, with initial terms expiring April 30, 2004, may be renewed only with the approval of the Trustee and for no more than two terms of five years each; and (5) The Trustee has approved the proposed transactions on the basis of the evaluations and analyses performed by the Advisers.
