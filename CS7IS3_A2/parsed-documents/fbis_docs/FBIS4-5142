The political dynamics of that visit bear study and shed light on emerging new realities in Asia. On Mr Christopher's fiasco of diplomatic mission to assert US might on behalf of jailed Chinese dissidents, Paula R. Newberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace put it perhaps the most kindly: "The China debacle exemplifies the difficulties of discussing rights issues with rights violators," she wrote. Ms Raphel's visit to Delhi was characterised by much forced jocularity on her part, and a field day fo India's lively, nationalistic Press. Kanchan Gupta of THE PIONEER newspaper chided Home Minister S.B. Chavan for "warmly greeting" Raphel, thereby "mortgaging our foreign policy to the quirks of political novices like Ms Raphel who would have been pushing files in anonymous offices had it not been for Mr Bill Clinton coming to power in the US." The state of relations was well illustrated by a brief incident caught by the camera of THE ASIAN AGE, whose photo caption read: "Joint secretary Hardeep Puri, in best diplomatic demeanour, welcomes a cheery Robin Raphel at his office in South Block on Wednesday morning. Keen observers noted that he quickly camouflaged a wince as Ms Raphel took her fellow bureaucrat by the arm." The matter of Kashmir -- the main topic on Ms Raphel's agenda -- is complex, and India is far from blameless. But the Indian Government has shown itself healthily disdainful of US protestations and machinations in the now-hackneyed "wake of the Cold War". The US must learn -- surely is learning, and quickly -- that it can no longer follow the dictum of former president Theodore Roosevelt by speaking softly and carrying a big stick. That reality is an ugly one: The US has been an important force for human rights as well as a major political and economic player in the world for some decades now. As long as America was a leading factor in the world economy, governments with which it has done business have had at least to pay lip service to democracy and human rights. This is amply evident in the Clinton administration's diplomatic soft-shoe over Most Favoured Nation trading status for China. But with the Cold War yielding to multipolar entropy and the impending economic rise of Asia (especially China), this too will change. The failure of Soviet communism and the apparent decline in America's ability to live by its founding ideals have left the moral foundation of global politics dangerously weak. Brute power is becoming more decisive than ever both inside and among countries. Much concern has lately been expressed over alleged human rights abuses by Indian armed forces in Kashmir. No doubt there is some, perhaps much, truth in the allegations made. Yet analyst Ajit Bhattacharjea in the India newspaper THE PIONEER makes a very good and welcome point when he writes: "The lesson to be learnt is that foreign pressure enables the Government to justify its policies, not to modify them. In the last analysis, the human rights of Kashmiris, as of every one else in this country, can be secured only by ourselves." Mr Bhattacharjea's point is mature beyond almost anything else written or said by journalists or politicians anywhere. His extremely apt point is that if we, the citizens of a country -- say, Thailand -- believe human rights are important, then we, the citizens must insist on them. We must hold our government and our elected leaders accountable, constantly and rigorously. "The fact is," writes Mr Bhattacharjea "that civil rights, in this country or in China, or anywhere else, cannot be sustained by Washington. but only by the pressure of domestic opinion." The question then becomes: Do we want civil rights? Do we want a democratic, accountable government? Do we want to know what is happening to our water supply, and the traffic on our city streets, and our villages, and our rivers? If so, we must rely on ourselves, as individuals and as organised groups of citizens. We cannot rely on the US. To quote Mr Bhattacharjea yet again: "There is much in the US record ... to show that human rights have been regarded as negotiable in exchange for strategic and economic facilities." In any case, in today's world the US doesn't seem to be the "superpower with clout" it used to be. Just ask Warren Christopher or Robin Raphel.
