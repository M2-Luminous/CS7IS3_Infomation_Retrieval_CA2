The driver at the steering wheel, keeping a look-out to all sides; the bodyguard near the street map, his eyes fixed onto the center of Strassfurth. Except that it is not all that easy to get around in the heart of the old salt town in the Harz thanks to numerous one-way streets and detours. Given such an inconvenient situation, protocol is reduced to naught and improvisation is everything. "Mr. Minister-President, now we will have to fight our way through here on foot!" The employee's index finger outlines the linear distance. At the other end of the market place the Infomobile of the Saxony-Anhalt government is in readiness with coffee, cake, and various printed material for information-starved citizens and a head of government who, in turn, will be agreeable to discussions. A sea of vending booths is taking up space in between, surrounded by a throng of people looking for bargains. First you have to work your way through this crowd. The minister-president accomplishes this with the ease of a housewife used to shopping here every week. An elderly gentleman greets somewhat hesitantly, most do not recognize the man in the grey-green smock at all. Christoph Bergner, his hair always slightly out of place, his smile more timid than beaming, does not fit the general image of a Christian-Democratic head of government. And personally that suits him fine. It is "difficult" at times, he has been known to confide to journalists, "to be constantly in the public eye" and to be exposed to "people's expectation to say something extraordinary." A facet of a politician's life that to him represents the "actual stress of his office." From a political standpoint this cannot suit him. On the scale of known eastern German heads of government, Bergner brings up the rear. His minimal time in office--six months from his appointment in December of last year until the new elections on 26 June--is not even enough time to build up a presentable foundation of popularity. Also, following numerous affairs and the fall of no less than two party-supplied minister-presidents in but one legislative period (Gerd Gies because of MfS [former GDR] Ministry of State Security, nicknamed Stasi] intrigues and Werner Muench because of salary augmentation) the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) government party in Saxony-Anhalt is politically bankrupt. From 39 percent of votes in 1990 down to a mere 20 percent according to polls, such figures illustrate the shrinkage process. It is nice to know that someone like Christoph Bergner still feels a "general liking" for a condition according to which "political offices are not forever." And so he is a modest man, "his feet planted firmly on the ground," and he seems to have integrity. He takes the train every day from his hometown Halle to the land capital and feels it is all right though strenuous that "there is a group of commuters," all the way to the land DGB (German Trade Union Federation) boss or the superintendent, who for the brief discussion of their concerns prefer the train route to official channels. Bergner considers privileges rather a nuisance. He never wanted to be anything special, not even in the GDR which, according to self-assessment, he "tolerated patiently but without self-exposure." One of his most significant insights from that time: "Anyone who wishes to remain blameless in this system must be prepared to abandon a career." Bergner found his niche as employee at the Halle institute of biochemistry for plants. Keeping quiet like that can also generate depressions. Bergner talks about these in his autobiography, identifying them as the motive for signing the "New Forum's" call for organization, still prohibited in 1989. "This was not a calculated political action but rather a desperate act." Nevertheless one "that ultimately led me into the landtag." Once there, Bergner soon became CDU caucus boss and thus the antagonist of Reinhard Hoeppner who is at the helm of the Social Democrats in the landtag. Competing with one another has therefore been familiar to them for quite some time. And when Bergner comments that a "personified election campaign is absolutely not to his liking" this is not based on a lack of ego but on the fact that Hoeppner is almost something like his alter ego. In other words: Viewed from a certain distance the political as well as exterior contours of the two opponents do not provide much of a difference. A difficult choice for the average person from Saxony-Anhalt who is really only desiring decent conditions in Magdeburg and secure jobs. It would have been different with the heavyweight western import Werner Muench: Hoeppner as "David" against "big boss Goliath." One who knows the little people against one whom they did not like that much but who in their opinion knows the important people in Bonn. The land, which seems somewhat arbitrarily patched together from the poor Altmark in the north, part of the Harz, the chemical triangle of Buna, Leuna, Bitterfeld, the Magdeburger Boerde (a fertile plain), and the outskirts of Wittenberg, not only lacks money but also identity and self-worth. Only "a local" can convey this. At the time, Christian Democrat Bergner was justified in "recognizing with a certain concern" that Muench represented a "dream opponent" for Social Democrat Hoeppner. Not surprisingly, his predecessor toppled over the salary affair "because the emotional sounding board was present"--within the citizenry and within the party. What a blessing in disguise: With Christoph Bergner as the new top man the CDU, coming out of its free fall, at least reached solid ground. Once there and asked what distinguishes him from Hoeppner, Bergner can only think of this response: "We are both very much representatives of our parties," in so far there are "admittedly some differences where the programs are concerned." Exaggerating this means: In Saxony-Anhalt the minister-president copies the image of his challenger. Therefore one's own political lines are not so much evident in the respective personality but instead in the tangle of relationships with party friends. A dilemma for Bergner: His attempt to embody the moral new beginning has very narrow bounds. Given that at the same time he advocates the continuation of the spent conservative-liberal coalition of Magdeburg. "Continuity" was the political "slogan" he announced in the government declaration in January. There is not much else he can do within the short time but to promote the half-finished bills of the Muench cabinet, pass the budget, and keep the rather elaborate government operation running. The 46-year-old family man actually gives the appearance of being indulgent in this task. For example, only after the persistent appeal of his finance minister did he agree to reclaim the excess salaries paid to the fired ministers. Bergner still feels a certain loyalty toward his predecessor, Muench, and the need for a "fair portrayal of his performance." This is also how he justifies that no less than three days before his fall he was still supporting Muench. "As caucus chairman, I could not bring myself to demand his resignation." He preferred to bear the consequences from the salary affair himself--a distinctly protestant characteristic. His announcement that he did not want to earn more money as minister-president than as head of the opposition was meant sincerely though naive given the situation of the law. It is said that he now reduces his salary through regular donations. And in spite of this sensitivity for the emotionally charged subject Bergner appears convinced "that the salary affair was not all that far-reaching." During his travels through the country he found "that it really does not echo at all." Anyway, the high school students, with whom he has discussions this morning in Halberstadt, are more interested in the subject of unemployment, criminality, and the "power" of the media. "There is no dirty business in this country that has any chance of remaining undiscovered," Bergner declares as if he owed a certain recognition to an opponent. This is followed promptly by his "but." "Politicians must confront elections, yet in Hamburg's editorial chambers there is no control mechanism." He is saying what he thinks. He talks about "folk play actors," as politicians are being portrayed in television, and about the "cold sweat" into which he himself still breaks out in front of a camera. He admits freely that when asked about youth policies he "waffled a bit." And they like him. An honest soul, as if he had no other choice--"in the time remaining when at least I still have responsibility."
