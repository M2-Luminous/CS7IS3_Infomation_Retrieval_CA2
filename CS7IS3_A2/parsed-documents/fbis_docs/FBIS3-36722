ITAR-TASS was told at the Foreign Office that the head of Britain's foreign affairs department called the exchange of views "quite useful," but also asked Yerevan to take specific measures to settle the conflict situation in this region, which is causing justifiable concern in London. Levon Ter-Petrosyan explained his country's position on this problem and confirmed his support for the process of finding a political settlement started within the CSCE framework which, in his opinion, represents the best way to normalize the situation in this region. The Armenian president said the Russian Federation not only enjoys influence in the southern Caucasus but "should play a key role there."
