Hammud Bin-Hilal al-Habasi, undersecretary for economic affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs [ministry name as published], said that this reduction will lead to neither a recession nor a slowdown of economic growth. The Omani official told AL-HAYAH that despite the fall of oil prices, the estimated budget deficit in 1994 will be 20 percent less than that of the previous year. Gulf banking sources stated that Oman asked four banks in the Gulf region, the West, and Japan to provide her with a new loan in the amount of $300 million. However, al-Habasi argues that the $2.6 billion of foreign debt that existed at the beginning of the present five-year plan will be the same at the end of the plan period in 1995, resulting in a zero figure of Omani net borrowing from abroad. The undersecretary in the Omani Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs indicated that Oman was undertaking procedures such as reviewing and modernizing investment laws as well as establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for commercial, investment, and financial activities that are in accordance with the free economy policy and market mechanism. Following are details of the interview: ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of the current year's budget reduction compared to both last year's reduction and that estimated and included in the fourth five-year plan? [Al-Habasi] There is no reduction with regards to the gross general revenue which has been estimated in the 1994 budget at about RO1732.1 million representing a 2-percent increase over the 1993 figure of about RO1698.5 million in the endorsed budget. This increase is mainly due to the estimated increase in the natural gas revenue and in other current revenues. As for the figure for the general revenue for the current year as it appears in the five-year plan, it has been estimated at RO1.780 billion representing an increase of about RO48 million over the estimate of the current budget. This slight increase in the general revenue is due to the fact that oil revenue for 1994 had been estimated at RO1.364 billion in the fourth five-year plan. However, due to the drop in oil prices, this revenue had been estimated at RO1.311 billion in the 1994 budget. Total general expenditure in the 1994 budget has been estimated at RO2.033 billion compared to RO2138.5 million in the 1993 budget with a decrease of about 5 percent. Meanwhile, the estimated figure for total general expenditure in the 1994 budget is more than the RO1.958 billion figure estimated for 1994 in the fourth five-year plan. It is thus clear that estimates for general expenditure tally with the government directives to reach a balance and narrow the gap between revenue and expenditure. It is also worth mentioning that decree number 1/94 issued by the Sultan to endorse the budget indicated that it was possible to review some expenditure items in case the net oil revenue dropped below average estimated prices due to the drop in world oil prices because of the current delicate and complicated world economic conditions. ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of reduction in both the current general expenditure and the investment expenditure in the new budget? [Al-Habasi] The general current expenditure is estimated in this year's budget at about RO1.5859 billion compared to 1.6175 billion in the 1993 budget. As for the investment expenditure, it is estimated in the current budget at about RO431.6 million compared to about RO495.8 million in the 1993 budget. As I indicated in my previous response, the reduction in the size of the general expenditure came as a result of the drop in world oil prices and the impact of that on revenues and consequently on the size of general expenditure and the current deficit. It is worth noting that the current budget is geared to serve development and provide the necessary allotments for new projects that are expected to be executed during the current year. Therefore, the reduction decided upon for investment expenditure will not greatly impact the previously endorsed figure of RO448 million for investment expenditure programs for 1994 in the five-year plan. This is because allotments endorsed for the programs seem quite similar to the figures, which have been previously quoted, of the current budget. Therefore, though oil prices have affected the current budget, it remains balanced, financially sound, and able to preserve the good developmental achievements that were executed in the Sultanate. ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the anticipated 1994 budget deficit and the "actual deficit" in the budget of 1993, the year when the current drop in oil prices occurred? ['Abd-al-Ghani] The deficit estimated in the 1994 budget amounts to RO300.9 million compared to RO375 million in the 1993 budget and represents a 20-percent reduction. Therefore, particularly in light of the current drop in oil prices in world markets, it seems that this reduction is sound and in harmony with the policies and procedures applied by the government in order to tackle the deficit problem. The "actual" 1993 budget deficit will be determined later on following the preparation and endorsement of the 1993 final accounts. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Which measures would be used to tackle the deficit in the new budget? Will those measures involve more withdrawal from the state's general reserves, or would there be recourse to domestic and foreign borrowing? [Al-Habasi] As I have previously mentioned, the current budget deficit is about RO300.9 million. Measures to finance it include resorting to state funds worth RO221 million and to RO48 million as receipts of government development bonds, in addition to acquiring RO31.9 million in the form of net borrowing and aid. A positive indicator is the fact that the figure for estimates of withdrawals from state bonds has been cut down from about RO292 millions in the 1993 budget to about 221 million in that of the current year. It is also worth mentioning that the resort to government devlopment bonds and foreign borrowing were financing measures mentioned in the fourth five-year plan. These measures are being used in accordance with the relevant endorsed regulations. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that, due to the drop in oil revenues, the government should review its decision not to increase foreign borrowing above the average reached during the current plan of $2.6 billion. Will the Sultanate accordingly arrange for foreign loans from either friendly countries or world banks as happened following the 1986 oil crisis? [Al-Habasi] I would like to indicate that the decision you refer to in your question was included in the fourth five-year plan, which stipulated that the size of the general foreign borrowing should remain fixed at the figure it had reached at the end of the third five-year plan: i.e., about RO1 billion. This means that it is possible to arrange for new foreign borrowing during the plan years. In fact, the planned borrowing during the fourth five-year plan period would be equal to the amount of loans paid back during the same period; the general foreign debt would be thus the same at the end of the plan period as it was at its beginning, i.e., the "net" foreign borrowing would be zero. This scenario is the one currently applied. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Procedures to cut down general expenditure included cutting down recurrent expenses, freezing or abolishing annual salary raises and professional allowances, and having new regulations for travel tickets, as well as for housing for those coming from abroad to be employed by the state. How much savings would these procedures yield in the budget? Besides, do the benefits accruing from these procedures outweigh the expected risks that they may cause, such as slowing down of economic growth and slump in some economic sectors, particularly those with an active private sector? [Al-Habasi] First of all, let me correct some inaccurate information that is included in the question. First: Annual raises have not been frozen or abolished; they continue to be paid and the current budget includes the extra funds necessary to pay periodic raises to employees of ministries and all government units. Second: Professional allowances have not been frozen or abolished, they have simply been reduced by 50 percent. As you know, this is not an allowance for all government employees, but is only granted to some of them according to either the nature of their jobs or to special circumstances that were valid during the last few years and no longer exist. As for the procedures that were mentioned and that have been resorted to in the framework of the comprehensive tackling of the financial conditions, they aim not only at reducing expenditures but primarily at rationalizing spending, cutting down on administrative expenses and providing elasticity in applying the benefits that are given to those coming from abroad to work for the government. I would like to seize this opportunity to affirm the following: First: There has been no change in basic salaries and periodic raises that were given to government employees as acquired rights. Second: We have rationalized spending and provided elasticity in applying the benefits granted to those coming from abroad to work for the government. However, those benefits should be well used in such a way that would allow those using them to choose the housing and travel fit for them. It should also be noted that these new procedures will save the government some expenses and lessen its responsibilities and administrative work; they will also enable it to control expenditure and waste. Third: The reduction in government spending will not create any noticeable recession trends that could impact the economy as a whole and the private sector in particular. ['Abd-al-Ghani] It has become crucial to harmonize--on the one hand--between national laws such as those concerned with work and workers, investment, trials and commercial arbitration and--on the other hand--international codes and conventions. With regards to this issue, is the Sultanate ready to revise some current laws in order to make them more compatible with world codes and directives that are encompassed in the framework of the new world economic order? [Al-Habasi] In view of severe economic international competition, the Sultanate Government, since the onset of the blessed renaissance of 1970, realized the necessity of adopting the free economy system. It therefore provided the legal and institutional framework for encouraging and facilitating both the private sector activities and domestic and foreign investment. Subsequently, besides issuing commercial, investment, customs, financial, and monetary laws, the Sultanate issued laws dealing with work and workers, immigration and visas, as well as commercial disputes, etc. In order to give a push to development and progress in the Sultanate, as well as to confront the novelties and changes in the world economy, the concerned authorities are currently working towards reviewing, modernizing, and developing many of the laws and legislation that are currently being applied. This procedure aims at establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for commercial, investment, and financial agencies and activities that would be compatible with the Sultanate's directive of adopting the free economy system, which relies on both the market mechanism and free competition and which has become the main concept of the new world economic order.
