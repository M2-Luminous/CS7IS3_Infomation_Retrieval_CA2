Like most politicians, the head of the Israeli Government basically preferred to talk about what he thought was important, thus avoiding giving answers to tough questions. The premier acknowledged that in the short term the peace in the Near East will be a peace between leaders rather than peoples. "There is a big gap between peace in name only and the peace that passes via the hearts of people," he said. Rabin noted that Arab leaders agreed to talk with Israel only because they realized they could achieve nothing by violence against the Jewish state. "We are not cutting our military expenditure, since our military might is a guarantee of security and a guarantee that the talks will continue. It is a factor which encourages the strengthening of trends toward a peaceful political solution," the prime minister stated. Yitzhaq Rabin addressed the topic of Islamic fundamentalism, which is particularly alarming to the Israelis. In his opinion, the danger is posed not so much by extremists from Hamas who are directly threatening the lives of Israelis, but by the spread of "Khomeyni-ism without Khomeyni," even in countries in the region that are located a long way from Israel. "Fundamentalism is undermining the stability of moderate Arab regimes as a whole, and this is our problem too," Rabin believes. The premier refused to say how he regarded the prospects of his Labor Party, and his own prospects, in future parliamentary elections in the wake of the Hebron massacre, which demonstrated how far the opponents of peace among the Jews themselves are prepared to go. However, he acknowledged that the popularity of the peace process has declined throughout large sections of Israeli society. "Many people ask me," the premier continued, "why we need peace when any fanatic can strap explosives around his waist and destroy a passenger bus? How can we be certain that 'Arafat, once he has assumed control of the Gaza sector with its 750,000 Palestinians, many of whom will remain terrorists until the end of their days, will be able to ensure order there?" "I belong to the category of politicians who are convinced that the risk is great, but this risk also engenders hope, and it should be given a chance," the head of the Israeli Government stated. "Needless to say, this will be a big test for Yasir 'Arafat as well." Diplomatic politeness obliged Yitzhaq Rabin to say only agreeable things about Russia, despite the fact that a certain strain was very evident in bilateral relations back in March. At that time his cabinet, backed by Washington, was extremely skeptical about Moscow's proposal to start preparing the second stage of the Madrid peace conference. "I see no disagreements between the cochairmen of the peace conference -- Russia and the United States," the prime minister said. "Their task is to help the two sides directly responsible for stopping the war; they can also agree between themselves, but they should certainly not conclude any agreements on the two sides' behalf."
