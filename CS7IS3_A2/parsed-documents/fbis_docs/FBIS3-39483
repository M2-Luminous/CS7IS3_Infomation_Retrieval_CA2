This too is worth considering. What seems to me to have been the gravest fault committed by [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in this election campaign is that they -- nobody else -- have caused a new political boost to be imparted to anticommunism. Who could have plausibly used anticommunist arguments against the PDS if it had not allied with the neocommunists of Communist Renewal and the "Catholic-communists" [Catholic left-wingers] of Rete? Nor is it any good for Occhetto to reply that the American Democratic Party and Britain's Labor Party also contain extreme fringes. This, both because, as [Democratic Alliance leader] Ferdinando Adornato has said, in those parties the influence wielded by the extreme fringes absolutely cannot be compared to that of [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti and [Rete Secretary] Orlando within the cartel of left-wing forces and also, and above all, because neither the Democratic Party nor the Labor Party -- unlike the PDS -- was born out of the communist tradition, and therefore they do not need to defend themselves against the suspicion of links with that tradition. Occhetto should ponder the following: If tomorrow [National Alliance leader] Fini were to suffer a breakaway on the right on the part of a group of diehard fascists, what would we say of him if he were then to ally with those same diehards in the elections? Having opted to facilitate unity on the left at all costs (on the basis of the theory that under the first-past-the-post system, it is only possible to win if united: no matter with whom) to the detriment of the pursuit of the average voter (who would have demanded strict limits in the left), the PDS may have -- though this is not certain -- gained a better chance of victory, but only by causing itself, and all Italians, to have to pay the price of perpetuating the communist-anticommunist split in Italian society and politics. This, all the more inasmuch as the PDS' alliance with Communist Renewal -- unlike what would have happened in the event of a contest between the two groups -- threatens to block the (inevitably slow) evolution of the political attitudes of PDS officials and members. Which are reflected in the language used by the PDS in this campaign. All the key terms used by the PDS -- both those, such as "Progress" or "Democracy", which are accorded a positive connotation, and those, such as "Individualism" (always qualified as "unbridled") or "Economic Liberalism" (invariably "unrestrained"), which are accorded a negative connotation -- belong entirely, in this usage, to the traditional communist lexicon. D'Alema says that it is boorish for unreconstructed anticommunists to cite the lamentable argument of "communism," but in order to help them to correct such a serious fault, this boorishness, would it not be appropriate for the PDS to ask the nearest Public Health Office to carry out an urgent lexical "disinfection" program? This, since, although of course language says nothing about intentions (intentions can be concealed, and must in any case submit to changing circumstances), it does say some unmistakable things about the principles and political attitudes behind them. But it is not of course merely a linguistic problem. There are (at least) three "areas" concerning which it is legitimate to worry about a possible victory by the left-wing forces. They concern the issues of state control, foreign policy, and the relationship between political authority and the judiciary. On the first point it seems clear to me that the left-wing cartel is adopting a position of "continuity" with respect to the course pursued by the First Republic. It is enough to consider the remarks made about the 1980's, the CAF [Cossiga, Andreotti, Fanfani] years. The left refers to them as years of "uncontrolled economic liberalism." What liberalism? The 1980's were in fact years of state control -- unrestrained, too. Years when there was not a single instance of privatization (whereas this was taking place in other countries) and when dominion was exercised by the Single Party of Public Expenditure, of which, it must be pointed out, the PCI [Italian Communist Party] was also part, with the CAF. By taking issue with an economic liberalism that has never existed in this country, the left-wing cartel is sending an unambiguous message to the very many ramified vested interests at all levels of the social pyramid that are vitally dependent on public spending. A message of "continuity" (with respect to the Christian Democratic system of state control) instead of a change of course. The second crucial "area" concerns foreign policy. Stances in this regard can only be fully assessed in crisis situations. Well, the PDS leadership has not said a single word of self-criticism about the stance adopted during the Gulf crisis. If a similar situation were to arise again, what would happen with the PDS in government? Would Italy undermine Western solidarity, with all the negative repercussions that this would entail for our country? It is not possible just to say, "let us forget about the past," as long as well-founded doubts about future conduct remain. Last, the problem of the judiciary. I approach the issue, of course, with the circumspection and caution that are always obligatory when discussing the real centers of authority. In Bologna, the heart of the communist "regime" in our country, for instance, jokes are made (though these are whispered, and only to trusted friends, more or less as happens in totalitarian regimes) about the fact that the most incisive action in connection with illegal funding, kickbacks, and so forth has hitherto affected, as it so happens, a number of socialists and also Ciriaco de Mita's brother. We do not yet know what will happen in the Cusani case, but, to be frank, the worry is that in the event of a victory by the left-wing forces, the politico-judicial lobby known as the "magistrates' party" -- which is, of course, not the judiciary as a whole but, rather, a pressure group operating within it from positions of growing strength -- will succeed in imposing a "pact" between the ruling left-wing forces and the judicial authorities, more or less similar to that which existed between the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the same authorities in the 1950's and 1960's. When the advent of a totalitarian regime is feared, it is principally the possibility of such a pact that people have in mind. I read in the newspapers the statement made by Angela Cavagna, a television starlet, who criticized parties that "change their coats but do not change their underwear." Alas, this is likely to remain absolutely the most accurate observation that has been made about this election campaign.
