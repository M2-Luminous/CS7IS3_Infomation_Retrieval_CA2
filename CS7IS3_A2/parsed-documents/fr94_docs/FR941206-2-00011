FR941206-2-00011 FR941206-2-00006 DOC Position: We agree with the petitioners. (See the BIA section of this notice.) Suspension of Liquidation Consistent with section 734(f)(2)(A) of the Act, the suspension of liquidation of all entries, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, of silicomanganese from Ukraine, will not now be reimposed. Suspension of liquidation will be reinstated only if the International Trade Commission (ITC) issues an affirmative injury determination and the Department terminates the agreement suspending this investigation. ITC Notification In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. The ITC will now determine, within 45 days, whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated. If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the suspension agreement will remain in force and the Department will not issue an antidumping duty order. Consistent with section 734(f)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department will not issue an order, so long as the agreement remains in force. Notification to Interested Parties This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act, 19 USC 1673d(d), and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4). Dated: November 30, 1994. Susan G.
