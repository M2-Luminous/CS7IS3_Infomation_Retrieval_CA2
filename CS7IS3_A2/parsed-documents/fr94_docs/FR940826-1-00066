FR940826-1-00066 FR940826-1-00009 E. Bidding Credits 24. In the Third Report and Order we adopted a 25 percent bidding credit for businesses owned by minorities and women. We concluded that the use of bidding credits would be an effective tool to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate in the provision of narrowband services. 24 And, in this Order, we raised this bidding credit to 40 percent for the regional narrowband auctions. While we do not think that a bidding credit of this magnitude is required when used in conjunction with an insulated entrepreneurs' block, we continue to believe that a bidding credit is necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS. In addition, we believe that a small bidding credit is warranted to help small businesses overcome financing obstacles. Accordingly, we propose to continue to provide a bidding credits in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks that would give small businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent. 24 See Third Report and Order at ¶72, in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;252, 9 FCC Rcd 2941, 59 FR 26741 (May 24, 1994), ( Third Report and Order ). 25. In ex parte presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for narrowband PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who are likely to bid for licenses in this service. PCSD states, for example, that all of the existing large paging companies can justify much larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur, regardless of a bidder's credit. Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable to any of the large companies. 25 As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the narrowband PCS service, we propose to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. These measures would enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits can have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in entrepreneurs' blocks. 25 Ex parte filing of PCSD Development Corporation (PCSD), August 9, 1994. 26. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make special provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in narrowband PCS. 26 In effect, the bidding credit would function as a discount on the bid price a firm would actually have to pay to obtain a license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased capital formation difficulties, we propose to provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than small businesses. Thus, women and minorities would receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts they bid on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it might be impossible to assure that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision of narrowband PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems endemic to both groups. Therefore, we propose a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent for these groups. We believe that these measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing and operating a narrowband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress. We seek comments on these proposals. 26 Although we did not previously grant bidding credits to small businesses in the Third Report and Order , we now believe that, given the exponentially greater expense likely to be incurred in acquiring broadband PCS licenses, bidding credits might be a proper means to ensure that these firms have the opportunity to participate in this service. 27. As discussed below, we have also proposed to modify the definition of a minority and women-owned firm. 27 To receive a 10 percent bidding credit, we propose that a small business must satisfy the same gross revenue test adopted for installment payments. As explained more fully in the small business definition section, we propose that a consortium consisting entirely of small businesses also be eligible for a 10 percent bidding credit even if the combined gross revenues of the consortium exceed the small business gross revenues threshold. In addition, we propose that a small business that is owned by women and minorities must satisfy the definition of a business owned by minorities and women as well as the small business definition to receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Finally, we propose that a consortium of small firms owned by women and/or minorities is eligible for a 25 percent bidding credit, provided that each member of the consortium meets the definition of a small business and a minority and/or women-owned firm. 27 See infra ¶¶44&hyph;54. 28. Repayment Policies Applicable to Bidding Credits . To ensure that bidding credits benefit the parties to whom they are directed, we inquire whether we should adopt strict repayment policies: if, within the original 10-year term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control of a license to for example, an entity that is not eligible for as a high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify would have to be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of approval of the transfer. Thus, an assignment of a license from a small minority-owned firm to a women-owned firm with revenues greater than $40 million would require repayment of 10 percent of the original bid price (25 percent less 15 percent) to the Treasury. A sale to an entity that would not qualify for bidding credits would entail full repayment of the original bidding credit as a condition of transfer. Small businesses also would be bound by the financial eligibility rules during the entire license term as set forth below. Thus, if after licensing an investor purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the business and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million small business cap, this repayment provision would apply. 28 If such a proposal were to be adopted, we would envision that these repayment provisions apply throughout the original term of the license to help promote the long-term holding of licenses by those parties receiving bidding credits. Nevertheless, as in the case of the holding period and transfer restrictions discussed at ¶¶88&hyph;89 above we seek comment on any effects such rules may have on the ability of designated entities to attract capital. We therefore ask commenters to address in detail whether this type of restriction would further the goal of increasing the number of designated entities participating in the provision of narrowband PCS services. 28 See infra ¶¶39&hyph;43, for a discussion of which investor interests would be ``attributable'' for purposes of calculating the gross revenues caps.
