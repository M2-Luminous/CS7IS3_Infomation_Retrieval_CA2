The MP and former cabinet minister, 54, received a warrant formally advising him he is under investigation on the charge of complicity in Mafia association. Raised by the magistrates today were parts of testimony provided by informants Giuseppe Croce Benevento and Leonardo Messina who have told investigators that Mannino maintained ties with Mafia families and promised to use his political clout in matters of interest to the Agrigento boss. Thousands of "men of honor" and their families were allegedly made available to the Christian Democrat of the time, whose old party is now named the Italian People's Party. Informed judiciary sources here said Mannino was also questioned on accusations which had not originated with the mafiosi state's witnesses, mainly on his relations with public notary Pietro Ferraro, arrested one month ago on a Mafia association charge. These magistrates, said the sources, have taken over the records compiled during an earlier investigation of the politician based on the word of another Mafia state's witness. On October 11, 1991, an investigation into Mannino, the minister for the Mezzogiorno at the time, was shelved. This probe originated with an informant's testimony.
