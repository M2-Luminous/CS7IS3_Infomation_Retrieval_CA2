This is the general principle for guiding the 1994 financial work as set forth at the regional financial work conference on 27 January. Qian Fenyong and Song Zhimin, leaders of the region, attended the conference. Song Zhimin gave a speech at the conference. According to the financial work principles as set forth at the national financial work conference and in line with actual regional conditions, the regional financial department should carry out its work in line with the following work priorities: Strictly control aggregate credits. The state-owned commercial banks should engage in the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities according to the amounts of loans, control the targets for the management of the proportions of liabilities, and check on legal persons, that are mainly regarded as a unit. Policy-lending banks should strictly handle the defined policy-lending business. In regard to the management of credits, the policy- lending banks should carry out the principle of "planned management, credits for fixed targets, management on the premise of maintenance of capital, and self-balance;" and grant loans according to the state-fixed targets. Except for the temporary use of capital, the central bank must not offer funds. It is necessary to cut the relationship between policy-lending loans and the basic currency of the central bank, carry out the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities among the non-banking financial organizations according to different actual conditions, continue to strictly control the aggregate foreign exchange loans, and simultaneously readjust the proportions of the foreign exchange structure and the property structure. Try every possible means to increase bank savings and strive to expand credit resources. All banks and urban and rural credit cooperatives should continue to adopt various kinds of positive measures to organize and assimilate bank savings, strive to increase both urban and rural savings deposits over 1993, and increase at least 5 billion yuan of savings deposits this year. The situation that enterprises registered a negative increase in savings deposits should be changed. We should exert efforts to improve service to assimilate savings deposit but must not adopt the improper means, such as wantonly and perfunctorily raising interest rates to attract savings deposits. Various levels of people's banks and specialized banks should strengthen the management and examination of interest rates. Those violating regulations governing the management of interest rates should sternly be investigated and handled. At the time of firmly organizing forces to increase savings deposits, we should exert great efforts to flexibly use existing credits and increase usable capital. Optimize the structure of loans and ensure the supply of capital for key items. When assimilating savings deposits and flexibly using existing capital, we should use the newly increased portion of loans to meet the needs of key projects for the region's economic development. We should positively support agricultural and livestock production, ensure the supply of funds for purchasing farm and livestock products, and positively support the development of energy resources and transportation service and the production of major raw materials for industrial use. It is necessary to support the supply of funds for state key construction projects; the development of high value-added products, readily marketable products, and the industries and products with high capability to create foreign exchange; the supply of the funds for the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with good economic results and the foreign export trade enterprises; and the implementation of the support-the-poor plan in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Enterprises should be guided to enter markets and join competition. We should concentrate funds and select a group of town and township enterprises and key projects to accelerate their technological transformation. To ensure the fulfillment of the above targets, we should continue to carry out the principle of supporting the good, controlling the bad, and having both guarantee and control. Continuously consolidate the financial order and realistically strengthen supervision and control over financial work. Last year, the region made positive achievements in straightening out financial order. On the basis of the achievements made last year, this year, we should continue to expand achievements. It is necessary to continuously implement the regulations on consolidating financial order as stipulated last year. It is necessary to resolutely ferret out inter-bank loans that were granted in violation of regulations. Loans that cannot be withdrawn should clearly be investigated and the responsible persons should be called to account. Economic entities run by the banks themselves should be separated from the banks. Under the unified leadership of the local party committees and governments, the people's banks at various levels should conscientiously and resolutely eliminate the problems of arbitrarily collecting funds. Positively support enterprises to transform the managerial mechanisms and to conscientiously return the credits to the banks. The financial departments should adopt a positive attitude to help enterprises change their managerial mechanisms and engage in reform and also pay attention to analyzing and grasping the new situation and new problems cropping up in the course of replacing the old system with the new in an effort to avoid losing state credits and assets. Strictly control loans for fixed assets. It is necessary to continuously carry out mandatory plans for granting loans for fixed assets. No one is allowed to grant loans for fixed assets without approvals. People's banks at various levels should strengthen the examination and auditing of loans for fixed assets. Banking units and leaders of units that violate policies should be called to account.
