According to a top municipal government official, the city has spent 26 billion yuan in building residential quarters over the past 15 years, with newly-built apartments totalling some 80 million square meters in floor space, six times the amount in 1949 when New China was born. Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa, in a report delivered at a meeting on housing, said that more than 1.3 million families have moved into new homes since the start of China's reform and opening to the outside world. The average living space per capita increased to 8.3 square meters in 1993 from 4.55 square meters in 1978, the official said. The pace of urban housing construction has quickened since the 1980s. To date, more than 110 residential areas have been built in urban districts, and 69 old and dangerous housing zones have been rebuilt. The official added that the current housing construction drive has greatly improved both the citizens' living conditions and the urban environment. He said that the city has broken ground for about 10,000 square meters in newly-designed "comfortable apartment buildings", with the aim of improving housing for people with low incomes. But, he noted, there are about 200,000 households still living in very bad quarters, with an average living space of no more than four square meters. The official revealed that the city's goal for this year's residential construction is 6.55 million square meters. He urged government departments and leaders at all levels to pay close attention to the work and to mobilize the broad masses to promote housing construction and reform.
