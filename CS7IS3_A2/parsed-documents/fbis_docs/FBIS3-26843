If the central government had not adopted resolute measures at that time, the economy could not have been so stable, and reform, opening up, and development could not have turned out such major achievements. Practice has proved that both giving full play to the role of the market mechanism, and strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control are the essential and indispensable components of a market economy system. A view of the market economy system of all countries shows that its basic framework includes a perfect market system, as well as a macroeconomic regulation and control system. This also should be the case of a socialist market economy system. One of the basic experiences of China's economic reform is to constantly promote economic development through gradual reforms, and to create conditions for further reform so that economic development and deepened reform will push each other forward. Practice has proved that the degree of market advance must correspond with the capacity of macroeconomic regulation and control. The faster the pace of market advance, the more effective the macroeconomic braking mechanism will have to be. The intense reform, rapid economic growth, and readjustment of the interests structure and economic relations are bound to be followed by more contradictions and frictions, resulting in all kinds of unexpected outcomes. The task of macroeconomic regulation and control is to discover the new contradictions and problems promptly, and to adopt measures to resolve them. When such "microscopic regulation" is introduced frequently, it will avoid further aggravation of the problems and contradictions. As the extent of "microscopic regulation" is limited, the shock and loss incurred also will be relatively limited. If the problems are not discovered and resolved promptly by immediately adopting the method of "microscopic regulation," but are left until they pile up and reach an extent that must be resolved, the scope of regulation and control inevitably will be broad. We then will be forced to slam on the brakes. Consequently, the shock and loss incurred will be greater. Therefore, the prediction of macroeconomic regulation and control is particularly important. It is necessary to take precautions against problems that might crop up in every stage of reform and development, including problems related to stagflation, and to adopt effective means and measures to prevent and resolve them promptly. Under the conditions of developing a socialist market economy, macroeconomic regulation and control should be focused on economic means, which include interest rates, tax rates, and other means of indirect control. However, the necessary administrative means must not be forsaken. At a time when change is being effected in the economic system, the problems arising from the administrative behavior of the government departments at all levels should be resolved by adopting necessary administrative means. The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Economic Structural Reform has defined clearly that the powers and responsibilities of macroeconomic regulation and control lie with the center because only the central authorities can make overall judgments and decisions on such issues as the nationwide supply of currency. In this regard, the localities should be subordinate to the center, and the part should be subordinate to the whole -- not vice versa. Under the favorable domestic and international environment, China's economic growth must be rapid and not slow. However, we should take note of economic stability and coordinated development. It should be noted that the greatest danger of high economic growth is inflation. Hence, there should be a limit to the high growth, which should not lead to serious inflation or social instability. If there is inflation, it will be impossible for rapid economic growth to continue. We must be aware that the danger of aggravated inflation still exists. The 1993 retail price index rose by around 13 percent over that in 1992, and there is still great pressure on 1994 prices. Curbing inflation now has become a matter of concern for people at home and abroad. It is also an important condition for ensuring social stability and the smooth progress of reform and opening up. Excessive investment is the main factor triggering inflation. The great demand for investment, which exceeds the national strength, must be backed by the excessive issuance of currency, which will stimulate inflation. Fixed-asset investment in 1993 rose by around 47 percent over 1992, of which investment by state units rose 58 percent, the largest scale of investment in the 1980's. All localities now have great demand for investment and for developing new projects. Unless effective measures are adopted to check this trend, the 1994 scale of fixed-asset investment will continue to increase, which will further aggravate inflation. To curb excessive growth in fixed-asset investment, it is necessary to adopt correct monetary policies, have the currency supply under control, issue currency as little as possible, and strictly approve the loans granted for fixed-asset investment. We have learned the lesson of fluctuations on several occasions in the past. To avoid drastic falls, it is necessary first to guard against great rises. We must avoid another overheated economy, which may force us to adopt stern measures. Work in all fields should be focused on optimizing the structure and increasing efficiency, rather than on one-sidedly pursuing growth in output value and blindly expanding the scale of construction. In the new year, we must pay special attention to agriculture, and under no circumstances should we develop secondary and tertiary industries at the expense of agriculture. Experience tells us that deepened reform requires a spacious environment. To attain this point, the scale of economic growth and investment should be appropriate. The economy will continue to grow at a rapid pace in 1994, and so will the total investment in construction. This is definite, but appropriateness is very important. Only by setting the growth at a practical level and keeping investment growth strictly under control can we ensure that the entire economic environment will not be too tight and that all reforms will proceed profoundly. When a good job is done in reform, the established stimulative and restraining mechanisms will promote the optimization of resources, reduce losses, and genuinely attain the objective of better efficiency and intensive operation. In the 1990's and in the entire process of attaining the socialist modernization program, we must handle properly the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform is the motive force, while development is the target and stability is the premise. Only by doing a good job in reform and development can there be a solid foundation for stability. Without a stable political and social environment, however, it will be difficult for reform and development to proceed. For this reason, we should take social bearing capacity and stability into account, while proceeding with reform and development. Reform must promote development, while the latter must meet the needs of the former. The target for 1994 national economic and social development, which is both grand and feasible, has been proposed. In the 1994 and throughout the 1990's, it will be remarkable to attain the annual average GNP growth of 8 to 9 percent set out by the 14th CPC Congress. The task of macroeconomic regulation and control is to attain this goal, and to ensure the rapid, steady, and coordinated [kuai su wen ding xie tiao 1816 6643 4489 1353 0588 6148] development of the national economy. This is what the people of the whole country are expecting.
