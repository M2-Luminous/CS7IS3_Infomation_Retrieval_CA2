FBIS4-7240 "dreas082_l_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 Philippines Accused Plotter Denies Communist Chief's Charges Accused Plotter Denies Communist Chief's Charges BK2804052294 Manila MANILA BULLETIN in English 24 Apr 94 pp 1, 8 BK2804052294 Manila MANILA BULLETIN English BFN [Text] Leaders of the revolutionary movement who had been accused by Communist Party founder Jose Ma. Sison of plotting with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to assassinate him denied yesterday the charges, saying Sison "is either sick of paranoia of the highest order or again up to some evil scheme." "By airing self-serving and serious charges without basis, Sison is in effect giving policy guidance to the group of Gregorio Rosal and similar brutal killers to escalate the internal feud in the leftist movement, while he is ensconced in the safety of his refuge in the Netherlands," said Antonio Cabardo, vice president of Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan [Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People] (Sanlakas), and one of the five leaders Sison had charged of plotting to kill him. Others expressed the same sentiment. Sanlakas is a multi-sectoral organization in the NCR [National Capital Region] composed of former affiliates of Bayan [Bagong Alyansang Makabayan -- New Nationalist Alliance]-NCR. Cabardo said it is now clear that Sison is pushing for the implementation of an earlier death sentence for four opposition leaders, as he claimed to be the target of a similar slay plot. Sison had charged in an interview over radio station DZMM and DZRH that the AFP and Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes, Arturo Tabara, Felimon Lagman, and Cabardo had sent a hit team to Europe led by a certain "Narding" to kill him. The recent media pronouncement of Sison about the alleged assassination plot and the present handling by Luis Jalandoni of the peace negotiation with the GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] panel all point out to the tendency of the Sison group to pull out from the peace negotiation, Cabardo said. Thus, Sison and Jalandoni are laying the ground work for a graceful exit from the peace process, a face-saving move that would enable Sison to use the alibi of risks to personal security of the NDF [National Democratic Front] panel for his planned pullout. Cabardo warned Sison that his Stalinist design will get him nowhere, as comrades and the masses begin to see through the ruse and realize that the policies and program he is spousing are not for the revolution after all. He ask the pro-Sison comrades to come to terms with reality and recognize that the ideological struggle cannot be resolved in their favor by eliminating the opposition within the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) physically, for many others will later take up the challenge.
