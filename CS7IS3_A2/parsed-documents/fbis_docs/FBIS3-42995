Because strains that destroy such compounds have been only partially described, the researchers here sought to present a complete picture of the genetic control and regulation of the process associated with the decomposition of sulfoaromatic compounds. In studying the genetic control of the decomposition of arylsulfonates in Pseudomonas sp. BS1304, they demonstrated that the process of destruction is controlled by the plasmid pBS1004, which has a molecular weight of 120 kbp and belongs to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. The plasmid can be isolated in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, and P. mendocina. Degradation of the substrates begins with desulfonation and subsequent meta-cleavage of the substituted catechols. Both stages are effected by enzymes with high substrate specificity. The researchers found that the instability of the trait under consideration was associated with the formation of spontaneous deletions in the plasmid. Ultimately, the researchers demonstrated that the formation of such deletions is induced by Rms178 of the IncP-2 incompatibility group. Figures 3, references 13: 1 Russian, 12 Western.
