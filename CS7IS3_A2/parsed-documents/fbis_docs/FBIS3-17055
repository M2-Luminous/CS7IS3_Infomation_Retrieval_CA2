Of these more than sixteen thousand people, 3,390 were granted citizenship under the regular naturalization procedure, and 605, for outstanding merit before the Republic of Estonia. Estonia has established regulations favoring people who registered themselves in 1990-1991 as applicants for the Estonian citizenship with the Congress of Estonia, a parallel parliament set up to stand for the legitimacy of interests and legal continuity of the pre-war Republic of Estonia in the country's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union. A total 12,329 holders of the Congress of Estonia cards, who are not required to pass the language exam or the one-year waiting period after entering the citizenship application, had obtained citizenship by early last month. Also 12,718 ethnic Estonians who were not citizens by birth had been granted citizenship. Ethnic Estonians can obtain citizenship under looser procedure rules. Russian-speakers make up about one-third of Estonia's 1.5 million population. A considerable number of ethnic Russians also are citizens by birth and received citizenship without having to apply for it. Their exact number is not known.
