He said that Russia lost vast sums of money from restrictions on the sale of uranium, aluminium, fertilizer and commercial space launches. In some cases, Mr. Shokhin said, Russia is still considered a communist country with a centrally-controlled economy, although more than half of all Russian enterprises are now in private hands. We have more private enterprises than some other countries, he said. Mr. Shokhin said that this year Russia will revise its entire tax system and may reduce import taxes. The Russian vice-premier said that the Russian Government regarded as its major task the search for non-inflationary methods of containing production decline, which reached 26 per cent during the first four months of the year. According to the vice-premier, the Russian Government is now actively engaged in drafting laws designed to encourage foreign investment. Some of the bills have already been submitted to the Russian parliament. Predicting imminent changes in the investment climate in Russia, Mr. Shokhin urged Russia's foreign partners to co-operate more actively with the new market structures rather than count on the central government guarantees. He reported that Russia would be gradually adopting new forms of investment guarantees, such as mortgage, the sale of products for rubles and guaranteed re- conversion of rubles into hard currency.
