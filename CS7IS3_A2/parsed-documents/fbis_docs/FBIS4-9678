General agreement on human rights 1.1 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala reaffirms its adherence to principles and rules seeking to guarantee and protect full observance of human rights and its political will to ensure they are respected. 1.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will continue to promote all measures designed to promote and improve rules and mechanisms designed to protect human rights. 2. Strengthening institutions charged with protecting human rights 2.1 The parties believe that any behavior that limits, restricts, or jeopardizes duties pertaining to human rights assigned to the judicial branch, Ombudsman for Human Rights, and the Public Prosecutor's Office undermines basic principles of a law-abiding state. Thus, the efforts of such institutions to fulfill such duties must be supported and strengthened. 2.2 As for the judicial branch and the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala reaffirms its willingness to respect their autonomy and to protect the freedom of action for both of them against pressure of any sort or origin to ensure that they fully enjoy the guarantees and instruments that they need to operate efficiently. 2.3 As for the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala will continue to support his work, strengthening his position by supporting his actions and promoting reforms that might be needed to ensure that he will be able to better fulfill his duties and responsibilities. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will support initiatives aimed at improving the technical and material conditions that the Ombudsman for Human Rights might have at his disposal to fulfill his tasks of investigating, overseeing, and following up on the full observance of human rights in Guatemala. 3. Commitment against impunity 3.1 The parties agree that firm action must be adopted against impunity. The government will not promote the adoption of legislative measures or of any sort to prevent the trial and punishment of those found responsible for human rights violations. 3.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will promote, via the legislative branch, necessary legal modifications to the penal code to classify and punish, especially with regard to serious crimes, forceful or involuntary disappearances and summary or extrajudicial executions. The government will also promote, via the international community, the recognition of crimes against humanity, forced and involuntary disappearances, and summary or extrajudicial executions. No special laws [fuero] or exclusive jurisdiction [jurisdiccion privativa] may be used to provide impunity for human rights violations. 4. Commitment to eliminate illegal security groups and clandestine organizations and regulate the bearing of arms 4.1 In order to maintain absolute respect for human rights, illegal groups or clandestine organizations should be dissolved. The Government of the Republic acknowledges its responsibility in fighting any such groups. 4.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala reiterates its commitment to continue purging and professionalizing security organizations. It also acknowledges the need to continue drafting and adopting effective measures to accurately regulate the ownership, bearing, and use of firearms by individuals in accordance with the law. 5. Guarantees of freedom of association and movement 5.1 Both parties agree that the right to free association, movement, and locomotion are human rights recognized internationally and constitutionally which must be exercised in accordance with the law and given full validity in Guatemala. 5.2 The Ombudsman for Human Rights, in the exercise of his duties, will be in charge of verifying if members of the Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense have been forced to join these groups against their will and if they have committed human rights violations. 5.3 The Ombudsman for Human Rights will immediately conduct the necessary investigation of complaints submitted to him. In order to do this, after informing the public that membership in such committees be voluntary and respectful of the law and human rights, consultations will be held with the population to ensure that the will of committee members is expressed freely and without any pressures. 5.4 If transgressions against the volunteer nature of these organizations or the legal order are confirmed, the Ombudsman for Human Rights will adopt those decisions he deems appropriate and will promote the pertinent legal or administrative actions to punish human rights violations. 5.5 The Government of the Republic unilaterally declares that it will not support the organization nor will it arm new Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense nationwide so long as there are no circumstances to motivate these actions. The URNG considers the government's statement as a positive expression of its will to achieve peace and facilitate the objectives of the statement. 5.6 Those affected will approach the municipal mayor, who will convene a public meeting and call on the Ombudsman for Human Rights to verify, through all available means, the volunteer nature as well as the decision of the residents. 5.7 Both parties agree that other aspects of the Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense will be dealt with later, once other points of the general agenda are discussed. 5.8 The parties recognize the educational and informative work carried out by the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office and request that it include information on the content and significance of the current agreement. 6. Military conscription 6.1 Conscription for obligatory military service must not be forced or become an occasion for violation of human rights. Therefore, in keeping with its nature as a civic duty and right, it must be just and nondiscriminatory. 6.2 Toward this end, the Guatemalan Government will continue making the necessary administrative decisions and will promote, as soon as possible and in the spirit of this agreement, a new law on military service. 7. Guarantees and protection of people and groups working to protect human rights 7.1 The parties agree that all actions that might threaten the security of those people or groups that work to promote and protect human rights must be condemned. 7.2 To this end, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala will take special measures to protect the people or organizations that work on human rights. Furthermore, it will opportunely and exhaustively investigate charges surrounding actions or threats that could negatively affect them. 7.3 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala reiterates its commitment to guarantee and effectively protect the work to defend human rights carried out by individuals and organizations. 8 Compensation and/or assistance to victims of human rights violations 8.1 The parties admit it is their humane duty to compensate and/or assist victims of human rights violations. This compensation and/or assistance will be embodied in government measures and civic and socioeconomic programs. Such actions will be accorded priority status and will be addressed to those who social and economic conditions are the most needy. 9 Human rights and the internal armed confrontation 9.1 Until the agreement for a firm and lasting peace is signed, both parties will acknowledge the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of the injured, captured, and those who are not part of the fighting. 9.2 These statements by the parties do not constitute a special agreement in regard to Article 8 (common), Point 2, Paragraph 2, of the 1949 Geneva Convention. International verification by the United Nations 1. The parties reaffirm their decision, included in the 10 January 1994 Framework Agreement, to have all agreements be accompanied by appropriate national and international verification mechanisms. Also, the United Nations will be in charge of the international verification. 2. In this context, the parties agree to ask the UN secretary general to organize a mission to verify the human rights situation and compliance with commitments established in the agreement. The mission will form part of the global verification of the agreement for firm and lasting peace which the parties have agreed to sign as soon as possible this year. 3. The parties acknowledge the importance of national institutions, such as the judicial branch, the Attorney General's Office, and the Ombudsman for Human Rights, which are responsible for the validity, observance, and guarantee of human rights in the country. They especially emphasize the importance of the role of the Ombudsman for Human Rights. 4. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general to establish a Verification Commission, taking the following into account: Functions: 5. The mission will be assigned the following duties in verifying the human rights situation: i. It will receive, assess, and follow up on charges of possible human rights violations. ii. It will check that corresponding national organizations conduct the necessary investigations autonomously and effectively and in accordance to the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala and international human rights norms. iii. It will issue statements on the existence or nonexistence of human rights violations based on the evidence it can obtain in exercising its responsibilities as expressed in Article 10, Subparagraphs i), ii), iii), and iv), and will take into account investigations by the corresponding constitutional institutions. 6. The mission will verify other commitments in the current agreement and will determine the correct compliance of the parties. 7. According to the results of their verification activities, the mission will make recommendations to the parties, especially regarding measures necessary to promoting full observance of human rights and strict compliance with all points in the current agreement. 8. The mission will establish commissions for bilateral dialogue with each of the parties so as to allow comment on the mission's recommendations and thus speed the implementation of the preceding measures. 9. The mission will regularly send reports to the UN secretary general, who will brief this organization's responsible officials. Copies of the reports will be sent to the parties. 10. The mission is authorized to: i) Settle and freely move about the national territory. ii) Freely and privately meet with any person or group of persons for the appropriate fulfillment of its functions. iii) Freely visit, without prior notification and whenever it is considered necessary for the fulfillment of its functions, state agencies as well as URNG camps. iv) Gather the information needed to fulfill its mandate. 11. The mission may address the public through the media to disseminate information in connection with its functions and activities. 12. Within the verification of compliance with human rights, the mission will give special attention to the right to live, personal integrity and safety, individual freedom, the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom to organize, and political rights. 13. When carrying out its functions, the mission will bear in mind the situation of the most vulnerable social groups in society and the people most directly affected by the military conflict (including displaced people, refugees, and returning refugees). 14. The mission's activities will address events and situations that occur after its installation. 15. To implement the general pledge on human rights (Chapter I of this agreement), the parties recognize as human rights those defined by the Guatemalan legal system, including treaties, conventions, and other international instruments on the subject to which Guatemala is a signatory. Cooperation with and support for national human rights organizations 16. The parties agree on the need for international verification to help strengthen permanent constitutional organizations, and other government and nongovernment agencies, for the protection of human rights. In support of them, the verification mission will have the means to: i) Cooperate with national organizations and agencies in all that is necessary for the effective protection and promotion of human rights. It will specifically advocate technical cooperation programs and carry out activities to strengthen government agencies. ii) Offer its support to the judicial branch and auxiliary organizations, the Attorney General's Office, the Ombudsman for Human Rights, and the presidential human rights commission to help perfect and consolidate national organizations for the defense of human rights and an appropriate legal process. iii) Sponsor international technical and financial cooperation required to strengthen the capability of the Ombudsman for Human Rights, and other national institutions and agencies, so that they may execute their functions in the human rights sector. iv) Help develop a culture of respect for human rights in cooperation with the state and the different groups of which society is comprised. Duration and structure of the mission 17. The mission will initially be established for one year; its mandate may be renewed. 18. The verification mission will be led by a chief, appointed by the UN Secretary General. He will have at his disposal international and national officials and experts in various specialties who are necessary to carry out the mission's duties. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the mission will sign the corresponding agreement concerning its headquarters, in accordance with the 1946 Vienna convention on diplomatic privileges and immunities. Putting the international verification mission into operation 19. Taking into consideration their willingness to sponsor human rights in the country and the fact that the current agreement's provisions reflect constitutional rights already included in Guatemalan laws; and considering the international mission's task of strengthening national agencies and entities for the protection of human rights, particularly the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the parties recognize that it is advisable to begin verification of the human rights agreement, on an exceptional basis, before the agreement for a firm and durable peace is signed. 20. Given that the verification mission will begin its operations before the military conflict ends, and given that military operations continue, the mission will coordinate the necessary security measures. 21. The parties agree to immediately ask the UN secretary general to send a preliminary mission as soon as possible so that it may prepare the establishment of a mission within the shortest time possible and in coordination with the parties and to evaluate the financial and technical requirements essential to the verification of the human rights agreement. Cooperation of the parties with the verification commission 22. The parties pledge to offer their fullest support to the mission and, in this regard, are dutybound to provide all the cooperation required to fulfill its functions, particularly in guaranteeing the safety of mission members or people who submit reports or who testify. 23. The international verification carried out by the mission will be done within the framework of this agreement's provisions. Any situation which arises in connection with the scope of this agreement will be settled through talks, as foreseen in Number 8. Final provisions First: This agreement will become effective on the date it is signed by the two parties. Second: This agreement will be part of the agreement for a firm and durable peace. Third: A copy of this agreement will be sent by the parties to the UN secretary general and the Ombudsman for Human Rights.
