Speaking before journalists at the United Nations, Dr. Bukoshi said: "We call upon the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and Russia to comprehensively include Kosova in the peace process, because without the solution of Kosova issue there will be no peace in Balkans." Prime Minister Bukoshi, who is conducting a three-day visit to the United States, the United Nations, and Washington respectfully [as published] once again called high and decision-making officials not to ignore the explosive situation in Kosova and take preventive steps before it gets too late. He also said that: "During this month, army movements have intensified, and the number of Serbian soldiers to Kosova has increased. The situation has deteriorated especially since the Serbian paramilitary kill Albanian civilians in cold blood," said Dr. Bukoshi, and illustrated it with the latest killings in Hani i Ezit and Fusche Kosova. Dr. Bukoshi warned that the peaceful policy of the Kosova Government could lose credibility among the Albanian population, and said that "this peaceful stand could be used by Belgrade's authorities to intensify their repression. Whereas, peaceful movement of Albanians could be the reason for neglecting the Kosova situation by the international community." "These alarming trends threaten to stop all the progress toward peace in Kosova," said Bukoshi, and added that while Serbs in Knin and Bosnia are on the verge of achieving their territorial aspirations through violence and aggression, Albanians in Kosova and Macedonia are facing mounting misery only because of their peaceful determination. "Our main purpose is to prevent war in Kosova, and as far as our political project is concerned, we had declared our will through the referendum. Kosova fulfills all the conditions to be an independent state, similar to other republics of former Yugoslavia. Kosova is a rich region and has a sufficient human potential. We are not asking to unite with Albania and this is the biggest compromise we are offering. We are not asking for the change of borders through the use of force," answered Dr. Bukoshi to the question whether they considered the unification with Albania. Asked whether he was requestion a deployment of peace-keeping troops to Kosova, similar to those in Macedonia, Prime Minister Bukoshi said: "The best example of preventive measures by the international community is The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. A civilian-military government under the auspices of the United Nations for a certain interim period until normalization of life would be the best possible solution. Within this framework, demilitarization of Kosova should take place, and removal of all paramilitary forces, establishment of democratic institutions, such as parliament, government and public life."
