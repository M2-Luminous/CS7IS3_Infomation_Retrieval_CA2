Kukevich video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] This event is significant not only for the Amur Oblast residents, but for all of the state. Up till now, there was not a single border marker at the eastern Russian-Chinese border, neither at a land nor a river zone. Today, we are adopting a practice of organizing state borders that is generally accepted in the world. [Video shows interview with A. G. Laskov, chief of demarcation group No. 5] [Begin Laskov recording] There are two demarcation groups working in our oblast -- Nos. 4 and 5. I can also say that the length of the border on the Amur Oblast territory is 1,281 km. The demarcation working groups, which are part of the commission, started field work in early May last year. We were preparing foundations for border markers, and determined their topographic coordinates. Now, the new stage is erecting the border markers. Overall, our group will erect 48 border markers in Amur Oblast, and group No. 4 will erect 50. In other words, 98 border markers are to be erected in 1994-95. The hydrographers group will determine the location of the main fairway. Appropriate documents are being drafted on all of these points, and the end result of our work is a protocol describing the location of the state border line. After this work is concluded, the border with China will be as in the rest of the civilized world. [end recording]
