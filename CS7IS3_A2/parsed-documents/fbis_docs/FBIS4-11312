Garcia] [Text] Havana 23 Apr (PL) -- Miami resident Magda Montiel is happy to know that many of the emigrants attending a meeting with the Cuban authorities have put aside their arrogance, which is a result of defeats, and are thinking of the welfare of their country. Montiel, a former congressional candidate for the State of Florida, and 209 other emigrants are attending "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference under way in Havana. According to Montiel, this conference, which she describes as a "reencounter with the homeland," is a very important step that has been very well accepted by the Cuban community living abroad, including those who once decided to invade the island or were members of terrorist groups. Montiel believes the fact that mercenaries, who were part of the foiled Bay of Pigs invasions in 1961, are now willing to talk with the same government they tried to overthrow 30 years ago is very important and will be remembered and written about in the pages of history. In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Montiel said that for days prior to the conference the television stations as well as the newspapers talked about the conference and tried to play down its importance. Montiel added that there were even people who invented and spread rumors that Fidel Castro was sick. Montiel recalled that self-appointed Cuban President Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the ultrarightist Cuban-American National Foundation (FNCA), has appointed a cabinet and announced the creation of an emergency junta "to be prepared for any action." The Cuban emigrant added that in the past few days she has seen Mas Canosa more scared and angry than usual, especially when his distorted features are picked up by the television cameras saying: "Let Castro's friends go to Cuba to eat lobsters." According to Montiel, defeated in the elections by Liliana Ross Lethinen, an ultrarightist and a FNCA protegee, "the United States and the Cubans living abroad do not have the right to dictate what should happen in Cuba; that is up to those who live on the island." I believe changes must be made on the island because of the severe economic crisis the country is confronting. Even the government admits this. But these changes must be made in accordance to the needs of the people and those who lead them, Montiel added. Regarding another kind of change, Montiel said that if the Cubans did not want their president, he would not be in power because "our people's spirit of rebellion does not accept impositions." On the need to respect the sovereignty of the nation, Montiel said that "we must let the Cubans in Cuba solve their problems, and, if necessary, we who are outside should support them as neighbors should." Montiel opposes a return to the Cuba of the past. The Cuban emigrant recalled her happy and fortunate childhood in the Nuevo Vedado neighborhood in Havana where Santa Claus visited her and brought her lots of toys while other children were shoeless and did not even have milk to drink. I did not see the Mafia or the corruption prior to 1959, but my parents did, and I know it existed even though there are some who refuse to admit it, Montiel added. According to Montiel, the ultra rightists think of yesterday's Cuba (before the Revolution) as a paradise where everything was rose-colored; but today, she added, it is a sin to admit the achievements of the Revolution. Montiel added that she left the country when she was eight years old and that it was very difficult to leave her home, her grandmother, her friends, and the way she lived in Cuba to go to Miami where everything was different, where one lives in constant fear of having one's children stolen, even at the airport or at a shopping center. Montiel, a well-known lawyer, has her law practice in Miami and is currently a member of the Cuban Committee for Democracy (CCD), even though she does not share many of the ideas of the organization. When asked about the elections in which she ran against Ross Lethinen for a seat in the U.S. Congress, Montiel said that had she won she would have shown the rest of the U.S. Congressmen that not all Cuban emigrants think like those who support a U.S. blockade.
