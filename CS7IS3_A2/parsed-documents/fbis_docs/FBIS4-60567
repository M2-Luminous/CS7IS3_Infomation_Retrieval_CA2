He described the decision as "foolish." He stressed that he had turned down an offer from al-Bid to hold the post of deputy chairman of the presidential council in the "Democratic Republic of Yemen." [passage omitted] 'Ali Nasir said that he had requested al-Bid to "abandon the decision to secede and to return to dialogue" with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, "because secession will not solve the problem." [passage omitted] 'Ali Nasir still believes that the "Pledge and Accord Document" signed in Amman in February "represents a base for solving all problems and contains comprehensive solutions to the crisis." He added that my return to Yemen "in these conditions is not my current concern. My concern is to bring an end to the fighting."
