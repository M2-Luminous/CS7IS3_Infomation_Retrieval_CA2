In an interview with the French daily LE FIGARO, Mr. Sekkat indicated that the speeding up of privatization at the end of 1993 paved the way for a resumption of foreign investments, which amounted to $500 million (one-fourth of which was used to acquire equity in privatized companies), compared with $460 million in 1992. This is the equivalent of 5.029 billion dirhams, reflecting a "still more spectacular" 15.9-percent increase, according to the central bank governor. To reinforce this trend, Mr. Sekkat said, the Al-Maghrib Bank set up an Investment Impetus and Follow-Up Committee comprising the directors of the seven leading Moroccan bank; their objective is to "solve problems" that may crop up either when projects are being worked out--"financial engineering is not always up to what investors would expect"--or when applying for the various local, regional, and other permits. The Al-Maghrib Bank governor also expects growth to improve as a result of adequate rainfall, if it keeps up "at least until the end of March." "If that is the case, growth might range between 7.5 and 10 percent." Mr. Sekkat also mentioned a projected reduction of the budget deficit to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, which will enable the Treasury to make "less extensive use" of bank financing and thus "promote a rollback" of interest rates. As for foreign-currency reserves, they increased by $300 million in 1993, to $3.8 billion, the Al-Maghrib Bank governor also indicated.
