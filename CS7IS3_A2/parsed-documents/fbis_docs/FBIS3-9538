FBIS3-9538 "dreeu058__a94012" FBIS-EEU-94-058-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic CTK Explains New Amendment to Employment Law AU2303181094 Prague CTK in English 1503 GMT 23 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2303181094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- The Chamber of Deputies today passed the government-proposed amendment to the Employment Law, with changes as made in the joint report of the parliamentary committees. Parliament did not approve any of the changes proposed by opposition deputies during yesterday's debate. Deputies of the government coalition parties, the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS) and independent deputy Josef Jezek, a former deputy of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) voted for the government draft amendment. Opposition deputies did not support the amendment -- they either were not present or voted against it. Deputies present from the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Liberal Social Union (LSU) and independent deputy Ladislav Rymes voted against the amendment. Members of the deputies' groups of the Left Bloc (LB), Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), Movement for Self-Governing Democracy-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS), Czech-Moravian Central Party (CMSS) and Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) abstained from voting. Neither a proposal by Petra Buskova (CSSD) that a provision banning women's employment at night be excluded from the Labor Law nor changes reflecting trade unions' stand proposed by Deputy Hana Orgonikova from the LSU were approved by parliament. According to the amended Labor Law, employment legislation will concern all types of employers equally -- be they physical or legal persons. Up to now terms and conditions of employment between an employee and an employer who is a legal person were set down by the labor law, those between an employee and an employer who is a physical person by government regulations. The amended law transfers the decision-making concerning overtime work from ministries to employment offices. The amendment says that at places where no trade union is active, an employer can provide his employees advantages similar to that set down in a collective agreement (concluded between an employer and a trade union). The new labor law makes provision for the future change in the system of accident insurance by abolishing of the existing compensation limits for the loss of income of persons who lose their work capability due to accidents at work or diseases ensuing from the nature of employment. The pensions these people receive will rise with the growth of the average salary.
