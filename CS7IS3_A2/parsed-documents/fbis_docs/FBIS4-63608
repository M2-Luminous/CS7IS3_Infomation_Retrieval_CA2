The setting for this will be a conference in the headquarters of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] with Russian counterintelligence leaders. Informed sources, in giving this information, noted that, in the event that the results of the conference require any modifications to this document, which has already been agreed in principle, the signing will be postponed. Let us recall that the president visited Foreign Intelligence Service headquarters some weeks ago. However, no conceptual documents similar to those which have been prepared for the conference in the FCS and which would have defined Russia's [foreign] intelligence doctrine were elaborated for that meeting. At the same time, the sources stressed, in his speech to intelligence workers and in his more private talk with the Foreign Intelligence Service leadership, Boris Yeltsin posed a number of fundamental questions -- including on the subject of cadres -- the essence and details of which are not yet being made public, but which could also be interpreted as defining some of the key guidelines of a possible [foreign] intelligence doctrine. The sources do not rule out that the counterintelligence doctrine, if it is signed by the president, will be made public, albeit with a number of cuts.
