FR940317-1-00038 FR940317-1-00011 Included in the recovery of the unpaid fee will be the assessment of interest on the debt due, penalty for nonpayment and the full cost incurred by the Federal government in the collection process. See 31 U.S.C. 3717. Explanation of Regulatory Fee Categories 37. An explanation of regulatory fee categories is contained in the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and is based on the categories established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in section 9(g) of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). Where regulatory fee categories from the schedule need additional interpretation or clarification, we have relied on the legislative history of section 9 and our own experience in establishing and regulating the various services. 1. Private Radio Bureau 38. The two levels of statutory fees for Private Radio services, exclusive use service and shared use services, were established on the basis that those licensees who generally receive a higher quality communications channel, due to exclusive or lightly shared frequency assignments, will pay a higher fee than those who share marginal quality channels. In addition, as noted above, because of the relatively small annual fee amounts in the Private Radio Services, applicants for a new license, reinstatement and renewal will be required to pay a regulatory fee covering an entire license term, with only a percentage of all licensees paying a regulatory fee in any one year. Applications for modification or assignment of an existing authorization do not require payment of a regulatory fee. The expiration date of these authorizations will not reflect a new license term when either modifications or assignments are processed. In an effort to reduce public confusion, the Commission has provided separate lockbox addresses for these applications. 2. Mass Media Bureau 39. Television stations. As discussed above, we propose to allow installment payments for regulatory fees if a television licensee's annual fee exceeds $12,000. We propose that this amount be deemed large because it greatly exceeds the estimated average regulatory fee obligations to be incurred by most other television licensees. Specifically, according to our estimates, the 551 commercial VHF television licensees will pay an average fee of $8,826. Most VHF licensees (379, or 69 percent) will pay $8,000 or under in fiscal year 1994 and only 18.5 percent of VHF licensees will be asked to pay over $12,000. Similarly, under the statutory schedule 561 commercial UHF television licensees will pay an average fee of $8,294. The vast majority of UHF licensees (406, or 72 percent) will pay under $10,000 in fiscal year 1994 and only 27.63 percent of UHF licensees will be asked to pay over $12,000. Thus, we tentatively conclude that television licensees subject to a regulatory fee above $12,000 will be automatically eligible to make two equal installment payments, subject to additional administrative and interest charges. 40. In determining a TV station's market rank, the Commission has traditionally relied on the Arbitron Company's publication ``Television Markets and Ranking Guide.'' See, e.q, 47 CFR §§73.658(k) note 1 (prime-time access rule). We note, however, that Arbitron has recently announced that it will no longer provide television ratings services. See Cooper, Arbitron Drops Local TV and Cable Ratings, Broadcasting & Cable, Oct. 25, 1993, at 45. Thus, we seek comment on whether we should rely on the latest Arbitron publication's rankings which would be placed in our rules (see, e.q. , 47 CFR 76.51 (major television markets)), or should we use some other source (such a A.C. Nielsen) to determine a television station's market ranking reach year for purposes of assessing regulatory fees. In this regard, we tentatively conclude that we will need to rely on the most recent market rankings to assess fees each fiscal year because a static list in our rules may become outdated after a few years. Thus, any changes in market rankings may affect regulatory fee amounts for the following fiscal year.
