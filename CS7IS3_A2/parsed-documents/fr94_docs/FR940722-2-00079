Castleton T. 25 S., R. 23 E., (5.00 acres) Section 25, N1/2SW1/4NW1/4NE1/4. The existing plan does not identify these lands for disposal. However, expressions of interest have been received from Grand County and members of the public that appear to have merit and the disposal of which may be in the public interest. Therefore, they will be considered through the plan amendment process. General issues to be addressed in the amendment include impacts of the proposed disposals to livestock forage, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, visual resources, and public safety. Site-specific environmental assessments will be prepared at such time that a specific disposal is being considered. Dated: June 30, 1994. G. William Lamb, Acting State Director.
