He had given the party leadership to her through this letter. Her father had given Benazir advice about policy. Mr. Bhutto had written: "Since the slogans of days past are like old songs, they lost their quality of ravishing one's heart. Therefore, new slogans should be raised in each era; however, the principles should not be changed." The Central Committee of the PPP elected Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as chairperson of the party instead of Begum Nusrat Bhutto and followed late Bhutto's 1978 decision. Rejecting this action, taken after 15 years, Begum Nusrat Bhutto said that the party's Central Committee had made her chairperson for life when the Supreme Court had rejected her late husband's request for bail. The kind mother of the prime minister said that no one else could become the chairperson or chairman of the party as long as she was alive. The Central Committee's resolution to appoint the new person to this position on 5 December 1993 was unconstitutional and illegal. In light of the stand Begum Nusrat Bhutto's has taken, we can say that, if the mother and daughter did not make up their differences, the PPP will remain in two camps, and the daughter will have to compete against the mother. After Mr. Bhutto was hanged, Benazir Bhutto spent some time in jails, and was released on condition that she would leave the country. In 1986 she was not only given permission to return to Pakistan, but to participate in politics. The Americans had gotten assurance from then-Pakistani rulers that Benazir Bhutto would not be arrested, all possible arrangements would be made for her safety, and no restriction would be imposed on her public meetings and rallies. In 1986 she became the joint chairperson of her father's party. Her mother had agreed to her getting this new position in the party. Nusrat Bhutto was happy that her talented daughter with her high-level education, unique intelligence, and courage was successfully reinstating the popularity of the PPP. The mother, in her joy, had given her daughter free hand to run party affairs. After marrying Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, there some changes appeared in Madam Bhutto's policies that worried some senior party leaders. The mother began to get new complaints about her daughter's attitude almost daily. It is said that these complaints were not removed despite Begum Bhutto's efforts. As a result, many old associates of the late Mr. Bhutto began to leave the party one by one. Madam Bhutto had no regrets at losing her political uncles because she felt that these alleged uncles had not made any serious efforts to save her father from hanging. In addition to her personal feelings, the late Ziaul Haq's supporting lobby had also effectively spread the rumors that some of these senior leaders had advised in favor of hanging Bhutto. According to Zia's lobby, some of these wanted to avenge Mr. Bhutto for his contemptuous attitude. Some of them were hoping that the leadership of the PPP would turn to them once the candle of Mr. Bhutto's life was extinguished. When these deluded leaders were disappointed, they not only said goodbye to the PPP but began to sow seeds of distrust in the mind of exiled brother Murtaza Bhutto against his sister and the brother-in-law. Murtaza Bhutto was told that Asif Zardari was trying to take over his ancestral rights and that Zardari's hold on the PPP affairs was also tightening. It is said that some officials of one of the Pakistani intelligence service were involved in efforts to persuade Murtaza to act against his sister. Murtaza Bhutto became very eager to return home. When Madam Bhutto became the prime minister, Nusrat Bhutto insisted that arrangements should be made for Murtaza Bhutto's return. When this was not done, both mother and the son had the misunderstanding that the prime minister did not want Murtaza Bhutto to return. When he returned, his arrest naturally was very unpleasant to his mother. Murtaza Bhutto was brought into the election arena and when he competed against PPP-nominated candidates, his mother openly supported him. Subordinates told the prime minister and her husband that Nusrat Bhutto and her son had started plans to take over the PPP. A plan to remove this danger was made. According to it the honorable mother was to be removed from the party chairperson's position, and a joint chairperson was to take over all responsibilities. This plan was approved and for simple display or out of respect the daughter appealed to the mother to relinquish the highest position of the party and become the chief patron. This appeal was rejected. Murtaza Bhutto's associates requested Begum Nusrat Bhutto to be adamant and declare that she was the permanent PPP chairperson. Begum Nusrat accepted the advice of her son's political advisors and supporters. The party well-wishers who were upset at this mother-daughter conflict and who do not want the party to divide into two groups joined forces and decided to persuade Benazir Bhutto to meet with Nusrat Bhutto along with Asif Zardari and find a way to make her change her mind. It was decided that Murtaza Bhutto's cooperation was necessary for this effort. Thus, the prime minister is to be advised to start negotiations with her dear brother, and if necessary go visit him in jail. The party well-wishers feel that arrangements should be made to get Murtaza released on bail immediately and that efforts be made to take back all the cases against him in order to improve Nusrat and Murtaza Bhutto's mood. Former National Assembly Speaker Ma'raj Khalid, who is considered one of the party founders, is very active in these reconciliatory efforts. Ma'raj Khalid maintains that there are examples of recalling cases based on serious crimes when the greater national interest was involved. The present situation demands that political stability be established in Sindh. To attain this important national goal the present PPP government should not hesitate in taking the cases against Mir Murtaza Bhutto and MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader Iltaf Hussein. In this context if President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto use their special privileges, all perceptive Pakistanis who know the need for political action to improve the situation in Sindh will be relieved. The opponents of the PPP have a different opinion about the conflict between Nusrat Bhutto and her daughter. The Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leaders declare it a major political drama to give the opposition the message not to start a campaign against Benazir's government. They should respect the prime minister's pro-federal politics and support her decisions on sensitive issues; otherwise, the extremist elements in Sindh might raise their head with full force. If we consider the point expressed by the Muslim League (N) observers to be wrong and dismiss this theory of staging drama, we still have to admit that it is necessary that the PPP leadership remains in Benazir's hands to strengthen Sindh's allegiance to the nation. Her position in Sindh should not become weaker, and the new efforts of cooperating between the MQM and the PPP should be successful. If the division within the PPP is not stopped and if it does not establish stable relations with the MQM, then deployment of soldiers for a long time in Sindh will become a necessity. Such measures will affect Sindh's developmental plans. As Sindhis feel the pinch of deprivation of basic amenities, the question about where aid from the central government to Sindh goes will arise painfully. It should be remembered that Sindh provides 60 percent of the central government's total revenue. Therefore, we can say that the welfare of Pakistan depends on Sindh's staying within Pakistan and on the fact that the anti-national and separatist elements do not flourish in the nerve center of this state, Karachi. The MQM representatives, while discussing the neglect of Karachi residents' basic needs and the result of this neglect, have advised prominent national leaders to establish a separate task force to study Karachi's economic problems and find solutions for them. This task force should be composed of representatives from the PPP, MQM, industrial organizations, commerce groups, and labor unions and should be asked to present its report within two months. This report should identify the problems and also suggest ways and means to resolve these problems. Sindh had to spend about 2.5 billion rupees for the military operation last year. One Sindhi senator had appealed to the president, the prime minister, defense minister, and the high command of the armed forces against these charges. He asks what reasons there are for charging additional money for the Pakistani military service when it is doing its duty within Pakistan? According to the constitution, it is the duty of the Army to help the civilian government when need arises. The question raised by a Senate member is not the only one which needs attention, several questions related to defense expenses need be answered. The National Assembly does not have the constitutional right to audit defense expenses. At the same time, the feeling is becoming common that the fundamental reason for our nation's backwardness is the fact that our defense expenses are much more than our resources. After increasing our foreign debt to meet defense needs, the money left for meeting our people's basic needs is nominal. Governments increase taxes without reason to make up their monetary shortages. This sends the price of commodities up. As a result people with limited income are suffering. The number of psychological patients is increasing daily, the increase in crime and accident is ruining the society's piece of mind, and the rate of illiteracy is touching new heights. According to a recent report issued by the education ministry, there are 121 countries in the world with very low literacy rates. Pakistan's position is 111 in that list. In other words, only 10 other countries have higher illiteracy rates than that of Pakistan. The situation in the area of food is so bad that we have to import wheat, pulses, and edible oils. The scarcity of electricity has forced us into the problem of load shedding. The nation was told on the television last week that we will need at least 60 billion rupees to enable us to generate enough electricity to meet our needs. Even when we get this huge amount, we still will have to wait a few years to get rid of the practice of load shedding. The spokesmen for the federal finance ministry are telling us the good news that the amount of our foreign exchange reserve has increased. However, they do not tell us how much foreign exchange will be left after the interest and the next installments of foreign debts are paid. It is not clear how we will repay the foreign exchange deposited by private individuals spent by our government. Instead of keeping the Pakistani people in the dark, it would be better to admit openly that our country is going through a serious economic crisis. In order to get out of it, we must change our foreign policy in such a way that our geographical borders are secure and we do not have to purchase new weapons costing us tens of millions of dollars, that the military and economic aid now suspended is reinstated, and that foreign investment in our country on large scale becomes a reality.
