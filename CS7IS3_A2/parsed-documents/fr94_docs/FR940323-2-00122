FR940323-2-00122 FR940323-2-00094 Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in United States v. New Waterbury, Ltd., et al., Civil Action No. 91CV00688 (WWE), was lodged on March 1, 1994 with the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The consent decree resolves an action based on violations which occurred at the New Waterbury industrial facility located at 59 Mill Street in Waterbury, Connecticut (``facility''). The facility is approximately 100 buildings on 100 acres in downtown Waterbury, Connecticut and was used for years in the manufacture of brass and copper products. New Waterbury, Ltd., a real estate development limited partnership, acquired the manufacturing facility in 1987 from the former Century Brass Products, Inc. Settling defendants are storing PCB equipment and drums of PCB waste in a building that does not comply with the structural requirements for PCB storage areas established by 40 CFR 761.65(b) (it lacks an adequate roof and walls to prevent contact with rain water, adequate spill containment, and surfaces impervious to PCB penetration). Until the filing of the complaint settling defendants had not been conducting monthly leak inspections as required by 40 CFR 761.65(c)(5). The PCB equipment and waste drums have been stored at the facility since before 1987, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(a). In addition, settling defendants are operating a commercial PCB storage facility without having applied for and received Region I approval, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(d). Pursuant to this proposed consent decree, settling defendants will remove and properly dispose of all PCB equipment and PCB waste by August 15, 1995. Settling defendants will also clean up any spills of PCBs derived from the storage of PCB equipment and PCB waste. The cost of PCB removal and disposal under the consent decree is estimated at nearly $500,000. Pending proper disposal, settling defendants will provide and maintain adequate temporary storage measures to prevent and contain PCB leaks and minimize the risks of fire and vandalism, will keep proper records on the stored PCBs, and will report monthly to EPA. The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to United States v. New Waterbury, Ltd., et al., DOJ Ref. # 90&hyph;5&hyph;1&hyph;1&hyph;3713. The proposed consent decree may be examined at the office of the United States Attorney, 141 Church Street, New Haven, Connecticut; the Region I Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 1 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 624&hyph;0892. A copy of the proposed consent decree may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005.

Cruden, Chief, Environmental Enforcement Section, Environment and Natural Resources Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6728 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;01&hyph;M
