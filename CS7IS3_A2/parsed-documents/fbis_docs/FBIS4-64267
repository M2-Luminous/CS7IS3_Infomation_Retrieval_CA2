Yet, things seem to be clear now. Roman Herzog can get ready to move to Berlin. After the Free Democratic Party [FDP] promised to continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and after recent statements from among FDP ranks, it is as good as certain that the CDU candidate will be elected as successor to Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker on 23 May. Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau has hardly any hope. Even Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP group, has recognized the signs of the time. At his party's land congress he was reelected, but punished with a humiliating score as a result of his open sympathy for the SPD candidate. He announced that he would give in to the FDP majority and, if necessary, even against his own conviction, vote for the CDU man. So the chances for Herzog are excellent. In the Federal Assembly, which will elect the head of state on 23 May in Berlin, the majority situation is obvious. The CDU/CSU is by far the strongest group. Of the 1,324 delegates, half of which will be nominated by the Bundestag and half by the laender, the CDU and CSU alone can count on 619 votes, thus only being 44 votes short of the absolute majority. The SPD has to rely on the help of others. Even if Jens Reich, former GDR civil rights activist, were to withdraw his candidacy after the initial rounds of votes, and if all members of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] and the Alliance 90/Greens were then to vote for Rau, the SPD would still have to be backed by a majority of the FDP for the victory of its candidate. Yet, at the moment very little speaks for this. After all, it has been said that there is agreement within the FDP to strictly follow the party's recommendation in the Federal Assembly. A split in the party is not likely. Nobody in Bonn expects the FDP to vote for Rau, thus risking a major dispute with the CDU in the coalition only a few months before the Bundestag election, considering its intention to continue to stay in power after 16 October in Bonn along with the CDU/CSU. After all, the majority of the 111 FDP members in the Federal Assembly, 78, come from the Bundestag group, where the atmosphere is clearly in favor of the CDU candidate. So Herzog is going to make it. What is also clear is that the FDP will do everything to prove how independent and indispensable it is. "The FDP decides on who will become federal president -- nobody else," was the slogan Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, proclaimed with self-assurance: "The FDP is once more in its favorite role of being able to tip the scales." This is why the final decision should not be made before the individual ballots. Apart from the support for Herzog, the FDP parliamentarians will discuss a second alternative, which is considered by FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer as "absolutely plausible": The FDP's own candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher would not only run in the first two ballots, which require an absolute majority, but also in the decisive third round, in which a simple majority will suffice. Even then, the FDP would indirectly support the CDU/CSU without having to openly back the candidate that does not have a great popular appeal: The SPD would then lack the necessary votes; the CDU/CSU could ensure the victory of its man with its relative majority -- peace in the coalition would be saved; and the FDP could celebrate itself as an independent, decisive force. However, there are still some imponderabilities. Within the CDU/CSU support for Herzog is not quite that undivided. There are reservations among deputies from eastern Germany against the conservative candidate from the west. Saxon Environment Minister Arnold Vaatz would rather vote for eastern contender Reich. Yet the FDP has made its behavior dependent on the solidarity of the CDU/CSU. Things might become unpleasant if Republikaner Chairman Schoenhuber were to commit his partisans to Herzog. Should Herzog then come off with only a narrow lead, he would have to step down because he said he would not be made president with the decisive votes of the Republikaner. The Social Democrats might also thwart the CDU's plans. If, after the first two ballots, they were to decide to withdraw the candidacy of Rau in favor of the highly appreciated social-liberal Hamm-Bruecher, the FDP would be maneuvered into a most embarrassing situation. If it were then still to vote in favor of Herzog, it would let down its own candidate. Yet, if it were to stick to Hamm-Bruecher, the FRG would get its first female president -- and the sensation would be perfect.
