The U.S. President Has Quite a Lot of Things To Do in Europe -- Beginning With Deciding Whether To Open the Doors to NATO Membership for All Who Want To Enter and Ending With an Impromptu Meeting With the Ukrainian President"] [Text] Moscow -- The special booklet carefully produced in Washington for those members of the U.S. press bound for the summit meeting in Moscow points out that Russia is a cold country where survival in winter is hard and where furthermore crime is to be feared and rides in "private taxis" are to be avoided. Among the plus points it lists "the likelihood of moderate prices for souvenirs if you pay in dollars." I would dispute that point: Prices in Moscow today, both in general and in particular, have outstripped those in America, despite the fact that the country is falling apart before our very eyes. The present meeting between the two leaders is a jubilee one, the 25th since Khrushchev's time. But in terms of meetings between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, it is the second and is surely once more akin to a "leap into the unknown." In Vancouver their discussion took place on the eve of the April referendum after a week of feverish thought in Washington about whether there was any point in meeting "on the eve of uncertainty." The situation is also quite tricky after the December elections in Russia. I am bound to agree with Brent Scowcroft, Bush's former national security adviser, who remarked that if this visit had not been planned long ago Clinton would surely not now have wanted to make the trip but would have waited for the dust to settle and for relations between Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy to become clear. As for Vladimir Volfovich, the U.S. President has already decided not to meet with him for the moment, although during the visit he may demonstrate his sympathies for reformers not only of the pro-Yeltsin type. Meanwhile during the visit the U.S. President will clearly have to try to convince his own fellow countrymen that, even if America does not have a clear concept of its relations with Russia today, it is at least working on one. That criticism has been expressed increasingly loudly lately, along with barbs aimed at the secretary of state, who is increasingly loudly being called "sluggish" and "irresolute" in the United States. Meanwhile the accusations that the U.S. Administration's course is unclear are being countered by the thesis that it is not only America but also international financial institutions which should respond more clearly and promptly to the social reforms in Russia -- in the sense of providing Western aid. On the subject of Western aid, Russia has so far not received even the amount that it was promised. For example, the $5.5 billion which the IMF proposed giving us is still in doubt. Since 1992 Russia has received $2.5 billion. The rest will be paid only if the IMF considers that we will fulfill the agreed conditions. Clinton's team believes that this is right, while at the IMF the rate of inflation and the imbalance in the money system are giving rise to definite doubts. In this connection two IMF missions will come to Russia to work in January. If they believe that the government does have concrete and durable remedies for stabilizing the economy they will "release" a further $1.5 billion to us and will make recommendations on social aid to citizens who have suffered during the economic reforms. According to information in BUSINESS WEEK, the U.S. President is considering offering his Russian counterpart a further $1 billion for items of expenditure in the new budget in 1994. He will also focus attention on the theme of creating a social safety net in Russia -- I do not rule out the possibility of technical assistance in elaborating it -- relating to a system of unemployment benefits, food subsidies, and so forth. During the visit there will probably be an announcement of a joint Russian-U.S. project aimed at prospecting and opening up oil fields in West Siberia and on Sakhalin. U.S. oil and gas companies are planning to set aside $3.4 billion for this purpose -- meanwhile U.S. investments in Russia stand at $400 million today. I would recall here that the two presidents will also give their formal blessing to a whole series of agreements concluded in Moscow during U.S. Vice President Gore's visit -- agreements on space, on ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors, and on new norms for foreign investments. The U.S. President will spend four hours in Minsk -- as a mark of gratitude for Belarus' constructive stance on the question of scrapping nuclear missiles. As for a meeting with the Ukrainian leader, after rumors that Clinton had invited him to Moscow earlier than Yeltsin a statement was made on an agreement to hold a meeting of the three presidents in Moscow. On 12 December the U.S. visitor will probably stop off at [Kiev's] "Borispol" airport. The U.S. first lady and her daughter will join the President on Friday after spending a few days in Europe. Here is one more fact: Several days ago, before New Year, the U.S. President visited his native state of Arkansas and with a laugh showed the whole country the "family" shorts given to him for his morning jog by the people of his state. Last Thursday Bill Clinton had to return to his home state, unfortunately for a very solemn occasion -- in connection with the death of his mother. But one of the drawbacks to the President's work is that even personal tragedies do not cause state visits to be canceled.
