On 15 January, the provincial party committee and the provincial government cosponsored a forum to explore new ways for enlivening state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and solving the problems in these aspects. Eleven examples, including Liaoyuan (Jiancheng) machinery plant, the Jilin chemical fiber corporation, the Hunchun gold mine, and the Jilin (Fengyuan) cement plant, introduced their experience in reforming the wage system and the property right system, developing various forms of management system, optimizing the industrial structure and the product mix, and accepting the challenges on domestic and international markets. Provincial Leaders He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Wang Jinshan, Liu Xilin, Feng Ximing, Liu Yazhi, and Wang Guofa conscientiously heard the speeches made by these examples. Present at the forum were vice mayors of the city, prefectural, and autonomous prefectural governments in charge of the industrial work; chairmen of the city, prefectural, and autonomous prefectural planning and economic commissions and restructuring commissions; directors and managers of the units that introduced their experience at the forum and relevant enterprises; and responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments concerned.
