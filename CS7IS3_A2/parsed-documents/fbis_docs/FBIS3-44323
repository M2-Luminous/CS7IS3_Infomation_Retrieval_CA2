What impact will the new tax systems have on foreign- invested enterprises and a new round of foreign investments in China? With this question in mind, this reporter has interviewed Li Lijun, head of the Fujian provincial taxation bureau. Foreign Businessmen Will Not Suffer Losses Li Lijun categorically told this reporter: The new tax systems, which will be implemented as of 1 January, will affect neither the interests of foreign-funded enterprises nor the enthusiasm of foreign investors. On the contrary, they will enable foreign-funded enterprises and foreign investors to get better returns. He said: The tax reform will place the taxes of domestic enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises on an equal basis and the same starting line. In this way, all enterprises will be able to compete on an equal basis in the market economy. Prior to this, the taxes of foreign-funded enterprises in China were the industrial and commercial unified tax and the income tax of foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises; after the tax reform, the industrial and commercial unified taxes will be turned into value- added, business, and consumption taxes. They will pay the same taxes as domestic enterprises now. Naturally, the tax reform will have a certain impact on foreign enterprises. If the original industrial and commercial unified tax is lower than the new taxes, foreign enterprises will certainly have to pay more if they should pay according to the new taxes; conversely, there will be no effect on them. For this reason, the state taxation department has also provided that, while implementing the new tax systems, we can give a tax refund. That is to say, foreign enterprises which have to pay higher taxes according to the new tax systems than they formerly did do are allowed to have a tax refund to ensure that their new taxes equal the previous ones and to guarantee that they will not suffer losses. With regard to those foreign enterprises which pay higher taxes than the new ones, they should pay according to the new tax systems. Li Lijun said: To implement the new tax systems, the Fujian taxation departments have conducted a lot of investigation and study. They have also worked among foreign enterprises to enable each of them to have a full understanding of the new tax systems and thus remove their worries. Viewed from the present conditions, all foreign enterprises understand the new tax systems and take the initiative to cooperate with us so that the tax reform has made smooth progress. The High Science and Technology Industry Tax Will Drop Li also pointed out that the foreign enterprises mentioned above refer to those approved before 1 January 1994. Those approved after that date must pay according to the new tax systems. These foreign enterprises will be treated equally without discrimination like domestic enterprises. Therefore, when investing in a project and carrying out a feasibility study, foreign businessmen should take this factor into consideration. The Fujian provincial taxation departments have compared the new tax burdens of foreign enterprises in Fujian with their original tax level. The result is: In industry, the overall tax level of the new tax systems is lower than that of the old tax systems by 27.9 percent; in high science and technology industry, it is also lower; in electronics, textile, garment, furniture, cosmetics, drink, trade, transport and communications, it has risen on the average. It can thus be seen that if foreign businessmen invest in Fujian according to the state industrial policy and rationally choose trades that yield high investment returns, they can have great prospects, such as investing in high-tech industry, infrastructure, and so on. Li also stressed: Fujian Province still encourages foreign businessmen to invest in real estate and other tertiary industry. The land value-added tax in the new tax systems is also applicable to foreign businessmen. But this is aimed at restricting speculation in land transactions by foreign businessmen; it will not have any impact on genuine property developers. Taxation Organs Will Collect Taxes According to the Law In Li's view, the new systems totally conform with the needs of socialist market economy and respect international tax practices. In so doing, China's market economy can enter and converge with the international market at an early date. Moreover, the new tax systems provide that, except for the stipulated tax deductions and exemptions, taxation departments must not reduce or exempt taxes without authorization. This makes it possible for the taxation departments to impartially collect taxes according to the law. Foreign enterprises can also feel at ease because there is no need to worry about the imposition of other taxes. Li stressed: After the implementation of the new tax systems, foreign enterprises still enjoy the preferential treatment of tax exemptions in the first two years and tax reductions in the next three. Therefore, their new tax burdens will not increase in the wake of the tax reform. On the contrary, because of investing in high and new technology and the infrastructure, they will be able to enjoy more preferential policies. He said: The implementation of the new tax systems in 1994 will be more beneficial to foreign investments in Fujian.
