FR941102-0-00055 FR941102-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 12 [T.D. 94&hyph;84] RIN 1515&hyph;AB63 Extension of Import Restrictions on Maya Artifacts From the Peten Region, Guatemala AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on Maya artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala which were imposed by T.D. 91&hyph;34. The Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency has determined that the emergency conditions which originally warranted the imposition of import restrictions still exist. Accordingly, the restrictions will continue to be in effect for an additional three years, and the Customs Regulations are being amended to indicate this extension. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Legal Aspects: Donnette Rimmer, Intellectual Property Rights Branch, (202) 482&hyph;6960. Operational Aspects: Leo Wells, Office of Trade Operations (202) 927&hyph;0300. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency (USIA), after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, determined that Maya artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala were in danger of pillage and looting, and that an emergency condition existed which warranted the imposition of a prohibition on the importation of such articles into the United States. In T.D. 91&hyph;34, the Customs Service announced the imposition of import restrictions and identified the types of articles covered by the restrictions. The Deputy Director of the USIA has considered the recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and determined that the emergency conditions which warranted imposition of the initial restrictions still exist and has decided to extend the import restrictions for another three years. (See 59 FR 50038, September 30, 1994.) Accordingly, Customs is amending ยง12.104g (19 CFR 12.104g) to reflect the extension of the import restriction. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) do not apply.
