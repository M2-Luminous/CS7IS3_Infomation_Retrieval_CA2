Behind this is the realization that Japan would never accept numerical targets, and apprehensions over the recent trend of yen appreciation and comprehensive dollar depreciation. Dollar depreciation will trigger a drop in U.S. bonds and stocks, and bring about a rise in interest rates. If interest rates go up, U.S. President Bill Clinton's reelection strategy of maintaining low interest rates to sustain economic growth will be undermined. Such a change of U.S. attitude is also partly a result of domestic considerations in the United States. Japan and the United States will start negotiations to resume the economic framework talks this week. The key to successful negotiations is Japan's macroeconomic policies, including sustained income tax reduction. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata should exercise leadership to make the decision to continue substantial tax cuts beyond 1994, and implement additional public investments before the end of June. Of course, finding revenue sources for this will be difficult, but I do not think it is necessary to come up with a concrete figure for the politically unpopular consumption tax hike. If prior consultations on macroeconomic policies are successful, the framework talks can be resumed before the end of June, and there is a strong possibility that an agreement may be reached in automobiles and the two other priority sectors during the summit meeting in early July. As to negotiations on specific sectors, Japan should not change its position of rejecting numerical targets because such a demand is absurd, in the first place. If, due to the political situation, a decision on sustained tax cuts could not be made, and an agreement on macroeconomic policies could not be reached by the end of June, there will be no progress in negotiations on specific sectors as well. Since Japan's surplus essentially has to do with macroeconomic policies, the United States will not be content merely with an agreement on specific sectors. Furthermore, since Japan is also saying it wants to resolve the trade imbalance, it would not be logical to go ahead with negotiations in the specific sectors. After June, the right timing for Japan to arrive at a conclusion on tax cuts will be around December. Although the United States has set the deadline for identifying priority countries to negotiate with under the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) in September, Japan should formulate its policies according to its own domestic schedule. If Japan tries to deal with this matter before the end of September, it would only prove that the Super 301 provision is effective. Even for the sake of other countries, Japan should absolutely refrain from doing this.
