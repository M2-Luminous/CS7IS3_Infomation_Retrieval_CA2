He would not have a face-to-face debate with his opposite number, PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] candidate Stefan Heym, in September, he said. Was he throwing in the towel? Polling results appear to indicate that more than 50 percent of the voters in the Berlin-Mitte district plan to vote for Heym, the PDS' direct candidate. The respectable showing by the SED [Socialist Unity Party] successor party in the Brandenburg local elections has the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] worried--and not just the SPD. After those elections [Guenter] Verheugen, the SPD national executive director, was quick to say that there will be no cooperation with the PDS. But what good does that do? However honorable such statements might be they do not necessarily help obtain the votes of potential PDS supporters. That suits Gysi's party fine; it continues to move ahead. At least that is what the polls say. According to Infratest Burke Berlin, 55 percent of the eastern Germans polled would like to see the PDS represented in the Bundestag again; 24 percent said they might vote for the PDS in the next Bundestag election. And according to Infas, 62 percent of the eastern Germans consider the PDS to be a party "committed to social issues." In that regard it competes with the SPD, of course. Under the circumstances, SPD headquarters would just as soon leave well enough alone. The debate has not yet come to a close, it is said. A plan on how to deal with the issue only exists in "Guenter Verheugen's head." That is not entirely correct because a lot of thought is already being given to the matter behind the scenes. These deliberations include a reexamination of the SPD's own role--and how it is perceived among the voters. It was not until 1990 that the newly founded eastern German SPD which initially went by the name of SDP decided not to accept former members of the SED. That decision held for a year to start with. These days, the local party organizations decide on a case-by-case basis, but they are very restrictive. Are they too restrictive? At this point party headquarters no longer want the SPD in eastern Germany to act as a new party unhampered by the SED past, but as an activist political force involved in current issues. Wolfgang Thierse, it is said, is inclined to adopt such a position. Given the unclear majority situation, who can afford to drive potential voters into the arms of the PDS by asking them: "what did you do the day before yesterday?" Certainly not the SPD. The membership figures alone send a loud and clear message. The SPD has 30,000 members in eastern Germany while the PDS has about 130,000. The only recourse is to go on the offensive. On orders from the party executive committee Rudolf Hartung, the executive director of the Berlin SPD and a former functionary at party headquarters, worked up a set of theses. The revised version of the "33 Theses for Self-Confident Dealings with the PDS" will be completed within the next few days. It will then be presented to the executive committee. A shorter version will subsequently be published. The document calls for focusing more on SPD successes in national politics. It contains quotations from statements by Gysi and analyses of the PDS membership structure and comments such as "everyday political life in the PDS is joyless and has little to do with Gregor Gysi talk shows." The document also includes optimistic, albeit helpless statements such as: "among nonvoters there is a distinctly greater potential for confidence in the SPD than in the PDS." Or: "about 20 percent of the PDS voters admit that the SPD is more effective and can be more successful on major social policy issues than the PDS which is by and large a regional political party limited to the former GDR." Hartung is not the only one to prepare such a strategy paper on the PDS issue. Uwe Kuester and Rolf Schwanitz, two deputies from eastern Germany, have also drawn up an analysis. Kuester, the SPD parliamentary group's executive director, would not like to see an "election campaign that focuses on party platforms," nor does he want the SPD to concentrate on the SED past. "In the final analysis," he says, "one cannot exclude 2.3 million former SED members for life." His study goes into the PDS membership structure and election strategy as well as into the consequences for the SPD election campaign. "It would be counterproductive to stigmatize the PDS members as individuals who are forever looking backward," Kuester writes. As an example he cites PDS politician Kutzmutz in Potsdam who met with a lot of understanding when he noted that "my biography does not start in 1989." The market economy is another issue to be raised, he recommends. The PDS which casts doubt on it in its platform is "totally unrealistic and ideologically overburdened" on that score. In his view, the PDS is trying to blame the SPD along with the government for the negative consequences of Bonn's decisions. This attempt must be countered. The election campaign should therefore be based on SPD achievements, including those in the Bundesrat. In essence, Kuester's paper says, "by attacking the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], our principal adversary, in this manner we will simultaneously be dealing in the most elegant way with the PDS, our principal competitor." In his paper entitled "The PDS--Antidemocratic, Divisive, Separatist" Rolf Schwanitz, who made a name for himself in the SPD as head of the working group on German unity, places particular emphasis on the PDS's past and its programmatic goals. He feels nonetheless that "attitudes toward the GDR past have changed, particularly among those who sympathize with the PDS." Schwanitz would not only like to confront the PDS with "soft issues" in the election campaign but rather to "expose its core." The PDS is merely interested in "focusing on problems and not on their solutions," he says. "The PDS primarily represents the interests of the former nomenklatura." In his paper Schwanitz analyzes the role played by the PDS in reports prepared by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, examines its draft statutes and its dealings with SED assets. "In united Germany," he writes, "the PDS tries to secure freedoms for left-wing extremist forces and agitates against a well-fortified democratic system of government." Schwanitz then turns against "a response adapted to the public mood in which the issues already preempted by the PDS, e.g. Stasi activity, its role in the past and present, are respected and ignored." Can the PDS "campaign of conquest" still be stopped? If it did return to the Bundestag, it could thwart some options and force others to be adopted. "The consequence could be a grand coalition," Hartung speculates. Do others share this fear? At any rate, CDU headquarters is also busy working on strategies directed against the PDS. Campaign materials directed against the Gysi party are to be distributed following the summer recess.
