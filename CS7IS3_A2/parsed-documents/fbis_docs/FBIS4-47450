The approach revolved around a multiple-parameter recording method that entailed recording seven behavioral indicators and processing them by using original mathematical programs based on pattern recognition theory and data analysis theory. The proposed systems approach to evaluating the effects of psychotropic agents on the training process called for recording the following behavioral indicators: number of correct responses, their latent period, number of responses to pain stimuli, speed of response to them, number of interstimulus responses, number of nonpurposive responses, and amount of time for which the animal was able to maintain itself on the crossbar. These seven indicators were analyzed in strict accordance with the animals' two possible states (response to light and failure to respond). After primary data processing, the seven series of starting indicators were transformed into 20 derivative indicators associated with the response and failure to respond to light. Those data were then transformed into a three-dimensional matrix of indicators. The matrix was analyzed to develop a set of 8-10 diagnostically significant symptoms that were then used to characterize the animals' training curve based on N time points. The proposed systems analysis method was used to examine the effect of daily injections of D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [D-9-THC] in a dose of 2 mg/kg on animals' ability to learn a conditioned response to light. The behavior of the animals receiving the D-9-THC injections was compared with that of animals that received daily injections of a physiological solution. The animals in the first experiments performed established that daily injections of D-9-THC improved study animals' ability to execute conditioned responses and lengthened the latent period of their conditioned response, did not change their latent period of response to pain stimuli, did not change the length of time for which the animals were able to remain on the crossbar, and increased the number of interstimulus reactions and nonpurposive reactions. The ability to execute the conditioned response improved gradually in both groups of animals; however, the behavioral strategies used by the animals in the two groups differed. The animals that received the D-9-THC appeared to rely less on information stored in their long-term memory, and the role of the emotional component in their decision-making process increased slightly as compared with that in the control animals.
