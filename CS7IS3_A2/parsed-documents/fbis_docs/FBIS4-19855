Late in the summer of last year, when Social Democrat European Deputy Detlev Samland presented a report stating that the five men and one woman who were originally grouped around Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber did indeed have big mouths, but hardly stood out in terms of their presence in parliament or their parliamentary work, there was a storm of protest. Retired criminal investigation official Klaus-Peter Koehler from Heidenheim (Brenz) even had announcements published in newspapers in which he branded the report "the deliberate falsification of information." "A Warning" Five years ago, the Republikaner's ability to obtain 7.1 percent of the vote in the European elections attracted attention well beyond Germany's borders and caused great commotion in the media. At the time, their success was viewed as a "warning" issued by citizens to those in government, but was also seen as being partly due to the right-wingers' anti-European program. Entitled "German Interests Have Priority," the Dinkelsbuehl declaration on the European elections contained the following points: "No unilateral Western integration," "no to placing Germany at a disadvantage," "no to the right to vote for foreigners," "no to surrendering sovereignty." No Movement Politically This clearly indicated that the policies the German right-wing extremists would pursue in Strasbourg would be geared solely to obstruction and not to constructive participation. Three and a half years later, in March 1993, former criminal investigation official Koehler admitted to an Ulm newspaper: "We have achieved a few minor points, but politically we have not achieved any movement." However, initiatives such as that launched by his colleague Johanna-Christiana Grund from the Bavarian pilgrimage center of Altoetting could hardly be described as a "minor point": "Entry to and the Exercise of the Profession of Alpine Mountain Guide in EC Member States." The history of the Republikaner in the European Parliament was from the outset one of violent disputes and quarrels with those of a similar political persuasion from other partner countries. In 1989, six Republikaner moved into the building of concrete and glass in Strasbourg: Franz Schoenhuber (journalist from Munich) as leader, Johanna-Christina Grund (mountain guide from Altoetting), Klaus-Peter Koehler (retired criminal investigation official from Heidenheim), Harald Neubauer (journalist from Munich), Emil Schlee (retired ministerial assistant from Raisdorf-Reuterkoppel), and Hans-Guenther Schodruch (lawyer from Siegburg). A month later, the group started talks with right-wing radicals from other countries to agree on close cooperation and the formation of a joint group in the European Parliament. At the very start, there was a dispute with the fascist Italian Social Movement because the Germans had denounced the "repression of the German-speaking population in South Tirol." However, in the case of another two parties -- the French Front National, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and the Flemish Vlaams Blok, led by Carel Dillen -- Schoenhuber and his people did not want to agree on a common platform but only on "technical cooperation." Le Pen only reluctantly accepted Schoenhuber's complaints about the "the German people's right to live in one free state with guaranteed rights," whereby the German meant the "1937 borders." Busy With Themselves Of course, the Republikaner guild in Strasbourg busied itself most of all with itself and that led to its finally being de facto dissolved. The party's Bavarian chairman, Harald Neubauer (a former German National Party member and later a close confidante of the notorious DVU leader and friend of ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, Gerhard Frey) challenged Franz Schoenhuber for the leadership. As a result, in September 1990, the Republikaner leadership released the five European representatives (with the exception of Schoenhuber) "from the duties toward the party immediately" and instituted expulsion proceedings against them. On 3 December 1990, Franz Schoenhuber left the "Rightist Group" in Strasbourg. He justified the move by saying the Republikaner could not have anything in common with neo-Nazis, racists, and extremists. He leveled such charges at Harald Neubauer, in particular. At the end of 1990, Johanna-Christina Grund and Neubauer were finally expelled from the party; in the spring of 1991, Koehler, Schlee, and Schodruch arrived at the same verdict by leaving the party themselves. Schlee and Frau Grund also left the "Rightist Group" in the European Parliament and have described themselves as "independent" since then, while Neubauer had himself made chairman of the extremist right-wing splinter party the "German League," which he helped form. Although this is fiercely disputed by those concerned, in his report, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] European Deputy Detlev Samland maintains that the Republikaner had almost no presence at all in Strasbourg. Nevertheless, by June of last year, they had submitted 139 statements, although they drew no response. The possible exception were contributions during debates made by Schoenhuber concerning himself and his past: "I was not an SS man; I was a soldier in the SS and I am not ashamed of that." All in all, it is not an exaggeration but more of an understatement that over the five years in which they have been active in the European Parliament, worlds have separated the Republikaner's original political demands and reality.
