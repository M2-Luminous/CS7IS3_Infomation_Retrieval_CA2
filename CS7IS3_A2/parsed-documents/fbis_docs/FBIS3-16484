Ukrainian submachine-gunners do not allow medical personnel in, if the latter refuse to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. Hospital workers said that Major Shevchenko of the Ukrainian armed forces had presented them an ultimatum in accordance with which they must either serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces or will lose their jobs. A high-ranking representative of the Black Sea Fleet, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that earlier this year Ukrainian submachine-gunners had seized the military hospital in Nikolayev. Special forces were involved. The same source announced that the Black Sea Command qualified those actions as "actions carried out by uncontrolled bandit formations, because the Ukrainian Defense Ministry did not inform the Black Sea Command of its plans to resubordinate the Black Sea Fleet's establishments and units." He stated that if such unilateral actions were repeated, the Black Sea Fleet personnel would be given the order to use arms to rebuff them.
