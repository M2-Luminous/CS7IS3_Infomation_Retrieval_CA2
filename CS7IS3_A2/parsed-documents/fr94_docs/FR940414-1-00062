FR940414-1-00062 FR940414-1-00010 The Universal Treatment System identified as BAT/PSES technology, and assumed in the cost model to be required, consists in part, of raw wastewater storage tanks. Storage tank capacity was costed to hold as much volume as is assumed to be generated during three months or the facility's maximum wastewater volume generated at one time in 1988, whichever volume is larger. The system also includes a jacketed process treatment vessel in which emulsion breaking, chemical oxidation, sulfide precipitation and hydrolysis will take place, an activated carbon system consisting of a feed storage tank, a grit pre-filter, a three-bed adsorber unit (and, if size required, a backwash system), and effluent storage tanks equal in capacity to the raw wastewater storage. A review of pesticide manufacturing treatability data reveals that activated carbon, chemical oxidation, and hydrolysis are the most common BAT technologies used to treat pesticide active ingredients. These technologies are expected to be capable of treating any and all active ingredients in PFPR waste streams to levels that will allow recycle/reuse and thus would result in zero discharge of wastewaters. (See previous discussion of the Universal Treatment System treatability study.) The model calculates costs for BAT under the assumption that hydrolysis and chemical oxidation are carried out only when required (based upon the treatability information for each active ingredient available from the pesticide manufacturer rule database or data transfers as described previously in Section V). Emulsion breaking pretreatment and activated carbon adsorption, however, are always assumed to be carried out on the wastewater and therefore their costs are always included. This approach is conservative, because it is likely that not all facilities will need to use emulsion breaking to treat their wastewaters. The input data required by the cost model consist of facility-specific wastewater flow data, facility-specific influent active ingredient concentration data, active ingredient treatability data, and active ingredient analytical method data. These data are used to calculate current and proposed active ingredient loadings, to size and cost the treatment system, and to cost monitoring of the treated wastewater. The flow data were obtained from the PFPR questionnaire responses. The concentration data were obtained from EPA sampling at seven PFPR facilities. Both sets of data are stored in the pesticide formulating data base. The cost model determines the quarterly wastewater volumes and the maximum wastewater volume needing treatment at any one time. These values are used to size the raw wastewater storage tanks in the Universal Treatment System. Active ingredient loadings were estimated on a stream-by-stream basis by first identifying the active ingredients that could be in each stream and then extrapolating sampling data to set an influent concentration for each active ingredient in each stream. It was assumed that each active ingredient contained in the pesticide product would be contained in the wastewater streams generated by the production line for that product. It was also assumed that all active ingredients formulated, packaged or repackaged by each facility would be in the facility's non-line specific wastewater streams. The concentration of each active ingredient in the facility's commingled wastewater was then estimated by dividing the sum of the stream-specific loadings for each active ingredient by the total facility pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater flow. The active ingredient concentrations for each stream were extrapolated from the sampling data in the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging analytical database (and were sorted by stream type and active ingredient). Due to the lack of concentration data for numerous active ingredients in the process wastewater streams, concentration values were extrapolated from available active ingredient stream data to other active ingredients within that particular stream type for which no characterization data exist. The following methodology was used: •Actual active ingredient concentration data were used when available; •Active ingredient concentration data were transferred to structurally similar active ingredients for the same source of wastewater; and •Median values of all the active ingredient concentration data points for the same stream type were transferred to all remaining active ingredients lacking characterization data.
