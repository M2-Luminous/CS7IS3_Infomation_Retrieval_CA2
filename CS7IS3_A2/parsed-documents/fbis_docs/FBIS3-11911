If anyone has any doubts about that, he just needs to look at current relations between the United States and the Russian Federation. Everything seems to indicate that the western pretext of the so-called "Soviet danger" is tending to change its name to the "Russian danger." Must there always be some sort of threat? Defense Secretary William Perry said on 14 March that there could develop in Russia an "authoritarian, militarist, and imperialist nation hostile toward the West." In such a situation, "we might see the birth of a new version of the Cold War." Perry added that his country should therefore have a "strategy for protection." According to the 6 February edition of THE WASHINGTON POST, British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said before the conference on security policy in Munich, Germany that "the most probable threat to European security" is the potential danger that Russia might try to recover control over the territories of the "former Soviet empire." Has anyone ever said that is one of Russia's intentions? Rifkind said such signals come not only from nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but also from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other "moderate" officials. Are they real signals or are they unfounded fears leading to a search for pretexts for doing what they do in practice? Following the Clinton-Boris Yeltsin summit in Moscow last January, both sides agreed on the need to move on to new stages of cooperation, including a U.S. promise to grant the Russian Government relatively modest assistance of $2.5 billion. New obstacles to relations emerged suddenly. One of them was the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the ultimatum announced by NATO, led by the United States, to initiate air attacks on Serb positions if they did not withdraw their artillery. The carrot comes before the stick; it was always that way. Later a Russian initiative gave an important boost to a solution to the controversy, at least temporarily, to avoid further air attacks. Russia achieved a victory with this measure. Then something emerged by chance as if pulled out of a magician's sleeve: the famous case of alleged spy Aldrich Ames, a CIA official accused of working for special Soviet services since 1985 and later for similar Russian agencies. Was it discovered now or was it saved for the proper moment? Tempers flared. It seems unreal that the friendship reached after so much "sacrifice" in the Cold War years (some people are already speaking of a "Cold Peace") [words indistinct]. It is not known how many they may have stored away in the drawer for a proper moment. A Russian general said he was surprised by the U.S. reaction, arguing that the CIA does worse things in Moscow. But let's not fool ourselves. These are not fortuitous incidents. It is just that the huge propaganda machinery is cranked up when the system needs it. (That is how freedom of the press works in that country). At least that is how the directors of the Russian agency ITAR-TASS think. A recent dispatch stated: "...attempts to give a political character (to the case) have shown once again that the intelligence service is a policy tool that can be efficiently used at the appropriate moment." Perhaps at another time the Ames case would not have had such an effect. It seems it was necessary now, especially when one keeps in mind that the current administration has been accused by quite a few "hawks" of being [words indistinct]. That is not the case if we are really objective. The fact that Bill Clinton was opposed to the war in Vietnam in the 1960's (as many people were), the fact that he was in favor of lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military, and the fact that he is maintaining an image of almost total dedication to domestic issues does not mean that he, as commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, is not taking "strong" measures for his country's defense. Only in this sense can we interpret the activities that continue to be periodically conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces both inside the continental United States and abroad. According to reliable sources, even though they have pledged not to aim their powerful rockets at Russian territory, the country's strategic forces periodically conduct massive deployments of planes and perform tests of nuclear attacks "on powers abroad." They are not exactly doing this to test air attacks on Canada, their NATO ally. Some of these "superbombers" head south of Florida as if familiarizing themselves with the theater of operations near Cuba. Is this part of U.S. defense? They are also deploying their strategic defense systems against the nuclear arsenal supposedly launched from Russia. Apparently their friendship is not solid enough. The U.S. Navy maintains at its air and naval station in Key West, Florida, an "aggressor" squadron of TA-4 and F-16N bombers, which have red stars drawn on their vertical stabilizers. The stars identify the Russian planes, which they imitate. These "aggressors" are used to train U.S. pilots in a realistic environment, and there is no doubt that they are being trained to fight a well-defined adversary. It seems that not only ashes remain. Another example is the existence of units called "opposition forces" in training sites at Ft. Irwin, California, and Ft. Polk, Louisiana, which have foreign weapons, especially of Russian origin. Those units employ the tactics and uniforms of that country. The Americans are also trying to exert a direct influence on the Russian armed forces. To achieve this they are encouraging the implementation of joint maneuvers in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic Sea, as well as visits by B-52 bombers, the same ones that conduct attack exercises on Russian territory, among other activities. These are only a few examples that show that the popular saying may also be applied in this case. There were many years of intense fire...and some ashes, and perhaps a few fires had to remain. Fortunately, for the moment, there are not many...
