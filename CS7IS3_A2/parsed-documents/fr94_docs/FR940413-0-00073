ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements section 622(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 622(a) provides public housing agencies (PHAs) with the option, subject to the requirements of this part, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing projects, for occupancy by disabled families; elderly families; or mixed populations (i.e., disabled families and elderly families). This final rule also amends existing regulations, which currently provide for preference for elderly families and disabled families, and discretionary preference for near-elderly families in ``public housing projects for the elderly''_that is, public housing projects that house mixed populations (``mixed population projects''). This final rule continues to provide for preference for disabled families and elderly families in ``mixed population projects.'' However, certain amendments were made to include new and revised definitions pertaining to ``family'' as set forth in section 621 of the 1992 Act, and to provide for recognition of the designated housing process. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 13, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background_Proposed Rule On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1244), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 622(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act). Section 622(a) amended section 7 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437e) to provide public housing agencies (PHAs) 1 with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing projects for occupancy by (1) disabled families; (2) elderly families; or (3) mixed populations (``designated housing''). (Section 7 of the 1937 Act, previously titled ``Congregate Housing'' was retitled ``Designated Housing'' by the 1992 Act. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the references to section 7 in this preamble are to section 7 as amended by section 622(a) of the 1992 Act.) 1 Section 626 of the 1992 Act provides that the amendments made by subtitle B of title VI of the 1992 Act (which amendments pertain to the authority of PHAs to provide designated housing) shall not apply to lower income housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between HUD and an Indian housing authority.
