To achieve this goal, it is imperative that we urgently speed up economic structural reform to resolve the deep-seated underlying contradictions in economic development in China. As a key link in the economic system, the financial system is enormously significant for the development and stability of the national economy. Since the beginning of the year, runaway economic growth has been accompanied by over-investment, soaring prices, a money supply that has been expanding excessively, and disorder in the financial sector. All of that shows that problems in the financial system have become the bottleneck impeding the sustained and stable development of the entire national economy. The only fundamental solution is to accelerate and intensify the reform of the financial system. I. Underlying Structural Root Causes of Current Financial Plight and Its Effects on the Macroeconomy The problems in the financial system are wide-ranging. Here we will limit ourselves to an analysis of the more important ones that impact macroeconomic regulation and control. A. The People's Bank of China does not have clearly defined objectives and functions. Its tools of regulation and control are obsolete and its organization and financial system are irrational. 1) For years the People's Bank of China has consistently pursued a dual-objective -- economic growth and a stable currency -- monetary policy, with emphasis on the former. This has resulted in constant conflicts with the fight against inflation. With the People's Bank putting fast economic growth first, not only do policymakers have trouble knowing how far they can properly go in using the monetary policy to stimulate economic growth while avoiding inflation and economic boom-and-bust, but the optimal allocation of resources is also out of the question. 2) Generally speaking, the primary function of the People's Bank is to regulate and control the money supply and ensure the safety of the banking system. Nowadays, however, the People's Bank has taken up the responsibility of adjusting the economic structure while failing to set quantitative management standards for the assets risk and mobility requirements of specialized banks or to carry out stringent inspection. Instead it has limited itself to using administrative orders to put forward general policy demands. The result is a steady decline in the quality of the assets of China's banking industry even as the industry is becoming a more and more risky business. 3) Although the central bank has adopted a number of indirect regulatory and control tools since reform began, they have not been used to good effect because of the constraints of external conditions and the push of internal interests. Many loopholes still exist. The old reliance on quota management continues. Moreover, the lending management is lax and interest rates are not used flexibly enough for leverage. 4) At present branches of the People's Bank are set up at each level of the hierarchy of administrative divisions. On the one hand, this puts the central bank under enormous pressure from the local governments. Power tends to be fragmented and localism is a major problem, which militates against the effort by the central bank to assert its authority and independence. On the other hand, the People's Bank meddles in the operations of the branches of specialized banks level after level, breaking up the integrity of specialized banks. This does nothing to help the big banks discharge their responsibilities. Nor does it facilitate macroeconomic regulation and control. 5) The central bank these days is an unwieldy massive organization plagued by financial problems. Branches of the People's Bank are forced to pay the workers' wages and benefits out of retained net income, a situation out of step with the general practice in the world, where the central bank of a nation is independent and removed from profits. As a result, government administration and enterprise management are inseparable in the People's Bank, which has lost its impartiality and there is a built-in credit expansion mechanism. B. In specialized banks government administration and enterprise management are merged. There is no autonomy for credit activities within the prescribed limits while credit activities outside these limits lack effective discipline. 1) Right now specialized banks discharge both policy-making and commercial responsibilities. There is confusion over their goals. Responsibilities are ill-defined. On the one hand, the policy-making function is not assured. On the other hand, the commercial risk they take and losses they incur as commercial entities are masked by their policy-making function. This works against both their operations as commercial ventures and the realization of their policy-making goal. 2) Specialized banks have interest motivation and a credit expansion mechanism without, however, a corresponding risk restraint mechanism. On the one hand, there are no funds to make loans in the plan, On the other hand, they continue to extend more and more loans in the form of through inter-bank lending. On the ne hand, the state strictly controls the level of interest rates and the difference in interest rates between one trade and the next. On the other hand, because of the acute demand for funds on the money market, grassroots branches of specialized banks and credit managerial personnel have in effect been extending loans at higher interest rates. The difference in interest rates translates into a huge loss. The covertness of the real interest rates has caused the unhealthy tendency to run rampant. 3) There is a rising demand for specialized banks to become comprehensive multi-function entities, yet the state does not have a coherent management system for each industry or trade. As a result, credit funds are being transferred in large quantities, sometimes causing destructive competition. C. The financial market has gotten more mature but there is disorder in the market and its development has been irregular. 1) What is lacking is a clear set of rules defining who should be the principal players in the financial market. Even when regulations exist, they are not strictly enforced. Investors which should not enter a certain type of market do so anyway. Case in point: enterprises entering the market for inter-bank lending. 2) The market has lost its original meaning and is becoming a credit market outside the banks characterized by excessively long maturing periods and overly high interest rates. 3) The enterprise bonds market is not standardized and does not operate in the open. All sorts of internal fund-raising takes place in a chaotic manner and on an inflated scale. Supervision by the market is ineffectual. 4) With no support from the banking system, the national debt market has yet to put together a national debt market operating mechanism that integrates the banks closely with public finance. Some actions by the treasury on the market have affected the reputation of national debt. Today the national debt market is in a bind. 5) Fund prices on the entire financial market are distorted and the market is disorderly. Official interest rates are too low, undermining the stability of the macroeconomy. Nominally all interest rates are planned interest rates. In fact what is in effect are market interest rates. It is clear from the above analysis that China's current financial system amounts to a formidable barrier to any effort to ensure sustained and stable economic growth while maintaining the total size of the economy on an even keel by fully utilizing all the tools of macroeconomic regulation and control. A particularly striking problem in recent years is this. Against the general backdrop of local economic management, the entire banking system shows signs of returning to the traditional system of the People's Bank controlling everything. What is happening is that with their control over funds, branches of the People's Bank set up level after level to coincide with the hierarchy of administrative divisions have been engaging in commercial activities on their own. Moreover, they have been giving orders to local branches of specialized banks when it comes to funds, thus severing the integrity of specialized banks. In addition, most of them having adopted the retained net income system, local branches of the People's Bank have a strong profit-driven incentive to expand re-lending and special lending by the central bank. An inevitable product of this system is a mechanism for expanding credit, forcing the central government to keep pumping money into the money supply at the grassroots level, which, in turn, results in the excessive growth of the money supply and spawns new inflation. This tendency to lose control locally on the financial front leads to organizational over-staffing and widespread inefficiency. We can see that if we do not end this system, the pernicious boom-and-bust cycle will keep on repeating itself and the stabilization of the macroeconomy will become just empty talk. II. Objectives for Financial System Reform During the Ninth Five-Year Plan To create a favorable environment for the rapid and stable development of the national economy, we must speed up the pace of financial reform starting today and go all out to complete the reform of the financial system before the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, creating the rudiments of a modern financial system that is structurally sound and operates efficiently. The goals of reforming the financial system during the Ninth Five-Year Plan are: A. The complete unification of the goals of the monetary policy of the People's Bank. The central bank should keep a tight lid on the money supply mainly by effecting macroeconomic financial regulation and control through the regulation and control of basic money and base interest rates. Replace mandatory quota management with window guidance. Reorganize the People's Bank structurally. Ultimately, it shall be streamlined into a system consisting of the headquarters, regional branches, and local currency control and supervisory bureaus. B. Complete the transformation of the operating mechanism of specialized banks now under way, turning those banks into genuine commercial banks. The distribution of the branches of specialized banks should coincide with that of economic regions. Be consistent with international practices in the financial and accounting systems and methods of operations. The main commercial banking groups should go after internationalization. C. Complete the establishment of a bank with policy-making responsibilities and run it properly. At the same time, the People's Bank should give up its function of regional economic regulation and that of regulating the industrial structure. Lower the mandatory deposit reserve rate as appropriate. D. Establish a standardized nationally unified financial structure and extend the reach of the existing stock exchange. Launch the financial futures business across the board and provide good financial services for the development of commodities futures trading. Speed up financial law-making. Regularize the currency market, stock market, bond market, credit market, and insurance market in accordance with the law, forming an orderly financial market. E. Complete the reform of the foreign exchange system. Put together a standardized foreign exchange market. Make the renminbi essentially convertible in international payments and trade. III. Procedures for Reforming the Financial System Looking at the underlying structural causes of the financial predicament that China is in today, we can see that the People's Bank controlling everything and losing control at the local level are the main forces working against macroeconomic stability. The key to successful financial reform, therefore, is to steadfastly focus on the People's Bank and stick to a dual-level banking system. To achieve the goal of reforming the financial system before the Ninth Five-Year Plan ends, our philosophy of reform and actual reform measures now and in the near future must help prevent organizationally the localities from interfering in the economy, thus hurting the macroeconomy, as is happening today: A. Emergency measures To dampen runaway investment fever, check inflation, and ensure sustained and steady economic growth, we must now take a string of emergency measures. The crux of our emergency response is to redirect the flow of funds back into the banks and tighten credit and the basic money supply, thereby easing payment difficulties. 1) The People's Bank should immediately reassert control over funds while decentralizing organizational, operational, and managerial responsibilities. Specifically, its head office should take back from its branches at all levels the control over funds. In the future the People's Bank should limit the objects of its re-lending to the head offices of specialized banks. There should be no more re-lending from the People's Bank to nonbank financial institutions. Loans already issued must be paid off within a set period. In view of transitional requirements, procurement funds for agricultural byproducts this year should be handled in a special way. At the same time, the responsibilities of specialized banks and other financial institutions should be decentralized to the People's Bank at the provincial and municipal levels. 2) The People's Bank should gradually end its present de facto function of regulating funds between different specialized banks and different regions. No longer will branches of the People's Bank at all levels manage the deposit reserve fund of the branches of specialized banks. Nor will they continue to help out branches of the specialized banks at the grassroots level by shifting money around to solve their payments difficulties. The headquarters of a specialized bank should tighten its management of the provision fund of the entire bank along with its responsibility for fund regulation within the bank. All specialized banks must maintain their provision fund above 5 percent. Should a situation occur where payment is not ensured, we must firmly investigate the culpability of the bank president in order to protect the reputation of the bank and social stability. Hold the specialized bank accountable for payment. 3) By strictly controlling the scale of lending and sorting out funds, the People's Bank should immediately regulate and control the operating system of basic money in accordance with the increase in the money supply. All financial institutions must purchase a specified amount of treasury bonds depending on the total volume of deposits they have received. Instead of using credit as the only way to regulate the size of the basic money supply, we should gradually switch to a variety of instruments, including treasury bonds, the mortgaged trading of the financial bonds issued by the policy-making bank, bills rediscounted, and unsecured discounted loans. 4) Further raise the interest rates on loans and deposits. Such a move will boost savings, speed up the withdrawal of money from circulation, and slow down the expansion of the M1. Moreover, it will cut down on the amount of idle social funds and will successfully lower the level of market interest rates. For the short haul, it is proposed that the interest rate on one-year bank savings deposits be raised to 10 to 12 percent, and that the interest rate on one-year loans be raised to 12 to 15 percent. 5) Speed up the development of a policy-making bank and a system for making policy-based investment and short-term loans. Everything must be done to complete the creation of a national long-term development credit bank and import/export specialized bank within the year and the establishment of an agricultural policy bank next year. In the period before the policy-making bank opens for business, we must introduce special account management to the policy-based lines of business of specialized banks. The policy-making bank must adhere to the principles of paying back principal with interest and not making a profit. Guided by the national industrial policy and planning, the policy-making bank must exercise decision-making authority in its operations and assume risk on its own. By inviting bids on the market, it should contract out certain functions to be performed by commercial financial institutions. 6) The People's Bank, including the head office and its branches at all levels, should immediately sever ties with the for-profit financial institutions, investment companies, and other businesses that it had set up. For the time being, at least, it should sever all personnel and financial links with those institutions as soon as possible. 7) Improve the lending quota management system within the People's Bank. Announce this year that in the future the amount of lending a specialized bank can make in any given year will be determined by its share of the liabilities of the entire banking system for the preceding year. The idea is to make the distribution of lending quotas less arbitrary. 8) At a time when the relations between public finance and banks have not been straightened out, give the central bank special permission this year to issue bonds to finance short-term loans in order to regulate cash flow between banks. In the future, we should develop the central bank's open market business through established procedures. In view of the fact that this year the treasury has stopped making overdrafts on the People's Bank or asking for advances from it, the treasury bonds purchased by the various financial institutions should be counted as part of the lending for this year. In the future, adjust the scale of lending as necessary. 9) Handle the host of major and serious illegal fund-raising cases promptly. Educate the public about the risk of different financial instruments. Announce to the public through government orders that fund-raising schemes, bonds, and stocks unauthorized by the financial agencies in charge will not be protected under the law. Also, liberalize the conditions for the proper issue of shares. Simplify examination and approval procedures. Speed up the examination and approval process. 10) The state should put some of the publicly held shares on the market in the coming months. At the same time it should speed up the examination and approval of new shares for which conditions are ripe so that they could be traded on the market soon. Increase the supply of shares on the market. Curb share over-pricing and dampen stock fever as appropriate. B. Financial Reform in the Near Future, Last Two Years of Eighth Five-Year Plan 1) Reorganize the People's Bank. In the near term, we may consider setting up a branch in each economic region. Next, we may phase out the bank branches at the county, prefectural, municipal, and provincial levels in stages. Meanwhile we should set up banking supervisory and control bureaus in the various localities if necessary, all under the leadership of the People's Bank. The branches of the People's Bank in the major regions are to be responsible for monitoring the monetary policy and the buying and selling of national debt. The function of the banking supervisory and control bureau is to supervise and monitor the financial institutions registered in the local jurisdiction and conduct economic studies and research. As part of the reorganization of the People's Bank, we should hive off the bank's existing financial services, forming independent yunchao companies and clearing centers. In addition, we should set up a nation-wide commercial bank to accommodate the personnel made redundant by the reorganization of the People's Bank. In general, offices and departments within the People's Bank should be set up to discharge macroeconomic regulatory and control responsibilities. 2) After the existing nation-wide banks -- the Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Agricultural Bank -- have turned over their policy-making function to the newly created policy-making bank, they should be downsized as appropriate. By centralizing managerial powers, these banks should live up to the role of major banks. The various specialized banks may be organized into a number of comprehensive banking groups under the industry-specific management of the state. The methods of operations of these groups as well as their management system must be consistent with international practices. Both the Construction Bank and China Investment Bank should also transfer their policy-making function to the newly created policy-making bank and then be reorganized as a pair of long-term credit commercial banks. Set up an urban cooperative bank and a rural cooperative bank, both as local commercial banks, and put the currency supervisory and management bureau in charge of their registration and supervision. All branches of the urban cooperative bank and rural cooperative bank at all levels shall be independent legal persons. Below the head office , branches of the urban cooperative bank should be set up at just two levels -- grass roots and municipal -- down to the prefectural municipal levels. Branches of the rural cooperative bank would go up to the municipal level only, at three levels -- municipal, county, and township -- altogether. The rural cooperative fund should be transformed into a genuine community fund and mutual aid organization. Develop regional commercial banks as appropriate. Besides the several already in existence along the southeastern coast, a few more may be set up in the northeast and in central and western China. Income taxes to be paid by these banks shall be considered central taxes. The People's Bank shall not make short-term loans to them. 3) Abolish the retained net income system for the branches of the People's Bank at all levels. The financial system of the People's Bank should be modelled on the "Financial System for Financial and Insurance Enterprises" and its profits should be turned over to the Ministry of Finance. The wages and benefits standards of the People's Bank must be reformed based on the level in financial enterprises. The necessary wage and benefits expenses should come out of the Ministry of Finance. 4) Set up a board of supervisors for state banks to monitor the utilization of state capital and preserve and increase its value. In the future, banks should be allowed to go bankrupt under the law, with mergers and acquisitions being the best option so as to ensure the orderly transfer of the assets and liabilities of the bank going under. While the People's Bank will no longer interfere in the personnel arrangements of the branches of specialized banks and commercial banks, it must strictly supervise and evaluate their business activities, being authorized to take disciplinary actions against the violators of banking laws and regulations, which specialized banks and commercial banks must comply with as a rule. 5) Establish a mechanism whereby the central bank can flexibly utilize the base interest rates to regulate the supply-demand of funds. The central bank must be swift in adjusting the interest rates paid by specialized banks on deposits and the range within which they are allowed to fluctuate in light of the objectives of macroeconomic regulation and control and the supply-demand of funds. 6) We should waste no time in giving specialized banks the power to set the interest rates they charge borrowers within a set range. Gradually translate the decision-making authority of specialized banks and commercial banks into a reality, enabling them to exercise autonomy in their operations within legally prescribed limits, including the power over personnel, financial resources, materials, deposits, lending, and foreign exchange, as well as the power to pursue new lines of business. Commercial banks should introduce management by the assets:liabilities ratio and establish assets risk management and a bad debt reserve system. Commercial banks must adopt international practices when it comes to the financial and accounting systems, methods of operations, and management system. They should create a practical and feasible self-restraint mechanism and risk responsibility mechanism. 7) The People's Bank should intensify the risk management of the assets of specialized banks. Formulate effective methods with binding force to evaluate the quality of bank loans. Modify the mix of assets and liabilities of specialized banks. 8) Adhere to the principle of industry-based management. A strict separation system should be applied to the personnel, finance, funds, and information of the stock, securities, trust, and insurance companies set up by banks and various agencies. They must be registered separately, operate independently, be responsible for their own profits and losses, and assume the risk themselves. 9) Speed up the creation of a People's Bank satellite clearing network. Establish a clearing center with a membership system to take up such tasks as bank clearing and mail remittances clearing.
