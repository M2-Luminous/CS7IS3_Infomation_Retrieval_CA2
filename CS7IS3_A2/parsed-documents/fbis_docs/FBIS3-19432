Police liaison officers working in Tallin, St. Petersburg, and Moscow for half a year have only reported minor incidents. This assertion was made by a Swedish Security Police (SAPO) chief superintendent who does not wish to be identified. The security police addressed the audience of a well-visited seminar arranged by the Baltic Center foundation in Stockholm yesterday. "I recommend all companies that are active in the Baltic states and Russia to contact our local police representatives. They can be reached via the embassies in Tallin and Moscow and the consulate in St. Petersburg. In May there will be a policeman posted to Riga as well," the security police representative said. The businessmen at the seminar were eager to learn about the magnitude of the risks for businessmen in the East. "We recommend that you do not pay protection money. People who become exposed to protection gangs must contact us immediately for help," the police representative said. But after these words of comfort to the businessmen, the security officer painted an alarming picture of crime in the Baltic states and Russia. It is perfectly obvious that there are mafia-like gangs looking for profits in hard currency. They are often organized by former KGB officers and specialize in controlling specific areas like airports or dockyards. They defend their districts with outrageous violence. The many murders reported from the Baltic states and Russia often relate to wars between various mafia gangs. It is dangerous for the police to intervene in these conflicts. In 1990, as many as 364 policemen were killed in the former Soviet area, compared to five in the United States the same year. Mafia activities have so far spread mainly to Poland and Germany. Berlin is indicated as a new center for the expanding East European mafia. Language differences are mentioned as one of the reasons why the mafia has still not gained a foothold in Sweden. But the authorities fear a wave of serious crime with offenses like drug smuggling, kidnapping, and money laundering, which have been taking place on a smaller scale.
