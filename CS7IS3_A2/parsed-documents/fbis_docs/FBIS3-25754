In an interview published in Harare, Dr. Nathan Shamuyarira said the International Republican Institute was funded by security agents of big powers. The Zimbabwean Government strongly regretted the plan to help the opposition. He said it was tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. Dr. Shamuyarira said there was a danger that the American funding could lead to subversion. Zimbabwean opposition parties should fund themselves locally. He said the money they received from the international organizations was dirty money.
