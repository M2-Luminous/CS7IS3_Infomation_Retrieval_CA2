The statement reads: Japan has carried into extremes its hostile policy toward Chongnyon and our republic today. The Japanese authorities recently committed another fascist outrage by sending several hundred police and raiding the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in broad daylight and searching many places including houses of Chongnyon officials on the groundless pretext of "violation of the national land utilization law" in the wake of their undisguised crackdown on the Osaka prefectural organizations of Chongnyon in April. This is part of the premeditated anti-DPRK moves the Japanese authorities committed by taking advantage of the U.S. attempts to isolate and stifle our republic over the "nuclear issue". It signifies the beginning of their wholesale suppression of Chongnyon. It is a grave challenge to our republic, an independent and sovereign state. The DPRK Government strongly denounces the Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, considering it the worst human rights abuse, an illegal act of political repression and a typical example of their national chauvinistic crime. Now, the Japanese authorities are running about recklessly, standing on the forefront of the United States' anti-DPRK "cooperation system". They went the length of making haste with legislative measures for the establishment of a wartime system like "emergency legislature" in anticipation of "sanctions" on our republic, and even crying for sea blockade. This is an open revelation of Japan's will to involve itself in another war of aggression on Korea by following the United States in case of emergency. The entire Korean people can hardly repress resentment at the fact that Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a century and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon it, is still suppressing and persecuting by means of strong arm Koreans in Japan, the victims of drafting by her and their descendents, without any justification, far from atoning for its past crimes through generations. The Japanese authorities who have consistently pursued a hostile policy towards us are now intending to stage a comeback to our republic, joining the United States and the South Korean authorities in crying for "sanctions" over the "nuclear issue". This shows that their aggressive nature remains unchanged. It is a mistake if Japan, which raked in big profits with the backing of the United States during the Korean war, expects another "shower of gold" in a second Korean war. The time has already changed. If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past, should take the van or be inevigled or join force in any "sanctions" against us, we would regard it as a declaration of war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment for it. The DPRK Government and the Korean people strongly demand that the Japanese authorities promptly stop their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it and sternly punish the chief culprits in the case. The Japanese authorities must immediately give up such foolhardy acts as pursuing a hostile policy toward our republic and suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. We will closely follow every move of the Japanese authorities.
