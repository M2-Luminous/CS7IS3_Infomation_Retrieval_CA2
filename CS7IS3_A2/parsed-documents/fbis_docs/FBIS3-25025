The latest reports tell us that more than 100 people have been killed and more than 200 have been injured. We have been informed that, despite that, UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] will continue the negotiations in Lusaka. On the other hand, the Angolan Government admitted it is engaging in a major military offensive action in northern Angola: [Correspondent Mendes Oliveira] Heavy shelling continued this morning in the city of Cuito. According to the Angolan national radio correspondent in that city, the number of people who have died since the fighting resumed on Saturday [5 February] is now over 100. The government forces stated yesterday evening that they controlled 85 percent of the city, which had been under UNITA control for five months. The UNITA leadership held an emergency meeting and decided that, despite the fighting, it will continue to be present at the talks in Lusaka and respect the unilateral cease-fire it declared in September. Despite justifying the attack on the grounds of maneuvers by the UNITA forces in Cuito, military sources in Luanda have admitted that the Angolan Armed Forces are engaged in a major offensive action all over northern Angola. They stated that they have recaptured the city of Ambriz and that they are engaged in the attempt to recapture the oil city of Soyo and city of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte province. Despite this recent escalation, the two delegations will today resume talks in Lusaka. The presence in Lusaka of the head of the UNAVEM [United Nations Angola Verification Mission] military mission has been used as an excuse for them to start discussion on the mandate of the UN mission and the role of the observers, leaving behind, unfinished, the difficult issue of national reconcilliation. UNITA Spokesman Jorge Valentim yesterday defended the lifting of sanctions which prevent the sale of weapons and fuel to UNITA. Valentim stated that in allowing one of the sides to be over-armed and engage in an ethnic cleasing policy, the international community is allowing the creation of new Bosnias in UNITA-controlled areas.
