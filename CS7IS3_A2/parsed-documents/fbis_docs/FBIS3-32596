Approximately 40 people, initially identified as members of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], blocked the road between Teopisca Municipality and San Cristobal de las Casas. Alleged PRD members also seized municipal offices in Cacahuatal. The two mobilizations followed the seizure of municipal offices in Mapastepec, Huehuetan, and Tuxantan by civilians. Their demands are the same -- more credits for rural areas, more public projects, and distribution of land, among others. It is also stated municipal presidents have abused their authority and are acting through political bossism. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Municipal presidents have been accomplices to murder. One of our comrades was killed, reportedly while trying to escape. Relatives said the municipal president told him he could leave, but it was later claimed the prisoner was shot while trying to escape. We came to Teopisca in case the people need protection because we... [pauses] if things are not solved now in Teopisca, tomorrow or the day after we will bring in 1,000 people for further support. The governor wants us to work throughout the municipalities, but no solutions are proposed. We have put up with this problem for quite a long time, and no solution has been found. To the contrary, the municipal president now gives us the finger, mostly to our women, and that is not right. We have stopped the people even though they wanted to drag him out and tie him up. We know that is a crime and things might get out of hand so we opted not to do that, but we will not put up with this situation. We have an audience with the governor in Tuxtla Gutierrez scheduled for 15 February and, if no solution is proposed on the 15th, we will adopt other decisions or measures on the 20th to solve the problem as best we can.
