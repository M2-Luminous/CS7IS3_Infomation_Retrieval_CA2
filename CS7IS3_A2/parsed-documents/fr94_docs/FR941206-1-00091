FR941206-1-00091 FR941206-1-00008 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5116&hyph;1] RIN 2060&hyph;AD98 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards for Shipbuilding and Ship Repair AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from surface coating operations from any new or existing shipbuilding and ship repair facilities at a major source (defined in part V, A). The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act), which requires the Administrator to regulate emissions of those chemicals designated as HAP in section 112(b). The intent of the proposed standards is to protect the public health by requiring new and existing major sources to limit HAP emissions to levels attainable by use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT). In addition, this document contains draft recommended best available control measures (BACM) for volatile organic compound (VOC) and particulate emissions from this category. The draft BACM implements section 183(b)(4) of the Act. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995. Public Hearing. If anyone contacts the EPA requesting to speak at a public hearing by December 27, 1994, a public hearing will be held on January 18, 1995, beginning at 10 a.m. ADDRESSES: Comments.
