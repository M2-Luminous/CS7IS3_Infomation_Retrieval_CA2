Endo made the proposal at a meeting of envoys from GATT member nations that was held the same day. By clarifying the principles of free trade regarding these areas, Japan hopes to lessen the negative impact of U.S. investigations into antidumping cases, the formation of trade blocs, and other factors. According to a Japanese Government official, the government is still in the process of making internal adjustments regarding its final proposal. It plans to make an official announcement at a ministerial meeting to be held next week in Morocco for the signing of a global trade accord. The government plans to push for the inclusion of this proposal in the presidential statement that will close the meeting, so that the three topics may possibly be taken up on the WTO's agenda along with such issues as U.S. demands on unifying labor standards. In connection with protectionist measures, the government official stated on the same day , "The problem is that U.S. antidumping laws and Article 337 of its Tariff Act have the effect of restricting trade as soon as investigations are begun." Because no discussions were held on this issue at the Uruguay Round talks, Japan feels it should be taken up at the WTO. Moreover, concerning the U.S. Buy American Act, which requires that purchases of products related to U.S. national security be produced domestically, Japan feels it is necessary to make adjustments to this law so that it will be in line with multilateral trade rules. Japan has brought up such issues in hoping to balance things out so that U.S. demands on unifying labor standards will not become too prominent.
