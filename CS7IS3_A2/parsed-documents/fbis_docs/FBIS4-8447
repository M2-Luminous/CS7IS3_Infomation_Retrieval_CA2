The government therefore decided to limit the bill on the competence of the higher administrative units to their powers. He said while there were not significant differences of opinion between the coalition partners on the matter of the competence of the higher administrative units, there were "fundamental discrepancies" between them concerning the competence of the bodies of these units. The government was concerned that the powers of higher administrative units might expand in the future, he said. "It would be naive to assume that competence can be determined once and for all time, since higher units are living organisms," he said. Klaus said the government would debate the narrowed down bill on the constitutional law on April 27 and submit the definitive form of the bill to parliament on April 30.
