Will you support Austria's concerns? [Kinkel] The German Government strongly supports the desire of Austria and the other states of the European Free Trade Association to join the European Union. The German delegation was advised to examine Austria's concerns with the necessary flexibility and understanding. [Mayer] Which of the three problems -- transit, agriculture, acquisition of land -- do you consider the most sensitive issue? [Kinkel] All the spheres you mentioned are difficult but not insoluble. It is important to find solutions that are acceptable to all sides and that are within the framework of what has been achieved in the European Union so far. On the secondary homes issue that you mentioned, only a solution that grants the same rights to citizens from Munich or Vienna is acceptable to us -- to use a graphic example. [Mayer] If talks are not concluded by the beginning of March 1994, membership will be postponed. Germany will hold the chairmanship of the European Union for six months as of 1 July. Are quick negotiations after this date conceivable? What will Bonn's contribution to successful negotiations be? [Kinkel] The German government will emphatically support a successful conclusion of the negotiations according to schedule on 1 March 1994. I will do everything possible to ensure that. I hope that accession talks will no longer be on the agenda during the German presidency in the second half of 1994. At that time the ratification process should be well under way in the member states and in the countries that want to join the European Union. Otherwise membership cannot take effect on 1 January 1995. [Mayer] To what extent do the candidates influence the topical problems of the European Union? [Kinkel] The applicants will be important and welcome members of the European Union. All four states have long democratic traditions and highly-developed national economies. These states naturally have similar problems to the other members of the European Union. However, they have realized that there are no panaceas and no special cures. I see no insuperable difficulties in the institutional sphere if the new members demonstrate the political will to support the Community's policy and observe the rules stipulated in the agreements. During the accession talks, we agreed to adapt the institutions to a larger number of members. At the government conference scheduled for 1996 we will have to take stock and examine proposals for changes on this basis.
