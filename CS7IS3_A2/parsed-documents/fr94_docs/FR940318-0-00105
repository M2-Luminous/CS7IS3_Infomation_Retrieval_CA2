FR940318-0-00105 FR940318-0-00021 This legislation also eliminated the enhanced Federal matching rates for the Adult Assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These programs are the Old-Age Assistance for the Aged; Aid to the Blind; Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled; and Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act respectively. The current Federal matching rates for training and SAVE, which are 75 percent and 100 percent respectively, are reduced to 50 percent. Reductions in the Federal matching rates for the AFDC Fraud Control Program and for training under the Adult Assistance Programs are addressed in these regulations. Separate regulations will be issued pertaining to the FAMIS system. The statutory SAVE requirements were implemented without regulations via program action transmittals and information memoranda. In an action transmittal, ACF&hyph;AT&hyph;93&hyph;16, we provided instructions regarding the reduction of 100 percent Federal funding for the SAVE program, applicable to both the AFDC and Adult Assistance Programs, to 50 percent Federal matching. Optional AFDC Fraud Control Program Section 9102 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 added section 416 to the Act permitting State agencies to establish and operate an optional fraud control program. This authorized States to impose disqualification penalties on an individual found to have committed an intentional program violation(s) by a State administrative disqualification hearing or by a Federal or State court, and to claim Federal matching at a 75 percent Federal matching rate for costs directly attributed to the operation of an AFDC fraud control program. Section 13741 of OBRA&hyph;93 reduced all the AFDC enhanced Federal matching rates, including the 75 percent rate for operation of the AFDC Fraud Control Program. The new rate is 50 percent. The funding provisions at 45 CFR 235.112 are revised accordingly including the distinction between regular and enhanced funding for pre-eligibility fraud detection activities. Training Programs for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled Staff development and training activities pertaining to the Adult Assistance programs conducted under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have historically been matched at the 75 percent Federal matching rate. Final rules on the transfer of these training provisions from the Handbook of Public Assistance Administration to the Code of Federal Regulations were published in the Federal Register on February 27, 1971 (36 FR 3863). These rules included the transfer of the 75 percent Federal financial participation rate. Section 13741 of OBRA&hyph;93 amended sections 3(a)(4), 1003(a)(3), 1403(a)(3), and 1603(a)(4) of the Social Security Act to reduce all of the Adult Assistance program enhanced Federal matching rates. This change includes the 75 percent Federal financial participation rate for training. That rate is changed to 50 percent. The funding provisions at 45 CFR 235.64 are revised accordingly. Regulatory Procedures Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The amendments to these regulations are being published as final rules. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), provides that, if the Department for good cause finds that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is unnecessary, impracticable or contrary to the public interest, it may dispense with such notice if it incorporates a brief statement of the reasons for doing so in the rules issued. The Department finds that there is good cause to dispense with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to these amendments. Publication of these rules in proposed form is unnecessary as the amendments simply implement the statutory provisions and do not involve administrative discretion. Executive Order 12866
