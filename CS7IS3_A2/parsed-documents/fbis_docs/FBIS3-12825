Speaking to IRNA, he said the bloodbath in al-Khalil [Hebron] was a pre-designed plot carried out by the Qods occupier forces. Shaqaqi said the Zionists were dissatisfied with the active presence of Palestinian Muslims at Prophet Ibrahim's (peace be upon him) mosque. They committed the horrible crime to strengthen their own presence in al-Khalil which houses 27 Jewish settlements, he said. He brushed aside the Zionist claim that the crime may have been carried by an individual and said the people who were present at the scene said that some militarymen opened fire on the crowd in the mosque. Elsewhere on reflection of the crime and its impact on the world, Shaqaqi said the shameful crime made Russia call, for the first time in the recent year, for international support for the Palestinian people living in the occupied lands.
