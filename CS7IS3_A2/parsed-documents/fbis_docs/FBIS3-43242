The loss of innocent life in such a cold-blooded manner is a grave indictment on our society. Such acts of naked terrorism serve only the interests of those who want to destabilise negotiations and prevent free and fair elections. As with all such attacks, whether they occur in the East Rand townships, in Natal or in the Cape, they must be immediately investigated and the perpetrators brought to book. It is regrettable that there seems to be a different response when such attacks occur in townships as compared with those that occur where whites are victims. In townships, when taverns or homes are attacked, it is attributed to "black on black" violence or party political rivalry, and virtually dismissed as routine. We commend the police for their high-level response to this criminal act, and would like to see the same level and intensity of response in the other instances of violence that claim so many lives daily. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the three women and a man, as yet unnamed, who lost their lives. We wish the injured a speedy recovery. The ANC will continue to do all in its power to bring an end to violence. Issued by: the Department of Information and Publicity, P.O. Box 61884, Marshalltown 2107, Johannesburg. 31 December 1993
