A. Manukyan; UDC 621.396.962.33:621.391.26] [Abstract] This paper studies the reverse problem of diffraction for local inhomogeneities rigidly attached to the surface of an object. The method of constructing a two-dimensional radar image is analyzed. The method is based on application of the synthesized aperture method to the development of a packet of broadband signals when one only knows the intensity of the reflected signal. The quality of the resultant image is studied. The limits imposed on the parameters of the discrete signal (to avoid an ambiguous measurement) are formulated. Modeling results are presented. Coherent one-dimensional and two-dimensional portraits are contrasted. Two-dimensional images are found to have a better resolution. Noncoherent images are poorer than coherent ones, as noncoherent images are plagued with false peaks and a decreased signal to noise ratio. Figures 6; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.
