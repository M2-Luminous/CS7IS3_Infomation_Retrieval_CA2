Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor; and Vice Governors Zhang Ruifeng, Wang Jiangong, Chen Jianguo and Wu Aiying, attended the meeting. Zhao Zhihao put forward specific demands on how to guarantee the fulfillment of various work tasks this year. Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The enterprise, financial, taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, pricing, housing reform and organizational reform measures issued this year have involved many levels and sectors, with many uncertainties. Only by going deeply to the reality to conduct investigations and studies, trying to find out the new situation and thoroughly grasping the new problems, can we be able to definitely guide the smooth implementation of reform. Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year is one for laying a good foundation for the establishment of the socialist market economic system. To guarantee the fulfillment of all tasks, we must give prominence to priorities and grasp the key aspects. Increasing the income of peasants is the central aspect in rural work to which we must give a prominent place. We should grasp the readjustment of internal agricultural structure and develop high-yield, fine-quality and highly efficient farming and township enterprises with one hand while grasping the work of reducing peasants' burdens with the other hand, and guarantee a great rise in the average per-capita income of peasants this year. The industrial sector should act in close connection with the product strategy and regard conducting structural readjustment, carrying out technological transformation and increasing efficiency as a priority, guarantee that the technological transformation tasks defined by the provincial party committee and government be carried out in places where needed, and strive to greatly raise our province's product quality grade, technological content and ratio of products in the market. In foreign economic and trade work, we should have new ideas and measures of developing export-oriented economy under the new situation, expand the scale and sphere of using foreign capital and guarantee that the creation of foreign exchange through export will be higher than the whole province's economic growth rate. The planning and banking work must be coordinated with the new situation of the country's reform of the investment and banking systems, grasp the strengthening of economic development momentum as the major aspect and guarantee the needs of funds for accelerating development. After the implementation of the revenue-sharing system, the financial departments should strive to cultivate financial resources, do a good job in increasing revenue and reducing expenditures and increasing investments in some weak aspects, including agriculture, science, technology, education and social security. Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The deeper we have conducted reform and the more we have developed the market eocnomy, the more we need to strengthen idological and political work and to persistently grasp the building of clean politics. In conducting anticorruption struggle and strengthening the building of clean politics, on the basis of consolidating the work achievements of the previous stage, we should make unremitting efforts to grasp it until good results are achieved. Vice Governor Chen Jianguo gave a speech on the whole province's technological transformation.
