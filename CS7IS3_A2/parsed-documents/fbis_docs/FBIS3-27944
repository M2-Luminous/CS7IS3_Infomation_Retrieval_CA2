Japan believes that because an assessment in relation to the objective criteria at the governmental level is expected to give rise to confrontation, it is necessary to set up a neutral arbitration body. However, negotiations on these criteria to guide the third-party organ are also expected to experience rough sailing because the United States wants to include virtual numerical targets in the objective criteria. The proposed third-party organ will assess the openness of the market based on the objective criteria to be set by both countries. Membership in this body will be decided later. There are suggestions that scholars and private companies be asked to belong to this organ. As for the specific objective criteria, Japan proposes to include the following: the actual volume of Japanese imports of finished cars and auto parts, the number of sales outlets dealing in imported cars, and the number of right-hand-drive cars and bantam cars tailored to the needs of the Japanese market. The third-party organ is supposed to assess performance every six months based on these criteria. Thus far in the framework talks negotiations, the United States has been persuading the Japanese automobile industry to set up a joint committee which will promote cooperation between private companies in both countries. It therefore does not consider the third-party organ merely a body for assessing the objective criteria but also expects it to act as an intermediary between companies. According to a government source, the U.S. Government shows great interest in creating a third-party organ. It "has also expressed the desire to set up assessment bodies for areas other than automobiles." However, the United States wants to include the future percentage of increases in sales of U.S. products in the objective criteria and to ask the third-party organ to assess performance in terms of the extent to which targets have been met. Japan rejects this, deeming that "this will, in fact, amount to numerical targets." There is still a wide gap between the two countries' views on the role of the third-party organ.
