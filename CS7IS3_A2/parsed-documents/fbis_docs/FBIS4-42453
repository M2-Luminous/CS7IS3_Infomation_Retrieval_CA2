The lawyer was Greek Ambassador to Albania Khristos Tsalikis, who was summoned to the Albanian Foreign Ministry the day before yesterday for "briefing" purposes. The German, French, Italian, British, U.S., Chinese, and Russian ambassadors were also briefed. The Greek ambassador, who is not accustomed to remaining silent, told Serreqi: "Mr. Minister, I am a lawyer myself and you will never convince me that anywhere in the world witnesses are summoned with a strong police force and cages." Commenting on Serreqi's statement that Athens cut off the Greek-Albanian dialogue, Tsalikis reminded him that the Greek side suggested a meeting between the two countries at the level of experts, which the Albanian side rejected. Replying to a remark by the Albanian minister that Greece was wrong to block European financial aid to Albania by taking advantage of its European Union [EU] presidency, the Greek ambassador said Greece had no reason to take advantage of the presidency but only made a suggestion as an EU member. All EU partners agreed with this suggestion... [ellipsis as published] What did Serreqi, who as a pediatrician has no obligation to know law or diplomacy, understand about this? The only one who is in a position to know is Albanian President Sali Berisha, who was briefed by the Albanian foreign minister yesterday morning.
