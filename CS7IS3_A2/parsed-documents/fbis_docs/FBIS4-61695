Korolkov; place and date not given: "From Opposition to Fruitful Work"] [Text] [Korolkov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, during consultative meetings with deputies from the "Russia" bloc, you were considered to be a real candidate for the post of the Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. By the way, your name was repeated both by independent deputies and deputies from working collectives and political parties. What is your opinion on this issue? [Klyuchnikov] Along with my candidacy, some other candidates were also discussed. In my opinion, this issue will be regulated by the beginning of the first session. I do not fear the thought that a number of candidates for this post could be fielded. The key issue is that the majority of deputies from the "Russia" bloc, other parties and national groups understand that a Supreme Soviet chairman should organize the work of the legislature basing not on the differences and confrontation but on consolidation of all sane forces for the sake of normal legislative work which is required for the implementation of reforms and realization of the election promises by Crimean President Yu. Meshkov. [Korolkov] You were one of the organizers of the Republican Movement of the Crimea [RDK] in August 1991. You put a lot of energy into the organization of this movement, headed the RDK Executive Council which has been the most popular opposition force in the Crimea recently. The RDK's ideas, along with the "Russia" bloc program, won. What are your next steps? [Klyuchnikov] It is necessary to popularize the RDK's ideas otherwise the Crimean residents will stop supporting us. It will be difficult to do this because we were in opposition for more than three years while currently we have to change our methods and begin working constructively and creatively. It will not be easy for many former oppositionists, and -- God save them! -- I wish their process of transformation be painless. If they do not manage to change, I suspect that, in spite of performing normal legislative work, they will occupy positions of dissatisfied deputies or critics because this is easier and less responsible. I wish that the "Russia" bloc, its followers, and those who support our principles of legislative work, will form the basis for performing sane and constructive work in the newly elected Crimean Supreme Soviet. [Korolkov] It means that the RDK's ideas are included in the "Russia" bloc program.... [Klyuchnikov] The election platform and "Russia" bloc program are wider than the RDK's ideas notably, that over the last three years, specific political changes took place. Nevertheless, we will not reject the key ideas of the RDK and will look for chances to realize them within the "Russia" bloc program supported by the majority of the Crimean voters during the presidential and Supreme Soviet campaigns. [Korolkov] What are the key political aims of the "Russia" bloc deputies' faction in the Crimean Supreme Soviet? [Klyuchnikov] There is no "Russia" bloc deputies' faction yet but it is being formed and its aims are detailed by the election program. This is a further development and establishment of the Crimean statehood. For us, the future of the Crimea can be only with union with Russia and other CIS states. We will draft and adopt our own laws on citizenship, local administration, detailed separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and deputy and state employees' status. The law on recall of deputies, which broadens the rights of the Crimean electorate, should be adopted by all means. The law on the Crimean constitutional court should become a guarantor of all Crimean laws and the Crimean constitution. [Korolkov] However, you will not achieve any of your policies if economic issues are not resolved. What should the Crimean legislature do in this respect? [Klyuchnikov] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's edicts laid the basis for resolving the Crimean issues. They should be reinforced by corresponding laws. It is very difficult to raise the standard of living through the acting budget and taxation system, for which Kiev rather than the Crimea should be blamed. In my opinion, the law on the Crimean Republican bank, which will be authorized to register subsidiaries of foreign banks, first of all, Russian ones, should become one of our first laws. To reconstruct resorts and other production sectors, we should seek to attract large investments to the Crimea on a legal footing and establish a system of legal benefits for investors. When adopting economic laws, we should first of all consider the interests of the Crimean producers. To do this, we should draft and adopt the law on protection of rights of Crimean producers. I admit that the work on drafting laws regarding privatization and implementation of reforms in the agrarian sector will be very difficult. Nevertheless, we hope to avoid mistakes which had been made in other CIS states, and, considering our experts's experience, we will draft laws appropriate to the specific economy of the Crimea and its population. [Korolkov] What is your vision of the future foreign policy of the Crimea? [Klyuchnikov] We will support Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's signing of treaties with Russia and Ukraine. Our main goal is the resolving of the dire domestic problems -- primarily, economic ones -- of the Crimea at the expense of its foreign policy. In particular, this concerns the program regarding the return of the deported peoples. Crimean foreign policy should bolster the resolving of the issues regarding the Black Sea Fleet, stationing of military units, environmental protection, in a word, all the issues which the Crimea cannot resolve independently. We hope that Russia will assist us in our foreign policy. [Korolkov] Your friends from the Union of Afghan War Veterans say that you begin your work at six in the morning and finish at 10 in the evening. Is it really so? [Klyuchnikov] I have such days, especially, of late. The work in the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers, the People's Party of the Crimea, which, along with the RDK, to set up the election bloc "Russia." [as published] But I have no right to forget the problems of Afghan war veterans. The state promised to resolve these problems but forgot about its promises. We have to earn the money to help our Afghan war veterans, the families of those who perished, and socially protect them. [Korolkov] My last question is of a personal character: Have you time for your family? [Klyuchnikov] Of course. I have two children, two growing up as Crimean residents, and I never forget about them. I wish they can grow and live in the happy land of the Crimea in peace and friendship with all peoples who live on our land of plenty and be happier than we are. I am an optimist even though I had to overcome many hardships but I believe in the future and fight for it.
