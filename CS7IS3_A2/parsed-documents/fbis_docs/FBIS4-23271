The negotiating teams have already resumed their talks, but only at the level of heads of delegation. With the presence of the mediator and observers, the heads of the government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] teams once again discussed UNITA's Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. Agreement has been reached, and tomorrow night the last day Vorgan will be discussed. Should that be the case, the negotiators will begin discussing UNITA's participation in government. On 28 May the government sent a document to UNITA through the mediator, stating what ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios it would give that organization within the framework of national reconciliation. To prevent further delays, President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos sent a special envoy to Lusaka. He is General (Gopelipa), who delivered the document to Beye. The UN representative received the document and locked it in his drawer, only delivering it to UNITA on 31 May. The UNITA negotiating team is assessing the government proposal. Jorge Valentim says it is not a bad proposal because obstacles have been removed. What matters is that the war should end. The talks will continue tomorrow, but only at the level of heads of delegations and the mediator.
