FBIS4-59192 "drnes091_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 7 May 1994 SYRIA Yemenis Urged To Resort to `Dialogue, Reason' Yemenis Urged To Resort to `Dialogue, Reason' JN0705121294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0448 GMT 7 May 94 JN0705121294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] In an article today under the headline "Yemen's Unity First," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the Yemeni people have no interest in the shedding of brothers' blood and the destruction of civil and military installations. It says: Certainly, it is not the Yemeni people who ordered aircraft and tanks to bombard and shell military units and airports in the south and the north. The Yemenis, who restored unity to both parts of their country, did so without firing one single bullet, and without fighting between military units from the northern or southern parts. They have restored the confidence of the Arab masses in the possibility of achieving comprehensive Arab unity. AL-THAWRAH wonders: Why has the language of violence and blood become the only language between parties in the coalition government in Yemen? Why has Yemen quickly slipped into a comprehensive war, in which the air force, tanks, and other weapons were used? This war has claimed the lives of hundreds of peoples and inflicted grave losses on the country. The paper says: What is taking place in fraternal Yemen confirms that the bloodshed is not in the interest of the country. The blood of the homeland's sons is the possession of this homeland. Safeguarding Yemen's unity cannot take place by escalating the crisis and expanding battlefields. The Yemenis have restored their unity. So, why are they forced to separate and partition their country with guns and aircraft? Who will be responsible for the bleeding from the arteries of both the southern and northern Yemeni people? AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Yemeni leadership had better take into account the difficult situation the Arab nation is experiencing in its battle with Israel, which adheres to the ideology of expansion and of fragmenting the Arab nation. This is especially true since the bloody Yemeni events will further weaken the Arab position, when the nation is seeing cases of capitulation to the Israeli enemy, and the reception of its civil and military delegations in some Arab capitals. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: In the same way that Yemen's unity is the possession of the Yemeni people, it is also the possession of the entire Arab nation. The Yemeni leadership is responsible for safeguarding and reinforcing it through the adoption of principles and the establishment of the state of institutions and law. Arabs, through the Arab League, are also called upon to stand on the side of their Yemeni brothers and to assist them so they can overcome threats to their unity and to stop the shedding of their blood. The interest of Yemen and the Yemenis must be placed above all other considerations. In its editorial today under the headline "Yemeni Unity Is More Important Than People", the newspaper TISHRIN writes on the development of the political conflict in Yemen into armed clashes in which the air force and artillery are taking place, as if the country was heading toward a civil war. TISHRIN says: Syria has several times appealed to the brothers in Yemen to resort to dialogue, reason, national logic, and pan-Arab conscience, and to reject means of violence. President Hafiz al-Asad has more than once contacted Yemeni officials and urged them to resort to reason and wisdom, and to put the Yemeni people's interests above any other considerations. TISHRIN stresses that the Yemeni people's interests lie in their unity, and that a fragmented and bleeding Yemen is an element of weakness for Yemenis and the Arab nation. It says: Had the Arabs been united today, taking into consideration that they are one nation, they would not have been in a weak position to sign something that conflicts with their people's aspirations and nation's objectives, and to yield to the dictates of foreigners, invaders, and those who covet their land and resources. TISHRIN adds: The simplest Yemeni or Arab citizen knows full well that Yemen's interests lie in its unity and cohesion among its citizens. So, how can Yemeni officials ignore this? They are supposed to be an example to be followed, not a tool for the destruction of the unity of one people. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria, along with all Arabs, appeals to the brothers in Yemen to resort to the language of dialogue and reason, not the language of aircraft, tanks, and guns. Nothing is more painful than fighting among the sons of the one country. Arabs have in Lebanon's bitter experience something which should be an eloquent lesson for anyone willing to learn a lesson.
