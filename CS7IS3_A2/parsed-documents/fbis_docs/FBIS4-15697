The dry figures lead to interesting speculation--there will be more about them a little later; first, the main thing. The main thing is that Novosibirsk residents elected only 10 of the 25 deputies to the city Assembly. These 10 of the people's elect will soon receive temporary certificates, but it is still too early to say anything definite about the organ we elected, or even simply to state whether it exists or not! The fact is that there simply are no regulatory documents--they apparently forgot to write them. So SOMETHING exists in Novosibirsk, but we can say nothing about the details. For now the mayor has added some clarity: Viktor Tolokonskiy stated that the deputies must begin their work and that he personally will do everything necessary to make sure that this happens as quickly as possible. 1. ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR VOTED... Of the 1,065,304 registered voters, 267,977 were not too lazy to come to the electoral precincts. This is only 25.2 percent of the overall number of voters. And if that were not bad enough, some of our compatriots preferred either to destroy their ballots or take them for souvenirs, as a result of which the electoral commissions, to their regret, found in the ballot boxes (the word is somehow fitting) an even smaller percentage--22.8 percent. But the rayons voted in different ways. For example, residents of Zayeltsovskiy Rayon contrived to elect all three of their deputies and the residents of Pervomayskiy and Tsentralnyy Rayons elected their one each. That was the maximum, and then came: Kalininskiy--two out of three, Dzerzhinskiy--one out of two, Sovetskiy--the same, Oktyabrskiy--one out of three. Three rayons were left out of the game: Residents of Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon were unable to elect their one deputy; Kirovskiy residents elected none of their three deputies; and voters of Leninskiy Rayon failed to elect even one out of five.... 2. DEPUTIES Be that as it may, we did manage to elect 10 deputies. We have published the lists so there is no point in repeating them; let us note only the most interesting details. In the first place, 11 deputies from the former city soviet were vying for mandates at the same time: the largest number--three--in Kalininskiy Rayon, and not a single one in Pervomayskiy, Tsentralnyy, or Zheleznodorozhnyy. Only one of them was ultimately successful: Vasiliy Krivoshchekov was elected in Kalininskiy Rayon. Second, only three of the deputies were nominated by voter associations. That same Krivoshchekov was nominated by the Club of Deputies and Voters, Georgiy Chulinin--Russia's Choice, and Aleksandr Mankov--Working Novosibirsk. Third, the city's mayor confirmed his authority and a good deal of popularity: Viktor Tolokonskiy in competition with three opponents was able to win 51.7 percent of the votes. Let us note also that Nadezhda Boltenko in Zayeltsovskiy Rayon was able to pass up two former city soviet deputies at once: She won more votes than both of the aforementioned deputies together. Aleksandr Mankov also won over two former deputies, but in Kalininskiy Rayon. And in general the voters preferred to see in the city Assembly people who are removed from the political battles: Many of them work in production. 3. GEOGRAPHY Political geography is an extremely curious thing. Take, for example, Dzerzhinskiy Rayon: In three districts communists solidly gathered 22-32 percent, holding second places. In Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon the one with the largest number of votes was the representative from the Yavlinskiy bloc, Gennadiy Popov, and in Zayeltsovskiy preference was given to independent candidates. Quite diverse people won in Kalininskiy while the administration chief, Vladimir Afanasyev, won easily in Kirovskiy, garnering more than 40 percent of the votes. In Sovetskiy, on the contrary, administrators met with complete defeat and the chief of the administration and his deputy lost. Oktyabrskiy Rayon made an interesting decision; here the general director of the Novosibirsk directorate of Mosbiznesbank, Anatoliy Zvyagin, became a deputy, and in another district the leader was Vasiliy Vereteno, who was nominated by the Siberian branch of the International Association of Enterprise Leaders. 4. SYMPATHIES An interesting picture emerges here too. True, it is necessary to do one thing: We will count those who gathered the most votes in their district but still did not become deputies because of a confluence of circumstances (voter apathy, poor positioning of the stars, etc.) but simply the winners. This simplifies things considerably: Ultimately the discussion can be only about sympathies. Well, let us publish, as they say, the whole list. The anti-Yeltsin opposition had a serious stake in the elections to the city Assembly. Although, true, they still could not reach agreement among themselves. As a result the communists would put up one person, Working Novosibirsk--two, and Homeland--one. The oblast organization of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation ran seven candidates--one took first, three took second, and three failed. Working Novosibirsk received two firsts, two seconds, and again three failed. Homeland's indicators are not as good: one first, one second, and five "zilch." Representatives of the National Salvation Front and the Novosibirsk people's assembly lost solidly.... The Liberal Democratic Party, which intended to install three of its members as deputies, suffered a painful defeat--all of its candidates did badly, and the leader, Kirill Volobuyev, in his own electoral district received half as many votes as his only opponent. Now let us look at the other side. Democrats received five first places: two for Club of Deputies and Voters, and one each for Russia's Choice, Yavlintsy, and Forum. Only the candidate from Democratic Russia won no laurels. Russia's Choice gained a first and a second place. The ones that looked weakest were the candidates from the Forum voter club: one first place and two failures. Note that the SOTSPROF trade union failed: a second place and two "zilch" and the same fate befell the only candidate from Unity. And for the Club of Deputies and Voters the indicators are these: two first places and an equal number of failures. As for the administrators, here not everything is so simple. The mayor won quite confidently, the head of the administration was also on top, but the head of the administration of Sovetskiy Rayon lost by a mile to his only opponent. As for their deputies, one out of the four took second place. In general there are stable sympathies for the center and the people who were able to convince the voters that they were the "movers and shakers." If all the deputies had been elected, the two administrators would have been joined by 12 independent (from whom?) deputies, six representatives of democratic blocs, and four from the opposition. Now a little about the details. In face-to-face confrontations between supporters of the current reforms and representatives of the opposition the former won six times and the later won four times. Seven times the opposition kept itself from winning. The Communist Party, Working Novosibirsk, and Homeland frequently battled against one another, apparently remaining true to the old ideological principle: "And who the hell are you?" Another interesting detail: Young leaders of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and RCWP [Russian Communist Workers Party] (nonetheless already the top people in their parties) ran in two districts--the chairman of the Novosibirsk branch of the former, Kirill Bolobuyev, and the secretary of the oblast committee of the latter, Sergey Krupenko. Both suffered serious defeats and both lost to women: a teacher and a physician. Women, incidentally, came in first in seven out of 25 cases. 5. CONTINUATION FOLLOWS There will apparently be nothing to report on the Novosibirsk Assembly itself in the near future, but we will definitely try to tell you about the deputies and their work.
