A: I believe that the United States is already taking a very active role in trying to bring about peace in the region. And I hope that we'll see some results soon. Q: But, Your Majesty, our secretary of state, Mr. Christopher, has just recently said in Oslo, where he went to the funeral of the foreign minister of Norway, that this is not the U.S. role. This is the role of Israel and the Palestinians. Do you agree with that? Shouldn't the U.S. do more, sir? And did you not advise the president to do more when you saw him on Friday [21 January]? A: Obviously the United States is a very important element in helping parties in the region arrive at peace. But in terms of the Oslo agreement, it was an agreement reached between Israel and the PLO and the Palestinians. And I really hope that they can work out all the details that are needed with the help and support of the United States, and all of us, in fact. Q: But you don't want President Clinton and the State Department to do any more in an effort to push this process ahead than they're doing now. Is that what you're telling us, sir? A: What I'd like is exactly the opposite. I'd like continued interest and concern and the spirit of a partnership to continue to exist and manifest itself in the difficult times ahead at this year [as published], very crucial moment. Q: Your Majesty, Yasir 'Arafat, the head of the PLO, has come in for some criticism on the way he has conducted the negotiations with the Israelis. Do you personally have confidence in Mr. 'Arafat? A: I think that this is up to the Palestinians to decide, his Palestinian constituency. But I have tried to advise him, to the best of my ability, to try to realise that he has a changed role now. He represents Palestinains both in the occupied territories and in the diaspora. They should all be a part of the coming phase in terms of their views and feelings, particularly those who have endured 26 years of occupation; and at the same time, hopefully that we'll be able to delegate responsibility so that people are able to see progress and movement in dealing with the many problems that should be addressed, particularly when withdrawal begins. There has to be immediately a qualitative change in the lives of people that means the beginning of peace. Q: Do you think he has taken that advice that he should alter and change his role? A: I believe that essentially this is what he has heard from me in the frankest possible way. He has also heard it from and is hearing it from many friends of Palestine, the Palestinian cause, and Palestinians themselves. Q: There have been published reports that many Arab leaders are unhappy with Yasir 'Arafat for demanding Palestinian independence. Do you share that point of view? A: No, I don't share that point of view at all. I believe that it is the right of the Palestinians to decide what their future fate should be and that is a achoice, as far as we are concerned in Jordan, that was made in 1974 at the Rabat Arab Summit when all the Arab states supported Palestinians and recognising the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine. And we accepted that and have supported it ever since. Q: One last question on that point, sir. It's been reported that you had issued a virtual ultimatum to Yasir 'Arafat, saying that he should be more conciliatory, more cooperative in the negotiations. Is that true? A: We have had recently some very frank exchanges, and I hope that they have helped. Certainly they have helped in getting us to a point where we have agreement on a number of essential elements regarding Palestinian-Jordanian relations and our role in helping the people in the occupied territories regarding banks, for example, that are in the open. Q: Your Majesty, the foreign minister of Syria, Mr. al-Shara', journeyed to Amman, the capital of Jordan, in the last few days to report on his meeting, on President al-Asad's meeting with President Clinton, to your brother Crown Prince Hasan. Tell us, sir, what did the two presidents agree to? A: I have the impression that the meeting went very, very well, that there were very frank talks. And I believe that the Syrian position has been made clear by President al-Asad in the terms of a real desire and commitment to the cause of a just, durable peace, a comprehensive peace; but also that Syria is prepared to ratify a peace treaty when it recovers its lost territory and when that problem is solved. Q: Well, do you think it surprising, in view of what you just said, that the Israeli government, from Prime Minister Rabin on down, has been very, very cautious in assessing the Clinton-al-Asad meeting in Geneva? They don't seem very impressed. A: I believe that the results of the meeting were very encouraging. This is what I've heard from President al-Asad. I'd spoken to him before and I have heard from him since, and also from President Clinton, whom I had the pleasure of meeting a short while ago. Q: So can you tell us, sir, that you would expect some kind of beginning of serious negotiations for Israel to get off the Golan Heights and for Syria to give Israel true peace in the next few weeks?" A: I hope that this would be the case. Q: Hope. But what's your prediction? A: I don't have all the details, but I believe that negotiations are going to begin very, very shortly. And I think they will be at much more serious and determined level. Q: Just one more on that, Your Majesty. Are you convinced that Israel, in fact, will withdraw from the Golan Heights entirely? Are you convinced of that, sir? A: I know that the Golan Heights are of a Syrian territory. And obviously the question is territory for peace. That's part of 242. But beyond that, how it will be worked out is something for the negotiators, I believe, to ascertain. Q: You met on Friday with President Clinton. You have been critical in the past of some American Presidents for tilting too much toward israel. How do you assess President Clinton in that regard? A: I am most impressed. I believe that he is a genuine person. He has already got at the tips of his hands all the information regarding the area. He has studied. He's looked into all the problems, the different points of view. And I believe that he is determined to do whatever he can, together with the United States, to help bring about a just, honourable, lasting peace in our region. Q: Do you think he has a mindset that is even-handed as between the Arab side and the israeli side? A: I believe he has great integrity and he's able to see the different views. And the challenge, I suppose, is to try to reconcile them in the times ahead. Q: Continuing to look at the overview, sir, is this a--have the Arabs and the Israelis embarked on an irreversible procedure toward peace, or are we at a critical phase now that it could go either way, in your opinion? A: As far as I am concerned, I am totally committed for it to going one way, and that is the way towardes peace. I think that if it goes any other way, it would be the end for the entire region. Q: It would be a disaster? A: It would be a disaster. Q: Well, let me ask you this, Your Majesty. If the PLO-Israeli talks cannot get back on track and there can't be a deal on Jericho and Gaza and the beginnings of Palestinian independence, will you sign a treaty with Israel, between Jordan and Israel? Can you wait forever for the Palestinians? A: Sir, we started at the same point in time. We started at Madrid; we, the Palestinians and all the other parties to the conflict. Later on, Oslo saw the Palestinians move ahead and assume their own responsibilities regarding their rights on their soil. We supported that. We ratified the agenda. So we are moving on our own, really. We are looking at this agenda and we hope that we will cover all the items there. We have a difference, I believe, with Israel in the fact that we have been invited to ratify a peace treaty. We would like to see what that peace treaty contains, and we would like to work up from the issues that are there to have the crowning achievement be the peace treaty. When we are ready and when our efforts are successful and completed, I believe we would have peace. Q: Would you say to us, sir, there is no chance of Jordan ever signing a separate peace treaty with Israel under any conditions if the negotiations on the West Bank and Gaza are unsuccessful? A: I certainly hope they will be successful, and I certainly hope at the same time that we will be able to cover the Jordanian-Israeli differences and problems that beset both sides. And obviously there is a dimension that links us to the Palestinian- Israeli effort at this stage. I hope things will move, and I'm sure they will move. Q: Your Majesty, excuse me. It is impossible that you would sign a treaty with Israel without progress and some kind of a solution on the West Bank. Is that what you're telling us? A: Let me put it another way. I believe that a solution is coming, and I believe that we will ratify a peace treaty probably at the end of this year or maybe next year. Q: Your Majesty, one of the low points, perhaps the lowest points in the long and friendly relationship between your Kingdom and the United States, came during the Gulf war. Do you feel now that the United States should take a more positive attitude in trying to make peace with Iraq and Saddam Husayn, or do you think that's impossible? A: I wouldn't care to comment on this particular problem. I certainly have worried and have been very, very deeply concerned about the fate of the people of Iraq so far in their suffering that grows. But I'm sure this problem will be resolved. Q: Are you ever in touch with Saddam Husayn? A: I haven't been in touch recently. Q: One other point, Your Majesty. The Iranian government has sent a very large diplomatic mission to your country, to Amman, the capital of Jordan. it's headed by an ambassador who was active in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in 1979 and who, I am told, participated in the planning of the attack on the U.S. embassy in Beirut. is there any chance sir, as I'm told, that you would like that mission from Iran reduced because the fundamentalists who occupy that embassy are not for peace, they are against peace? A: Nothing has happened in that direction so far. And the ambassador is in Jordan and he's behaving as an ambassador should so far. But we are watching, obviously, the dimension of our relations with Iran. We would have liked them to be based on an agreement, clear at the highest levels as to where the green lines are, where the red lines are, where our differences are. And I hope that this will come at some point. But in the meantime, we will not permit our country to be jeopardised in terms of its internal sovereignty. Q: Are they agitating? A: I don't think they are at the moment. We haven't seen anything that would suggest that. Q: Your Majesty, the United States secretary of commerce, Ron Brown, was in Cairo on Thursday and he said the following: "The Arab Boycott of Israel is coming apart." Do you agree with that? A: I think inevitably it will come about in te context of progress towards achieving peace. But there are several areas that have to be covered. If you talk about, for example, Jordan and Israel, we have to work out a balance in terms of our trade and our -- they have a protectionist approach towards their products. [sentence as published] They have denied us the chance that they would wish for their products to come into our area. All these things have to be worked out, particularly with regard to the Palestinian dimension. But regarding foreign companies operating in the area, I think that is changing and altering in the right direction. Q: Do you think that progress can be made there before an agreement, peace agreements are signed? A: Regarding outside companies? Q: Yes. A: I believe it's happening gradually. Q: Your Majesty--excuse me, sir. Your Majesty, B.B. Netanyahu, the head of the Likud party, was in Washington this past week and made the statement that if he were prime minister, he would not return one inch of land on the Golan Heights to Syria. Would you tell us sir, do you think a switch in party control in Israel would endanger the peace process? A: If this is their approach, obviously it would. Q: It would. A: It would yes. Q: Could you amplify that, sir? A: Well, then it would mean that a very serious obstacle would be placed in the path of peace. And what we are searching for is a comprehensive peace in the region, which includes Syria, lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian dimension, Israel, together with everyone else. Q: And Prime Minister Rabin's immediate political future depends on success, doesn't it? A: I believe that.
