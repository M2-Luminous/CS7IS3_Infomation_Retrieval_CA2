Present at the meeting were Vice Governors Wang Xueping, Chen Suhou, and Liu Mingqi, as well as Liu Xuebin, Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and special assistant to the governor. Persons in charge of relevant government departments attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates. Since the founding of Hainan Province and the establishment of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, Hainan's economy has developed rapidly and its work to help the poor has made relatively great progress, with over 1.1 million people having managed to shake off poverty. Nevertheless, as our province has a weak foundation for development and development varies from locality to locality, the task is still very arduous. To speed up the pace of shaking off poverty and achieving common prosperity in the rural areas, the provincial government has decided to spend seven years (1994-2000) to reach the goal of raising the rural areas out of poverty. Governments at all levels and departments were urged to regard the help-the-poor work as part of their work, make concerted efforts, do solid work, and contribute to the realization of the help-the-poor- through-development program. This year our province has registered a drastic increase in the floating population, and the number of births outside the state plan among the floating population has reached serious proportions. According to the state's family planning management methods and the requirements of Hainan's family planning regulations, the provincial government has formulated and will promulgate Hainan Province's detailed rules and regulations of implementation concerning the management of family planning among the floating population, so as to effectively manage family planning work among the floating population.
