The UTD holds three out of the 19 ministerial posts. In a communique, it reaffirmed that it belonged to the "parliamentary majority" which is made up of six UTD and 34 Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] parliamentarians. The CAR has fallen out with Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and refused to join the cabinet. It rejects the premier's claim of belonging to the "parliamentary majority." In addition to the three UTD ministers, the new cabinet includes eight "independent" parliamentarians and eight ministers who are close allies of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. The UTD implicitly called on CAR to rescind its decision saying the first priority now was to "fill the political vacuum and put an end to country's social and economic ruin." The party was pleased that it was an open government, in which "the people are broadly represented by ministers chosen on the basis of competence and efficiency." Just as Premier Edem Kodjo stated yesterday, the UTD also expressed its determination to implement the government policy formulated in collaboration with the CAR.
