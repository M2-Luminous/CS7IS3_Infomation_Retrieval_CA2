The clause's objective would be to lay down stipulations prohibiting forced labour and the employment of minors to be contained in the international regulations that govern world trade. "In a world in which commercial exchange takes on a global dimension and markets no longer have frontiers, commercial activity could prove a forceful means of promoting social innovation and improving conditions for the weaker sections of society in the poorer countries," the European Parliament declared in defence of its request.
