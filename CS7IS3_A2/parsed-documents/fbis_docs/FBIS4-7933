Hungary's electoral system incorporates both a simple majority system used in Britain and France, and a proportionate system, applied in other European states. This combined method is completed by an admission threshold similar to Germany's. The 1989 Hungarian Election Act originally set forth four percent of the votes for each party as a minimum for gaining entrance into Parliament. In January 1994, this minimum was raised to five percent. The electoral law has undergone minor changes since 1990. Keeping the principle of proportional representation in view, the law aims at preventing mandates from being scattered among too many parties. To achieve this, a two-round electoral system was introduced, enabling the electorate to vote for individuals as well as for party lists. As in 1990, of 386 seats rivalled for, this year 176 will be filled by candidates in individual constituencies. Individual candidates can be entered until April 9. Candidates can either be put up by parties and other political organizations, or enter the elections independently. To be qualified as a candidate, at least 750 recommendations have to be collected beforehand. This year, 130 parties wish to enter candidates. In 1990, 28 out of 65 parties could enter at least one individual candidate but only twelve were able to draw up national lists and six reached the four percent threshold. To win the first round and consequently a mandate, candidates have to poll over 50 percent of the votes. (In 1990, there were only five first-round winners.) If none of the candidates obtain an absolute majority, a run-off will follow with all candidates reaching 15 percent in the first round. Should fewer candidates poll the 15 percent minimum, the top three are eligible for the second round. As a result, losers of the first round still play a determining role, as they can encourage their supporters to back another candidate in the second leg. Besides fielding individual candidates, parties also draw up regional lists in 19 counties and Budapest. A party is qualified to put forward a regional list if it fields a candidate in at least 25 percent of individual constituencies of the given region. 152 seats are available through such lists. To lose the least amount of total votes, 58 members of Parliament will be elected through national lists, which can be drawn up by parties having at least seven regional lists out of the 20. All the fractional votes are to be distributed among national-list candidates. According to analyses, the major parties are to run a tougher race this year than four years ago. Recent polls show that at least six parties could reach the five percent minimum. Such a close contest might see the ballots of the half a million first-time voters as determining the final outcome. Experts say that people living in a more settled condition and having a higher level of education exercise their electoral rights to a greater extent. Public polls also show that with the elections approaching, the number of citizens who are willing to vote and have considered their choice is growing. Voting is not an obligation but a right in Hungary as in most European states. In 1990, 63 percent of the total electorate turned out for the first round of the general elections, and 46 percent in the second. Analysts and polls forecast a 65-70 percent participation rate for this year. In February 1994, electoral offices were opened to prepare for the collection of recommendation slips from March 9 to April 9. Party campaigns are vigorously strengthening at meetings, on posters and through the media. They will stop only on the day before the elections, due to the Hungarian electoral law which states campaigning must be suspended for 24 hours preceding the election.
