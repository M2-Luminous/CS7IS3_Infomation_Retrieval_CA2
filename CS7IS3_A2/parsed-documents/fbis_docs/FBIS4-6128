Is Japan's market really closed, or are the trade frictions caused by the lack of U.S. efforts? We have assessed how the Japanese market is open in sectors criticized by the United States -- automobiles, plate glass, semiconductors, and medical and telecommunications equipment. Imported Cars Become Popular Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said as follows on 30 March: "There is virtually no progress.... Above all, I was disappointed with Japan's achievement in auto imports." The United States did not accept Japanese automakers' "voluntary action plan for purchasing U.S.-made products." In the trade barriers report, the U.S. Government focused on Japanese "auto dealers." The United States is scheduled to review its trade barrier list in September, and Japan's auto dealers may be listed as one of the unfair industrial sectors. However, our field research showed that actual market trends are somewhat different from the harsh tone of intergovernment negotiations. President Toshiro Nakada of the Honda Crio Tokyo Company said: "We have excellent responses from our customers. Of course, the Cherokee brings us a handsome profit." Honda Crio dealers began to sell Chrysler four-wheel-drive models in 1990. At that time, they really became sick of frequent customer claims of mechanical troubles and an inadequate supply of spare parts. However, changes took place in last 12 months. The Autorama Seijo Company (president: Tomotoshi Ono, with its office in Setagaya, Tokyo) is also doing well in its sales of Ford models. This Ford dealership had been a burden on the company until six months ago, but the Taurus suddenly became popular among customers in the thirties and forties age group. At present, imported cars make up 60 percent of total sales, and they are improving the company's business performance. While Japanese automakers are suffering from a prolonged sales slump, U.S. automakers have succeeded in improving the quality of their products. Japanese auto dealers are well aware of such market trends, and they want to "deal in profitable cars, no matter where they are from." In this connection, the Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Company has recently decided to sell Ford cars because the company has too many employees and dealerships to sell only domestic cars. Statistics released by the Fair Trade Commission state that 2,010 domestic auto dealers (55.6 percent of the auto dealers in Japan) deal in foreign-made automobile. However, most of them are doing so because of business ties-up concluded between their parent companies and foreign automakers. Japan is the only nation where foreign automakers have to sell their own cars through local automakers. In this sense, Japanese automakers and dealers still form a great "keiretsu" barrier against foreign automakers. A senior official of a European automaker in Japan said: "It is true that the Japanese market is exclusionary. But the Big Three have to try harder." European automakers have been building their sales network in Japan since the 1980's. In most cases, however, their achievements have been business carried out by dealer networks of Japanese automakers. Direct franchise contracts between European automakers and Japanese dealers do not exceed 40 cases. Strong Financial Dependence on Automakers Japanese auto dealers have been taking a passive attitude toward dealing with foreign-made automobiles. This was partly because the competitive appeal of Japanese-made cars was still strong, but the primary reason was strong ties between Japanese automakers and subsidiary dealers. When an auto dealer thinks about dealing in imported cars, it has to take into account the reaction of its parent company. Honda dealers began to deal in Chrysler models because the Honda Motor Company had started to take part in the supply of spare parts. Because the Toyota Motor Company has sales ties-up with Volkswagen and General Motors (GM), Toyota dealers cannot take a positive attitude toward dealing in Ford cars. The Japanese auto market is unique in that a few dealers cover large areas. In the U.S. and European markets, "responsible coverage areas" are assigned to each shop, but Toyota and Nissan usually have only one dealer in each prefecture, and each prefectural dealer runs many branch shops. Dealers have to open many branch shops because automakers assign targets for regional market share. The financial needs for business expansion tend to create dealers' excessive dependence on automakers. The Japanese auto parts market is closed to foreign companies, and this is also caused by the fact that the Japanese auto market is controlled by a small number of dealers. Japan's "parts makers companies" are usually established by automakers and local dealers, and this makes automaker-dealer ties even stronger. U.S. Wants Direct Contracts With Dealers As seen in the trade barriers report, the United States is seeking direct franchise contracts with dealers without the intervention of Japanese automakers. The U.S. report defines a "fair market" as being where dealers can make their own decisions. Under the present circumstances, the United States would not be convinced by Japan's claim that "U.S. automakers have free access to the Japanese market." From the standpoint of the United States, the "fairness" of Japan's manufacturer-led market would look suspicious. A major Toyota dealer in the metropolitan area said: "We want a free hand from the parent company. We wish the manufacturer would make no complaint about our imported car business." Japanese automakers had better just introduce local dealers to U.S. automakers and let them freely discuss their own business affairs. This may appear to be a conservative method, but the United States may trust it better than the automakers' action plan, which was designed as a set of figures.
