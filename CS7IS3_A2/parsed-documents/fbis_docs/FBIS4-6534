He said, "Although prospects remain uncertain for resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the minutes of the meeting show that at various points in his remarks, Mr. Kantor showed his willingness to work for setting the framework talks in order." He thus indicated that there has been a change in the U.S. position. With regard to the resumption of the talks, he said, "Both Japan and the United States have to come up with ideas on how to formulate the objective criteria. They should narrow their gap through behind-the-scenes contacts." He stressed the need to come up with points of compromise through unofficial discussions. On the issue of reducing Japan's current accounts surplus, Matsuura reiterated that "Japan should not set a numerical target." He pointed out that "what is important is to adopt policies which will produce actual results in reducing the surplus in each quarter of the year." As to the microeconomic sectors, he said, "If possible, measures, even in the financial services and other non-priority sectors, should be compiled before July."
