After the severe recession in 1993, Bonn is expecting economic growth of 0.5 to 1 percent this year in western Germany and 6 to 8 percent in eastern Germany, but there is still an unemployment figure for western Germany, which will be up to 450,000 higher. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer has said at the session of the economic cabinet of the federal government in Bonn on Friday [21 January] that the Bundesbank fully agreed with the outlines of the government's annual economic report, Vogel told the media. Tietmeyer said this applied, in particular, to avoiding forced interest rate reductions and to a policy of devaluation. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who chaired the session, stressed, according to Vogel, "the firm intention of the government to adhere to the cooperation between the government and the Bundesbank, as in the past." Vogel said Economic Affairs Minister Guenther Rexrodt told the economic cabinet, which includes 10 of the 19 government ministers, that the starting point for economic development this year was "relatively favorable." This applied to both eastern and western Germany. In eastern Germany, however, there was still no self-sustaining upturn in sight. [passage omitted] The government's main justification for its relatively optimistic assessment of the economy in the draft annual economic report is "better prospects for exports." The economic situation was improving in most parts of the world and slowly in Europe too. The economic revival was increasing investment activity. This fitted in with the type of goods German industry offers. For this reason, Bonn is expecting a rise in exports of 3 to 4 percent in real terms in 1994, following a fall of 11.1 percent last year. [passage omitted] The government is expecting, at best, a small increase in investment in the company sector in western Germany and a rise of 12 to 14 percent in eastern Germany. This means a rise of 3 to 4 percent in real terms for all of Germany. On the other hand, public investment would fall markedly because of the difficult budgetary situation. There was no indication of a rise in infrastructural investment in eastern Germany either, where it had risen so much in the last three years.
