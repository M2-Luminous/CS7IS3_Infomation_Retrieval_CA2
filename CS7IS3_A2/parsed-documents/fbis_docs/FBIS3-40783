This follows the commission being convinced that the revision of rolls in March and April this year by the Delhi administration had been done in a "gravely unsystematic, slip-shod and unacceptable manner." The commission has thus placed on record its "severest displeasure" against all those officers responsible for the defective rolls and its intention to proceed against them separately. The fresh revision, which entails house-to-house enumeration, will be carried out under the detailed supervision of its observers, and publication of the draft and the final rolls will not be done without the commission's "specific written clearance" for each of the 70 assembly constituencies. It has also warned that any defect in the rolls so published will invite the "most serious consequences." The commission has said that the house-to-house enumeration should begin on April 4, 1994, and the final publication of rolls be completed by October 20, 1994. The CEO has been directed to stick to the deadline. The commission has pointed out that it had received an "extremely large number" of complaints regarding defects in the preparation of the rolls and these continue to "pour in every day." "The nature of these complaints regarding the electoral rolls, as published on March 9 and April 2 this year are proof that the work of revision has been carried out in a slip-shod and unacceptable manner," it noted. It lists them as: --Omission of names of persons, who have been residing at the same address for the last 20 years or more, of whole localities and blocks of buildings, continuance of names of dead persons and related and multiple duplication of identical names in rolls of several constituencies. --Names included in the draft rolls had been left out in the final rolls without any orders. --Number of cases where the particulars of voters such as name, age, father's name, sex, etc., are either wrong or defective. The complaints received were from representatives from all walks of life, including but not restricted to ministers, defence service personnel, associations of residents of established colonies and political parties. Besides, newspaper reports too had pointd out these omissions, the commission noted. The programme for the revision of the rolls is: house-to-house enumeration (from April 4 to May 18); verification of citizenship status by the authorities concerned and preparation of manuscripts and printing of draft rolls (by July 18); publication of draft rolls (on July 19); period for filing claims and objectives (from July 19 to August 19); disposal of claims (by September 19); preparation and printing of supplementaries (October 19); and final publication of rolls (October 20).
