President Jiang Zemin calligraphed the name-plate for the bridge. Located at the juncture of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, the 4,142-meter-long bridge ranks second among the bridges over the Yellow River. Construction started in October, 1991, and the bridge was completed four months ahead of schedule. It cost 235 million yuan. The five-arched, big-span box beam in the middle of the bridge was joined successfully on its first test run. Experts say this is a major breakthrough in the history of China's bridge-building. The bridge is of great importance to facilitate the exploration of the Zhongyuan oil field and for the region's development.
