The source, which requested anonymity, added that Jordan feels that it is being done an injustice by the Syrian practices, particularly since Syria is monopolizing the use of the al-Yarmuk River tributaries by building dams on them. The source noted that Jordan was sympathetic with the Syrian position before the start of the peace process. But, now, Syria must seriously examine our grievances, the source said.
