The official, requesting anonymity, said Germany, which is to host the G-7 meeting, has shown interest in discussing the Russian issue but Japan has not yet received any notice about inviting a Russian delegation, he said. Meanwhile, the official said arrangements are now being made for Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor who arrived in Tokyo later Tuesday. Fujii intends to meet Kantor if his schedule allows, he said. On the ongoing negotiations on insurance service -- one of the top priorities under the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks, the official said further talks are needed ahead of the February 11 summit of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. The two sides are reportedly at odds over an objective criteria with Japan refusing U.S. demand for quantitative criteria that can be interpreted as numerical targets in market access. The official said the criteria could be something different for each field. On the macroeconomic field, the official stressed that it is for review by reporting each other's measures and not for negotiations. "The U.S. side recognizes it, and this is also how the macroeconomic field is taken at G-7 meetings," he said.
