FBIS4-3540 "drchi078_b_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 United States & Canada Report on U.S. Investigation of Downed Helicopters Report on U.S. Investigation of Downed Helicopters OW2104190894 Beijing XINHUA in English 1503 GMT 21 Apr 94 OW2104190894 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, April 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense Department investigators have found that the IFF (identification friend or foe) systems of the two U.S. Army helicopters shot down by U.S. fighter planes were turned off when the incident took place, it was reported here today. The two U.S. UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters mistakenly identified as Iraqi Hind helicopters by the two U.S. Air force F-15C fighters were shot down in northern Iraq on April 14. The WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Pentagon officials as saying that the switches on the Black Hawks' IFF units were found in the "off" position when investigators sifted through the wreckage in the crash sites. But one official described the findings as preliminary, saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from "on" to "off." The newspaper said if the helicopters had been flying through the no-fly zone with the IFF transponder shut off, it would explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system] aircraft got no response when it electronically queried them shortly before the F- 15C planes fired the missiles.
