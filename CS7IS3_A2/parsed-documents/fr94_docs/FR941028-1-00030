FR941028-1-00030 FR941028-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5099&hyph;3] RIN 2060&hyph;AC19 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants From the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed compliance extension and proposed changes to subpart H. SUMMARY: Elsewhere in today's Federal Register , the EPA is announcing a 3-month stay and reconsideration of certain portions of the ``National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks'' (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP'' or the ``HON''). The EPA is issuing the stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7606(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. This action is a proposal to extend the compliance date for certain compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers to allow the time necessary for installation of controls. Changes are also being proposed to the applicability of control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. This action also proposes a temporary extension of the applicable compliance dates beyond the 3 months of the stay, but only as necessary to complete reconsideration (including appropriate regulatory action) of the rule in question. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994, unless a hearing is requested by November 7, 1994. If a hearing is requested, written comments must be received by December 12, 1994. Public Hearing. Anyone requesting a public hearing must contact the EPA no later than November 7, 1994. If a hearing is held, it will take place on November 14, 1994, beginning at 10:00 a.m. ADDRESSES: Comments. Comments should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attention Docket Number A&hyph;90&hyph;20 (see docket section below), room M&hyph;1500, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460. The EPA requests that a separate copy also be sent to the contact person listed below. Public Hearing. If a public hearing is held, it will be held at the EPA's Office of Administration Auditorium, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Persons interested in attending the hearing or wishing to present oral testimony should notify Mrs. Kim Teal, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27711, telephone (919) 541&hyph;5580. Docket. Dockets No. A&hyph;90&hyph;20 and A&hyph;89&hyph;10, containing the supporting information for the original NESHAP and this action, are available for public inspection and copying between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Waterside Mall, room M&hyph;1500, first floor, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;7548 or 260&hyph;7549. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Janet S. Meyer, Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;5254. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the Federal Register national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the hazardous organic NESHAP, or the HON. The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning October 24, 1994 for some groups of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I. These compliance dates were the same as the proposed compliance dates and were consistent with the agreement on the negotiated rule for equipment leaks. The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart G no later than April 22, 1997. Public comments on the proposed rule included a substantial number of requests for a compliance schedule for subpart H similar to the 3-year schedule provided under subpart G. Several commenters argued that the 6-to-18-month compliance period in proposed subpart H did not take into consideration the implementation problems that could arise during installation of required equipment. A few commenters thought that proposed subpart H did not permit applications for compliance extensions. The EPA did not revise the compliance schedule as requested because the commenters did not provide any information that would justify establishing a source-category-wide compliance schedule similar to that provided in subpart G. Due to the lack of detailed information on equipment changes and installation schedules, the EPA thought that case-by-case compliance extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems that might arise. In issuing the final rule, the EPA added a provision, ยง63.182(a)(6), to clarify that individual extensions of compliance may be requested for installation of equipment required by subpart H.
