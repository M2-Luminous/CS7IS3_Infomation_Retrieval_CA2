Daniel Croto from REUTER and Roberto Vargas from Radio Mundial. Croto: Good evening, a question for President Callejas. I would also like to ask him about the guerrilla commander, known as El Chacal. During the Honduran election campaign, the Nicaraguan media quoted the Nicaraguan Army as saying that El Chacal had entered Honduran territory. The Honduran Army confirmed his presence but later denied it. My question is if (politics) is generating the information we are receiving on this case? Callejas: I met with AFP and Univision representatives and both told me that the so-called El Chacal was a Honduran. If that is the case, it would be a whole different situation if he were in our country. I actually think we are giving too much importance to a situation that does not have any significance in my country. I personally have not received any report from any government source about the existence of this gentleman. As I told the journalist who asked me the same question, we in government have no knowledge of the whereabouts or the actions of El Chacal. I can tell you frankly that we have no reason to avoid releasing that information. I asked the foreign minister and we have had no military intelligence reports. I have no information of any kind. The only information I have received about El Chacal in the past few months came from a Univision journalist and an AFP journalist. Moderator: Roberto Vargas and [name indistinct] after him. Vargas: Mr. President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, as a Nicaraguan I am proud to have you in my country. For the two years I lived in Honduras I was treated well. My question is the following: We are alarmed about drug trafficking. We have four cartels in Managua. A drug trafficking cartel was caught near Atahualinca. I would like to know if you could give our Nicaraguan Army or our National Police some type of training so they can better locate drug traffickers. Apparently we do not have that many well-trained people. I would also like to ask her excellency, the president of the Republic, who loves us so much, a question: Could you ask the DEA for technical assistance to train young men, people who want to work and locate drug traffickers? Chamorro: Could you repeat your last question please? I did not hear it, perhaps because of the echo here. Vargas: I also have voice problems. Could you ask the DEA for technical assistance to train policemen so they can locate drugs. Drugs enter Managua and the police never find out about it. Callejas As for the drug trafficking problem in the Central American and Caribbean region, I would like to note that there are a series of agreements signed among ourselves. The Central American region has an agreement to fight drug trafficking. This agreement, which includes all Central American countries, also has direct relations with Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and the DEA. We are all part of a program in the fight against drug traffickers. There are even radar installations that cover the Caribbean, and there are information service installations at the U.S. Southern Command. All Central American countries are making a great effort to fight drug trafficking. It is a difficult fight because, while the drug traffickers have economic resources, the Central American countries have huge limitations. The latest U.S. foreign policy decisions do not emphasize the fight against drug trafficking as much as in the past. It concentrates more on the producing countries, and therefore, all Central American countries must make a common effort because drug trafficking has no borders. There are agreements, there are direct relations, and I would like to say that what one reads in the media are police success stories in this fight in each one of our countries. There was an important drug seizure in Honduras and Nicaragua recently. The effort done by the Honduran police against this scourge of society is very important despite the huge limitations. Chamorro: As president of Nicaragua, I can tell you we have an agreement with the United States under which we will continue helping as they continue helping us. A large number of drug traffickers have been identified, who, by the way, are under arrest. Besides, my dear journalist friends, I wanted to tell you I believe that all Nicaraguans, as President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has just said, have to work to produce. As good reporters you should report to the authorities when something wrong is going on. We should help each other as [words indistinct] in this field. We all have to get down and work for our nation to achieve peace and tranquillity. No one should be abusing or selling drugs. I condemn all of these things that are taking place. We all have to work for our fatherland. [passage omitted]
