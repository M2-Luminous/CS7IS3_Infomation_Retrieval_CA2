Not least of these snubs was the one inflicted on him by Admiral Bobby Inman, the man chosen to succeed Les Aspin as Pentagon chief. The fact that the defense secretary, a man who is expected to keep his cool at all times, seems apparently incapable of surviving an editorial in the NEW YORK TIMES, is reason enough for concern at the way in which Mr. Clinton selects the members of his entourage. Regarding Bosnia, at the NATO summit last week the U.S. President approved the threat of air strikes against the Serbs at Tuzla and Srebrenica, while personally emphasizing that no more threats should be made that were not followed up by action. Since then, Mr. Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has openly mocked this position, UN representatives have rejected it, Moscow has implicitly vetoed it, and the U.S. head of the joint chiefs of staff has personally criticized it. No elementary consultations had taken place. Today, it is not just the White House, but also NATO, which is losing creditworthiness in that context. The slaps in the face given by Moscow are hitting home even harder. The continuation of economic reforms there would appear to be largely compromised, but against the advice of the best observers and of the market itself, Mr. Clinton is continuing to play down the possible absence of Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov in the next Russian Government, two men he openly supported last week in Moscow, whereas attempts are now being made to sweep them aside or demote them. The U.S. Administration, their attention trained on Mr. Yeltsin, manifestly failed to take into account the increasing power of Mr. Chernomyrdin, the conservative prime minister. By the same token, three days after the U.S. President explicitly asked Russia to complete the withdrawal of its armies from Latvia and Estonia, the Russian foreign minister stated that the Baltic states belong within Russia's strategic zone of interest -- to the extent that the Latvian prime minister is wondering whether this position has been coordinated with the United States. And with the U.S. President having just left Moscow, Washington has been reduced to asking the Russians to explain themselves. Furthermore, no response is being made to the growing affirmation of the Kremlin's desire to recreate its sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, and to retain a right to watch over affairs in Central Europe. The fledgling democracies of Central Europe, limited to rallying behind a "partnership for peace" which favors consultation with Moscow and which everyone mistrusts, have in a few days -- and despite the hugs and kisses from Prague -- lost much of their faith in the support that the United States is capable of offering them. This retrospective assessment of one year of foreign policy conveys a strong impression of thoughtlessness, of alienation from reality, of ignorance regarding the true situation regarding the balance of power, or -- in the case of Bosnia, Somalia, or Haiti -- of pure and simple disinterest. Referring to the trust Bill Clinton placed in the Syrian leader Hafiz al-Asad, or the manner in which he compelled Ukrainian President Kravchuk to give his nuclear arsenal back to Russia, the author of a WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial speaks of naivety. In any case, there are mumblings about a certain otherworldliness of the kind that characterized the policy conducted by Jimmy Carter. Admittedly, President Clinton has scored successes, especially on the domestic scene and at the level of trade, particularly with regard to the conclusion of the GATT and NAFTA agreements. His Asian policy, taking form at the recent APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit in Seattle, would also seem to be resolved. Beijing, meanwhile, is still very much on trial and, with the upcoming visit by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to China, is apparently making the minimal concessions required to secure the extension of the most-favored nation clause. There, too, no excessive naivety should be displayed. No more than in North Korea, where Washington, although apparently satisfied, has not obtained any real guarantee of being able to keep tabs on the development of nuclear arms.
