At about 0800 [0700 GMT] this morning, three MPLA-PT air force combat fighters flew in from Catumbela air base and destroyed a number of residential areas in the much martyred city of Huambo. A number of children, women, and old people were killed. [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] A parachute system was used to guide the fragmentation and (?precision) bombs dropped over the city. Those bombs made countless civilians victims and destroyed the homes of peaceful citizens. That barbarous operation comes in the wake of the problems in Bie [Cuito], where on 5 February the MPLA-PT forces broke the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The MPLA-PT air force's attack on Huambo began at precisely 0815 this morning, shortly after International Committee of the Red Cross and Caritas aircraft had left this city's airport. Though there has been no pronouncement [words indistinct] it is known that such violations, including air raids, can have a harmful effect on the humanitarian aid process, which is trying to save the lives of people in this area.
