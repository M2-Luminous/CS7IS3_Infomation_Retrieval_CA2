FR941207-0-00113 FR941207-0-00019 D. An original and one complete copy of the 303&hyph;S renewal application, including all exhibits, must be prepared for each station license to be renewed, except that an original and one complete copy, including all exhibits, can be filed for the joint renewal of licenses for a translator and the translator's commonly owned primary station. The application with all required exhibits should be filed with the Federal Communications Commission in the manner and at the location specified in 47 CFR 0.401. E. Replies to questions in this form and the applicant's statements constitute representations on which the FCC will rely in considering the application. Thus, time and care should be devoted to all replies, which should reflect accurately the applicant's responsible consideration of the questions asked. Include all information called for by this application. If any portions of the application are not applicable, so state. Defective or incomplete applications will be returned without consideration. Furthermore, inadvertently accepted applications are subject to dismissal. F. In accordance with 47 CFR 1.65, the applicant has a continuing obligation to advise the Commission, through amendments, of any substantial and significant changes in the information furnished. Section I_Fee Information By law, the Commission is required to collect charges for certain of the regulatory services it provides to the public. Generally, applicants seeking to renew the license for a commercial AM, FM, TV, FM translator, TV translator or Low Power TV station are required to pay and submit a fee with the filing of FCC Form 303&hyph;S. However, governmental entities, which include any possession, state, city, county, town, village, municipal organization or similar political organization or subpart thereof controlled by publicly elected and/or duly appointed public officials exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities or programs, are exempt from the payment of this fee. Also exempted from this fee are licensees of noncommercial educational radio or television broadcast stations. (This includes licensees of noncommercial educational FM and full service TV broadcast stations seeking renewal of the licenses for their translator or low power TV stations provided those stations operate on a noncommercial educational basis. Low Power TV or TV translator stations that rebroadcast the programming of a primary noncommercial educational station, but are not co-owned by the licensee of such a station, are required to file fees. In addition, noncommercial FM translators operating on a non-reserved channel (CH 221&hyph;300), and that are not co-owned by the licensee of the primary noncommercial educational station, are also required to file fees.) Renewal applicants that earlier obtained either a fee refund because of an NTIA facilities grant for the stations or a fee waiver because of demonstrated compliance with the eligibility and service requirements of 47 CFR 73.503 or 73.621, and that continue to operate those stations on a noncommercial basis, are similarly exempted from this fee. See 47 CFR 1.1112. To avail itself of any fee exemption, the renewal applicant must indicate its eligibility by checking the appropriate box in Question 2(B), Section I. FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications NOT involving the payment of a fee can be hand-delivered or mailed to the FCC's Washington, D.C. offices. See 47 CFR 0.401(a). The Commission's fee collection program utilizes a U.S. Treasury lockbox bank for maximum efficiency of collection and processing. All FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications, which require the remittance of a fee, must be submitted to the appropriate post office box address. See 47 CFR 0.401(b). A listing of the required fee and the address to which FCC Form 303&hyph;S should be mailed or otherwise delivered is also set forth in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing Guide'' which is obtained either by writing to the Commission's Form Distribution Center, 2803 52nd Avenue, Hyattsville, Maryland 20871, or by calling Telephone No. (202) 418&hyph;FORM and leaving your request on the answering machine provided for this purpose. See also 47 CFR 1.1104. Payment of any required fee must be made by check, bank draft or money order payable to the Federal Communications Commission, denominated in U.S. dollars, and drawn upon a U.S. financial institution. No postdated, altered or third-party checks will be accepted. DO NOT SEND CASH. Checks dated six months or older will not be acceptable for filing. Parties hand-delivering FCC Forms 303&hyph;S may receive dated receipt copies by presenting copies of the applications to the acceptance clerk at the time of delivery. For mailed-in applications, a ``return copy'' of the application can be furnished provided the applicant clearly identifies the ``return copy'' and attaches it to a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Only one piece of paper per application will be stamped for receipt purposes. For further information regarding the applicability of a fee, the amount of the fee or the payment of the fee, refer to the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing Guide.'' Section II_Question-By-Question Guidelines This section must be completed and submitted by all applicants regardless of the service of the station for which renewal is being sought. Question 1. The name of the licensee applicant should be stated exactly as it appears on the station's existing license. The current street address or post office box used by the applicant for receipt of Commission correspondence should be set forth. If this information has been set forth in Question 1, Section I, it need not be repeated here. Any change in the licensee's name, which does not involve a change in ownership requiring prior Commission approval, can be communicated to the Commission by letter. To report any change in the mailing address previously used by the licensee FCC Form 5072, entitled ``Change in Official Mailing Address for Broadcast Station,'' should be promptly transmitted to the Commission. See 47 CFR 1.5. Question 2. Applicants for AM, FM or TV stations should identify whether it has been licensed by the Commission as a commercial or noncommercial educational licensee. A licensee that merely elects to operate its station on a noncommercial basis is not considered to be a noncommercial educational licensee. The facility should be described by its service, call letters, and specific community of license or area as listed on the station's existing license. See 47 CFR 74.1201(a), 74.701(a) and 74.701(f) for definition of an FM translator, TV translator and low power TV broadcast stations respectively. For AM, FM or TV stations the location of the facility should be described in terms of the specific city or community to which the station is licensed. Translator and Low Power TV stations should specify the area the stations are licensed to serve. Question 3. This question must be completed by a radio or television renewal applicant seeking to continue its authority to operate an FM Booster or TV booster station in conjunction with the primary station. The FM or TV booster station should be described in terms of its call letters and the name of the specific community which it serves. Question 4. Aliens, foreign governments and corporations, and corporations of which less than 80% of the capital stock is owned or voted by U.S. citizens are prohibited from holding a broadcast station license. Where a corporate licensee is directly or indirectly controlled by another corporation, of which any officer or more than 25% of the directors are aliens or of which less than 75% of that corporation's stock is owned or voted by U.S. citizens, the Commission must consider whether denial of renewal would serve the public interest. Licensees are expected to employ reasonable, good faith methods to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their citizenship representations. Question 5. Commission policies and litigation reporting requirements for broadcast, translator and LPTV station applicants are directed to focusing on misconduct which violates the Communications Act or a Commission rule or policy and on certain specified non-FCC misconduct. In responding to Question 6, applicants are advised that the parameters of the Commission's policies and requirements regarding character qualifications are fully set forth in Character Qualifications, 102 FCC 2d 1179 (1985), reconsideration denied, 1 FCC Rcd 421 (1986), as modified, 5 FCC Rcd 3252 (1990) and 7 FCC Rcd 6564 (1992). For the purpose of this question, the term ``parties to the application'' includes any individual or entity whose ownership or positional interest in the applicant is cognizable under the Commission's multiple ownership rules. See in this regard Report and Order in MM Docket No. 83&hyph;46, 97 FCC 2d 997 (1984), reconsideration granted in part, 58 RR 2d 604 (1985), further modified on reconsideration, 61 RR 2d 739 (1986). Question 6. Each applicant should check the appropriate box to indicate whether a Commission grant of the proposed communications facility(ies) may or may not have a significant environmental impact as defined by 47 CFR 1.1307. Briefly, Commission grant of an application may have a significant environmental impact if any of the following are proposed: (a) A facility is to be located in sensitive areas (e.g., an officially designated wilderness area, a wildlife preserve area, a flood plain) or will physically or visually affect sites significant in American history. (b) A facility whose construction will involve significant changes in surface features. (c) The antenna tower and/or supporting structure(s) will be equipped with high intensity white lights and are to be located in residential neighborhoods. (d) The facilities or the operation of which will cause exposure of workers or the general public to levels of radio frequency radiation in excess of the ``Radio Frequency Protection Guides'' recommended in ``American National Standard Safety Levels with respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 300 kHz to 100 GHz,'' (ANSI C95.1&hyph;1982), by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., 345 East 47th Street, New York, New York 10017. Note: In answering this question, applicants for renewal of FM translator stations which transmit with an effective radiated power of 100 watts or less are excluded from the standards set forth in subparagraph (d) above. However, in determining the appropriate response to this question, such applicants must still perform an analysis of the subject facilities in the context of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a)&hyph;(c) above. If you answered No, a brief statement explaining the reasons why there will not be a significant environmental impact must be submitted. With respect to RF radiation exposure, the required statement must include a description of the steps that have been taken to protect the general public, station employees, and other persons authorized access to the tower from exposure to RF radiation levels in excess of the specified safety standards and that these steps comply with those required by OST Bulletin No. 65, October, 1985, entitled ``Evaluating Compliance with FCC-Specified Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Radiation.'' The applicant must take into account, ALL non-excluded transmitters at and around the station's transmitter site; that is, contributions to environmental RF levels from all nearby radio and television stations, not just the applicant's station, must be considered. If you answered Yes, submit the required Environmental Assessment (EA). The EA includes for antenna towers and satellite earth stations: (a) A description of the facilities, as well as supporting structures and appurtenances, and a description of the site, as well as the surrounding area and uses. If high intensity white lighting is proposed or utilized within a residential area, the EA must also address the impact of this lighting upon the residents. (b) A statement as to the zoning classification of the site, and communications with, or proceedings before and determinations (if any) made by, zoning, planning, environmental or other local, state or federal authorities on matters relating to environmental effect. (c) A statement as to whether construction of the facilities has been a source of controversy on environmental grounds in the local community.
