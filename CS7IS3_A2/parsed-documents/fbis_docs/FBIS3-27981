This is not enough to meet the needs of the 851,620 persons living in the province. Only four districts -- Phnum Penh, Kandal Stoeng, S'ang, and Ponhea Loe -- possess favorable conditions for growing rainy season rice while land in other districts along the Mekong river is reserved for growing dry season rice and subsidiary crops. The province transplanted only 45,230 hectares of assorted varieties of rice with an average yield of a tonne and a half per hectare in the past rainy season. So far the province has planted more than 12,300 hectares of fast-growing rice, or 25 percent of the plan.
