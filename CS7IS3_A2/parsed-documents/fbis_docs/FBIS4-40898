Territory leaders believe that it is essential to set uniform electricity and heat tariffs for Siberia and the Far East, to recompense from the budget 50 percent of the expenditure incurred both on importing fuel and foodstuffs into the region and on exporting produce made here, and to repay the debt owed by the federal budget to state sector enterprises.
