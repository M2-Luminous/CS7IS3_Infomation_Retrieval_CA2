These papers contained the viewpoints, ideas, and concepts of the Egyptian parties on the national dialogue from the perspective of the objectives and mechanisms of this dialogue. During this meeting, President Mubarak affirmed many principles. First, that national dialogue is a dialogue among all the political parties and the constitutional institutions in which intellectuals, thinkers, unions, federations, and universities take part. Second, that the National Democratic Party is a party to this dialogue. It cannot impose opinions on it. Its responsibility, as the party of the majority, is to provide the opportunity for the dialogue to succeed and to make available to every side all the information and statements regarding the issues open for discussion. All the political, economic, and social issues of the homeland are open to dialogue for the present and future of Egypt. So that the call for the dialogue starts off on the right course, President Mubarak has decided to form a minicommittee called the Committee To Prepare for National Dialogue. It will include 25 members selected by the president from among the leaders of the political parties, unions, intellectuals, and those who have an opinion. The committee will state its views on: 1. Identifying the general committee for national dialogue and the names of those personalities who are expected to be invited to join in the national dialogue. 2. Proposing the objectives and issues of national dialogue. 3. Studying the method of action of this general committee, or general congress, as well as its subcommittees, specializations, the method of convening it, and the administration of its meetings. 4. Proposing and providing the groundwork for the statements that should be made available to serve the issues the national dialogue will address. 5. Proposing a venue for the general congress and the various committees of the national dialogue. President Mubarak will invite the members of the Committee To Prepare for National Dialogue to a meeting when he returns from his upcoming visit to Japan and China.
