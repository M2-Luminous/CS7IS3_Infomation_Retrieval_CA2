FBIS4-2221 "drchi067_v_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 TAIWAN CNA Reviews Handling of Lake Qiandao Boat Incident CNA Reviews Handling of Lake Qiandao Boat Incident OW0604143394 Taipei CNA in English 1351 GMT 6 Apr 94 OW0604143394 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Vincent (name indistinct): "Nightmare on Lake Qiandao"] [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- It started off as a spring holiday for the 24 visitors from Taiwan, some in Mainland China for the first time to catch a glimpse on the land of their ancestors. It ended in tragedy in a cramped, lower-deck cabin aboard the Hai Rui while the boat crossed Lake Qiandao, or Thousand Island Lake. The bodies were found one piled on top of another, burned beyond recognition. Seven days later, when by Taiwanese custom the spirits of the dead return to earth, the victim's relatives were still at the scene near the lake, seeking answers to the questions they have been asking since arriving in the mainland on Sunday [3 April]. Qiandao Lake is in Mainland China's Zhejiang Province about 200 kilometers west of Hangzhou and is a popular tourist destination. The relatives and representatives of the Taipei Association of Travel Agents [TATA] were able to view the boat and the charred bodies on Sunday and Monday, before mainland authorities roped off the scene, barred reporters from the area, and detained the relatives in a hotel. One thing seems certain: the deaths of the tourists and eight mainland crew members and tour guides could hardly have been accidental. An unnamed Zhejiang official said the boat's gas tank had not exploded in the fire. Unless those aboard the ship had gathered below to escape a rainy day and were struck by a bolt of lightning, or all had been asleep at 5:30 p.m. when a freak accident occurred, then [word indistinct] and murder seems the only explanation. Yao Ta-kuang, a TATA representative at Lake Qiandao on Saturday, said that some gold rings, expensive watches, and cash were found along with the bodies, some of the relatives insisted that the belongings of the victims were notably short of possessions the victims had carried with them from Taiwan and had on the boat with them. Some of the relatives also claimed they found bullet holes in the boat before they were shepherded away to the hotel by the mainland authorities. The Hai Rui was ferrying the tourists across the lake to their hotel, which they had yet to check into. The Zhejiang officials began stonewalling immediately. Taiwan officials were not informed of the incident until about 30 hours after it occurred. When Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, or SEF, insisted on sending an official to the mainland to find out what happened and to see what steps could be taken on behalf of the victims' relatives, mainland officials turned down the request. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, or ARATS, the mainland agency authorized [word indistinct] to handle cross- strait affairs, claimed it was "not necessary" for SEF officials to be at the site. "We are very concerned about the accident and will provide help to the victim's relatives," ARATS Deputy Secretary- General Zhao Zhengyu added. Meanwhile, the relatives, who had flown to the mainland with the hope of repatriating the remains of their loved ones, were also spurned by mainland officials, who had taken it upon themselves to perform autopsies on the bodies. No results of the autopsies were made available. In addition to not letting the relatives gather evidence at the site -- taking photographs, for example -- mainland officials also refused to let the relatives take the bodies to Hangzhou, a nearby city, either for cremation or to fly the bodies back to Taiwan. Zhejiang Lieutenant Governor Liu Xirong told the relatives Tuesday that the bodies could not be shipped out of the mainland because their decomposition posed a health threat, while other local authorities said that allowing the corpses to be shipped to Taiwan would severely affect the mainland's security. On Thursday, officials informed the relatives that the bodies would be incinerated at Tonglu on Friday. Tonglu is between Lake Qiandao and Hangzhou. Despite the relatives pleas to the ROC Government for help, officials and commentators here could only criticize the mainland's handling of the matter. "The denial of the relatives' demands is consistent with the Chinese Communists' ignorance of human rights," Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong said on Tuesday. Kuomintang Cultural Affairs Department Director Chien Han-sheng said that the actions taken by mainland officials over the past few days have been "muddleheaded and careless." SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu, long involved in trying to reach agreements with the mainland over several issues, said relations between the two sides had definitely been harmed, and at least one scholar agreed with him. Chu Hsin-min, a foreign diplomacy professor at National Chengchi University, said the incident would likely be a "drawback" to Taiwan-mainland relations. On Wednesday, Taiwan legislators vented their ire at the Beijing regime. Li Ching-hua, a Kuomintang legislator formerly in favor or reunification with the mainland, said the cross-strait relationship had entirely failed because of the incident, while Chiu Lien-hui, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, demanded that ROC Premier Lien Chan pronounce Mainland China "a tourist area of uncivilized people." Now, a Taiwan boycott of travel to Mainland China seems likely, unless Beijing meets a list of demands the ROC Transportation and Communications Ministry will present, outlining the steps it can take to keep the mainland a favorite destination of Taiwan tourists. The boycott will do nothing for the 24 unfortunate tourists who spent their final minutes faced with a terror that may remain a mystery until cross-strait ties are unfrozen.
