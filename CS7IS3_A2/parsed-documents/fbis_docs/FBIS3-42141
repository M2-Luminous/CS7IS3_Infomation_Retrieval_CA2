And during the U.S. President's visit to Minsk the extremely delicate question of Belarus's share of the materials from the elimination of warheads was raised. IZVESTIYA's correspondent asked Valeriy Tsepkalo, the chairman of the republic Supreme Soviet's adviser on foreign economic questions, to comment on this situation. "The question of the share of the uranium in the tactical and strategic nuclear weapons being withdrawn from Belarusian territory has been discussed in talks between ourselves and Russia," Valeriy Tsepkalo explained. "Moscow and Washington formerly prepared an agreement on the sale to the United States of the uranium released as a result of the elimination of the nuclear warheads on strategic offensive weapons. At that time the United States reassured Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine that the agreement would not be signed before the question of the distribution of revenue from the sale of the uranium was settled. Nevertheless, the United States and Russia did sign the agreement. But the United States has assured us that the agreement will not come into force until agreement is reached on the distribution of the revenue. The United States is buying 500 tonnes of uranium over 20 years at a cost of $5.5 billion." "The agreement between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine contains provisions which establish Ukraine's share of uranium sales, either in money or in kind -- that is to say, through the delivery of industrial uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power stations. And most important of all, Ukraine has succeeded in resolving the problem of tactical nuclear weapons; in other words Russia has agreed to recognize Ukraine's right to the fissionable materials in the tactical weapons and count their number when determining the profit from the sale of uranium." "For us this is very important. Russia has not recognized our right to that quantity of fissionable materials in the nuclear weapons withdrawn from Belarus through 27 April 1992. But after all, almost half of all the tactical nuclear weapons of the former USSR were situated on the republic's territory." "Russia has claimed that the lion's share of the revenue from the sale of uranium will go toward covering the expense of destroying the weapons. However, this does not correspond to reality, since Russia has received considerable sums for these very purposes from the United States." "We consider it possible to begin talks with Russia about our share of the profits with the mediation of the United States -- that is to say, to prepare an agreement similar to the one signed in Moscow."
