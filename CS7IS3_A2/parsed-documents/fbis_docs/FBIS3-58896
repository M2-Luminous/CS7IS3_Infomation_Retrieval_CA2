At his party's national conference in Hanover today of representatives for the European elections, Kinkel said: "Russia remains a very important security partner in the East for us." The more successful cooperation with Russia is, the quicker the prospect of NATO membership for the candidates among the Eastern reformist states can become a reality. It should be made clear to the reformist states, however, that no new rifts must be created, Kinkel stressed. Russia and Ukraine must not be excluded. "This would be the most stupid thing we could do." The foreign minister went on to say that economic stabilization in the East is a basic precondition for lasting security in all of Europe. The response to the electoral success of old and new enemies of democracy in the East is the Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. This would also take the wind out of the sails of the right-wing nationalists in Russia for the time being. Commenting on the European elections to be held on 12 June, Kinkel said these elections will be crucial because the process of European unification is important for Germans in particular. "We must use these elections to mobilize the citizens of Europe." Today, the national economies in Europe are so closely interlinked that growth, employment, and competitiveness can only be created by joint efforts. [passage omitted]
