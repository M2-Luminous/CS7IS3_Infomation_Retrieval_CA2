Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Verona agricultural fair, Agriculture Minister Alfredo Diana said he did not rule out that Rome may wield the threat of a budget veto if EU farm ministers agree with a Commission proposal not to grant Italy an increase in its milk production quotas, as agreed to last year. "Each one uses the weapons at his disposal," Diana said. Italy will have to pay about one trillion lire (595 million dollars) in fines for having exceeded its production quotas from 1989 to 1991 and cannot take on additional financial burdens, Diana said, referring to threats of a budget veto issued yesterday by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. "This is not blackmail but an evaluation of the domestic budget made by Minister Andreatta," Diana said, adding that a compromise solution to the Union's budget requirements and Italy's agricultural problems will have to be found. Andreatta yesterday cited "general policy reservations" in barring implementation of the European Union budget reform that had been agreed on at the Edinburgh summit of 1992. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday failed to approve the budget reform, which would base contributions on gross domestic product and in inverse proportion to value added tax rates. Andreatta said the way Italy now calculates its GDP puts it at a disadvantage compared to other member states that have not yet carried out the budget reforms, changing the way production levels are estimated. Italy claims the discrepancy would force it to pay as much as one trillion lire in additional budget contributions. Rome also argues that failing to increase Italy's milk production quotas may cost it as much as five trillion lire (2.97 billion dollars). Italy believes the EU has not moved quickly enough on agricultural reform where Mediterranean products are concerned and that further negotiations are needed on agro-monetary realignment.
