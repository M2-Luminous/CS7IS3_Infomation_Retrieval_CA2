"The rumour is a work of the CDR [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] just to give morale to the Rwandan Army...It is totally untrue, it is just a work of a clique of people in Kigali who may be trying to disorganise our camp, Christine Umutoni, a member of the Political Bureau of the RPF, told AFP. The radio of the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), a pro-Hutu extremist movement fiercely opposed to the incorporation of the mainly Tutsi RPF in the Rwandan Government, had earlier Monday reported that RPF commander Paul Kagame and Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe had been killed in a power struggle within the movement. Umutoni said she had contacted the RPF High Command in Rwanda at 8.00 A.M (5.00 GMT) on Monday morning and was informed that rebel forces were advancing towards the Rwandan capital and were now at Kabuye, eight kilometers (five miles) from Kigali. She could not tell when they will storm the capital where ethnic warfare continues to rage since the death of the Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart in a suspect plane crash on Wednesday. "We have not encountered any significant resistance on the battle front," Umutoni said.
