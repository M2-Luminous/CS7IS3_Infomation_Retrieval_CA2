This represents the suspension of the government decision to withhold 10.9 percent of their March salaries. This is really a partial preliminary ruling, because the STF has not decided whether the wage increase should be immediately paid. The STF has determined that the government should adopt the necessary measures to have the difference deposited in the Bank of Brazil in the accounts of the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, and the National Accounting Office. The money will remain at the disposal of the STF in special interest-earning accounts until the STF issues a definitive ruling, something that will probably take place in May. In order to continue with the trial, Justice Ilmar Galvao will ask for more information from Congress and from President Itamar Franco, who will have 30 days to answer the STF. Soon after, the attorney general must give his opinion on the case. The preliminary ruling issued today only favors legislative branch employees. In making a final ruling the STF will take into account the administrative decision made on 10 March, when it decided that judicial branch salaries should be converted into the URV [real value unit] rate established on the 20th of each month.
