Under the decision made at a Central Civil Defense Council Meeting presided over by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok Monday, the government will also increase civil defense-related educational and public relations programs to focus public attention on national security. An emergency call-up exercise will be conducted Wednesday and Thursday to check the mobilization status of 6.6 million reservists for civil defense. Air-raid shelters, emergency water supply systems and warning systems will be tested and renovated, if need be, by the end of the month in full preparation for any emergencies. The air-raid drill on Wednesday will focus on evacuation to shelters, vehicular traffic control, first aid for the injured and emergency reconstruction of destroyed facilities. The Ulchi defense exercise slated for late August will serve as an overall test of the government's ability to manage a crisis -- not only an emergency in the run-up to war but also a flood, fire or other disaster. The government should keep the public informed of every security development to ensure that they do not fear for their safety and willingly participate in civil defense drills, Prime Minister Yi told the meeting. Emergency preparations should be carried out in such a manner that neither will they cause the people excessive uneasiness nor will they provide any reason for North Korea to make military provocations, he stressed. Attending the meeting were Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok, National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, Home Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Emergency Planning Committee Chairman Chon Yong-taek, among others.
