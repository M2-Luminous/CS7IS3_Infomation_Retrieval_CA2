Quoting military sources in Seoul, the Japanese newspaper said the two countries would shortly agree to exchange flight information to prevent accidents involving military planes as the first step of cooperation. South Korea is interested in defense exchanges and cooperation with Japan because its plans to promote military links with China and Russia have not met expectations since the establishment of diplomatic ties under former President No Tae-u, it observed. Influenced by President Kim's Japan policy calling for future-oriented relations, the South Korean military has begun showing a keen interest in that country, it added. Defense Minister Yi was to accompany President Kim to Japan in late March but has decided to go late next month for in-depth talks with Japanese defense leaders on military cooperation, the report said. It is highly likely that a South Korean naval fleet will call at a Japanese port this year, entailing a return call by the Japanese at a South Korean port, it quoted a Seoul military source as saying. At present, the two countries conduct two military personnel exchange programs a year covering mutual visits by army, navy, air force and joint chiefs of staff personnel.
