North China has vast arid or semi-arid areas, with scarce vegetation and serious desertification. Forest cover in north China is lower than 10 percent. The development of the local economy has thus been seriously hampered. Beginning in the late 1970's, the company was assigned to shoulder the task of planting trees in north China through aerial seeding. As a result, the ecological environment, and production and living conditions of farmers and herdsmen in those areas selected for aerial seeding have shown marked improvement thanks to painstaking efforts in the past decade, local officials told XINHUA.
