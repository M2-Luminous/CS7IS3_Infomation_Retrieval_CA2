The contribution of these three new members will bring something new and different into the EU even as the nations making up the hard core of the Union search for a political initiative which remains the essential objective to be pursued, Andreatta said in commenting on the outcome last night of the enlargement talks. Andreatta voiced satisfaction over the fact that the necessary compromises reached, especially in the agricultural sector, did not lead to any conservation of frontiers or of customs controls. The understandings with Austria with regard to road transit, while not leading to immediate liberalization, as hoped, nevertheless broke the bottlenecks in Italian traffic flow, he said. However, for Andreatta, the most important aspect of EU enlargement (which could well be extended soon to Norway, as well) was the movement towards a truly European dimension for the Union which does not coincide merely with West Europe but which is heading for the shape and configuration imagined for it by thinkers back in the pre-World War period. This enlargement is a political gesture, he said, because it should serve as a prelude to the inclusion in the Community of the former Communist states of East and Central Europe, whose participation in the continent's process of integration is today the biggest question facing the European Union, in his view. "If we do not manage to give European citizenship to the inhabitants of these countries, Europe will have lost one of those golden opportunities that history rarely offers," he said. With these new members, Europe acquires a wealth of "diverse experiences, new men and new sensibilities," he went on. However, he saw as being necessary a political initiative on the part of a hard core of four or five nations which, due to their importance, should together forge a foreign policy. For this reason, a federal form within the center may be necessary, according to the diplomatic chief.
