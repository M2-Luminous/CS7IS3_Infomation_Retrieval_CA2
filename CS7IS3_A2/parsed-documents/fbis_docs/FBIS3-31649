[sentence as received] Speaking after his meeting with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec tonight, he admitted that the way in which he made public the initiative was not only non-standard, but probably inappropriate from the diplomatic point of view. Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday [19 February] with his proposal to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had consulted neither the government nor parliament. Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties, for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy. To defend his course of action, he said today it was due to the pressure of developments because as late as Sunday night, no one knew whether or not Sarajevo would be bombarded. Baudys pointed out that Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers were stationed in Serbian Krajina and that, aware of his responsibility for their lives, "I did what I did." "I agree that the way I did it was not probably appropriate and correct. Nevertheless, I believe that I have neither breached the constitution nor exceeded my powers," Baudys said. He said that he and Zieleniec discussed mainly the technique of making public the proposal and that they discussed the contents only superficially. Baudys said they also turned to their Friday discussion during a luncheon, when Baudys informed Zieleniec of his initiative. But he admitted that his statement at the press conference on Saturday could be misunderstood as if Zieleniec were informed not only of the proposal, but also of the way in which it was being made public. Baudys said he told Zieleniec on Friday that he had sent off the letters containing his proposal to settle the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but did not tell him that he had sent them via embassies and two military air attaches. "He probably reached the impression that I had sent them via regular mail," Baudys admitted. He said he believed that the factual contents of his proposal should be distinguished from the way in which it was made public and which will probably be the subject of further discussion.
