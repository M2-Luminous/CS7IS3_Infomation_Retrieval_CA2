Subject to certain conditions, the effective date of the transaction would be July 1. The acquisition involves two quality mineral sands resources which are located in Natal and Transkei. By taking over Natal minerals sands and the interests of Rhoex in Wavecrest (Transkei), Iscor has acquired most of the remaining South African titanium reserves with low radio-activity levels. "This significant resource of high grade chlorinatable feedstock, low in radio activity, will enable Iscor to enter this industry," Ben Alberts, Iscor's executive director, mining, said. "We are one of the South African organisations with the technical know-how, infrasrtucture and ability to develop the required smelting technology. We have already done a number of successful smelting trials with the mineral." The take over of Natal mineral sands follows on the announcements earlier this year that Iscor had successfully tendered for coal exploration rights near the town of Moranbah in Queensland, Australia and its investment in the Qingdao port complex in the People's Republic of China to secure a dedicated iron ore storage facility.
