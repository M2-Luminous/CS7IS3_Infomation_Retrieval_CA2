Are the Russian people sharing the joy about the withdrawal of his troops from Germany? [Manilov] The soldiers' withdrawal from Germany is certainly causing mixed feelings in the people. There are people who do not want to put up with it. But on the serious political level there are no doubts: The withdrawal is an important and positive step -- an expression and part of the new Russian geopolitics. When Russia gave German unification its blessing, all of us were aware that it had to be followed by the armed forces' withdrawal. [Rybak] At the same time, however, U.S. troops remain in Germany. Is Russia thus abandoning the principle of parity in geopolitics? [Manilov] In former times, we insisted on parity in every respect -- and at any price. We counted every gun, every tank, and every nuclear warhead -- and compared our figures with those of the Americans and NATO. When we lagged behind, the arms production had to be increased. But the world cannot be pressed any longer into such primitive schemes. We understood that and agreed to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, without insisting on a similar step for NATO. [Rybak] Will Russia, with the troop withdrawal, not lose a joker in the game about the Americans' withdrawal? [Manilov] I think that it is time to put an end to the policy of cudgels. We no longer want to threaten with our arms potential. But the other side also has to make concessions. We say: "One cannot untie a knot with one hand." Least of all one that is so firmly tied as European security policy. [Rybak] Before Germany's political unification, it was stated that NATO will not spread to the East. However, the GDR area was immediately integrated. Was Russia cheated? [Manilov] Indeed, NATO did not keep its promise. This was a bitter experience. And not the last one. There are, for example, the bombing attacks in Bosnia. Would it have been so hard to reach for the telephone and to brief us? Formally, NATO was perhaps not forced to do it, but the point is the principle of partnership, which requires certain dealings with each other. [Rybak] In view of such experiences, has the Russian leadership considered slowing down the troop withdrawal from Germany? [Manilov] The punctual withdrawal from Germany was never questioned officially -- even though it resulted in great technical and social problems for us. This step was important to us in principle. In this way, we wanted to give a signal and to provide the new German-Russian relations with a solid foundation. Europe's stability depends on these relations. [Rybak] Was the German debate on the troop farewell humiliating for Russia? [Manilov] Many Russians felt this. Unfortunately, the German leadership lacked any sure instinct in this question. It has not understood the symbolic significance of this ceremony: We hope for joy and also a little bit of gratefulness. After all, the war against fascism cost millions of Russians their lives. Those who forget this and slam the door shut offend our national pride. Perhaps, however, someone also deliberately wanted to put bitterness into the cup of joy. [Rybak] What do you mean by that? [Manilov] There are extremists who would like to torpedo a German-Russian partnership. I could envisage that they are not at home at the Rhine. [Rybak] You mean pressure from the United States? [Manilov] I cannot rule out this scenario because the Weimar plans did not exactly show a European hand. We in Europe have lived together for centuries and have learned to act somewhat more sensitively. [Rybak] Unfortunately, there are still a few things that are poisoning German-Russian relations. For example: Will Russia return the German art treasures? [Manilov] Yes, this is another delicate problem. I do not doubt that the art treasures will finally be returned. However, we still have to clarify some points and Germany also has to return its booty. [Rybak] Many Russians regard the German art treasures as a compensation for war damage. Rightly? [Manilov] This attitude is wrong. We certainly have to talk about compensation. But the national cultural heritage must not be abused for it. In this way, we would hurt the Germans' pride. I will have the question of the return of cultural goods dealt with in the Security Council. [Rybak] With its rejection of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program, Russia is causing confusion. Only one month ago, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced Russia's accession. What is going on? [Manilov] Russia is supporting the partnership idea and is prepared for accession in principle. However, we do not want this partnership to remain only an empty declaration. Before we sign it, we want to know first of all what all that means and what rights and duties we have. There are a lot of questions that have to be clarified. [Rybak] Does Russia insist on a special status in the partnership? [Manilov] What does a special status mean? Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a major nuclear power. Nobody should forget these realities. It has to be ensured that no decision of global importance may be made without us. However, there is also another problem: Some states regard the partnership as a protective shield against the Russian "danger" and want to establish a "cordon sanitaire" at the Russian border. What kind of partners are they? Russia must not be isolated! The whole partnership would be useless without us.
