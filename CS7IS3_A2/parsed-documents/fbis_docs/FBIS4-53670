Saito told a news conference it is clear the two sides want to reach agreement on the resumption during the unofficial vice- ministerial talks to be held again Monday and that he hopes Tokyo and Washington would make efforts to achieve that. Japan and the U.S. have held three rounds of exploratory talks since last week to weigh terms and conditions for resuming the negotiations under the so-called "framework" agreement concluded last July. The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese imports. Saito also said a visit to the U.S. by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is a possibility depending on the outcome of Monday's unofficial talks. Kakizawa has repeatedly expressed his intention to visit the U.S. Saito said the government will consider what steps should be taken after the ongoing talks end.
