Who Can Interpret the Puzzling Unemployment Curve?"] [Text] For more than a year now, according to the official statistics, the unemployment rate in Lithuania has been stable at 1.5 percent, and sometimes has even dipped below that figure. Is that at all possible? And if so, what does it mean? V. Slekaitis, general director of the Labor Exchange, told LIETUVOS RYTAS that on December 1 of 1993, 30,848 people in Lithuania were registered as unemployed. Of these, 13,551, or 43.9 percent were in urban areas, and 17,297, or 56.1 percent, were in the districts. Of all those registered as unemployed, there were 19,078 (or 61.8 percent) blue collar workers, and 11,770 (38.2 percent) white collar workers. Of the total, 17,615 (or 57.1 percent) were women, and 13,233 (42.9 percent) were men. Official documents from the Lithuanian Labor Exchange also indicate that the proportion of unemployed blue collar men and unemployed women in the cities has increased. The documents show that the unemployment rate for Lithuania as a whole is 1.5 percent. It is lowest in the Anyksciai, Moletai, Plunge, Kedainiai and Varena districts, and is only 0.4 percent in the city of Marijampole. In the cities of Kaunas and Klaipeda, as well as in the Pasvalys, Prienai, and Vilkaviskis districts, it is under one percent. The unemployment rate is highest in the Taurage (6.2 percent), Silute (4 percent), Akmene (3.4) percent, and Raseiniai (3.1 percent) districts, as well as in the cities of Panevezys and Druskininkai (2.5 and 2.2 percent, respectively). No further information was provided to the LIETUVOS RYTAS reporter by either V. Slekaitis or his advisor V. Zaksauskaite (other employees are not allowed to talk to the press). When asked how many Lithuanians work only part of the day, or part of the week, the heads of the Labor Exchange said that that information was for internal use only, and was not made public; under the Public Employment [Gyventoju Uzimtumo] Law, the Labor Exchange was not required to collect this information. Upon being asked whether the General Director of the Labor Exchange was aware of the real situation in the employment market, Mr. V. Slekaitis responded that "we are doing a better job than anyone else!" The real situation in the job market According to LIETUVOS RYTAS data, on December 1, 4258 job openings were listed with local labor exchanges (there were 700 more in November). Urban labor exchange listings contained 78.7 percent of all job openings. Each available job had 7.5 unemployed applicants; 6.2 for each blue collar position, and ten for each white collar one. In Kaunas, Anyksciai, Lazdijai, and Moletai, each available job had about three applicants; each one in Vilnius, Klaipeda, Alytus, Mariampole, Mazeikiai, Pakruojis, Pasvalys, Plunge, and Vilkaviskis had about five; each one in Siauliai, Panevezys, Druskininkai, Svencionys, and Telsiai had over 50; finally, each one in Sakiai, Skuodas, Jurbarkas, Taurage, and Rokiskis had 200 unemployed applicants. There were no openings for white-collar applicants on December 1 in Jurbarkas, Rokiskis, Skoudas, and Sakiai. During November, 2685 people found jobs, or 746 fewer than did so in October. The unemployment rate is three times higher than the official figures indicate We were able to find out that on December 1, in 146 Lithuanian enterprises, a total of 17,300 people were on enforced vacation, in 107 firms 32,300 worked less than a full week, and in 253 firms a total of 50,000 people worked away from their regular jobs, or in jobs that did not match their qualifications. In November, about a hundred thousand people in Lithuania worked without a clear timetable. The Lithuanian Labor Exchange has this kind of information, but does not make it public. Experts assert that the unemployment rate is actually three times higher than officially reported. The discrepancies between the fictional official statistics and the real ones can be explained by the unacknowledged existence of reduced work weeks, unpaid vacations, and other such tactics. Compared to November 1, the number of people on enforced vacations has increased by 1.1 times, because they work less than a full week, or less than a full day, because the employer lacks raw materials or fuel, it is impossible to sell the products or there are no orders for them, many firms are not profitable, or their accounts are in a state of disorder. Most commonly, the under employment of employees can be seen in industry (91.4 percent). Things are considerably better in transportation (4.4 percent), construction (2 percent), and agriculture (1.7 Percent). The rural labor exchanges In the opinion of J. Adomaitis, senior scientific associate of the Agrarian Economics Institute, by the year 2000 the rural population will decline by 1.5 percent, and the working population by 6.5 percent. Hidden unemployment will continue to flourish in the countryside, for people will find it impossible to make a living on a 2-3 hectare piece of land. The situation will be aggravated by a shift in commuting flows--about 23,000 women used to work in the cities. Since transportation has become more expensive, people want to work closer to home. Ex-agricultural experts would like to continue to work in their specialties, which will cause the supply of labor in the countryside to exceed demand by that much more. There will be a real threat of the migration of the rural population to the cities. In the opinion of J. Adomaitis, rural employment offices should seek out the unemployed, and arrange employment for them as close to their homes as possible. Only a privately capitalized, government-supported rural labor exchange could accomplish this. What are the tens of thousands who are not employed, not in school, and not registered anywhere, doing? J. Jagminas, Director of the Vilnius Labor Exchange, believes that in the capital there are 366,400 gainfully employed individuals. Only 285,000 are insured by "Sodra." Of these, 190,800 work in the public sector, and 94,100 in the private sector--69,800 in corporations or closed stock companies, 11,400 in agricultural companies, and 4,800 in privately held companies. Public organizations employ 4,300 people. About 79,500 inhabitants of Vilnius officially pay no taxes of any kind, said J. Jagminas. He also asserted that in Vilnius alone, there are about 32,400 people who do not have jobs, do not go to school, and are not registered with the Labor Exchange. In other words, are there as many unemployed in Vilnius alone as the official figures say there are in the whole country? The director of the Vilnius Labor Exchange thinks that most of the large firms in the capital are headed for bankruptcy. Officials of the aforementioned offices do not want to give to the Labor Exchanges any data on their plans to lay off employees, for future partners might not want to have anything to do with a company that has many laid off employees.
