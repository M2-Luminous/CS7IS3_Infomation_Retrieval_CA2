Date the Complex Model Becomes Mandatory One commenter notes that the individual baseline issue is only pertinent to the years during which gasoline may be produced under the simple model for determining gasoline characteristics. Beginning in 1998, when the complex model becomes mandatory, the commenter correctly points out, all reformulated gasoline will be required to achieve specified reductions from the statutory baseline. Accordingly, the commenter observes, individual baselines for foreign refineries are only critical during the years the simple model is relevant. However, the refinery/importer individual baseline will continue to be relevant beyond application of the simple model due to its application to conventional gasoline through the anti-dumping requirements. As a result, if individual foreign refinery baselines were allowed, the difficulties described above would persist in perpetuity. Accordingly, the feasibility of the baseline setting scheme established today will have longstanding effect on the viability of the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping program. K. Date Reformulated Gasoline Requirements Begin Section 211(k)(5) prohibits the sale or dispensing of conventional gasoline in any covered area beginning on January 1, 1995. In order to implement this timing mandate, EPA proposed that the reformulated gasoline requirements would apply at all locations beginning on January 1, 1995. EPA now believes that it is necessary for the reformulated gasoline requirements to apply at facilities upstream of the retail outlet level beginning on December 1, 1994, in order for facilities at the retail level to have reformulated gasoline beginning on January 1, 1995. Under the gasoline volatility program (40 CFR 80.27&hyph;80.28), the volatility standards apply at facilities upstream of the retail outlet level beginning on May 1 of each year, and at all facilities including retail outlets and wholesale purchaser-consumers beginning on June 1 of each year. 70 This regulatory approach provides a one month lead-time during which the gasoline being dispensed at terminals meets the summertime volatility standard, in order to ``turn over'' the gasoline in retail level storage tanks to meet the summertime volatility standard before June 1. As a result of this timing requirement for gasoline volatility, almost all retail outlets achieve the summertime volatility standard by June 1 through the normal cycle of gasoline deliveries. 70 The end of the volatility control season each year is September 15 at all facilities. In contrast to this favorable experience under the gasoline volatility program, during implementation of the diesel sulfur program (40 CFR 80.29&hyph;80.30) retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers had significant difficulties complying with the new requirements at the beginning of that program on October 1, 1993. The diesel sulfur regulations did not require facilities upstream of the retail level to have low sulfur diesel fuel in place well before October 1, 1993, and many terminals did not meet the low sulfur standard until very shortly before October 1. As a result, a large number of retail outlets and wholesale purchaser-consumers were not able to obtain low sulfur diesel fuel in advance of the October 1, 1993 date when all facilities were required to meet the low sulfur diesel standard. In consequence of this situation in some areas of the country prices of low sulfur diesel fuel rose 30 ¢ to 40 ¢ over the cost of high sulfur diesel fuel. As a result, EPA was compelled to grant retailers and wholesale purchaser consumers additional time after October 1 to come into compliance with the diesel sulfur standard. EPA believes that unless a lead-time is mandated under the reformulated gasoline program, the January 1, 1995 commencement will result in the same supply difficulties that occurred under diesel sulfur, and retailers and wholesale purchaser consumers will be unable to meet the reformulated gasoline standards on January 1, 1995. EPA further believes that a one month lead-time is appropriate for the reformulated gasoline program, because a lead-time of this length has been successful under the gasoline volatility program. As a result, the final regulations include the requirement that certain reformulated gasoline requirements must be met by facilities upstream of the retail level beginning on December 1, 1994. This regulatory provision constitutes a clarification of the proposal that would require all parties, including retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers, to meet the reformulated gasoline standards beginning on January 1, 1995. The proposed regulatory timing could only be achieved if upstream facilities began dispensing reformulated gasoline before January 1, 1995, and that in consequence a lead-time of approximately one month was implicit in the proposal. All regulatory requirements for reformulated gasoline apply to gasoline that is produced or imported after December 31, 1994, or any time during 1994 if it is intended for use after January 1, 1995. It is presumed that all gasoline produced or imported after December 1, 1994 is intended for use after January 1, 1995. These requirements include, inter alia, independent sampling and testing, provisions dealing with downstream oxygenate blending, record keeping, reporting, and attest engagements. This reach of the reformulated gasoline requirements is consistent with the regulatory provision contained in the proposal (also included in the final rule at §80.65(a)), that reformulated gasoline requirements would apply to all gasoline sold, dispensed, stored, transported, produced, or imported on or after January 1, 1995. EPA thus proposed that gasoline sold or dispensed on January 1, 1995, and that necessarily will have been produced or imported during 1994, would be subject to all reformulated gasoline requirements.
