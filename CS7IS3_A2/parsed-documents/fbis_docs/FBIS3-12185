Qeysar also demanded new criteria for gun permits to settlers in Judaea and Samaria. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer called for the dismantling of the Jewish settlements situated in the heart of Arab population centers. Ben-Eli'ezer was interviewed on IDF Radio by Qobi Meydan. [Begin recording] [Ben-Eli'ezer] In my opinion, we have only two choices: one choice is to deploy an entire brigade to guard them and the second alternative is to dismantle these settlements. [Meydan] In other words you are talking about dismantling these settlements for all practical purposes? [Ben-Eli'ezer] Why for all practical purposes? Today these settlements are the focal point for tension and potential pogroms. I say that we have two choices: either guard them day and night while also watching and controlling their every step or we dismantle them. There is nothing else to do. [Meydan] If you had the choice, Mr. Ben-Eli'ezer, of either bringing in a brigade to watch over ten settlers or to dismantle the settlement, what would you decide? [Ben-Eli'ezer] If the decision was up to me I would dismantle it. I am talking about certain, specific settlements. One cannot continue dreaming about autonomy and coexistence. One cannot go along with the process when you see people forcefully leading toward a violent confrontation. [end recording]
