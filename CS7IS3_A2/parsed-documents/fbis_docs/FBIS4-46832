However, it would be a mistake to think that they are all inherited from the past--the time of the conquistadors, "gold fever," or pirates on the high seas. This is one of the stories set in modern times which has a plot suitable for an adventure novel. Irkutsk Oblast holds one of the leading positions among the regions engaged in gold mining. Most of the gold in the oblast is extracted in the North--in Bodaybinskiy Rayon, where the closed-type joint-stock company "Lenzoloto" is located. Until recently it was a state enterprise--a production association with the same name. It would probably still be one today if the pace of privatization had not been stepped up. On 9 April 1992, Yegor Gaydar, who was the first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government at that time, decided that the time had come for the "Lenzoloto" PO [Production Association] to join the triumphal procession of privatization. On this day the vice premier signed Directive No. 693-r, which ordered that: "The Lena gold mining production association 'Lenzoloto,' a state enterprise, is to be transformed into a closed-type joint-stock company. The 'Lenzoloto' Joint-Stock Company is authorized to enlist foreign investors to finance production development, under the condition that the amount contributed to the joint-stock company's charter fund by foreign investors does not exceed 31 percent." However, a minor violation of the law slipped into the government decree, either because of carelessness by the officials who prepared it or an oversight by the vice premier himself. From a letter sent by the Russian Federation procurator general to the chairman of the Russian Federation Government, V.S. Chernomyrdin, on 6 September 1993: "The directive from Ye.T. Gaydar conflicts with the Basic Provisions of the Program for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in 1992, in effect at the time of its issuance, which authorized their transformation only into open-type joint-stock companies in the process of their privatization." At first glance, the violation does not seem so terrible. However, subsequent events once again confirmed the words of the classic--that the slightest violation of the law is a hole which the bourgeoisie will inevitably rush through. On 28 August 1992, Petr Mostovoy, the first deputy chairman of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration of State Property], issued his own directive to execute this Russian Federation Government directive--under the number 392-r: "The Lena Gold Mining Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company `Lenzoloto' is to be established with the participation of a foreign investor--the 'Star Technology Systems Limited' corporation--and the Lena Gold Mining Production Association `Lenzoloto' is to be abolished." Petr Mostovoy's directive raised a number of puzzling questions in the organs of state authority of Irkutsk Oblast: Why did one of the largest enterprises in the oblast's North have to be abolished and why was the foreign "Star" Corporation, which was given the honor of becoming a founder of one of the largest gold mining enterprises, glorified in this way? There were even more questions when the founding documents of the new joint-stock company arrived in the oblast in October 1992. Its founders--the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo and the "Star" Corporation, registered in Hong Kong under laws of the British Virgin Islands--set the objective of developing placer gold deposits, and most importantly, the "Sukhoy Log" Gold Deposits, the largest in Russia. At the same time, the "Star" Corporation made the commitment to put 250 million U.S. dollars into the charter fund: $125 million of this sum were to be entered in the first year after registration (which took place in September 1992) and the remaining $125 million were to be added over a 3-year period. From the report signed by "Star" President (I. Makni) and "Star" Director (L. Mor): "`Star Technology Systems, Limited,' British Virgin Islands (because of its favorable taxes): "Capital: 1 million U.S. dollars. "Financing of projects in Russia from 1990 to 1992: 7 million U.S. dollars." And here is another document. From a statement signed by Academician Boris Laskorin of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]: "Taking into account that advanced technologies have been developed in Russia to extract gold from ore and technical and economic feasibility has been established for a mining complex on the basis of the `Sukhoy Log' Deposits, we believe that there is no need to enlist any foreign firms for the `Sukhoy Log' Deposits. The Goskomimushchestvo, it would seem, has one significant argument in this regard--Russia does not have the money to develop such a project, but "Star" is providing no less than $250 million. But this is only at first glance. The fact is that the "Star" firm is realy not such a kind "transatlantic rich uncle." Initially, "Star" made the commitment to invest 250 million U.S. dollars in the operation, but a year had not gone by when Petr Mostovoy and "Star" President (I. Makni) signed a protocol changing the founding agreement: "`Star' is taking part in the formation of founding capital by transferring funds in foreign currency evaluated at 625 million rubles [R]. Within 12 months from the date of the company's registration, `Star' will pay no less than 50 percent of its share in the founding capital in the amount of R312.5 million in foreign currency at the Central Bank exchange rate in effect on the date of the company's registration." The question arises: why was there any need to make a fuss by enlisting a foreign investor for the sake of such conditions? Especially as the founding capital for the "Lenzoloto" AO [Joint-Stock Company] has not been organized, although a year and a half has gone by since the enterprise was registered. From a letter sent on 4 November 1993 by the Russian Ministry of Security: "The Russian Ministry of Security has repeatedly informed the Russian Federation Government about this matter and expressed its opinion on the inadvisability of enlisting the `Star Technology Systems' firm as a founder of the `Lenzoloto' AO under conditions of the founding agreement, which are harmful to Russia's interests and grant the joint-stock company the right to monopoly development of the `Sukhoy Log' Gold Deposits." And what is most astonishing is that those who initiated the plan to develop "Sukhoy Log" did not even get around to coordinating the project with the oblast authorities and the Bodaybinskiy Rayon administration, on whose territory the natural resources which attracted the attention of the "Star" firm are located. The collective of the "Lenzoloto" Production Association was bypassed as well. From a letter sent by the procurator general of the Russian Federation on 6 September 1993: "In accordance with the privatization plan approved by the Goskomimushchestvo, 21.15 percent of the stock, only 6.9 percent of which is common (voting) stock, is transferred to members of the labor collective, while the foreign `Star' company receives 31 percent... "Taking into account what has been stated, I ask you, Viktor Stepanovich, to take steps to eliminate the violations committed when the `Lenzoloto' Production Association was changed into the `Lenzoloto' Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company and to bring the formal documents of the government and the Goskomimushchestvo into conformity with the laws in effect." In addition to the Office of the Procurator General, the following concluded that the directives of the Goskomimushchestvo were not in conformity with Russian Federation laws: the State-Legal Administration of the Russian Federation President, the Ministry of Justice, the Management Administration of the Russian Federation President, the Roskomnedra [State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources], the Roskomdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones], the Ministry of Economics, and a number of federal departments. But things are not moving, as they say. In October 1992, the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet held up implementation of the Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents in the oblast's territory, and then appealed to the Russian Federation Supreme Court for their repeal. Unfortunately, however, consideration of the case was delayed. One of the reasons for the delay was the endless promises by the Goskomimushchestvo that the government was about to make a decision to resolve all the problems. A year and a half passed after the oblast appealed to the court. From a letter sent by V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the Committee on Security of the State Duma, to V. Lebedev, chairman of the Supreme Court, on 30 March 1994: "The violations of law permitted by the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo are threatening the interests of the Russian Federation's economic security. "A number of proposals have been prepared to eliminate the violations revealed. However, the fact that the case indicated still has not been considered is impeding their implementation to a certain extent. "We would be grateful for your assistance in speeding up resolution of this case." It is appropriate in this connection to point out that as long ago as 29 June 1993, the oblast administration, the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet, and the Russian Federation President's representative in Irkutsk Oblast, together with the Roskomdragmet, the Ministry of Atomic Energy, and the Roskomnedra, submitted a draft directive to the Russian Federation Government which provides for the repeal of the Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents and brings Y. Gaydar's directive of 9 April 1992 and the mechanism for financing development of "Sukhoy Log" into conformity with the law. Elections to the local self-government organs in Irkutsk Oblast were held on 27 March 1993. The newly elected head of administration of the city of Bodaybo. N. Sizykh, petitioned the court for the Bodaybo administration to take part in the case as an independent party. The court approved this petition. The next court session is set for 6 July 1994--enough time for the Russian Federation Government to heed the opinion expressed by the Office of the Procurator General and ministries and departments and put an end to this drawn-out story.
