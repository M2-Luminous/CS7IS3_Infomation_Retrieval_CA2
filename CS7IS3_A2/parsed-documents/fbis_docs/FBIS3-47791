Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said Japan wants to closely watch the deliberations at the convention, which resumed Tuesday after adjournments four times. The Japanese Government hopes that progress will be made in the deliberations and that democracy will be achieved as soon as possible, he said. Myanmar's military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), has nullified the results of a 1990 election in which Nobel prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory, and has said elections will be held after a new constitution is adopted.
