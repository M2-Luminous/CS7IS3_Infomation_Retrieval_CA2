According to the commander in chief of the NPFL, Charles Gankay Taylor, the renegade LPC assisted by Nigerian soldiers attacked NPFL positions in Compound No.2 in Grand Bassa County and the Firestone areas over the weekend. The NPFL leader said it is clear that the NPFL will not accept the blatant abuse of peacekeeping by ECOMOG in Liberia and its continued acts of destruction and killings of Liberians. Since recent pronouncements by the U.S. Government confirming that Nigeria has been aiding and abetting armed groups, particularly the LPC and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for in Liberia] against the NPFL, ECOMOG is continuously escalating the war in Liberia. According to citizens fleeing out of the area, the rage of terror has hit the Harbel Firestone and Kakata areas with ECOMOG arresting citizens and skinning them alive, and selling human parts for meat in Kakata area and other areas. The NPFL leader is calling on the international community and the United Nations to immediately conduct investigations into the behavior of ECOMOG in Liberia and enforce measures that could make them desist from such practices.
