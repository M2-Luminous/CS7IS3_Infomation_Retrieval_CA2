The ethnic Albanians are seeking a degree of autonomy bordering on independence for a third of Macedonia's territory, mainly in areas where they form a majority of the population, such as on the frontier with Albania itself. The Macedonian Government says the Albanians comprise 20 percent of the population of 2.3 million people. The ethnic Albanians put it at 50 percent. The main Albanian political party in Macedonia, the Democratic Prosperity Party, which is part of the coalition government in power in Skopje, split into two factions in February. That rupture "was caused by direct interference from Tirana," Macedonian Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski said in an interview with AFP. A party congress at which the split occurred was attended by lawmakers and diplomats from Albania proper. The traditional leadership of the party was accused by Albania of damaging the cause of the Albanian minority in Macedonia. The leader of the new faction, 28-year-old Menduh Taqi, has received a hero's welcome in Albania. But while he had tough words for Albania, Frckovski suggested that 30 ethnic Albanians due to go on trial for allegedly running guns to Albanian militia here would not have the book thrown at them. Although the defendants could be sentenced to between two and 10 years, the minister said, "Harsh sentences should not be expected."
