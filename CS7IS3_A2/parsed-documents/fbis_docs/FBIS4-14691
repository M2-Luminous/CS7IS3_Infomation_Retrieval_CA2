He said that first it is planned to carry out a gradual ceasefire and to separate forces. After that it would be possible to start talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. "Anyway the principle "peace in exchange for territories" for the Karabakh conflict is unacceptable, the diplomat said. Kazimirov spoke in favor of sending peacekeeping forces to the region, of which Russian troops could be a part. Only in that case, he said, it would be possible to guarantee a ceasefire and a lasting peace in the conflict zone.
