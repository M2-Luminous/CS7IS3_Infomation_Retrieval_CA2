There were no survivors. By 9 pm last night [1300 gmt], the cause of the crash was still under investigation. However, rescue teams have already recovered the black box containing the flight recording, which is being analysed by experts, according to reports from the crash site. A source from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said Flight No 2303 took off at 8:12 am on a flight to Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province. Eight minutes later, the plane lost contact with the airport control tower, the source said, and was seen crashing in farmland in Mingdu town of Chang'an County soon afterwards . Reports from the scene were confused but the latest information said that all the 146 passengers -- including 133 mainland Chinese plus four Italian, two American, two British, three Hong Kong, one Taiwanese and another unidentified overseas traveler -- and also the 14 crew members on board the Russian-made jet were confirmed as killed. The death toll included four children, according to airline sources. Three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in the clouds and then saw a fire ball crashing to the ground. Debris was scattered across a wide area. Local officials, aviation experts, and medical personnel rushed to the crash site upon hearing the news. Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and leading officials of CAAC and the Ministry of Labour, including the newly appointed CAAC director Chen Guangyi, flew from Beijing to Xian to investigate the case soon after the crash was reported. The crash site was 30 kilometres southeast of Xian and 80 kilometres away from the Xianyang International Airport, where the plane took off. It was near the Qinling Mountains but the site of the crash was level ground. The incident was the first air fatality in China since last November, when an MD-82 airliner of China Northern Airlines crashed while landing in the western city of Urumqi. Twelve people died in that accident.
