In a meeting with Evans today, Li noted that there is no conflict of fundamental interests between the two countries, which actually share interests in upholding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, promoting regional cooperation and developing their own economies. He continued that in the current international relations, the economic factor plays an increasingly important role. The China-Australia cooperation in iron and steel, energy, transportation and communications has a sound foundation and holds great potentials for expansion, Li said. Evans told Li that Australia is also pleased to see the big momentum of its trade and economic cooperation with China. Discussing the human rights issue, both Li and Evans voiced support to the Vienna declaration and program of action, with Li adding that China made big efforts in drafting the declaration. Li continued that the declaration has reflected the developing countries' basic position and demands, namely the right to development is an inalienable part of the basic human rights. The declaration, while affirming the universality of human rights, says that people should not neglect the actual conditions of different countries and regions such as history, culture and religion or confine human rights to only one mold, Li noted. He stressed that the right to development is an undeprivable human right, because the declaration states that poverty and debt are big obstacles to human rights. Li Peng further stated that the latest resolution adopted at the recent U.N. Commission on Human Rights shows that it would not do to impose one country's views on human rights onto others. The only correct way is to conduct friendly discussions on the basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, Li added.
