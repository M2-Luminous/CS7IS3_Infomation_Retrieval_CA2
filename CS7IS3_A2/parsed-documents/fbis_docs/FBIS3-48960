The instruction is one of the executory regulations accompanying the 1982 Law on the Protection of State Secrets. MSW press spokesman Andrzej Szczypinski announced that the text of this regulation would be made available to the press next week. [passage omitted] Szczypinski did not deny that today's decision by the interior minister was connected with a discussion on the government's draft Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Professional Confidentiality presented in the Sejm on 2 December 1993. Among other things, the draft bans every person, including journalists, who has information classified by the government as secret from revealing it. Jerzy Zimowski, deputy minister of internal affairs, said on 22 December that the ministry "will not favor solutions too harsh for journalists" and suggested that the role of the press in cases of classified information should be discussed.
