A searching audit of the programme by the EU's hard-nosed financial watchdog, coming towards the end of the ESPRIT's current life-cycle, is a positive move which might have usefully been carried out in the programme's earlier days. The views of this lesser-known EU institution, charged with the job of ensuring accountability, must be implemented as the new information technology programme unfolds under the Fourth Framework programme. Yet there is not all that much new in what the Court of Auditors had to say. Most of the sharp-edged and incisive points they make about ESPRIT have been made many times before -- some almost from the programme's inception. Many of these points have been reiterated over and over in this very editorial column. The Court of Auditors' Report is like the summing-up of a judge at the end of a lengthy trial, a summing up that takes account of evidence and opinions garnered over many years. One issue that stands out is that of precompetitive research. The ESPRIT programme early on developed an ideological attachment to this, which suggested that the exploitation of research results would be an act of dangerous intervention. That this issue still has to be questioned after all this time is hard to believe. However, it has to be acknowledged that progress has been made. The transfer from DG XIII to DG III ended ESPRIT's experience of existing in an isolated empire, opening the programme up to broader economic, industrial and other considerations. With the approach of the Fourth Framework, it is to be hoped that the summing-up of the eminent judges in Luxembourg will prove final and that the programme under its new name can start a new life without making the same mistakes over again! Single Market Strategy As mentioned in the last issue of the Eurotech Forum, the EC Commission has devised an elaborate framework to consolidate and to regulate the Single Market. This is known as "Making the Most of the Internal Market": Strategic Programme. According to the Commission, it decided "to prepare a strategic programme for the completion, the management and the future development of the internal market, which can serve as a guide to the main priorities of the Community in this area and as a means of measuring the progress of the Community towards its objectives." They also add that "an overall plan for the implementation" of the internal market is desirable. The Commission wants to see this come about by an endorsement from the Council of the general orientation provided in the strategic programme and by a firm undertaking by the Council to accelerate discussion on the seventeen legislative proposals from the 1985 White Paper that are still before it, with a view to their final adoption before the end of 1994. The strategic programme is divided into specific categories. Section A, which is the completion of the basic legal framework calls for the adoption of the legislative proposals that still have to be agreed so that the basic legal infrastructure for the single market can be established and which will serve to expose regulated sectors to competition. This includes the adoption of the outstanding measures from the 1985 White Paper, in the areas of company law, taxation and intellectual and industrial property. Action to ensure the free movement of persons as well as measures to introduce competition into the regulated sectors of energy, telecommunications and postal services are envisaged. Section B deals with managing the single market. This aspect of the strategy is about the need to ensure conformity and transparency in the transposition of Community directives into national law and the need to ensure quality in enforcement. Measures will be introduced to support administrative cooperation, including proposals on the development of a communication and data exchange network for Union administration. Means of redress, such as providing access to justice and judicial cooperation, will be developed, as will the importance of evaluating Community rules. The "practical performance of the legislation" and "the broader business and economic impact" will be assessed. In this context, existing networks will be used. A major study on the economic effects of the internal market will get underway in 1994 with likely publication in 1996. Improvements to the INTRASTAT system are also envisaged. Section C is about developing the single market. This will take steps to ensure transparency and the application of the principle of proportionality in preparing new Community legislation. Regarding communication and information measures, the Commission will devise "a coherent strategy involving Community institutions, national administrations and non-governmental organisations in a systematic and coordinated way." Moves to improve the business environment will deal with the application of competition policy, improving cross-border payments, further proposals on transport, promotion of Union-wide protection of intellectual and industrial property, improving company law, the creation of a favourable tax regime for business, covering action on both direct and indirect taxation, the upgrading of European standardization and conformity assessment and quality systems. Further improving the environment for the consumer and the relationship between sustainable development and the internal market as also included, as is the establishment of trans-European networks. The strategic programme points to the convergence of interests and coordination and action designed to stimulate private investment and to ensure technical interoperability, and proposals on the "early development of telematic networks between administrations."
