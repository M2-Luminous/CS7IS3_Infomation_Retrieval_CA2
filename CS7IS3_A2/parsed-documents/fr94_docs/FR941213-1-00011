Background Title IV of SMCRA established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231 et seq. to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. The Secretary adopted AML regulations (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994) at 30 CFR Subchapter R, Parts 795, 870, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, and 886 to implement this act. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program.
