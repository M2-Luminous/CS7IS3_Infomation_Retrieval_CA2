SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces the availability of educational loan repayment under the National Institutes of Health Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Research Loan Repayment Program. The Program, which is authorized by section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;1), as added by the Health Omnibus Programs Extension Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;607) and amended by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43), provides for the partial repayment of the accumulated educational loan debt of health professionals who agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to AIDS. The Program provides for the repayment of up to $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals for each year of obligated service. The purpose of the program is the recruitment and retention of highly qualified health professionals conducting AIDS research as NIH employees. The NIH, through this notice, invites health professionals interested in engaging in AIDS research as NIH employees to apply for participation in the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. DATES: Interested persons may request information about the Program beginning on September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Information regarding the requirements and application procedures for the Program may be obtained by calling or writing: Mr. Marc Horowitz, Director, NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program, Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health, Federal Building, Suite 102, 7550 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland 20892&hyph;9905 (1&hyph;800&hyph;528&hyph;7689). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&hyph;43) was enacted on June 10, 1993, amending section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;1). Section 487A directs the Secretary to continue a program of entering into agreements with appropriately qualified health professionals under which such health professionals agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in consideration of the Federal Government agreeing to repay, for each year of service, not more than $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals. This program is known as the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. Under the Program, the NIH will repay qualified educational loan debt incurred by health professionals to pay for their undergraduate, graduate, and/or medical educational expenses. Upon application, individuals must have total qualified debt which will exceed 20% of their anticipated annual NIH salary (``debt threshold'') on the date of program eligibility. Half of this debt threshold amount will not be repaid by the Program and will remain the obligation of the participant. The remaining repayable debt of qualified health professionals will be satisfied at the rate of one-third per year, subject to a statutory limit of $20,000 per year, for each year of obligated service EXCEPT for individuals with repayable debt equal to or less than $10,000. These individuals will receive repayment of their repayable debt at the rate of one-half per year. Obligated service requires individuals selected to participate in the Program to agree to serve at least 2 years as an NIH employee engaged in qualified AIDS research. Participants may apply for renewal contracts in one-year increments to satisfy their remaining repayable debt.
