Hard on their heels, however, is a fast-growing army of counterfeiters who are pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars while local officials look the other way. Take the case of Microsoft. In October 1991, the US software manufacturer was shocked to discover counterfeit copies of its hologram appearing up and down the American West Coast. Company officials had thought the hologram -- a sophisticated reflective sticker used to authenticate products -- was almost impossible to duplicate. After months of detective work, the fakes were traced to an unexpected source: the Shenzhen Reflective Materials Institute at Shenzhen University in southern China. The institute was raided the following March by the Shenzhen Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC), which found contracts and materials that suggested the institute had received an order for 3 million holograms. Almost two years later, many questions remain. "The AIC did a very good raid, it was excellent," Alix Parlour, corporate attorney for Microsoft, said. "But it's been downhill since then." Despite numerous meetings with the Shenzhen branch of the AIC, she said, the Chinese had failed to provide Microsoft with information they have about a Taiwanese company involved in the case. Microsoft still has no idea where the moulds used to make the holograms are, or, more importantly, if they are still in use. Company officials are not sure why the Chinese are dragging their feet, but Parlour offered the following speculation. "There's always the dismal prospect that someone at the university is well-connected and can protect the institute," she said. Many counterfeiters are state enterprises, collectives, or village or township enterprises. "Officials say, `Hey, these are my factories, I'm not going to put these guys out of business'," a Hong Kong-based trade official said. One leading provincial official in the south of China told a US trade official that he would only intervene on behalf of foreign manufacturers producing in his province. Experts agree that the State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- which deals with trademark infringements -- is serious about cracking down on pirates. Unfortunately, the state organisation's local branches, understaffed and lacking resources and political clout, often prove unable or unwilling to take action. Local AIC branches are particularly careful when dealing with big counterfeiters with powerful connections. "Sometimes the AIC will carry out a raid right away," Joseph Simone, a lawyer with Johnson Stokes and Master who advises on intellectual property law, said. "But often they will first do a political background check to see who the counterfeiter is. Some people have gone to jail for going after the wrong factory." In some cases, money can move the AIC to action. Foreign companies report being asked to "contribute" funds to set up special teams to raid infringers. The head of one industry association said his organisation was asked for US$250,000 (about HK$1.95m). Patrick Wong, executive secretary of the Hong Kong office of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said that while China had the capacity to turn out 62 million compact discs a year, its actual consumption was 2-3 million. The rest, says the former Hong Kong policeman, ended up in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Canada and the US. Although the organisation, which represents recording artists around the world, provided Chinese officials with the names and locations of about a dozen factories that were illegally reproducing CDs and handed over funds for a task force, when the AIC finally carried out raids it was against shops in Shenzhen and not the well connected factories manufacturing tens of millions of CDs. And getting the AIC to carry out a raid does not necessarily end a company's problems. Although foreign companies are generally permitted to send a representative along on raids, not all AICs allow this. When the AIC raided three companies pirating Walt Disney products in Guangdong province last year, the American company was not allowed to participate in the raid, raising doubts about what was actually seized and what has happened to the factories. "We'll only believe it when we can go on a raid and see (the offender) shut down and say `ouch'," John Feenie, executive vice-president Asia Pacific for Walt Disney, said. Some foreigners also suspect that AIC officials tip off violators before a raid can be organised. To prevent this, Steven McVeigh, Hong Kong manager for Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations Services, said the company sometimes stationed employees outside factories even before it approached the AIC. Simone estimates that some big companies should budget as much as US$500,000 to cover the cost of private investigators, lawyers and in-house staff. But, he added, few companies were earning enough in China to justify such an expense. And even when a company succeeds in uncovering an infringer, justice is not always done. Criminal punishments are rarely handed down and only in trademark cases. It is difficult to get compensation and fines are too low to be a deterrent. In the case of Microsoft, it took the AIC two years to fine the offender and the fine was HK$2,000. Some frustrated companies have abandoned the legal road for more direct methods. This often results in what Simone described as "an unhealthy reliance" on establishing guanxi, or connections. One foreign law firm that has handled intellectual-property cases through its offices in China has retired Chinese judges on its staff.
