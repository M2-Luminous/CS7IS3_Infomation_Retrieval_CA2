Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura did not reveal the size of the package. Government sources say the business stimulating measures will total 15 to 16 trillion yen and will include 7 trillion yen in income and resident tax cuts. Takemura said the cuts and revenue sources for them will be specified in the plan. The government and ruling coalition parties "will decide in the first half of this week on how big the income tax and resident tax cuts should be, whether corporate taxes can also be reduced and how to finance such tax cuts," he said. Takemura spoke at a reception in Takamatsu, Shikoku Island, sponsored by his party, Sakigake (Harbinger). Takemura, who is Hosokawa's chief spokesman and chief of staff, said many leaders of the coalition's seven parties share the view that the tax cuts should be implemented for a certain period of time before the consumption tax is raised from the present 3 percent. The Finance Ministry insists the cuts be carried out in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax to 7 percent around April 1995, government sources say.
