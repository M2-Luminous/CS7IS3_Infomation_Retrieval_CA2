Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-21JAN94-SYRIA Syria-US-Israel Arabic Version of Al-Asad's Statement on "Normal Relations" President Hafiz al-Asad's 16 January statement supporting "normal peaceful relations among all" as a result of peace with Israel went significantly further than previously in suggesting a willingness to meet Israel's demand for full-fledged ties; but in his statement, which did not elaborate on the meaning of "normal relations," he evidently made a conscious effort to avoid using the term in Arabic that most clearly connotes such ties. Speaking at the joint press conference with President Clinton following their summit in Geneva, al-Asad endorsed "'alaqat silm 'adiyah" (Damascus TV, 16 January) rather than "'alaqat silm tabi'iyah." Although the former term can also be translated as "normal peaceful relations" ('adiyah means ordinary or regular), Arab media generally use the word "tatbi'"--from which the latter expression is derived--to connote "normalization," presumably including full diplomatic ties, trade, and tourism. In fact, the term "tatbi'" was used by Syrian media's Arabic translation of President Clinton's reference at the joint press conference to eventual "normal and peaceful relations" between Syria and Israel.
