The puppets of the communist Vietnamese have mustered a number of their lieutenant generals, major generals, and brigadier generals to launch new offensives along Route 68. Moreover, they also called up the previously defeated troops from Kompong Thom Province as reinforcements, and General Prum Samen was personally sent from the Phnom Penh headquarters to command troops on the battlefield. 2. During the two-day battle from 15 to 16 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] attacked them with gunfire and land mines, destroying five army vehicles and two tanks. The NADK also killed over 20 enemy soldiers and seriously wounded more than 30 others, including Prum Samen, an envoy of the Phnom Penh headquarters who had previously been posted to Stoung Battlefield in Kompong Thom Province. The enemy commanders and their rank and file were in panic but the Phnom Penh headquarters was then not able to find a replacement for Prum Samen. Finally, it ordered [Gen.] Long Sopheap of Siem Reap Province's Military Region 4 to replace the wounded general. Long Sopheap, however, said he did not yet want to go and that he needed to wait and look at the situation for a little while. 3. Afraid of being killed, the commanders of the ranks of captain, major, and colonel have fled the battlefield one after another. Hundreds of soldiers who had been forcibly recruited in various villages as well as troops in diverse units have also deserted in force.
