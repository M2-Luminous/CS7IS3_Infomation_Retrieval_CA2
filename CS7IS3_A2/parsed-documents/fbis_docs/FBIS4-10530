He said the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) is demanding that the Mexican Army cut back its presence in the region and that livestock breeders and ranchers suppress their belligerence in order for the talks to resume. The EZLN military strategist also said the rebels have heard nothing from Manuel Camacho Solis -- either privately or publicly -- as previously stated by the former foreign minister. In an interview with three reporters in a clearing in the Lacandona jungle, the subcommander commented on Camacho Solis' public reappearance and on his views on the peace process. On Friday, the commissioner, speaking to representatives of the three branches of the government, reaffirmed his commitment and his position on a political solution to the armed conflict. He also mentioned that new steps will be taken in the next few weeks aimed at building peace. Basically, Marcos believes that "political and military" conditions are not right for the resumption of talks. He charged that the Mexican Army is conducting new troop movements into new areas in the region. [Marcos] "What they did was to move them out of the press' way. They retreated across the flank the press covers, namely Tuxtla Gutierrez, San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. Some of them came around Arraiga, and the others came through Villahermosa and Tenosique. Five days ago about 30 8.5 ton trucks came down from Tenosique along the border highway, transporting about 1,000 or 1,200 soldiers." [LA JORNADA] Don't you think this is just movement of troop replacements? [Marcos] This is within the replacement. What they do is to relocate the parachute and sapper units; they get them out of the press' way and place them in the rear. The paratroopers are counterguerrilla rangers [preceding word in English]. In military terms this means sappers and paratroopers in the rear; thereby the hammer and anvil operation is inverted. It would now be on the border and the anvil here. "I believe here they have too much at stake and the game is to penetrate the woods (the Lacondona jungle), control the road and from there position the anvil. I do not think they will risk positioning the anvil in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas because this would be too obvious and they do not want this." [LA JORNADA] What are they thinking of then? Is this an offensive tactic? [Marcos] Isolation, removing the guerrillas as spokesmen on society. They want us to stop making statements; they want us to stop doing what we are now doing. They want to take us out of these woods. Nevertheless, the troop movements here have to be very quick to force us out of here. What was planned previously on this side -- that is to move in the sappers and the paratroopers who are the green berets -- was to defuse the mines. These are counterguerrilla units who come in to clash and to locate us. "The units used are from 12-15 [not further explained]. We are talking about approximately 5,000 men, a division. This is an airborne division, following the gringo model of a rapid intervention. "Therefore, initially they move in this direction, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, on the landing fields here. The landing field of Altamirano was refurbished while all commercial flights from Las Margaritas landing field were stopped. There they have set up a garrison from where they start to push us to over there (the border with Guatemala). Over there is located the anvil, in this case it would be the Kaibiles (elite unit of the Guatemalan Army). At this point, the Mexican Army eases up, and there they would force us to confront the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles then apply the anvil. "To this end, they publish in the media that the soldiers have left; the reporters see them passing through San Cristobal de las Casas. Nevertheless, they turn back and then change troops." [LA JORNADA] Is the government playing both sides? Camacho said he coordinates the interests of peace, in reference to the cattle breeders. [Marcos] Yes, I believe he is going to attempt to include the cattle breeders somewhere in the dialogue. They had already intended to talk to us as they know very well that we have not yet invaded the farms. Maybe they want to take advantage of this to reach an agreement and solve the problem of the cattle that was the war tax and to somehow negotiate land ownership. "Meanwhile, the Army supposedly continues to ease military pressure. What it is really doing is maintaining it at the same level. It is not compartmented; it simply has changed strategy. This is the last report I received yesterday (Friday)." [LA JORNADA] This is not clear. What does the government want? Does it want to continue with the dialogue, or is it preparing for a final offensive? [Marcos] It does not want to continue with the talks; what are now suspended are the talks. They want to know what the communities are going to say, and they want to maintain the military presence. They are waiting to see the results of the talks, to then ease the military pressure and begin negotiations." [LA JORNADA] Do you believe you will continue with the dialogue if the conditions exit? [Marcos] No. Right now the conditions do not exist. We thought they were since the committee had been noticing the withdrawal of soldiers, but their departure was not confirmed. Reports from our front line indicated that (the soldiers) were not leaving. Later we received reports that they were coming through another place. Since there was no movement in the rest of the country, we figured out that it was just the same soldiers moving from one place to another. "Thus far, the situation has not changed. Colosio's slaying was the pivotal factor in the suspension of the talks. We said: There is the perfect excuse. Seemingly, it is now when it is becoming clear that it is not our fault, and there is an internal government plot. We can hold the talks with that (military) tactic in place so long as they do not have a legal basis to attack us..." [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you met with Camacho Solis a few days ago? [Marcos] No. I have not seen Camacho since the talks, and it is not true that he has sent any secret communiques. If he did, they have not arrived. We have not heard from Camacho since the talks. He was awaiting the results of the talks. We went along with the process; then Colosio was assassinated, and the whole thing was suspended. We had heard he was coming (to Chiapas). However, I have not had any contact with him, either written, public, or secret. [LA JORNADA] Why are they saying that? [Marcos] The government is waiting to see how the situation evolves. Colosio was their alternative in the negotiations. After Colosio's death, they must readjust to decide what they will offer or negotiate. [LA JORNADA] Under what conditions will you resume the dialogue and come down to the cathedral? [Marcos] In order to resume the dialogue, some military conditions must exist. One is that the Army reduce its presence. Another condition is a decrease in aggression -- at least until the dialogue is resumed -- on the part of the cattlemen, businessmen, and the political class. This aggression seemed to come mainly from the municipal presidents and the cattlemen. Obviously, Salinas' resignation would be a welcome sign. [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you want to speak to Zedillo? [Marcos] No. I have never said... I could give you some advice on how to write textbooks, but I never said that. The committee has not held a meeting since it was appointed, and it is very possible that it will not support any of the candidates. "I had already given up on the idea of the candidates coming here. We will not invite them anymore, but we are willing to talk with a representative. For that matter, we are willing to talk with any representative. What truly matters to us is that they come here because if something happens to them, if a plane crashes... What I have said is that we are willing to talk with any candidate, but I did not think they would come because if something happened to them, they would blame us. Seeing as how Colosio was killed, we can expect anything to happen to any other candidate."
