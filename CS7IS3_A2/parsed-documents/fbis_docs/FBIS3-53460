Before his departure, Sha'th said that the Palestinian-Israeli talks will be resumed in Taba on Tuesday morning. Sha'th said he submitted to President 'Arafat and the other Palestinian leaders in Tunis a comprehensive report about the progress of the negotiations, especially in light of the problem that Israel caused with what it called "the Cairo agreement" between the two sides. This problem was solved when Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, acting in the interest of the peace process, backed the Palestinian stance. Dr. Sha'th added that the report he submitted to the Palestinian leadership included his expectations about the future of the Taba talks with the Israelis. He said that the Palestinian leaders held lengthy discussions on this issue, adding that he was given the necessary instructions about it. Explaining his instructions, Sha'th said they included commitment to continuing the peace process and to achieving results on the specified dates so that there can be no retraction of the schedule set for withdrawal. He pointed out that the dates are an important part of the agreement. Sha'th explained that Palestinian and Israeli negotiators in Taba are about to formulate a protocol of civilian powers in Gaza and Jericho in a process known as the transfer of powers to the Palestinian National Authority. He announced: We are about to complete this protocol this week, indicating the transfer of all civilian powers to the Palestinian National Authority. Sha'th noted that during the round of talks that will begin tomorrow the negotiators will focus on complex issues, including the border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, the Gaza settlements, and the presence of international forces, an important part of the Declaration of Principles. Sha'th added: If we succeed in settling these issues, we will begin concentrating on the details of other security matters. Sha'th described the Syrian-U.S. summit as a positive development that brings Syria back to the negotiating operation, something that is bound to help attain a comprehensive peace. He noted that Syria will be returning to the negotiations armed with a full commitment on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the restoration of Syrian sovereignty there. Sha'th remarked that this is good for the peace process because it emphasizes an important precedent, namely that a real implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 means full withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967. He pointed out that Egypt got as much in the Camp David accords. He said Syria is now repeating the Egyptian achievement and the same will be applied to the Palestinian territories when negotiations over the final status are held. Sha'th said that the Clinton-al-Asad meeting was useful as a precedent and was beneficial because it stressed the principle of comprehensiveness.
