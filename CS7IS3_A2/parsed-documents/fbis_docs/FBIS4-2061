Addressing the opening ceremony of the 29th Conference of Governors of the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN), Lien said the ROC now ranks high on the list of foreign investors in most SEACEN member nations and its bilateral trade with these countries has increased tremendously. "Even though our overseas investments have shown a slight drop in the past couple of years," Lien said, "the ROC remains among the top three foreign investors in most of SEACEN member nations." Lien said Taiwan will discuss the issue of double taxation and reach agreements on the promotion and protection investments with each of these countries. "We hope to reduce as much as possible the many obstacles to economic and trade interflow," he noted. The premier continued that Taiwan is drawing up plans to eliminate restrictions on the establishment of financial institutions and their range of operations, to gradually relax the control of capital flow, and to encourage competition from more foreign financial institutions so as to further liberalize its financial markets. "We are also cultivating talent, promoting a free flow of commodities and information, and making the best use of Taiwan's strategic location and economic conditions to develop the Taiwan area into a multinational operations center in the Asia-Pacific," Lien said. He added Taiwan hopes to attract both domestic and foreign capital to create a bright future for Taiwan's economic development. Speaking on the same occasion, Lord Kingsdown, former governor of the Bank of England, said the world has become steadily more inter- dependent and economically integrated. Against this background, Kingsdown said, international monetary cooperation has become very important. He noted that the volume of international financial transactions has grown substantially in recent years. He cited as an example that United States cross- border transactions in bonds and equities grew from 2.8 percent of gross domestic products (GDP) in 1970 to 92 percent of GDP in 1990. Central bank governors and other senior financial officials from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar [Burma] and the host ROC -- attended the opening ceremony at the Taipei International Convention Center. Central bank governors from Cambodia, Laos, Fiji and Tonga were also present at the meeting as observers. This is the first time Taiwan has hosted the annual SEACEN conference. Taiwan became a full member of the forum in 1993. The government-level regional financial cooperation organization was founded in 1966. The participants will review regional financial situations and discuss possible financial and economic cooperation projects over the next two days. A joint statement will be issued at the end of the annual conference Friday. President Li Teng-hui is scheduled to receive the Southeast Asian central bank governors Thursday.
