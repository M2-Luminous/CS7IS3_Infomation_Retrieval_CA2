FBIS3-50933 "drlat007_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 Peru Shining Path `Leader' Rejects Guzman's Orders PA1101031394 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0144 GMT 11 Jan 94 PA1101031394 Madrid EFE Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Lima, 10 Jan (EFE) -- According to a report published today in the Lima magazine SI, the terrorist violence that persists in Peru is led by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," who has rejected the leadership of Abimael Guzman, the founder of the Maoist Shining Path who is in favor of a peace agreement. The rejection by Ramirez Durand of the orders of Guzman, who is the top leader and is considered the "guiding thought" of the terrorist organization, has led this group to a schism which is analyzed by the political weekly publication. The report states that while Guzman seeks to put an end to the "people's war" with his petitions for a peace agreement with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, "Feliciano" and his followers advocate a continuation of violence. Ramirez, who is considered the number three man of the group after Guzman and his mistress Elena Iparraguirre -- who are both sentenced to life imprisonment -- has become the leader of those who follow him and who now disavow the leadership of the Shining Path founder. According to the magazine, the dissidents today recognize "Feliciano" as the new "president" of the Shining Path. For them, Guzman no longer is "President Gonzalo," and he has become "just another prisoner." The attacks that took place in Lima during the last week of December and the first week of January -- including the detonation of car bombs in the Prefecture (Civil Government) of Lima that left over 20 injured and considerable damage -- are attributed to this radical group. The weekly publication feels that this "recalcitrant" group of Shining Path was formed by the union of the People's Aid of Peru -- a Shining Path group that supported armed actions and provided all types of assistance to the activists -- with the Metropolitan Committee that has formed a Regional Directorate. According to the report, this directorate would come under a central committee that has been reorganized under the leadership of Ramirez Durand. The report adds that in Lima, four special detachments have been organized by the veterans in the terrorist struggle, and that only one of them -- the one in the eastern area of the city -- is reportedly engaging in military actions, while the others are conducting political activities to recruit new militants. In October of 1993, three weeks after Abimael Guzman sent the first letter from prison to the Peruvian president asking him to hold talks for a peace agreement, in more than one town of Puno Department, southeast of Lima, there appeared signs that read: "Viva President Feliciano." The weekly adds that, later, in the jungle region of Tingo Maria, a Shining Path column stopped a passenger vehicle and one of the members told them that "Feliciano" had assumed leadership of the organization because "Guzman is no longer President Gonzalo, because he is a traitor to the revolutionary cause." "We do not agree with the letter of surrender. To the contrary, we will continue to struggle," the Shining Path member reportedly said. SI states that the reports show "two lines, two directions, two currents," and that the other one is that made up of 2,500 Shining Path members, who are being held in 10 prisons in the country. Abimael Guzman exercises control over them. It adds that Guzman has managed to retain the loyalty of that group, due to a project begun three months ago when the two letters in which he asked Fujimori for peace were made public. The magazine states that the Shining Path leader obtained the transfer from Yanamayo Prison (in Puno) to Lima of several leaders, including Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, Victor Zavala, and Maria Pantoja. Guzman instructed the imprisoned militants at a meeting in the Naval Base where he is being held to persuade the imprisoned members to accept the request for peace. Shining Path members who are being held in the prisons of Santa Monica and Canto Grande of Lima and Yanamayo Prison in Puno have expressed support for Abimael Guzman's peace request.
