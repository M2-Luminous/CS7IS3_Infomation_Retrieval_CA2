Some time ago, we visited a methane gas plant at a village located in Taesan-ri, Chongju County. The methane gas plant is operated by one person. The plant has a round shape with a ferment room on the second floor and machine room, compressor room, and supply room on the first floor. First, we visited the ferment room. A functionary of the cooperative farm said: "How nice it is to build, with our own might, such an outstanding tank to produce methane gas!" After hearing from him, we went to the supply room through the compressor room. Many pipelines have been laid in the supply room to transport gases to automobiles and other agricultural machines. Comrade Kim Hyo-song, secretary of the ri party, said that "We are widely using methane gas to operate machine facilities." According to his remarks, the cooperative farm has properly built the base to produce methane gas and, above all, formulated plans to use it for use by agricultural machines. Therefore, automobiles, rice transplanting machines, weeders, and small-sized harvest machines are being operated using the gases. The methane gas production base built by the cooperative farm's own might has greatly improved the rural people's standard of living. Also, the cooperative farm uses methane gas to operate generators. The gas pipelines between the supply room and the rural dwellings are connected like a spider's web. We visited a family at No. 10 workshop village, where a housewife was preparing a lunch by using a gas stove. We use methane gas byproduct as a good quality fertilizer.
