It is completely cleared up until 1 June this year, when possibly the issue of the Russian state budget and the ability of Ostankino to pay for the relay of its programs to the Latvian Radio and Television Center will be solved. Until 1 June Ostankino will be relayed at its present extent, on condition that losses incurred by the relays not paid for will not be covered from the Latvian state budget. Likewise, the Latvian Radio and Television Council maintains the right to deploy free broadcasting time to other programs. The Council resolved to announce a competition for free air time on Latvian television networks. It will decide separately on the terms of the competition.
