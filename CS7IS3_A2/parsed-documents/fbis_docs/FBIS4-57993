Thus, he replied to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who claimed he was a personal friend of the jailed former president and attributed Perez' current situation to maneuvers by his enemies. "I acknowledge and respect the opinion of a man like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but I do not think he has been adequately informed about what has happened in Venezuela," the interior minister curtly replied. Escovar argues that Perez was tried with all the appropriate guarantees. That trial, he notes, was for embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. "It is not at all true that he was tried because he is a champion of democracy in America. He has not been jailed for the good he has done for democracy but for the harm he has caused the nation," Escovar said. Escovar believes this trial "stimulates the moral recovery of Venezuela and strengthens democratic institutions." Remarking that it was the first time that a president in office has ever been tried, Escovar recalled that when he initiated his action against Carlos Andres Perez (11 March 1993), "no one believed it was possible." "Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the action I undertook had a solid basis, as evidenced by the fact that the Senate unanimously suspeded Carlos Andres Perez from his post. Now, an arrest warrant has been issued against him with 10 votes in favor of the decision and five against." The interior minister believes what some are saying, that is, that Carlos Andres Perez accepted his arrest while apparently rejecting privileges as a maneuver to regain credibility and popularity. "The polls indicate that public opinion is against the former president even while he tries to portray himself as a victim to see if he can generate some support. The Democratic Action Party National Directorate has just excluded him from the party, thereby announcing that his strategy will not work," Escovar noted. In Escovar's opinion, Perez is not anyone's victim, much less a victim of Escovar's alleged rage. "He is the victim of his own actions. He is only targeting himself for serious abuse when he attempts to personalize the matter by saying that this is a hateful conspiracy against him, not a legal action for embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. Relations With Colombia In response to insistent reports that certain Colombian sectors support an armed aggression against Venezuela because the new president will not fulfill Perez' exaggerated promises, especially those involving the Gulf, the interior minister affirmed that relations with the neighboring country "are excellent." Contrary to the popular opinion that Gaviria's visit was highly untimely (among other reasons, because he is about to leave office), Escovar said: "It was one of the best presidential visits I have seen because it was not an encounter of protocol, rhetoric, or pomp and circumstance; it was a working meeting." Escovar reiterated that the visit was significant: "Mainly because it stimulates a new climate of trust in the mutual affairs that demand our attention." In terms of the new climate of trust, the interior minister explained that some people in Colombia believed relations depended on Perez. Perez, he noted, did more harm than good to those relations. Why? Escovar responded: "Because no one in Venezuela trusted the way Perez managed relations between the two states and the two peoples. Now relations are better because no one doubts that the president will manage them skillfully and impartially." Nevertheless, we told Escovar that the Venezuelan media reported that the meeting with Gaviria concluded with the signing of a document of no importance. To this Escovar replied: "There is one point which refutes that. The joint declaration signed by the two presidents acknowledged the importance illegal aliens have for Venezuela. It recognizes that Venezuela is absolutely sovereign on deciding who can remain in Venezuela and who cannot." He added that the importance of cooperation between the two governments in the immigration problem was stressed. "This issue alone justifies the visit by President Gaviria and his team. By the way, there are some very brilliant, top-notch people on that team." We then mentioned Decree 1911, which allows the registration of children born to illegal aliens. Escovar Shalom commented: "This was a serious, disturbing problem. I have the authority to speak on this because I opposed the decree. I asked the Court to annul it, and I asked President Velasquez to repeal it, which he did." The interior minister mentioned the ambiguities of the decree. The decree granted more privileges to illegal aliens than to Venezuelans, who, without proper identification, cannot register their children with the vital statistics registrar. "It is not a matter of being against Colombians or anyone from another nation, it is against illegal aliens," he noted. Escovar was then asked if this irregularity was corrected by repealing the decree. The interior minister appeared somewhat surprised by the question. Although the legal amparo no longer exists, it is still possible that exceptions continue in some cases. He jots this down in a notebook and says that a memorandum will be sent on the matter, although he does not doubt that children continue to be illegally registered as Venezuelans through irregular procedures such as forging documents. "Is this one of this government's and the nation's biggest problems?" Escovar says he has a great interest in confronting this challenge efficiently but that he does not expect miracles. He refers to how from the beginning this government was able to reduce the number of people killed by firearms over the weekend. "When the Metropolitan Police relaxed, there was a rise in the number of deaths. That is now being corrected.... As interior minister, I have insisted that the police remain deployed on the streets. This means breaking the culture of police inertia and bureaucracy.... If the action is not consistent, the results won't last," the interior minister observed. But what about poverty and the forgotten neighborhoods where there is not even a training facility for young people? The interior minister replied: "The problem lies deeper and requires coordinated action in the needy neighborhoods with neighborhood associations and other organizations. We are already doing some of this, but not with the required intensity. There are still many setbacks in coordination. The problem goes far beyond what statistics and the formal appearances disclose. We must get to the bottom of the matter. True progress cannot be achieved without prevention and improvement in the social conditions and without counting on a new, more highly trained police force that is better equipped and has ethical values." He was then questioned on how the student bus fare issue was finally resolved. He recognized that the subsidy must be maintained but administered in another way. "It must not generate corruption or conflicts," he remarked. Caldera's Apparent Inertia Caldera appears to have fallen into inertia. Some say he seems to be playing a solitary game of chess. He is neither seen nor heard, despite what one would expect of him in a situation as difficult as the one the nation is experiencing. Escovar stated: "The president is attentive to the government. Just because he does not make many public appearances does not mean he is inactive. He is focused on his main obligation; that is, to govern..." The minister noted that besides, "his attitude contrasts with the verbal hemorrhage [hemorragia verbal] of previous years." The interior minister denied Antonio Ledezma's charges that now he combats the same hooded individuals he protected as prosecutor general. "I always fought them as prosecutor general. I have told the students this both privately and publicly. As interior minister, I have instructed the police throughout the nation to arrest hooded individuals. The law should be applied to those of legal age and the provisions in the Law on Protection of Minors to minors. Escovar noted that on several occasions he has spoken with students in his office. Their leaders have been asked to reject the presence of hooded individuals and violence in general. The students say these people are a minority without any roots, at least not in the university. They claim that they are small groups removed from the student body. At times they are joined by high school students. "This is the only time that students have come to this office to drink coffee and talk with the minister. I told them a few days ago they should have rejected the people shooting at the police cars just like the government rejected the police officer who killed the student from Fermin Toro school." Nevertheless, Escovar acknowledged that in the past, the pressure of student and other types of demonstrations had lessened. He believes that if the police have put away their weapons and adopted a tolerant attitude, the students should moderate their impulses and demonstrate in a civilized manner. Returning to hooded individuals, he again insisted that there is no contradiction between his policy as prosecutor general and his policy as minister. "The Presidency has regained its majesty with Dr. Rafael Caldera and that is noteworthy. Besides, only three months have gone by, and a government cannot be judged after 90 days, much less amid a crisis as traumatic as this one." Are changes in the works? Escovar replies that it is not his place to discuss that. He mentioned, however, a maneuver to generate friction among the ministers and a conspiracy among public office aspirants whose expectations were not fulfilled or who were not chosen for the positions they sought. "Their goal is to spread all sorts of rumors about the ministers." He recommends looking at this "conspiracy" from the viewpoint of the local culture, as part of the tropical folklore. He adds: "Now, the possibility of change always exists." Rumors (we tell the minister), which recently constituted a very popular and exploited tool, were always a recourse, a weapon of the population. Escovar notes: "Rumors and gossip are part of communication... Sometimes they are free information bulletins." Escovar added that the popular media have become more sophisticated. Rumors are not just spread orally, by idle talk, anymore. "Now there is the anonymous fax, a vicious tool being used to publicize all sorts of maneuvers and which does not require many people." Escovar relates how the so-called "Operation Centaur" was extensively publicized in this way. Those behind "Operation Centaur" claim that Escovar, Jose Vicente Rangel, Rafael Poleo, Radical Cause, and others plotted to destabilize bankers and businessmen to set up a communist regime in Venezuela. And what is the source of that campaign and those strange charges? "Rumors such as those circulated by `Operation Centaur' preceded the arrest warrant against Perez. It is obvious that there are certain interests and persons who dislike my being interior minister." That Cancer Called the Sectorial General Directorate of Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex] Escovar said that as for the Diex, strict measures are being taken. "We need to clean house, to begin and conclude a clean operation." With this goal in mind, he has given specific and categorical instructions to the new Diex directors. The operation has begun with immigration officials and includes an investigation to determine the origins of several falsifications and the forgery of documents used to legalize visas, residence permits, and other transactions. "The Diex, as it currently operates, does not defend Venezuela's national sovereignty." Escovar adds: "I am willing to take action against all those people." He explains that it is not an easy task, but it will be undertaken, even if most of the staff has to be changed." [no opening quotation marks as published] Presidential Aspirations Ramon Escovar Salom, who has been minister four times (twice under Carlos Andres Perez himself) and former ambassador to France, was constantly mentioned as a presidential hopeful while he was prosecutor general. "When some groups offered to promote my candidacy, I understood that the time was not right. I did not agree to run for first senator of the Federal District, either, and decided to remain as prosecutor general." He recalls that many insisted he was doomed to fail when he became prosecutor general. His opponents now make similar or worse predictions, perhaps because people know he acts independently and fear he will unveil a few crimes. Let me remind you of the failure of many other interior ministers. Right now, one of them is in prison with Carlos Andres Perez. "But I am not the executor of other people's failures... Those who are dying to see me fail as interior minister will be disappointed. This applies to those I call the authors of the bogeyman." Does that mean you are not afraid that the position will wear you out? "Before they claimed I was preparing my presidential campaign, now they say I am burying it because I accepted this ministry." What do you think? "Conjectures do not always match the facts. The well-worn expression neither one nor the other but quite the opposite comes to mind." He recalled that in addition to the offers to run for president or senator, he was offered the post of international prosecutor (the equivalent of UN under secretary general, with a $14,000 salary) to try Yugoslavian war criminals. "It was not like I did not have anything better to do, but I believed my duty was to stay here and accept President Caldera's offer. What is your goal? "That is unpredictable. Just remember how Christopher Columbus sailed for the East and ended up reaching the West." But is that the way to reach the presidency? "It is not necessarily a way, but it is not an obstacle, either."
