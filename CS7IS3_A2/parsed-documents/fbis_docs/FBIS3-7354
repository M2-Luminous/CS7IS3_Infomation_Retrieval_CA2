In the meantime, an overseas-based P-3 anti-submarine plane flown to the sky above the east coastal waters of South Korea carried out a sea reconnaissance and an exercise of strike at submarines by mines, torpedoes and depth bombs, escorted by formations of pursuit planes. On the 25th, the U.S. imperialists deployed Okinawa-based formations of F-15s in the Osan Air Force Base, South Korea. On the 24th, they brought F-18a pursuit-assault planes to the Kunsan Air Force Base, South Korea, from the Yokosuka Base of Japan. The U.S. imperialists on March 25 staged an exercise of surprise bombing strikes at ground targets and an aerial attack exercise in the skies above Tokjok islet, Pyongchang and Tanyang areas of South Korea in coordination with war planes flown from overseas bases and those belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea and the puppet air force. The South Korean puppets on March 24 and 25 drove dozens of armoured cars and heavily armed puppet army troops in a war gamble in the areas of Kimpo and Paju Counties, and Cholwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province. On the 25th, they sent 20 odd fighter planes of the puppet army to the sky above the areas of Paju and Ryonchon, and Cholwon and Rinje of South Korean Kangwon Province, which are adjacent to the demilitarized zone and staged exercises of missile strike at ground targets and airlifting operation. Such war exercises staged at a time when the aggression forces of the U.S. Pacific Fleet are moving toward waters close to the Korean peninsula and the U.S. forces in Japan are ready for action in "an event of contingency" prove that the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets against the northern half of the country are entering into a more grave stage.
