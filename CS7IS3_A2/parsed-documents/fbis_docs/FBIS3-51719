Will cost reduction be merely an illusion? [Cavallo] Productive sectors must be patient. We managed to get the Fiscal Pact signed and every province will now begin to provide benefits to a growing number of industries. Within a few months -- in all provinces -- the effect of reduced taxes and contributions will fully reach agricultural, manufacturing, mining, fishing, and construction industries. We hope tourism will also be included, as will passenger and cargo transportation. [LA NACION] The official estimate foresees an annual reduction in costs of 4 billion pesos. But when? [Cavallo] We hope that by the middle of this year all sectors throughout the nation will fully enjoy tax and social security benefits. [LA NACION] Why do the provinces object to transferring their pension fund to the nation? [Cavallo] Because there are strong interests around each fund. Some want the privileged provincial retirement system to continue. Some funds allow retirement at 45 on very high pensions. [LA NACION] Which provinces are they? [Cavallo] Almost all. The provinces also have a very large social security deficit. This averages at about 150 million pesos per month. [LA NACION] What will you do to stop unemployment from growing? [Cavallo] We have the intensive work program. The Ministries of Labor, Education, and Economy are carrying out training programs for our youth. This program will be intensified. [LA NACION] Is unemployment the weak part of the plan? [Cavallo] No, this plan is creating more jobs than what the Argentine economy has created. During the six years of Raul Alfonsin's administration 700,000 jobs were created while during the four years of President Menem's government 1 million jobs were created. What happened is like that which occurred in Mexico and in Chile: A greater participation of women in the labor demand. [LA NACION] Will the social works system be deregulated? [Cavallo] We will work with the ANSSAL [National Health Insurance Administration], the Labor Ministry, the CGT [General Confederation of Labor], and the unions on various fronts. First we must reorganize social works to improve services. Some union social works are very good but they can still be improved. Others, however, are lost causes and should be absorbed in an orderly process by the well managed social works. The government is willing to pay off what it owes the social works as a result of its intervention if the unions accept the reorganization we propose. Around the middle of this year we will also have a good computer system installed at the pension fund administration boards which will also help to put the social works in order. Only then we can talk about a deregulation program. [LA NACION] Will measures be implemented to encourage merges and takeovers? [Cavallo] Something like this is being done by the ANSSAL but I believe -- and this view is shared by the other ministers -- that we must intensify this task. This must be done through dialogue with the union leaders; we are waiting for the appropriate time to begin. [LA NACION] What is the estimated trade deficit for this year? [Cavallo] I do not know if it is wise to estimate. It makes sense to project a GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent or an inflation of under 5 percent, but not to estimate the deficit of the trade balance because this depends on the volume of capital. I do not have a target for this. I believe it depends on the will to invest. [LA NACION] Does it not worry you that in the last few months the deficit is above all projections, including the projections of the economic team? [Cavallo] No, because there was no target. Figures were prepared at the request of the IMF. The important thing is to have growing exports. Last year's growth was 7 percent and this year it will probably grow to between 10 and 12 percent. A repeat of what happened under the Austral plan must be prevented, when exports fell because there was greater consumption and also in some way what happened to investments within the context of relative prices and the organization of the economy which completely discouraged investment. What is happening with exports is very interesting: The exports that are increasing most are those with greater added value. This shows that an industrial reorganization is taking place in Argentina. Products are being produced directly to be sold abroad. [LA NACION] Is this not happening because there is no room on the domestic market: Some say consumption has reached saturation point or is even declining? [Cavallo] No. Consumption continued to grow last year at 4 to 5 percent, which is quite high. Of course, it is very good that consumption grew less than the GDP because this means domestic savings increased. Very few countries in the world increase their consumption at 3 percent or more per year. [LA NACION] Nevertheless, it seems that consumption has been concentrated in a small segment of society while the great majority are unable to fulfill their basic requirements. [Cavallo] Consumption level and growth rate are very different concepts. Some families still have a very low consumption because we inherited a country in which for decades there has been both stagnation and a constant worsening in the distribution of income. I admit that there still are segments of the population that have low levels of consumption but, overall, everyone is consuming more. [LA NACION] Does the Menem-[Cordoba Governor] Angeloz pact and the single voting ticket in Cordoba affect you? [Cavallo] On the contrary, I am an economist; a single ticket enables us to save resources and efforts. [LA NACION] Will you be a candidate for the Constituent Assembly? [Cavallo] If there had not been a single list I would have considered it. In that case the Justicialist Party [PJ] should join a common front with the UCeDe [Democratic Center Union]. But with a single ticket, it would be senseless. [LA NACION] With a single ticket, how can you criticize Angeloz during the campaign? [Cavallo] I do not generally criticize Angeloz. I appreciate him but I think Cordoba should speed up its economic transformation, especially since it has a governor who, as a candidate, has said he will continue everything Menem is doing now. As a Cordoba citizen I regret many things. I wonder why those in Cordoba pay much more for electricity than those in Buenos Aires; why do judges establish much higher fees for lawyers and experts than in the Federal Capital; and why are there still regulations on industry and commerce? [LA NACION] Would you accompany Menem on the 1995 ticket? [Cavallo] I have never considered it. I think the natural ticket would be Menem-Duhalde but, if Duhalde wants to remain as the governor of Buenos Aires Province, there are other top leaders who could occupy that post; Ruben Marin, Ramon Ortega, or Carlos Reutemann. [LA NACION] If you ever become president, who would be your economy minister? [Cavallo] I do not like hypothetical cases, but any of my secretaries or even under secretaries could be minister. There are also very good economists in the UCR. When the most important reforms had to be implemented, courage was as necessary as technical capacity and a good team. Some people say I am a fighter and that I sometimes shout, but I understand that someone with my personality was necessary. [LA NACION] Following the case of Aluar [Argentine Aluminum Industrial and Commercial Corporation], are you not afraid of more cases of salary cuts in companies with problems? [Cavallo] Salary cuts will probably be applied where salaries have been increased beyond productivity. I hope higher salaries will be cut first. I imagine Aluar first reduced the salaries of its high ranking executives. Companies must realistically face cuts in their costs. If salaries are higher than productivity in some sectors it is better to cut salaries than to stop production. [LA NACION] Do you not think the salaries of many workers are low? [Cavallo] Those salaries that are below the productivity level will continue to increase. Our statistics year after year reflect a sustained increase in real salaries. [LA NACION] Many people would not agree. [Cavallo] I think that the popular consumption level will increase because very few people earn less than 400 or 500 pesos per month. A few years ago many people did not even earn 200 pesos. In the Federal Capital even domestic employees earn 600 or 700 pesos.
