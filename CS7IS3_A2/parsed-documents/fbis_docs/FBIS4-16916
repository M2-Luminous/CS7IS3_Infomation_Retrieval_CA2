Speaking at today's briefing he also mentioned that Azerbaijan's signing the Russian-sponsored agreement will bring to profits for all the sides: Armenia will be deblockaded, Nagorno-Karabakh will get all the security guarantees, Azerbaijan will get the territories. Zurabyan also mentioned that the participants of the Moscow summit will supply Russia with the CIS mandate to realize its peacekeeping initiatives in Karabakh. Answering the SNARK's question on Karabakh participation in signing the agreement, Levon Zurabyan said if Azerbaijan expresses its readiness to sign the agreement the Karabakh representatives' participation will be ensured.
