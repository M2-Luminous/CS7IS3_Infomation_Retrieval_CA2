"Both ruling and opposition parties must consider how they will act after parliamentary debate on the state budget (for fiscal 1994) ends," Ozawa, secretary general of shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], said in a speech. The withdrawal in late April of the SDP, the largest component in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years. The SDP walked out of the coalition following the abrupt formation of a new parliamentary group by other coalition partners excluding the SDP. The SDP has demanded that the Hata cabinet voluntarily resign en masse after passage of the budget through the Diet. The overdue budget is expected to clear the Diet in mid-June. The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet. If the SDP supports the motion, Hata has to disband his cabinet or dissolve the House of Representatives. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo predicted Saturday the Hata cabinet will resign en masse if such a motion against his cabinet is approved. "If a no-confidence motion is approved, the Hata cabinet will have no other choice but to resign en masse," Kubo told reporters in Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan.
