Security Council [UNSC] have discussed adopting a statement encouraging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections before sanctions are imposed against the communist country. Department spokesman Mike McCurry made the admission when pressed to comment on reports that adoption of a statement urging Pyongyang again to permit outside nuclear inspections has been discussed by the council's permanent members. McCurry did not elaborate on whether the Security Council was moving to adopt the statement before the nuclear issue is referred to it or after. Asked about the possible form of sanctions, McCurry said there has been no specific discussion since the issue has yet to be brought up formally. He said there were only informal meetings among UNSC permanent members to review the present situation and work out an agreement on the best possible means of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. As to speculation that China might exercise its veto power when the Security Council considers sanctions against North Korea, McCurry said Beijing has not revealed its official position on sanctions.
