Landsbergis, leader of the right-wing opposition, held a press conference at the Seimas [parliament] yesterday. He spoke not about politics but about economic and financial issues which, in his opinion, were almost forgotten by journalists who became fascinated with the recent sensations. The speaker commented on two new laws adopted by the Seimas -- on the litas' viability and land which were "accompanied" by statements from the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives). According to the professor, the news that international organizations and banks are suspending credits for Lithuania could mean that "the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] has run into a deadlock." Thus, the perspective, certainly, if it is not changed by some political decisions, looks quite somber: Being deprived of Western credits, the LDDP may resolve to borrow from Moscow. Incidentally, "Russia has indirectly sucked in the large part of all loans received by Lithuania until now, because credits have been extended for enterprises which produce goods for the Russian market and sell them at lower prices." This way, Russia has received additional assistance from the West through Lithuania. "Later on, Russia will probably buy Lithuania for Western credits." Since the litas' exchange rate will be determined by the government from now on, the gate for corruption will become even wider. The conservatives' statement reads that "seeing the corrupt goals of the LDDP government, such a monetary policy when LDDP leaders will be able to agree on the litas' exchange rate in advance will develop into hard currency speculations among a "group of comrades" by profiting from other businessmen and bankers who are not "comrades" and who will have no access to the party money market or will have to yield to the monopoly of LDDP banks despite their wishes." V. Landsbergis specified that the "litas exchange rate will be set by lobbyists who have access to the president." He also reported that the opposition was planning to appeal the law on land to the Constitutional Court. It would even request to review this issue as a priority (certainly, after the president's decision). Asked whether the Homeland Union would support the nationalists' proposal to hold elections to the Seimas and self-governments in fall, V. Landsbergis replied: "Homeland Union's definite position is that the Seimas elections should be held simultaneously with the elections to self-governments. There may be different ways to achieve this. Thus far, preparations for a possible referendum have been under way." He also added that in a normal democratic state, such a bankrupt government as the Lithuanian one would itself express the desire for early elections and announce them. Asked about his expectations concerning the meeting of the three presidents in Palanga, the professor replied that he wished A. Brazauskas would warn the Latvian and Estonian presidents against engaging in any discussions on occupation and annexation, which Russia wants to impose as an issue worthy of attention. "We have Russia's recognition and the condemnation of that annexation. The Lithuanian president has a good chance to remind his colleagues that they could follow Lithuania's agreement with Russia because the situation is absolutely identical," said V. Landsbergis.
