Unusual Thoughtlessness"] [Text] Kemerovo--The popular thesis about "shifting the center of gravity of the reforms to the localities" is erroneous--thinks the author of the article published below. Only the Government of the Russian Federation is capable of bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building regional complexes out of the crisis. And it must not take its hands off the wheel. The Monopoly is Immortal. Long Live the Monopoly! I must say that no document developed by the president's administration, signed, and, moreover, read by B. Yeltsin, has evoked such authentic interest among specialists as the first Message of the president of the Russian Federation to the Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening Russian Statehood." The document can be viewed in various ways. But there is no doubt about one thing: The Message clearly brought Ye. Gaydar's economic experiments to an end. In his message the president stated that "1994 must be the year of the formation of Russian financial-industrial groups. The government must make sure that they are created strictly on a voluntary basis and prevent the revival of old ministerial structures, illegal appropriation of state property, and unjustified monopolism." The creation of corporations has proved to be viable throughout the entire 20th century. But, as analysis shows, the potential capabilities of financial-industrial groups (FPG) could remain unrealized if their creation turns into a regular campaign and they themselves are regarded as a panacea for all economic problems. Is the alarm justified? Unfortunately, yes. And here is a concrete confirmation of this. The administration of Kemerovo Oblast, based on the key points of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation No. 2096 of 5 December 1993 "On the Creation of Financial-Industrial Groups in the Russian Federation," began to work actively on forming the financial-industrial group Kuzbass Company. According to the intention of the authors of its concept, it "is being created for fuller utilization of scientific-technical and production potential of the Kemerovo production-territorial complex." As you can see, in Kuzbass they are trying to rely on the edict to create not an interbranch structure but a regional one which would function like the old Sovnarkhoz [Soviet of the National Economy]. But, God help them, with "local" problems. Here, as analysis shows, we are speaking about something altogether different: the creation of a real monopolistic monster which could cause serious harm both to the region and to Russia as a whole. The administration intends to solve the oblast's economic problems, among other things, "through cartel agreements of participants in the financial-industrial group...." It is in this connection that I fully share the viewpoint of Ye. Salnikova, deputy chief of the Main Administration for the Development of Competition of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures: "The most dangerous thing for market relations are agreements in the form of financial-industrial groups among competitors--enterprises operating on the market for the same commodity." How does one avoid this? We Can Save Ourselves Only Together, in the Same Boat Speaking at a conference of leaders of coal enterprises and associations of the Kuzbass, oblast Governor M. Kislyuk said that: "We need financial-production groups, since it has long been clear that rescuing the drowning is the problem of the drowning themselves. No Moscow and no ministry will help us." With all due respect to the governor, I think Kislyuk's statement is profoundly erroneous and very rash. What is the most alarming thing? The key circumstance for the Kuzbass is that saving the oblast economy is far from an oblast problem since we cannot overcome our adversities within the framework of the Kuzbass alone. Why? Because these problems are too great and the price of solving them is very high...let us think about it. If we tried to rely only on our own investment resources and organizational efforts, we would not be able to complete the structural rearrangement of the oblast national economy or perhaps even just the fuel complex by the end of the 21st century. The essence of the problem, in my opinion, is this. According to figures from oblast statistics, by 1 July 1992 the fixed capital of the oblast national economy (before it was reappraised) was estimated at 49.1 billion rubles [R] in 1984 prices. Of this amount, R39.3 billion was in fixed production capital. So if we set for ourselves just a partial task and began structural rearrangement only of the sphere of material production and the production infrastructure, we would have to invest, depending on the branch, R3.5 and sometimes even R10 in capital investments for each ruble of fixed production capital. Our calculations show that just high-quality transformation of worn-out fixed production capital will take from R25.0 billion to R41.0 billion in capital investments in 1984 prices. As for agriculture, which produces approximately 38 percent of the social norm of grain, it could collapse completely if financial aid is not rendered to it from the federal budget. So are we at an impasse? The problem, it seems, can be resolved only on the basis of combined efforts: federal, interregional, intraregional, branch, and production. For no matter what anyone says, the Kuzbass with all of its factors is only a particle of immense Russia. Its key branch--coal--will be subsidized from the federal budget in the future as well. Therefore there will be no "economic gallop." We will be forced to pass through such stages as: stabilization, which will occupy the years 1994-1996; restoration; structural, and, finally, market. Conducting the basic economic reforms will probably take from 25 to 30 years. And this is in the best case, with a satisfactory solution to the most difficult economic problems and mandatory provision of the necessary investment resources. But in all probability the emergence of the Kuzbass from its structural and ecological crisis will last up until the middle of the 21st century. Here a great deal can be resolved through a well-considered and weighed regional economic policy, strategy, and selected priorities. We will probably not be able to reach the key indicators of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe until the end of the 21st century. The historic disparity is too great. What Can the Oblast Administration Do? And so the problems are legion. Who should work on them? Within the framework of the oblast, who is responsible for leading the process of economic reform? The answer to this is simple: Of course, it is the oblast administration. But, as the situation shows, its economic role is decreasing and in all probability it will decrease even more. The reason for this phenomenon is fairly commonplace. Everyone who is very familiar with modern history recalls that before 1929 in the United States the majority of economic functions were under the jurisdiction of the states. But the crisis of 1929-1932 demonstrated the inability of the states and local authorities to handle socioeconomic problems alone, which brought about strengthening of federal power within the framework of F. Roosevelt's "New Deal." Therefore, drawing historical analogies, I can say with a fair amount of certainty that the thesis: "The center of gravity of the reforms must shift to the regions," if speaking about branches of specialization, will not stand up even under the slightest criticism since one can see nothing here but good intentions and wishes. In this case I have in mind investment resources. It is in this connection that the federal government, relying on the region's administration, must take over the main functions for bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical, machine building, and other regional complexes out of the crisis and also provide a federal production infrastructure. And agriculture should be under the direct jurisdiction of local administrations; this pertains to the intraregional production and social infrastructure. After a couple of years when the administration begins to be restored and return to its initial condition, when its quantitative and qualitative growth begins, when normal tax mechanisms are created--then, I agree, it will be possible to begin a stage-by-stage increase in the role of regional administrations in solving economic problems. At the same time this would be based on interaction between federal and regional legislation. But today.... In my view, it is necessary, in the first place, to develop a full-scale "general plan for management of the oblast national economy," which is capable of functioning in a market environment; second, to create as a part of the oblast administration a "Committee on Coordination of Economic Activity and Organization of Cooperative-Economic Ties in the National Economy of Kemerovo Oblast." In general I think that the oblast administration, while not a market subject, can do a great deal for its reliable functioning--through the creation and priority support of corporations (financial-production groups), associations, and private and joint enterprises.
