He announced this during a short conversation with journalists at the Kremlin Wall, after the laying of wreaths at the grave of Yuriy Gagarin. The Russian president said that: Nixon has met Rutskoy and Zyuganov, but the interesting thing is that he came here to meet me. After that, Yeltsin noted: I will not meet Nixon, the government will not receive him, and Filatov [Yeltsin's chief of staff] will not receive him. It should be realized that Russia is a great country. It simply cannot be played around with like that, the president said, noting: I am impressed by the position taken by Bill Clinton, because he phoned me and distanced himself from Richard Nixon's trip." Referring to Russian-U.S. relations, Yeltsin said that the two countries' foreign ministers were due to meet in Vladivostok shortly. He stated that: The U.S.-Russian partnership must be preserved and developed. The president noted that Russian-U.S. partnership: Is a great achievement that we worked very hard for, and we must not lose it. Moreover, I am convinced that we will not lose it, Yeltsin stressed. Asked by the journalists about the Ames scandal in the United States, Yeltsin said: I would not like to draw any dramatic conclusions from this. He expressed hope that it should not and will not affect Russian-U.S. relations. Yeltsin believes that one should not get upset about the fact that both countries are conducting intelligence work.
