FR941216-1-00010 FR941216-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;170&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require installation of new case drain pipes and an additional fairlead support for the hydraulics case drain line in the rear spar area of the engine/nacelle. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue failure of the case drain line in the hydraulics system. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of main system hydraulics as a result of lack of support against vibration and subsequent fatigue failure of the case drain line for the hydraulics system. DATES: Comments must be received by January 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;170&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
