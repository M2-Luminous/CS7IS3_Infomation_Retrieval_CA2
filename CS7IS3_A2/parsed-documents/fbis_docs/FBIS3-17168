Pro Patria will be represented at the talks by the party Chairman Mart Laar, General Secretary Ivo Rull, deputy head of the parliament faction, Kalle Jurgenson, and MP Vootele Hansen. The delegation of Rural Centrists will include party Chairman Ivar Raig, chairman of the party's Central Council, Vambo Kaal, Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar and Minister of Reform Liia Hanni. MP Vootele Hansen in a brief interview with BNS said the meeting was to discuss finding finances to credit the farm sector, as well as drawing up legislation for regulation of the market. "Of course, we don't consider it possible to give up free market principles," he said. Rural Centrist Party's Vambo Kaal, in turn, said his party hoped to resolve issues such as protecting of the domestic market, financing and taxation of the rural economy, privatization, problems of cooperation within the coalition. "If we fail to succeed in resolving the problems by mutual compromise, we cannot continue our activity as part of the coalition," Kaal said. Pro Patria this week is also to begin talks with the Social Democrats, the other party beside Rural Centrists in the ruling coalition's Moderate bloc. Mart Laar, Ivo Rull, as well as Pro Patria parliament faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar and Defense Minister Indrek Kannik are to sit down at the negotiating table opposite a delegation of the Social Democrats led by the leader of the party, Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin. Mihkel Parnoja, deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, has told BNS the key issue for his party at talks with the senior coalition partner is cooperation within the coalition until next the elections. He said cooperation within the coalition could be better, especially since over some issues coordination in the coalition tends to happen too late.
