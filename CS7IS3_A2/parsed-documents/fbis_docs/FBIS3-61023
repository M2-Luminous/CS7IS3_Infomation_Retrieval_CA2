Questions relating to problems of providing the necessary level of combat readiness and maintaining troop command and control were put by our correspondent to Colonel General Viktor Kopylov, commander, Siberian Military District. "Our training," said Viktor Andreyevich, "was before and remains as the rock-bottom requirement. This, in spite of the fact that today it must be organized under conditions of an enormous personnel shortage. The table of organization and equipment of units and large units is only now being finalized. Nevertheless, the district's authorities and the military council maintain their viewpoint, even in light of the difficulties, that our district, which is far removed from the "hot spots," was before and remains as the most favorable relative to organizing combat training. As far as the practical side of the problem is concerned, I can say that in those units in which there are personnel present and combat vehicle crews supplied, the people have been especially well-trained in accomplishing unexpected missions." [Veklich] Let us make that more definite. Let us assume that a motorized rifle regiment receives a combat alert signal. Are the regiment's subunits in a position to execute a timely departure from their permanent deployment garrisoning location with their combat materiel, accomplish a march of let us say 500 kilometers, and then perform the particular mission assigned? [Kopylov] As far as extreme conditions are concerned, we have found a way to maintain unit combat capability. We redeploy our personnel and equipment so as not to spread too thinly our woefully inadequate number of specialists. We reassign some specialists to make up for manpower deficits in subunits, so that the latter can assume a state of complete readiness to undertake any mission. Others are trained to man equipment, in the event of an irregular situation, to enable them to move combat vehicles out of motor pools before the reserve is mobilized. This approach has become associated with the need to devote greater attention to individual training of personnel. We have come to make more extensive use of fighting vehicle gunnery training facilities and simulators. [Veklich] But there is quite a number of units consisting of officers only. They sometimes must carry out not only their regular duties, but other duties as well, such as guard duty and servicing and repair of equipment. [Kopylov] The problem is indeed serious. The conduct of company or battalion tactical exercises in reduced-strength units produces poor results. Also, an officer who has not worked through problems of commander's training and fire control and who is lacking personnel to boot simply faces the threat of disqualification. With this kind of situation in mind, we in the district took the route of creating, on the basis of units, reduced-strength officer battalions and companies. This year's experience shows that our action has been justified. A young school graduate - a platoon leader - who lacks personnel due to no fault of ours can in the course of an integrated exercise hone his skills both in the role of a BMP [combat infantry vehicle] driver-mechanic or sniper, something which will undoubtedly be of use to him, and in subunit command and control and combat organization. And so it goes up the chain of command, to regimental commander. Although we have employed the above procedure as an experiment, in the new training year integrated training of officers lacking personnel under their command will become a part of routine combat training. [Veklich] The Siberian Military District recently participated in the operational-strategic command and staff exercise "Center." What goals were achieved? [Kopylov] The district was generally rated highly. We carried out a number of actions on an experimental basis. We drew up proposals based on them for submission to the General Staff. This included problems that surfaced. For example, uncovered in the course of the exercise was a drop in readiness of motor vehicles, which in the event of an actual combat situation would be supplied to district units. I see the cause as lying in an attitude deterioration in the management of motor vehicle organizations and of other enterprises that have shifted to the market economy for the accomplishment of state tasks. Also, the motor vehicle fleet is aging due to a lack of replacement parts. It can become completely inoperative. Also leaving something to be desired is the professional training possessed by a certain number of drivers working for the enterprises. In a word, "Center" made it possible to evaluate the district's actual capabilities and set goals to work toward, once again based on our capabilities in an environment of personnel shortages. [Veklich] Viktor Andreyevich, it is a fact that special importance is being attached to troop command and control. What are the prospects for providing the district's command and control elements with modern automation and communication equipment? [Kopylov] We have devised a plan for improving command and control facilities; its implementation has already produced tangible results. For example, the PVO [air defense] command and control facility has been completely automated. We have a display system there, and have set up direct communication with the PVO strany [country] command and control facility. Thus, we were able to reduce district PVO command and control and reorganize the cooperation process. By examining the problems of air defense, we see solutions in a unified PVO strany system. A major role should undoubtedly be played by large units of the PVO Voysk [troops] of Russia located in the district's territory. We enjoy good communication with them. We also plan to undertake certain measures related to reorganizing and improving a number of other fixed and field command and control facilities. [Veklich] How have those persons who are on duty on the basis of contract service contributed toward the maintenance of combat readiness? [Kopylov] Presently in the district there are about 3,000 servicemen of that kind. The contract arrangement has enabled us to effect a considerable correction in shortages of all categories of drivers. Vehicles are now being operated by professionals, with the result that the number of district motor vehicle accidents has been halved this year. Presently serving in a number of military collectives are entire subunits consisting of "pros." Even this rather limited experiment shows that maximum benefit is derived from service by contractors when they are brought together into a company or battalion. This makes it possible to provide them with more intensive training. However, I think that there is as yet no firm economic backing to bind the contract serviceman to the Armed Forces. In my opinion, if a person who has signed a contract to serve for three years wishes to receive a discharge after one year, he should be made to pay a penalty. [Veklich] Viktor Andreyevich, now for the last question. Is it possible that Siberian soldiers may find themselves facing the present obviously difficult Siberian winter without heat in the barracks, while officers' families may not have a roof over their heads? [Kopylov] I take pleasure in saying that this year commanders of the district's KEU [billing directorate] headed by Colonel Grigoriy Kuyan and rear services officers have done much to prepare all personnel comfort systems for the long Siberian winter. All the district's boiler rooms are in working condition, with reserve boilers installed. There is a six-month supply of fuel. However, it is true that personnel difficulties exist. We are losing qualified rear services specialists to places paying half again to twice as much. That is why this winter we must continue to resort to assigning conscripts to servicing of boiler rooms. Concerning having a roof over one's head, I wish to point out that we do not have a single case of an officer assigned to a withdrawal unit living out in the open. Thus, we made 40 apartments available to recently arrived aviators. They will be assigned another several dozen apartments in the near future. That is to say, we act like good hosts to people coming to us from beyond the border, even though the number of our people in need of an apartment exceeds 3,000. I think that we would be able to resolve the housing problem if there were no difficulties with financing.
