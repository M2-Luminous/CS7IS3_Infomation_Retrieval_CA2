FR940810-2-00104 FR940810-2-00070 1. If a customer assures delivery, the member or associated person must annotate that conversation noting the present location of the securities; whether the securities are in good deliverable form; and whether they will be delivered to the firm within time for settlement; or 2. If the member or associated person locates the stock, an annotation must be made that identifies the individual and firm contacted who offered assurance that the shares would be delivered or were available for borrowing by settlement date; and the number of shares needed to cover the short sale. The manner by which a member or person associated with a member annotates compliance with the ``affirmative determination'' requirement contained in subsection (b)(2) above (e.g., marking the order ticket, recording inquiries in a log, etc.) is not specified by this Interpretation and, therefore, shall be decided by each member. However, an affirmative determination and annotation of that affirmative determination must be made for each and every transaction since a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing is not acceptable to satisfy the affirmative determination requirement. 2 2 Pursuant to Rule 440C, The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') also requires NYSE members to make affirmative determinations prior to effecting short sales and to annotate such determinations. NYSE Information Memo 91&hyph;41 (October 18, 1991). The NASD believes that requiring such annotations will enhance member compliance with affirmative determination requirements already imposed by the Interpretation and will enable the NASD to examine member compliance with the requirements more effectively. Requiring firms to annotate each and every affirmative determination also will make clear the NASD's longstanding policy that firms cannot rely on daily facsimile sheets of ``borrowable stocks'' to satisfy their affirmative determination requirements under the Interpretation. The annotation requirement will preclude this practice as members or their associated persons will have to annotate the name of the person contacted and number of shares for each short sale. Requiring annotation of affirmative determinations will also enhance the NASD's ability to examine for compliance with various other NASD short sale rules including those found in Article III, Section 21 of the Rules of Fair Practice (record keeping) and in the Uniform Practice Code, Section 71 (mandatory delivery requirements for certain restricted securities). Further, the annotation requirement will assist in examining for compliance with the short sale rule or ``bid test,'' recently approved by the SEC. 3 Accordingly, the NASD is proposing to amend the Interpretation to require that members or their associated persons maintain a written record evidencing their compliance with the affirmative determination requirement for each customer or proprietary short sale. 3 Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 34277 (June 29, 1994). The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal will enable the NASD to more effectively enforce an already existing provision of the Prompt Receipt and Delivery Interpretation requiring members or their associated persons to affirmatively determine that shares relating to a short sale are available for delivery to a purchaser. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will: A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
