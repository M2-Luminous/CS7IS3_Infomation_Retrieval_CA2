However, he also called for vigilance. "While going ahead with arms reduction, we will be seeking military parity both with the United States and NATO", Yeltsin said. Yeltsin pointed to the significance of new forms of military cooperation such as joint exercises adding that "we will hold them in an effort to beef up the spirit of friendly cooperation". Yeltsin also pointed to the strategic partnership of the allied nations during the Second World War. However, he stressed that Russia must be treated as an equal because any other attitude was unacceptable. For his part, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that Russia was not opposed to joining the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace plan. "We are not the weaker side in negotiations and have no inferiority complex on that score", he said. "In my view, Kozyrev went on to say, it is desirable that attempts must be made to approve a wider concept of Russian-NATO cooperation rather than a framework agreement." However, the minister declined to say when exactly Moscow intended to sign such a paper. In an earlier interview with Interfax, Kozyrev said that Russia wanted a more serious program of partnership with NATO to meet the country's status and specifics. However, he denied that such a program would be an alternative to the Partnership. Russia will formulate its position on Partnership later this month, Defence Minister Grachev told Interfax. Grachev is expected to outline it at NATO's headquarters in Brussels on May 24 following Yeltsin's approval of the Russian formula. The minister said Russia disagreed with parts of the Partnership plan. At an earlier news conference in Moscow, Grachev said his ministry had decided to come up with a European security plan as an alternative to Partnership. He said Russian experts were given until May 15 to work out an appropriate document. The minister made it clear he had discussed the idea with Yeltsin himself.
