Another single item that strongly affects the bottom line of the Credit Guaranty Agency is the annual payment pertaining to the settlement of Wartsila Meriteollisuus. The export recovery increased the demand for the agency's services by more than 25 percent. The agency's total guaranty commitment for last year was FMk53 billion, of which the export guaranties' share was 86 percent. The objective of the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency has been defined as the promotion of exports and strengthening the operating conditions of small and medium-size industry. The tools available to the agency to further these goals are export guaranties and state guaranties, which can be granted to businesses and financiers. Credit Guaranty Payments -- 145 Million Compensation received from state guaranties and export guaranties amounted to FMk145 million. Based on these, the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency paid FMk206 million in compensation. This was FMk72 million less than in 1992. The guaranties issued for trade with the former USSR resulted in compensation payments of FMk536 million. On the other hand, last year the compensation transfers involving Wartsila Meriteollisuus showed in the books of the Credit Guaranty Agency as a revenue of FMk65 million, which was unusual. The outstanding amounts have been factored, and during the legal proceedings, part of the compensation paid was returned. This spring the Credit Guaranty Agency will close its books on an accrual basis, and the outstanding debts will be estimated in the same manner as insurance companies do when they close their books. This is expected to provide a clearer picture of the agency's cash flow than the currently used cash-based accounting system. 3 Billion Total Liabilities At the beginning of last year, the total liability for trade with the USSR was less than FMk3 billion, which had accrued during the 1980's as a result of long-term financing. The Credit Guaranty Agency submits payments for interest and principal to the banks as they become due . The loans will later be collected from Russia, in a manner which will be determined by the international conference of creditors or the so-called Paris Club. The Paris Club is planning to extend long-term credit and low interest rates for trade with the East. Due to the fact that the procedures for collecting these debts have still not been set in place, it has not been possible to carry them forward. According to Matti Vuoria, section head and chair of the board of directors for the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency, there is also great demand for new guaranties for trade with Russia, "but the decisions must wait until the creditor countries have made their final decision regarding debt consolidation." According to CEO Ilkka Niemi, the Credit Guaranty Agency's opportunities to conduct business are not dependent upon the methods of collecting outstanding debts, which are accrued from trade with the East. At the beginning of the current year, the book risk ceiling of export guaranties was increased to FMk45 billion. According to Niemi, this allows for FMk70 billion in trade guaranties. Also, according to Niemi, disregarding the credits issued for the trade with the former USSR and the commitments to Wartsila Meriteollisuus' incidental traffic, the profits generated by the Credit Guaranty Agency are on a good international level. Balancing the approximately FMk200 million in other compensation are FMk145 million of guaranty payments. During the year, the metal industry has greatly increased its share of export guaranties, and its share of all guaranties is now 65 percent. The strongest growth for export guaranties was to the Far East, where China is rapidly becoming the largest target for export guaranties. Slight Decrease in Estonia's Risk Level So far, guaranties have not been issued to Baltic states, which were formerly part of the USSR. However, the agency's board of directors decided last Thursday [10 February] to adjust Estonia's risk rating to the extent that short-term letters of credit could be guaranteed. According to Ilkka Niemi, small and medium-size businesses are beginning to learn how to utilize various forms of state guaranties. Starting last July, the Credit Guaranty Agency began issuing special debt consolidation credits to businesses that are in debt but considered viable. The agency has received consolidation applications valued at FMk1.3 billion in credits. Banks Eager To Transfer Risk Banks have shown an eagerness to transfer risks for individual companies to the Credit Guaranty Agency. In connection with debt consolidation guaranties, the commercial bank maintains half of the risk, and counterguaranties are divided the same way. Last year, small and medium-size businesses received financing guaranties that amounted to a total of FMk917 million.
