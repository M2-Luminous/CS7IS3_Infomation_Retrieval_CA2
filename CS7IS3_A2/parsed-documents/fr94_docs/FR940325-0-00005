FR940325-0-00005 FR940325-0-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Parts 20, 21, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 72, and 73 RIN 3150&hyph;AE84 NRC Operations Center Commercial Telephone Number Change AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect a change in the NRC Operations Center commercial telephone and facsimile number. These amendments are necessary to inform the public of these administrative changes to the NRC's regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 31, 1994, 12 noon EDT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jean Trefethen, Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington DC 20555, Telephone (301) 492&hyph;8985. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In June 1994, the NRC is scheduled to move its Operations Center from the Maryland National Bank Building in Bethesda, Maryland, to the Two White Flint North Building in Rockville, Maryland. When this move occurs, it will be necessary to use new telephone and facsimile numbers to reach the NRC Operations Center. For a minimum of 90 days following the move, calls made to the old telephone number will automatically transfer to the new Operations Center. NRC licensees shall revise their procedures and any other affected documentation to show the proper telephone and facsimile numbers for the NRC Operations Center. This notice is being published to inform the public and NRC licensees of the commercial telephone and facsimile number changes. Because this amendment deals with agency procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective 12 noon EDT May 31, 1994. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Regulatory Analysis A regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared for this amendment because it is an administrative action that merely changes the telephone and facsimile numbers that are currently being used by licensees under the existing regulations. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule because this rule does not involve any provisions which would impose a backfit as defined in ยง50.109(a)(1). Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for this rule.
