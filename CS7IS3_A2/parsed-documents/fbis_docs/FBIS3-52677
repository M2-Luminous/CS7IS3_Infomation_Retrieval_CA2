FBIS3-52677 "drnes004__a94017" FBIS-NES-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Afghanistan `Afghan Arabs' Reportedly Train Tajiks 94AE0044A Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic 19 Nov 93 pp 28-31--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94AE0044A Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI Language: Arabic Article Type:CSO [Article by Jad Salim] [Text] Kabul--A lot has been said and written about the `Afghan Arabs,' those people who had come from numerous Arab countries to fight the communists alongside the Afghan mujahedin. Since then, these people's native countries have been calling them the `Afghans' and have been afraid of them because these Arabs are well-trained in combat by U.S. intelligence. When Afghanistan's jihad [struggle] against communism ended, numerous `Afghan Arabs' departed Afghanistan's mountains, some returning to their native countries where they joined armed radical fundamentalism and carried out some military operations, motivating local authorities to pursue them as dangerous terrorists. The others returned to Peshawar, Pakistan, which was asked to deport them as soon as possible. Some people say that Islamabad has met the demand and deported the `Afghan Arabs' to Sudan and Iran. Others say that Pakistan pushed them out the door only to open a window for them to return and that they come and go as they wish in Peshawar. What is certain is that a large number of these `Afghan Arabs' continue to use this city as their center, moving easily between Peshawar, which is close to Afghanistan's northern border, and northern Afghanistan. According to Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, military commander of the Jami'yat-e Eslami Party which controls power in Kabul, there are nearly 70-80 `Afghan Arabs' who continue to fight in southern Kabul side by side with his rival Golboddin Hekmatyar, the Hezb-e Eslami Party chairman and Afghanistan's prime minister who is not exercising his powers. Like Hekmatyar, the governor of Kunduz Province, in northern Afghanistan, denies the presence of these Arab combatants. To seek the truth, AL- WATAN AL-'ARABI has toured Afghanistan to look for these Arabs and has found them. So where are the `Afghan Arabs' now and what do they do? One looks for them but cannot find them. One hears about them but cannot see them. One goes here and there and asks about the `Afghan Arabs,' and one is told, "Perhaps they are near Mazar-i Sharif and in Takhar and Tashqurghan. They have training camps there. But do not bother because you will not find them." I headed for Mazar-i Sharif and to Takhar and Tashqurghan. I went around; I searched; and I asked. But there was no trace of any training camp. However, with great difficulty I found Hasan. Hasan is a 28-year old Arab, as he says when he is asked. But it is difficult for Hasan to conceal his Egyptian accent. Hasan talks to one gently and politely and explains his position on jihad, saying, "It is jihad for God and Islam against Islam's enemies." Hasan was asked, "Now that the Afghan jihad against communism has ended, what are you doing here in Mazar-i Sharif?" Hasan responded that jihad against communism has not ended because communism has not disappeared completely from Afghanistan, considering that "there are active and influential elements that continue to operate in the government and that control sensitive positions. If we consider what is going on in Tajikistan, our neighbor, we would become certain that communist is still extant and that it is trying to return forcefully to the region. So how can we end the jihad?" When one asks Hasan about the training camps, one is told that they exist. But Hasan will reveal no more, because when he joined his group, Hasan promised that he would not disclose any details. All we have been able to learn from Hasan is that all the vast barren expanses are training grounds where training camps are set up by night and disappear by dawn "because we do not need buildings and we do not need tent camps to train in the use of weapons and to master offensive military strategies. The environment belongs to us. We may meet under a shady tree or hide behind a hill." Very adroitly, Hasan refused to disclose the number of `Afghan Arabs,' their nationalities, or their ages. We asked him, "Do you not want to go back home? He answered, "Someday, perhaps soon. My country needs me and needs my knowledge." He departs, placing his hand on his heart as a sign of peace and as a greeting, stroking his black beard with the other hand in the meanwhile. After a 24-hour search in Tashqurghan, I met with 'Adnan. Like everybody else, 'Adnan is masked and he wears the Afghan garb which consists of a shirt, a pair of pants, and a black turban. If Hasan's accent betrayed his attempt to conceal his citizenship, then 'Adnan masters all of the Arab world's accents. When he speaks, one decides one minute that he is an Egyptian, another minute a Palestinian, or perhaps an Algerian, an Iraqi, or a Libyan. His strange mixture of accents confuses one. When one asks him, "What is your citizenship, 'Adnan?" He answers, "What business do you have with my citizenship? I am an Arab and I struggle for what is right. My conviction is my faith and my faith unites me with my brothers, whatever their citizenship." One then asks, "Why do you train when jihad has ended?" 'Adnan answers, with all his features turning into a question mark, "Ended? If, and I say if, jihad has ended here, then it has not ended in our Arab countries. Right will triumph soon. God's word will be carried out soon, and it is for this word that we work. Do not try to get any clarifications or information from me. I have taken the oath to keep things secret and to remain silent. Do not look for others, either, because we are all faithful." Algerian 'Abbas: I Am Libyan I left the province and headed for the city of Kunduz, carrying deep inside me a despair that was dragging my steps backward. But the thread of hope holding my curiosity and my desire for knowledge was stronger. Immediately upon arriving in the city, which is located 332 km north of Kabul, the capital, I headed for the office of Governor Qari Rahmatollah. I introduced myself and delivered to him a letter of introduction from a prominent political figure in the country. He welcomed me warmly and expressed his willingness to meet my wishes. I told him I wanted to see 'Abbas, a name that had been mentioned in my presence by an official in Kabul. He is an Algerian who heads an Islamic organization in Kunduz which coordinates humanitarian aid to Tajik refugees. At my request, the governor of Kunduz, who was my host, summoned 'Abbas. To honor a guest in Afghanistan, custom requires that a number of notables be invited to have dinner with him. So, the reception hall was swarming with men. As soon as dinner ended at about 2000, 'Abbas came in. He is a tall, brown-skinned, and no more than 35 years old. He wears a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest, and a black turban. His beard is also black but not thick, and he strokes it between one word and the other, as if seeking inspiration from it. Those present conversed, and I listened and watched without interrupting, convinced that my turn to speak would inevitably come. But I miscalculated. 'Abbas was undoubtedly aware of my profession and of the purpose behind my request to meet him. He spoke in general terms and avoided looking at me directly. From time to time, he gave me a side glance. Whenever I tried to catch his eye, he turned his face away, as if afraid that I would ask him a question. But I did not ask any until the others finished talking about humanitarian aid and about generalities, and also until they finished exchanging their courtesies. When I asked 'Abbas about his citizenship, knowing full well that he is an Algerian--a fact confirmed to me by everybody who sat in that hall and who knew 'Abbas very well--he flashed me a quick look and fired his words as if he wished they were bullets that could hit me, saying, "I am Libyan." He stood up straight like an arrow, asked to be excused because he was late for some important business, and departed with the speed of lightning, leaving behind tension in the air. I remained seated on the floor. The rapid succession of developments paralyzed every move I had hoped to make, and I remained paralyzed until I was pulled out of my state and awakened by a guest who said, "What is the matter with you? You are as silent as a rock. You wanted to see 'Abbas. He has come and you have not asked him a single question." To justify 'Abbas's assumption of a different identity, this guest started to criticize me and to accuse me of seeking out Arabs for one purpose only, namely to offend them. "Why do you want to harm them? Why do you harbor ill will for them? Why do you investigate their affairs. They are jihad people. 'Abbas, for example, has been here for six years and he speaks Dari like any Afghan. All he does is work to help the Tajik refugees." "Of course," I said to the man, "but the Tajik refugees have not been here for a year yet. Besides, where does 'Abbas get the money to help the refugees?" "How surprising," said more than one guest to me. "Why did you not ask him this question? We are not interested in the source of the money. What is important is the aid given to the refugees. "But are you not worried for your condition from movements that perhaps conceal some unhumanitarian purposes behind them?" "Do you not worry about us? We need aid. The Tajik refugees are a burden to us and our governorate is poor." The following day, I asked to see 'Abbas again. The city governor sent an emissary to him, but this emissary returned to tell us that 'Abbas was very busy and that he did not have a single minute to spare. The reason was that during the night, an attempt had been made on the life of 'Abdol Ghafur, leader of the Tajik refugees in Kunduz. Armed men entered a home where a confidential meeting was in progress and opened fire from their automatic weapons. 'Abdol Ghafur escaped the attempt but his personal guard was killed. I turned to Governor Qari Rahmatollah and said to him: tell me about the Tajik refugees and the problems you encounter. Kunduz governor proceeded to tell me that the Tajik refugees (Muslims) have occupied the schools in he center of the city, thus compelling teachers and students to conduct their studies in school yards or under trees and reducing the number of students. The refugees have also set up large camps at the military airfield, in Imam al-Bukhara, and in Bagh Sharkat (sites around the city of Kunduz). Training Camps for Tajiks When refugees started arriving in Kunduz, the people helped them. But then refugee numbers multiplied so rapidly, the people could help no more. So, a Higher Refugees Committee was formed of Tajik members and and it began to collect donations and distribute them to the refugees. This committee was followed by an Arab organization named the Islamic Aid Coordination Committee, which tends and provides aid to the refugees. The governor went on to add that this committee's activities are limited and do not exceed humanitarian objectives. Last summer, a number of refugee children and old men died because of high temperatures and lack of medicines. They suffer greatly because their life here is difficult. They also need foodstuffs. The Islamic Coordination Committee provides just one loaf of bread, i.e., 120 grams of bread, per person daily. This is not enough to feed a human being. Kunduz is a peaceful city, according to its governor, and no problems will develop in it because the local consultative council includes members from the various parties existing in the region. The governor also said that he works ceaselessly to safeguard the city's security and that he holds a weekly meeting to examine and deal with the conditions. Despite these security facilities, nobody other than the Arabs has come to help the refugees. The United Nations is absent from Kunduz, and "we have appealed to the United Nations and to the Islamic countries to aid the refugees, and also our governorate which suffers from a different problem, namely the return of Afghan refugees. To date, Iran and Pakistan have evicted 700,000 Afghan refugees in the direction of Kunduz. The Afghan Government is unable to help and aid these refugees. This is why we have appealed to non-governmental organizations and why we have assured them that security here is firm and that they can operate without any fear. It seems that the first organization to respond will be Doctors Without Borders, a French organization." I asked the governor about reports that the Arabs, who are active in Kunduz, have rejected the entry of any non-governmental international organization to the city. In response, he was content to say that an understanding has been reached on this issue, that humanitarian organizations must be invited, and that no obstacles must be placed in their way. I asked the governor if officials are getting more befuddled because Tajik refugees are replacing their tents with solid houses, thus confirming their intention to stay in Afghanistan for a long time? The governor answered that nobody is forcing them to stay or to return to Tajikistan, especially since they assert that the communists will kill them if they return, considering that these communists have already burned down and destroyed their homes. Moreover, Afghan hospitality and the Islamic faith do not permit officials to deport Tajik refugees. I left the governor and headed for Kunduz airfield. On the way, I saw a sign pointing to the office of the Islamic Relief Organization, i.e., 'Abbas's office. I passed close to it and followed a rugged road to get to the military airfield camp. The camp encompasses nearly 1,000 buildings, some constructed of clay and some of lumber. Every building is tantamount to a number of rooms. Seven to 10 persons live in each room, of which one corner is set aside for cooking. I moved from room to room and from building to building, surrounded by a troop of children who looked at me as if I had just descended from Mars. I entered a wooden building that has been turned into a hospital. There, I met with Dr. Taleb Shah Faydzadeh, the camp physician who fled Tajikistan in December 1992 to escape death. Faydzadeh asserted that the airport camp alone includes 22,000 refugees and that there are nearly 40,000 Tajik refugees in Kunduz and its suburbs. I asked him about the living conditions and about aid. He answered with a choking voice that living conditions are very difficult, that youth and men can rarely find work in the city, and that aid comes from some Afghans, and especially from Arabs. What Arabs? "I do not know what Arabs. All I know is that there is a coordination committee that collects donations. Every morning, the Arabs distribute a loaf of bread to every person. Drugs are dwindling, and patients are increasing in numbers. Some patients are people who have lost arms or legs to mines planted around the airfield. There are five Tajik physicians here, and at times we enlist the help of the Kunduz hospital physicians." [Salim] Where do you get money to buy food? [Faydzadeh] Some young men are employed in construction or sanitation work in the city, even though they may have high college degrees. However, we prefer such work to returning to Tajikistan, where our lives will be endangered by the communists who have destroyed our homes and burnt our lands and property. I had decided to leave the airfield camp. But an eight-year old child insisted, while holding my hand, on taking me to her family room. I went to that room and found seven children and two women there. I asked one of them: where is your husband? "He went to the training camp." "What camp and what sort of training?" "I do not know. But he tells me that if he does not go, the Arabs will not aid us." I did not know what to do when the other woman assured me that her son had also gone to the training camp, but that she did not know where this camp was located or who managed it. All she knew is that the camp's youth and men went to train in jihad against communism and communists. At nearly 1,500 meters from the airfield, another camp has been set up for Tajik refugees. It is Imam al-Bukhari Camp and it includes 8,000 refugees. If two mosques have been built at the airfield camp for the 22,000 refugees, then five mosques are being built at the same time in the new al-Bukhari Camp. In Imam al-Bukhari, old men and a few young men are busy building a hospital and the five mosques. Anybody you ask at this camp will tell you that the youth have gone to train for jihad. But nobody will tell you the location of the training camp, the duration of training, or the people in charge of this "profession." When one asks about aid, the answer given is, "They are the Arabs. They give us food and materials to build our tents and the mosques." We Want Weapons, not Aid From Imam al-Bukhari, I went to Bagh Sharkat Camp, where a model village is being built. The area is a vast barren expanse where every refugee selects his own spot and builds his own house on his own and in the style he wishes. In Bagh Sharkat, I met with a 50-year-old man who had finished building his home's outer walls and who was busy with internal partition. As soon as he learned that I was a journalist, he started yelling as loudly as he could, "We want weapons. We do not want food aid. We need weapons to fight against communism in our country, Tajikistan. I am building this home for my wife and children. But I will not live in it because I will go to the jihad. I am training daily, and I can still carry arms. I have sold some property to buy weapons and I will sell the car I own for the same purpose. Moreover, the Arabs give us some aid and we also have some weapons hidden here. But we need more." I asked this zealot, "Where do you train and what kind of weapons do you have?" His answer was a smile, after which he went on to talk about jihad against communism. Again, I asked about the type of aid advanced by the Arabs. He responded, "The Arabs help us and help everybody. Every morning, they come here and leave construction materials, lumber, and stones. We take whatever we need to build our homes. They also give us bread. But they do not give us money." "Which Arabs?" "The Arabs. I do not know which Arabs." I became certain I could get no more information. So I left, having decided to head for the border area of Sherkhan Bandar near the Amu Darya River, which is 50 km from Kunduz and which is considered the border separating Tajikistan from Afghanistan. There, the UN Higher Refugees Commission tends a refugee camp that includes 2,000 refugees who lack drugs, but not food. Natasha, a nurse at this camp, invited us to have tea at her tent where she lives with her husband, who was absent that day, and with her seven children. She was in her seventh month of pregnancy. As soon as we sat down, Asad came into the tent. Asad was a dark-skinned man with piercing eyes. When he spoke, his thundering voice almost brought down the tent on our heads. Karim came in Asad's company. Karim was a 50-year-old man with features that were not as harsh as those of Asad. He spoke with fear in his voice. He turned left and right while speaking, as if looking for a spy or an observer hiding behind this or that couch. Of course, I addressed all my questions to Asad, who proceeded to explain his current life to me: "I came to Afghanistan in January 1993. I lived at the border camp of Imam Sahib initially. But I live at the Kunduz airfield camp now and I come here to Kunduz nearly every day to visit my daughter. In Kunduz, we get food aid from the Afghan Government and from the Arabs, as well as some aid from the Iranians." "What kind?" "Any kind of aid one can think of, and I will say no more." Asad went on to assert that the Afghans have not asked the refugees to return to their homes, and that these refugees will not return as long as their Tajikistan is run by criminal communists. Rather, the refugees will carry on with their struggle, jihad, and political action in exile. Asad talked at length about the communists, whom he has known for 17 years. He has asserted that the refugees are accused of being radical Islamists and that the communist government uses this excuse to pursue and kill them. I asked Asad, "How do you struggle?" He answered, "We meet from time to time at a certain place in Kunduz. We study the situation and determine the steps that we have to take. Yesterday, for example, I was present when the attack against leader of the Tajik refugees in Kunduz was made. The communists wanted to assassinate him, but failed. 'Abdol Ghafur survived but, regrettably, his guard was killed. We also train at various and changing sites on how to launch attacks. Several months ago, we launched an offensive from the border Imam Sahib point. I did not take part in it but 500 other refugees and some Arabs did." I interposed at this point and asked him, "What Arabs? What are their nationalities?" After a moment's hesitation, he said, "Two Egyptians took part in the offensive. Regrettably, it failed and 300 attackers, including the two Egyptians, were arrested. The others managed to return." Karim then interposed to tell me that he had gone into Tajikistan twice as a delegation member and that conditions have not changed there, as confirmed by messages received from Tajikistan. He said that, consequently, he does not believe that any refugee will decide to return home soon and that most refugees have resolved to stay and train in jihad. I left the camp and took a tea break at the residence of employees of the UN Higher Refugees Commission before taking the road back to Kabul. At this residence, one employee said to me, "Look for a person called Ishaq in the capital. He knows a lot about the `Afghan Arabs.'" They Went to Sudan As soon as I got back to Kabul, I did, in fact, start looking for Ishaq, and I found him in one of the ministries. Ishaq said, "The Arab youth who came to Pakistan from the Middle East to support the mujahedin are divided into several groups. Some came for humanitarian work; others came to continue their studies, and most of those were Palestinian communists; and some came first and foremost for the purpose of jihad, and they took part in battles in south and east Afghanistan. However, they all fought alongside the mujahedin and they asserted that they were members of the International Islamic Conference. Because they had various political tendencies and opinions, they supported this or that party. Generally, they supported either Golboddin and his Hezb-e-Eslami Party or Sayyaf and his Ettehad-e Eslami Party. This condition persisted until the Kabul [communist] government collapsed. At that time, some `Afghan Arabs' decided that the jihad had ended and that they had to support the government. Others believed in Hekmatyar's principles, arguments, and ideas which stressed that Kabul's government was not Islamic and that, therefore, the jihad had to continue. These `Afghan Arabs' are currently fighting in Kabul with the Hezb-e-Eslami Party's forces. But they do not exceed 100 in number, and some of them have been killed in battles." Ishaq added, "Pakistan has deported a number of `Afghan Arabs' to Sudan, which is trying to get control over the remaining groups here in one way or another. One should keep in mind that several countries, led by Iran, Sudan, and Pakistan, are involved in financing and adopting Islamist elements. "As for the U.S. intelligence agencies, which are eager to learn what is going on, they request reports on the Islamists' activities in Pakistan. But I doubt that Islamabad provides a true picture of the real situation." I thanked Ishaq for this information. But another question kept occurring in my mind: "Why is the United Nations absent from Tajik camps in the north?" I posed this question to a UN official, and he offered a clear answer, pointing out that there was no need to disclose his name. He said, "The United Nations is absent, especially from Kunduz, because it does not wish to become embroiled with the Islamists. These people are very active in the camps and they urge the Tajiks to struggle with all means. We are not prepared to enter into territory planted with human mines with the consent of Afghan officials, even though we are completely confident that our position suits the radicals and gives them a free hand."
