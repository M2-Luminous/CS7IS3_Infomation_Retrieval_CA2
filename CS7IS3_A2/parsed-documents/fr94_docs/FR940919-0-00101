FR940919-0-00101 FR940919-0-00016 For coke by-product nonwastewaters, EPA is promulgating concentration-based standards based on incineration. Under the authority of section 3007 of RCRA, EPA collected generation and management information concerning coke by-product wastes; this information was collected in 1985 and 1987. The majority of K141 to K145 nonwastewaters generated during that timeframe were recycled or used for energy recovery. Tar storage tank and tar distillation bottoms may be removed periodically. The Agency identified the following annualized land-disposed quantities of wastes: 49 tons of K141 nonwastewaters, 2,750 tons of K142 nonwastewaters, 10 tons of K143 nonwastewaters, 304 tons of K144 nonwastewaters, 1,408 tons of K147 nonwastewaters, and less than 100 tons of K148 nonwastewaters. EPA identified no K145 nonwastewaters that were being land disposed. The Agency solicited comments on the above estimated quantities that may require alternative treatment as a result of the LDRs. However, no comments were received on this issue. Thus, EPA is using the estimates shown above for the quantities of these wastes that may require treatment capacity as a result of the LDRs. Current management practices indicate that the majority of the newly listed coke by-product wastes are amenable to recycling, and therefore alternative treatment may not be required as a result of today's final rule. Thus, EPA believes that adequate capacity exists to treat the small amount of wastes that require alternative treatment. EPA does not have any information that coke by-product wastewaters are currently generated. The quantity of these wastewaters is assumed to be zero. EPA solicited comments on changes of management practices or generation data on these wastes. No comments were received on this issue. Consequently, EPA concludes that the quantity of these wastewaters is zero. As a result of this analysis, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance to K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147, and K148 nonwastewaters and wastewaters; however, the Agency is granting a three-month variance as described in Section A for the reason described therein. b. Surface Disposed Chlorinated Toluene Wastes K149_Distillation bottoms from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene, benzoyl chlorides, and compound with mixtures of these functional groups. (This waste does not include still bottoms from the distillation of benzyl chloride.) K150_Organic residuals, excluding spent carbon adsorbent, from the spent chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid recovery processes associated with the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene, benzoyl chlorides and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. K151_Wastewater treatment sludges, excluding neutralization and biological sludges, generated during the treatment of wastewaters from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene, benzoyl chlorides and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. For wastes generated during the production of chlorinated toluene, EPA is promulgating concentration-based treatment standards based on incineration for nonwastewaters. EPA collected generation and management information on wastes generated from the production of chlorinated toluene. EPA collected this information under the authority of section 3007 of RCRA during engineering site visits in 1988. This capacity analysis incorporates data from the section 3007 information request and engineering site visits. EPA identified four facilities that produce chlorinated toluene wastes. The Agency has identified no K149 nonwastewaters, no K150 nonwastewaters, and less than 100 tons of K151 nonwastewaters that were being land disposed. For the capacity analysis, EPA assumes that these quantities are currently being land disposed and will require treatment capacity as a result of today's final rule. EPA solicited comments on management practices and generation data on these wastes. One commenter requested a variance because high concentrations of salt and halogenated compounds make these wastes difficult to incinerate. EPA contacted a commercial incineration facility that stated that with proper management they could treat these wastes. Therefore, EPA believes that a capacity variance is not warranted for these wastes. EPA does not have any information that chlorinated toluene wastewaters are currently generated. EPA solicited comments on changes of management practices or generation data on these wastes. No comments were received on this issue. Thus, EPA concludes that the quantity of these wastewaters is zero. Because adequate capacity exists to treat these wastes, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance for K149, K150, and K151 nonwastewaters and wastewaters; however, like the other newly listed and identified wastes, EPA is granting a three-month variance as described in Section A for the reason described therein. 4. Newly Identified TC Wastes That Were Not Previously Hazardous by the Old EP Leaching Procedure In the Third Third LDR rule (55 FR 22520, June 1, 1990), EPA promulgated treatment standards for D012 through D017 wastes, but only for those wastes that were previously hazardous by the old EP leaching procedure and remain hazardous under the new TCLP. D012 through D017 wastes that were not hazardous by the old EP leaching procedure but are now hazardous using the new TCLP are considered newly-identified D012 through D017 wastes. In response to the ANPRM (56 FR 55160, October 24, 1991), EPA did not receive any estimates for additional waste quantities (or newly-identified wastes) due to the use of the TCLP rather than the EP leaching procedure. Similarly, no estimates were received in response to the proposed rule. EPA believes that the quantities of the newly-identified D012 through D017 wastes due to the use of the TCLP rather than the EP leaching procedure are small, if any, and, hence, expects little or no additional demand for commercial treatment capacity as a result of the LDRs. Because sufficient capacity exists to treat these wastes, EPA is not granting the newly-identified D012 through D017 wastes a national capacity variance. However, the Agency is granting a three-month variance as described in Section A of the preamble.
