FR940325-1-00061 FR940325-1-00008 The fallback guidelines would restrict management practices to those activities that assist in or do not hinder meeting certain legal mandates and achieving or maintaining rangeland health. The fallback guidelines include the requirement that grazing management practices be implemented that assist in or do not hinder the recovery of threatened or endangered species, or assist in preventing the listing of species identified as candidates for threatened or endangered species. This guideline is intended to avoid the impacts associated with the listing of more species as threatened or endangered. A second guideline would require that grazing practices be implemented that would assist in attaining and protecting water quality consistent with the Clean Water Act. The fallback guidelines would also require that grazing schedules include periods of rest during times of critical plant growth or regrowth, and that continuous season-long grazing be limited to instances where it has been demonstrated that such use would be consistent with achieving or maintaining rangeland health and riparian functioning condition, and with meeting established resource objectives. Under the fallback guidelines, development of springs or other projects affecting water would be designed to protect the ecological values of the affected sites. Livestock management practices or management facilities such as corrals, pipelines, or fences, would generally be required to be located outside of riparian-wetland areas, and where standards for these areas are not being met, the facilities could be removed or relocated, or the management practices modified. The fallback guidelines would require the establishment and application of utilization or residual vegetation limits that would benefit the diversity and vigor of woody and herbaceous species, maintain healthy age-class structure in riparian-wetland and aquatic plant communities, and would leave sufficient biomass and plant residue to provide for sediment filtering, the dissipation of stream energy, and streambank stability and shading. Finally, the fallback guidelines would require that allotment management plans and other activity plans addressing livestock grazing that are developed or amended after the fallback guidelines become effective specify desired plant communities, including minimum percentages of site vegetation cover, and incorporate utilization limits for both riparian and upland sites to assist in achieving or maintaining proper functioning condition. The Department recognizes that the proposed fallback standards and guidelines may not fit all situations. A provision has been included in the proposed rule that would allow BLM State Directors to adjust the fallback standards and guidelines, subject to approval of the Secretary, to fit State or local conditions. However, in tailoring the fallback standards and guidelines to more local conditions, the BLM State Directors must ensure that the general purpose of each of the fallback standards and guidelines is met.
