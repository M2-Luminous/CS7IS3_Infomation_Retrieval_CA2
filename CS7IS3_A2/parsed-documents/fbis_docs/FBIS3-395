The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] decided at the eleventh hour to register conditionally for participation in next month's election. The party's national chairman, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, is on his way from Ulundi to Kempton Park by plane to register the IFP. Over the next four hours -- at midnight -- it will be all over for political parties that have not yet registered for the election. [passage omitted] At Ulundi, the Central Committee of the IFP made a last-minute decision. For news from Ulundi we switch over live to Gary Alfonso. [Alfonso] Good evening from here in Ulundi, where it has been a very busy day. Inkatha's Central Committee eventually decided, after a meeting of more than seven hours, to pass the resolution that they would in fact register. Dr. Frank Mdlalose is already on his way to Johannesburg where he will register the IFP conditionally as a party to take part in the election. TV News has just spoken to some of the members of the committee after the meeting and they were all cautiously optimistic. I have in my hand here the resolution and one of the significant decisions is of course the first one -- that they will register conditionally to take part in the election, but they also add that the decision does not mean that the IFP supports the current state of discussions or the transitional constitution. There are two clauses that are perhaps very important at this stage. The first is that mediation is also necessary to revise the election process and that of course means that the mediation can be employed and according to the IFP, to possibly postpone the election date, and that is what the clause says here. The role of the king must also be looked at by the mediators. A little while ago we spoke to Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and this is what he had to say about this decision. [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] In the first place, we don't want anyone to have any illusions that this means any shift in our position as far as our rejection of the 1993 interim constitution is concerned because we still have those reservations about that, and really, that is the reason why we seek international mediation because all the negotiations have flopped, they have come to naught. So therefore the very first thing that should be done is mediation itself, and we are very happy that the ANC [African National Congress] has endorsed this resolution of the Central Committee passed on the 12th which, after our discussions with Mr. Mandela, has also been accepted in principle by the ANC. So Monday, I expect Dr. Mdlalose and a committee to look at the question of terms of reference for such a mediation and what kind of people can conduct the mediation itself. So those are things that come first. So we would like to make it clear that there can be no progress unless that goes forward first before we go on to the other steps that we should be taking in terms of the Electoral Act. And then also we would like also to say that we expect the mediation also to include mediation [as heard] -- it should not in any way undermine any of the steps that his majesty the king has taken as far as the kwaZulu kingdom is concerned, and we have of course also informed members of the Freedom Alliance already this afternoon what we have decided. We were together yesterday and they endorsed my stand and the stand of the Central Committee at our meeting in Cape Town, and we are informing them now, and we are going to meet in that committee where Dr. Mdlalose is, members of Central Committee present [as heard] as well as members of the Freedom Alliance. So I hear that also...[interrupted by announcer] [end recording]
