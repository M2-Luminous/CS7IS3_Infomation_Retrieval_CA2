To be a crime it would have to be specifically described as "antijuridical conduct" either in the Penal Code or in a law such as the frightful and now repudiated Law 1008. Oddly enough, neither those in the U.S. Embassy nor their Bolivian counterparts who implement draconian measures included such conduct in that law, and therefore it is not characterized as a crime. Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the "laundering," which is also called "whitewashing," is impossible to keep under control in a financial and monetary system like ours, where there are no restrictions for converting our currency, or where no question is asked about who makes deposits or withdrawals in bank accounts for any type of currency. The other ways of finding out (through legal means, and not through intimidation, blackmail, or physical or psychological torture) if a transaction is voluntarily linked to a crime are also impossible. For example, how can you incriminate the apostolic vicariate in a Santa Cruz Province that 10 years ago sold a cattle ranch in its ownership to an individual who is now being accused of drug trafficking? There are many examples, and the introduction of controls to prevent the undesirable laundering can do nothing more than obstruct the normal flow of financial operations. What Law 1008 in reality establishes is the investigation of wealth, and in this way trace whether an individual accumulated wealth through illegal activities such as drug trafficking. This should be extended to other individuals to find out whether there were cases of embezzlement or corruption in the public administration.
