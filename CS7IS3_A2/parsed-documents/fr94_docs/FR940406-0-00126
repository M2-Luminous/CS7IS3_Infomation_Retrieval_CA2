A new §86.001&hyph;28 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.001&hyph;28 Compliance with emission standards. Section 86.001&hyph;28 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §§86.094&hyph;28 and 86.098&hyph;28. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;28 or §86.098&hyph;28 is identical and applicable to §86.001&hyph;28, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved].

(b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks. (2) Each exhaust, evaporative and refueling emission standard (and family emission limits, as appropriate) of §86.001&hyph;9 applies to the emissions of vehicles for the appropriate useful life as defined in §§86.098&hyph;2 and 86.001&hyph;9. (b)(3) through (b)(6) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;28. (b)(7)(i) Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes the procedure for determining compliance of a new vehicle with evaporative emission standards. The procedure described here shall be used for all vehicles in applicable model years. (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in §86.001&hyph;21(b)(4)(i)(A), and supply an evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the emission level at the useful life point.
