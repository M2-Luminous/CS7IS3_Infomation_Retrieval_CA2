The government spokesman stressed that the Greek Cypriot side cannot keep accepting amendments that aim at satisfying [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas. [passage omitted] In a statement, Democratic Rally [DISI] notes that the Butrus-Ghali report is disappointing and a result of intervention by third parties. The statement adds that the spirit and contents of the report already raise serious questions about the intentions and goals of the United Nations, which, it continues, together with outside interests, serves the Turkish demand for final division of Cyprus instead of the settlement of the Cyprus issue. DISI calls on all political forces to proceed with dialogue and cooperation to formulate a common stance to deal with the situation. Democratic Party [DIKO] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou describes the Butrus-Ghali report as an unacceptable one, which, he adds, seeks to satisfy the Turkish positions through the intervention of third parties. Kiprianou added that this situation should be put to an end, and our side should seek disengagement and promote discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, with priority on the issue of the Turkish troops, settlers, and security. The Free Democrats Movement announced that even though Turkish intransigence is more than obvious, the UN secretary general refrains from blaming the Turkish side and asks for extension of the process to reach an agreement on amended ideas. The Free Democrats reaffirmed their position on the immediate return to discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue.
