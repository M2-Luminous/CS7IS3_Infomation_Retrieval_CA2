The journalists -- Ngumo wa Kuria and Peter Makori -- both working for the Lonrho-owned STANDARD newspapers, were expected to appear in court in the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on Thursday, probably on charges of "false reporting to create alarm". Ngumo wa Kuria was picked up in Nakuru, while Makori was picked up from the western Kenyan town of Kisii and brought to Nakuru to face charges for the report, published on Wednesday by THE STANDARD, but which police authorities have strongly denied. The report quoted 200 ethnic Kisiis who arrived back home on Monday night and told how an unidentified group terrorised people last Friday in Mau Summit of Molo area, killing some people and forcing the rest out of their homes. The area was badly affected at the height of ethnic violence which left more than 1,000 people dead and tens of thousands more displaced last year, until the government stepped in and declared it a security zone in an effort to end the fighting between the majority Kikuyu and President Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin tribesmen.
