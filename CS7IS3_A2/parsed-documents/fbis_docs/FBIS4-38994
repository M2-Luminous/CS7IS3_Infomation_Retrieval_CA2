We shall see who was right, history will judge us. As long as Yeltsin is president there will be no positive changes in the country. Because this is all his fault - the destruction of that great power, the Soviet Union, and the destruction of the country's economy. All this is his doing -- the poverty, refugees, local conflicts, bloodshed. [Zhurba] But at that time you were there by his side. [Rutskoy] I was with him for six months only. After he signed the CIS treaty we were no longer together. I stated my position on this clearly and defended it until the Supreme Soviet was gunned down. And I am still defending my positions and will never change them. [Zhurba] Do you see yourself as a leader who, on becoming president, could change the course and the policy of the state and make our state richer and people's living standards better? [Rutskoy] It is the people who should judge me, Yeltsin and others. The people should choose their leader. [end recording] Nevertheless, the last word will be said by those who do not just listen to Aleksandr Rutskoy, but sometimes see him on the television screen calling on all the healthy, strong men and urging them to storm this building or that building.
