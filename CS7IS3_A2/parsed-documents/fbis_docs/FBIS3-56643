It was Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who proposed extending the emergency at the parliament session on January 18. He said it was needed to enforce law and order in the country. Opposition deputies who agreed with the head of state on most points demanded that he give up the "services" of the Defense Ministry in enforcing the emergency and lift censorship of mass media. Shevardnadze responded by saying that there was not censorship in the country while the emergency was being enforced by the police and interior troops. The emergency was extended in a 112 to 23 vote with 15 abstentions. There are 220 deputies in the Georgian parliament.
