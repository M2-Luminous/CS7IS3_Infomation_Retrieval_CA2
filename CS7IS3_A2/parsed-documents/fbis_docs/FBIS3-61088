The colossal Brazilian market is opening up to Russian businessmen. It is attractive not just by its size--Russia can operate thereon in the role not only of exporter of raw material but of supplier of machinery, equipment, and technology. The present state of trade relations does not satisfy either Brazil or Russia. According to Mr. Vieira, in 10 months of 1993, Brazilian exports to Russia amounted to only $146 million (Russian exports were only a little more). Trade is at times of a sporadic nature--from one incidental contract to another--and many transactions are effected via middlemen. The statement signed yesterday, on the other hand, opens the Brazilian market to Russian businessmen. It is planned within five years to reach a commodity turnover level of a minimum of $2 billion (it will in 1994 even have doubled compared with the present year). The trade plans are notable not only for the bare figures alone, for that matter: As distinct from trade with the West (where exports to us are supported by government credit, as a rule), trade with Brazil will be supported by credit from pools of commercial banks. From the Russian side lines of credit will be provided, it is anticipated, by, in particular, the Moscow Business Bank, the Mezhkombank, the Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank. Brazil's big interest in the Russian market fits perfectly well within the program of the encouragement of exports with a simultaneous adjustment of foreign trade priorities which has been announced by this country. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will create certain problems for South American commodities, nor is the European Union in any hurry fully to open its doors to them. Russia and Brazil frequently run into antidumping measures in respect to identical commodities (textiles, aluminum, isobutanol, and such) on European markets, incidentally. Besides expanding the possibilities for the coordination of trade policy in third countries, the statement signed yesterday creates a real basis for the mutual--and conflict-free--realization of the foreign trade plans of Russia and Brazil. Thus, Russia, preoccupied with a restructuring of its agricultural imports (hitherto largely oriented toward the West), intends to pay more attention to purchases (together with the traditional coffee and cocoa) of Brazilian soybeans, sugar, and meat. A certain niche in Russian imports could be filled by inexpensive Brazilian footwear also. The Brazilians, in turn, are interested in Russian turbines and engines, chemical fertilizers, and raw material for the chemical industry and pharmaceuticals. The Lado do Brasil company, specializing in the sale and service of VAZ automobiles, has already settled in on the Brazilian market. Plans for the purchase from Russia of specialized fishing vessels and floating fish-processing plants and a research ship for Brazilian research in Antarctica were agreed in the course of the Moscow negotiations. Russia has long been mulling over plans for an outlet onto the Latin American arms market. Brazil could become a good springboard for products of Russia's aerospace complex. The Brazilian side expressed once again in Moscow an interest in the joint development of inertial-guidance systems for space-launch vehicles. At Brazil's suggestion, a plan of Russia's participation in the creation of a global information system, which with the aid of 66 satellites would link all countries of the world, is being developed. Brazil's Alcantara Cosmodrome, in the state of Maranhao, would be used for the launches of these satellites, which would reduce the cost of the project considerably: The geographical location of the cosmodrome would permit a savings at the time of the launch of up to 30 percent of the rocket fuel.

Russia is counting on the states of the region (specifically, Brazil, which ranks among the "new industrial countries") that are prepared to purchase not only Russian raw materials but also its finished products. Russia could to some extent tackle problems of conversion here also, having obtained access to an ample arms and dual-purpose technology market. It has thus far belonged practically exclusively to the United States. And it is not fortuitous that a Russian exposition will appear for the first time at a close-combat arms exhibition in Uruguay in April-May 1994. The first attempts to organize broad-based cooperation with Brazil were made a year ago, when Moscow was visited by a delegation of the FINEP major government investment corporation. Even at that time (as now also), the Brazilians supported the creation of joint ventures in the field of telecommunications and displayed an interest in solid-fuel rocket engines. This approach objectively corresponds to Russia's interests: The relocation overseas, primarily in the "new industrial countries," of enterprises of the military-industrial complex (in the form of joint ventures or affiliates) could to some extent remove them from the heightened interest on the part of Western competitors supporting strict control of Russian research-intensive exports. But it remains an open question to what extent it will be possible to avoid debate with the West about which kind of technology Russia may export, and which, not. And it cannot be ruled out that participation in the reconstruction of Brazil's cosmodrome could, as in the case of the infamous "Indian deal," cause an outcry in Washington.
