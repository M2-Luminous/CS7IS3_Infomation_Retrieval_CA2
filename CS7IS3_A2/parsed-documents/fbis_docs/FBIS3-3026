Although almost 70, the venerable Ma is still full of vitality. He spoke of the National People's Congress [NPC] and CPPCC sessions with profound feelings: "I was involved in the CPPCC work in Guangdong for more than two decades, and during the last 10 years and more, I have been involved in NPC and CPPCC National Committee work. Overall, I feel that our NPC and CPPCC work have become more and more mature. The sessions' proceedings have improved with each passing year. This year's sessions will further push forward the reform to build a socialist market economic structure. I am confident that the sessions will be successful." Speaking of this, he stepped closer to the reporter and, with an amiable smile, he said: "I am full of determination and confidence. The reason is I have faith in the CPC's power." Speaking of the recent termination of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political system, his already rosy face reddened: "Colonialists will not resign themselves to withdrawing from the stage of history. The British want to continue their colonial rule in Hong Kong after 1997." At this time, he took this reporter's notebook and pen and wrote: "The ghost of imperialism refuses to leave." He continued: "The British attempt will not succeed. Whatever tricks it uses will be futile and end up hurting itself, like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet. No force can stop China from regaining its sovereignty over Hong Kong and achieving national reunification. This is because China today is already `a completely different story!'" Partly because of the excitement and partly as a result of the cold he has had in the last few days, he felt a little tired and was helped by family members to the bedroom to rest. Before he left, he introduced his third son, Mao You-li -- who is a member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee -- to this reporter. He said: "Please have more chats on the sessions." Wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, Ma You-li [you li meaning courteous], like his name, was quite refined and courteous and looked like a scholar. Speaking of the Hong Kong issue, he was also full of just indignation: "The British are guilty of wishful thinking, and nothing good will come of it for the British. As Premier Li Peng stressed in the `Government Work Report,' `British colonial rule in Hong Kong will soon end, and cannot be stopped by any force.'" Although born and brought up in Macao, Ma You-li, 46, was quite familiar with the three components of Marxism. He believed that the socialist market economy being practiced in China is compatible with Marxist economics and that it is a road suited to China's reality and essential to its development, a road chosen by Comrade Deng Xiaoping by integrating China's reality with Marxism. Ma You-li graduated from Hong Kong's Chinese University, where he studied economic management. He always came back to what he learned when discussing the NPC and CPPCC sessions: "I specialize in economics and am engaged in business. Therefore, I set great store by economic efficiency. It was pointed out in Premier Li Peng's government work report and General Secretary Jiang Zemin's recent speech on new development ideas that we must shift our approach to development to the path of raising economic efficiency and that we must not continue to follow the old path of blindly pursuing output value, high development speed, and investment expansion. These ideas are quite suitable to the reality of China's economic development." He said: China has only limited resources and not enough funds. With a weak economic foundation, it cannot afford to pour its limited funds and human and material resources into construction projects that have no or few economic benefits. We cannot pursue output value if what is produced is worthless and does not create economic benefits. We must rationally, scientifically, and effectively distribute our limited resources. Only by doing so can we push our economy along the path of healthy development. He smiled: "As a matter of fact, I already spoke about this issue during the discussion held by the CPPCC's Macao group. I also discussed my views on other issues, such as the tide of migrating workers. I feel that as a CPPCC National Committee member, I should do something concrete during this session. Discussing state affairs is our power as well as our duty. The government also takes our views seriously and tries its best to improve its work. Therefore, we are confident that through efforts during and after the sessions, we will achieve reunification of the motherland and make our country strong and prosperous."
