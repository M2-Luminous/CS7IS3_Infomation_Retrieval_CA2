FR940406-0-00042 FR940406-0-00002 (1) Nondiscriminatory placement, with back pay computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 unless clear and convincing evidence contained in the record demonstrates that the personnel action would have been taken even absent the discrimination. Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has been waived. The back pay liability under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act is limited to the two years prior to the date the discrimination complaint was filed; (2) If clear and convincing evidence indicates that, although discrimination existed at the time the personnel action was taken, the personnel action would have been taken even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless eliminate any discriminatory practice and ensure it does not recur; (3) Cancellation of an unwarranted personnel action and restoration of the employee; (4) Expunction from the Board's records of any adverse materials relating to the discriminatory practice; and (5) Full opportunity to participate in the employee benefit denied (e.g., training, preferential work assignments, overtime scheduling). (d) Mitigation of damages. The Board shall not decline to grant relief based upon failure to mitigate damages unless it has clear and convincing evidence that the employee or applicant for employment has failed to mitigate damages. The Board shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the complainant has failed to mitigate his or her damages. (e) Attorney's fees or costs_ (1) Awards of attorney's fees or costs. The provisions of this paragraph (e) relating to the award of attorney's fees or costs shall apply to allegations of discrimination prohibited by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In a notice of final action or a decision, the employee or applicant for employment may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees or costs (including expert witness fees) incurred in the processing of the complaint. In this regard: (i) A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees; (ii) Attorney's fees are allowable only for the services of members of the Bar and law clerks, paralegals or law students under the supervision of members of the Bar, except that no award is allowable for the services of any employee of the Federal Government; and (iii) Attorney's fees shall be paid only for services performed after the filing of a written complaint and after the complainant has notified the Board that he or she is represented by an attorney, except that fees allowable for a reasonable period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination to represent the complainant. Written submissions to the Board that are signed by the representative shall be deemed to constitute notice of representation. (2) Amount of awards. (i) When the attorney's fees or costs are awarded, the complainant's attorney shall submit a verified statement of costs and attorney's fees (including expert witness fees), as appropriate, to the Board within 30 days of receipt of the final decision, unless a request for review or reconsideration is filed. A statement of attorney's fees shall be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services and both the verified statement and the accompanying affidavit shall be made a part of the complaint file. The amount of attorney's fees or costs to be awarded the complainant shall be determined by agreement among the complainant, the complainant's representative and the Board. Such agreement shall immediately be reduced to writing. (ii) (A) If the complainant, the complainant's representative and the Board cannot reach an agreement on the amount of attorney's fees or costs within 20 days of the Board's receipt of the verified statement and accompanying affidavit, the Board shall issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees or costs due within 30 days of receipt of the statement and affidavit. The decision of the Board shall include the specific reasons for determining the amount of the award. The complainant or the complainant's representative may file a request for review with the Commission of the Board's decision, and the Board's notice to the complainant and his or her representative shall include EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition.
