Results of the institute's random testing of water from private wells and reports of three foreign industrial consulting firms have confirmed alarming rates of organic-solvent contamination in the surrounding areas, institute officials said. Water in 18 of the 40 wells within a one-kilometer radius of the Taoyuan plant were found to be contaminated with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Tetrachloroethylene found in water samples taken from well No. 4 registered 210 parts per billion [ppb], which is 42 times higher than the government-allowed maximum of 5 ppb. Reports of the Bechtel Corp., which was contracted by Thomson Consumer Electronics Co. to investigate pollution at the RCA plant in 1990, showed that tetrachloroethylene in the plant's production wells was found to be at levels ranging from 10 parts per million [ppm] to 1,100 ppm, or 200,000 times higher than the allowed maximum. Thomson, a French-based firm, began using the RCA plant in 1988 after it secured the plant from the U.S.-based General Electric Co. [GE], which bought RCA in 1986. GE had hired the U.S. industrial consultant D&M Co. to do investigation possible contamination around the Taoyuan plant in 1988. The institute said that both GE and Thomson knew about the toxic waste but did not take preventive measures to offset any negative impacts, such as informing plant workers and residents in the neighborhood to refrain from drinking underground water in the area. Instead, the two companies chose to bury the contaminants in 11 wells at the Taoyuan plant and four wells at the Chupei plant. Eight other wells in the vicinity of the Chupei plant, now owned by Japanese-based Ushio Co. which produces halogen lamps, were also found contaminated with tetrachloroethylene, the institute said. The contaminants, however, could be derived from other sources, it said. Situated behind Ushio is Philips Taiwan, while Yuloong Styrofoam Co. lies opposite the Chupei plant. According to medical research data, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene may be carcinogenic and are damaging to the liver, heart, and central nervous system. The environmental protection administration has decided to speed up operations to enable tap water to be supplied to residents in the vicinity of the two plants from a source other than groundwater as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the construction affairs department of the Ministry of the Interior announced that it will freeze an application by the current owner of the Taoyuan plant to use the land for commercial or residential use rather than for industrial use.
