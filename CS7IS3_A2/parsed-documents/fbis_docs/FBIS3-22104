The former director general of the state-owned Latbiofarm pharmaceutical factory, Ilmars Penke, was convicted for grave abuse of service status and large scale keeping and trafficking narcotic drugs in acquisitive purposes. Penke was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with property confiscation, except his summer house. The charges on Penke's deputy, Vyacheslav Kulikov, were the same, his sentence is seven and a half years imprisonment with property confiscation. The third accomplice, the former central laboratory chief Janis Osis was convicted for three and a half years with property confiscation. The court maintained that Penke and Kulikov were driven by covetousness but Osis--by other personal motives. The Criminal Police Department was commissioned to destroy the material evidence of 1 million pills of amphetamine group stimulants of the central nervous system, which were produced illegally under the disguise of flu medicine. The defendants' defense lawyers said they would appeal. In total, Latbiofarm made 16 million pills of MDA amphetamine drug between July 14, 1992, and Dec. 1, 1992, against a contract with a Slovakian firm. Fifteen million, or 4.5 tons of the drug, were sent to Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under the shield name of remantadine. The German police detected more than 3 tons of MDA tablets in the city airport in December, 1992. One third of the pills was never found, police reports. The investigation proved that Penke and Kulikov received from the Slovakian Weinwurm & Co. firm 198,000 Dutch guilders and 196,500 German marks. Penke and Kulikov divided the money and kept it at home. At court, they testified that they would have used the resources to pay bonuses to workers. The convicted manufacturers deny their guilt saying they did not know they produced a narcotic drug. The court said the defendants had substantially undermined the international prestige of Latvia as an independent country.
