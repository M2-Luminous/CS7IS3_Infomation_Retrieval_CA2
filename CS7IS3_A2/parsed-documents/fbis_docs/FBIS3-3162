A number of laws and regulations have been stipulated in China since 1993 and the number of trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises have grown a lot, participants said. Trade unions have now been set up in 45 percent of the foreign- funded enterprises where they should be organized according to China's laws or regulations. In economic development zones, where foreign-funded enterprises are given some preferable policies, 60 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises have trade unions. Trade unions mediate labor disputes and give Chinese workers legal knowledge and technical training. Trade unions not only stimulate the production enthusiasm of workers and reduce labor friction but also help maintain normal operations of overseas investors' businesses, Yang Xingfu, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said at the conference. Trade unions should cooperate with foreign investors for better development of the enterprises while protecting workers' rights and interests, he said. Trade union leaders from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning and some development zones attended the meeting.
