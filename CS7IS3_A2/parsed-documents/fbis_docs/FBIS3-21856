The Seizure of 1,600 kg of mandrax tablets valued at Rs 2.5 crore, by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) from a godown at Gota village near Ahmedabad last week is an eye-opener. DRI officials also got the clue that the drug traffickers were operating systematically in the city. They had manufactured mandrax tablets outside the city and were using local agents for the distribution of the tablets in other parts of the State. Dr. Yusuf Merchant, honorary director of the Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation and Research Centre (DAIRRC) of Bombay, recently met about 10,000 drug addicts in Gujarat and Bombay during the course of their rehabilitation camps. The number of drug addicts in Gujarat has risen from 800 in 1989 to a staggering 70,000 in 1993. According to a survey conducted by DAIRRC, every year about 4,500 more people in the State are becoming drug addicts. About 400 drug addicts from the State had undergone treatment for de-addiction at DAIRRC in the last three years. About 5,000 cases of de-addiction have been registered with the Gujarat Kelavni Trust in the last five years. The DAIRRC survey said about 75,000 drug addicts belonged to four major cities. Out of this, Ahmedabad accounts for 30,000 cases, followed by Baroda 20,000, Surat 17,000 and Rajkot 13,000. Drug addiction has been detected among prisoners of the Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad, according to the survey made by the Gujarat Kelavni Trust, Dr Nathubhai Patel, honorary director of the trust," said "a day care centre" had been set up in the prison by the trust to study the drug addiction habits among the prisoners, social workers visit the jail once in a week to motivate the prisoners against falling prey to drug addiction.
