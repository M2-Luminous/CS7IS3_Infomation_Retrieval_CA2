FBIS4-66963 "jptdd019__l94025" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 25 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA HAITI Source Denies Involvement of Police Chief in Drug Trafficking Source Denies Involvement of Police Chief in Drug Trafficking FL2604004394 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 25 Apr 94 FL2604004394 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] A source close to the Haitian Army denies the accusations brought against the Haitian police chief, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. According to the charges, the police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel Taboada, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the [U.S. Senate] Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that he met Michel Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escobar in (Colombia). Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also participated in that meeting. The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, has pointed out that Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before [corrects himself] after he was commissioned. He went to the United States for proficiency courses in security. Since then, he has never gone abroad. How can Taboada assert that he met Col. Francois in 1984, our source wonders. Let us recall that upon the return of Col. Francois, he was appointed to the Corps of Heavy Vehicles [as heard] of the presidential guard at the National Palace.
