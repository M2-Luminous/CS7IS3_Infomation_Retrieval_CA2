Before, such loan-restructuring agreements were concluded annually. "An upcoming agreement is to significantly change the structure of Russia's foreign debt, bringing it in line with what the country can really afford to pay," says a statement, released by Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday. In early June, Moscow and the Paris Club signed an agreement, deferring payments on a 7-billion-dollar Russian debt. Payments will be evenly distributed over 8-17 years with a 3-year easy term. A senior Finance Ministry official reported to the Financial Information Agency that in subsequent negotiations with the Paris Club Moscow hopes to get a deferment for 1994 on the payment of yet another 20 billion dollars. Earlier, the Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin declared that to secure a long-term debt deferment accord Russia must agree with the IMF on an economic program, which, if negotiations succeed, could be backed up by an IMF Stand-by credit worth 4 billion dollars. Appropriate talks are expected in autumn this year. According to federal budget expenditures for 1994, Moscow is ready to repay a 4.1 billion dollars toward debts. The former USSR debts total 80 billion dollars, about 10 percent of which is Russia's part.
