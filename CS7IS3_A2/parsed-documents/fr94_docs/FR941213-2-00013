FR941213-2-00013 FR941213-2-00005 Best Information Available Potential exporters identified by MOFTEC failed to respond to our questionnaire. In the absence of responses from these and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the PRC country-wide rate on best information available (BIA). When a company refuses to provide information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to the company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation (see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Belgium, 58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993) (``Belgium Steel''). Since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning to all other PRC exporters the highest margin in the May 27, 1994, amendment to the petition. Critical Circumstances On November 23, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC. We did not receive the allegation in time to make a critical circumstance determination in this preliminary determination. However, we will make a preliminary determination with respect to critical circumstances no later than December 23, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(b)(2)(ii). Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination. Suspension of Liquidation For Gao Yao, we calculated a zero margin. Consistent with Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 55625, November 8, 1994), merchandise that is sold by Gao Yao but manufactured by other producers will not receive the zero margin. Instead, such entries will be subject to the ``All Others'' margin. In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacture/producer/exporter 1Margin (Percent) China National Overseas Trading Corp 37.48 Cli-Claque Company Ltd 7.03 Gao Yao (HK) Hua Fa Industrial Co., Ltd 10.10 Guangdong Light Industrial Products Import and Export Corp 35.08 PolyCity Industrial, Ltd 63.09 All others 197.85 1 De minimus. ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination.
