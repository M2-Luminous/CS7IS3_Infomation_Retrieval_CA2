A regional work conference on reforms of the economic structure was held in Lhasa 20 January. Yang Chuantang, Standing Committee member of the regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the regional government, put forward a five-point requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of this year's reforms in Tibet. Pudoje, vice chairman of the regional people's congress Standing Committee, and Jiang Cuo [3068 2238], executive vice chairman of the regional government, were present at the conference. Reviewing reforms of the economic structure in Tibet over the past 15 years, Yang Chuantang said in his speech: Like other parts of the country, Tibet initiated reforms of the economic structure in farming and pastoral areas, whereby the region has promoted and expedited economic restructuring as a whole. In recent years, we have actively reformed the planning system, striving to expand the fundamental role of markets in resource allocation; in reforming enterprises, we have readjusted the structure, delegated authority to enterprises and allowed them to retain profits, changed profit delivery to tax payment, introduced the contract system, and changed the operating mechanisms of enterprises; we have made relatively rapid progress in reforming the financial and taxation system; and we have scored initial successes in reforming government institutions, focusing on the transformation of functions. In addition, we have conducted a host of fruitful explorations in banking system reform, circulation system reform, ownership structure reform, and social security system reform. A review of Tibet's basic experiences in the 15-year reform shows that seizing opportunities for reform means seizing opportunities for development; and without making and expediting reforms, it is impossible to achieve and expedite development. Comrade Yang Chuantang put forward the following five-point requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of reforms in 1994: First of all, it is necessary to make reform the top priority of the region and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the regional economy. Leading cadres at all levels should keep a cool head, recognizing and facing squarely our backwardness and areas where we lag behind, and strengthening the intensity and accelerating the pace of reform. In the face of this historic opportunity, we must strive to push the regional economy to a new height and constantly build up our overall strength so as to keep up with the pace of national development. Second, it is necessary to effectively strengthen leadership over reform. As we will face more arduous tasks and higher demands of reform, party committees and governments at all levels should devote more energies to expediting reforms and carrying out their historic responsibility. To this end, party committees and governments at all levels should familiarize themselves with the guiding principles, basic ideas, specific content, and operational procedures of all reform measures in Tibet; and should work out well-conceived plans and make meticulous efforts to carry them out in an innovative way in the light of the realities of each locality or department. It is necessary to pay close attention to overall coordination of various reform measures, and to guard against contradictory policy measures and selfish departmental interests to the neglect of the overall situation. It is necessary to conduct investigations and study for solving new problems and circumstances in good time. It is also necessary to improve the legal system and raise its level of standardization. Third, it is necessary to emancipate our minds, strive to make innovations, and quicken the pace of establishing a new system. Leading cadres at all levels should make a sober estimate of the situation, emancipate the mind, be bold in practice, do a good job in carrying out pilot projects, strictly adhere to the criteria of the forces of production, concentrate efforts on innovative reform, and mobilize the masses in blazing a trail of building new systems with special characteristics. Fourth, it is necessary to improve the economic restructuring departments and go all out to closely coordinate all departments concerned in jointly completing the tasks of reform. Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as all departments, should provide manpower, materials, and financial resources for improving the economic restructuring departments, rationalizing relations with the departments and actively supporting their operation. Fifth, it is necessary to step up study and enhance quality to keep up with the demands of the new situation. In conclusion, the vice chairman urged leading cadres at all levels to study and master the basic law governing market economic operations by stepping up study, persisting in thinking over issues, earnestly conducting investigations and study, and constantly improving quality. He said: Party committees, governments, and economic restructuring departments at all levels, as well as all relevant departments, should create the essential conditions and conduct practical, diversified forms of training for improving the quality of cadres in Tibet. Xiao Huaiyuan, director of the regional economic research center, outlined six major tasks of economic restructuring in Tibet this year: First, continuing to implement the "Regulations for Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and "Procedures for Implementing the Regulations for Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People in Tibet Autonomous Region," and reinforcing work related to changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises; second, continuing to stabilize and perfect the party's basic policies in farming and pastoral areas and deepening reforms in these areas; third, accelerating the establishment of markets, focused on the nurturing of capital goods markets; fourth, ensuring a good job in reforming the fiscal and taxation, investment, and foreign trade systems, and expediting the establishment of macroeconomic control and regulatory mechanisms compatible with a market economy; fifth, deepening reform of the social security system and setting up social security organizations; and sixth, actively and yet prudently promoting urban housing reform. He pointed out: This year, reforms will be carried out in Tibet at a deeper level, in broader areas, and with an intensity and difficulty never seen before. Economic restructuring departments at all levels should diligently study various reform programs launched in the region and pay close attention to carrying them out.
