The traitor Kim Yong-sam, branding the struggle of students and people against the policy of rice market opening as "a radical violent demonstration", threatened that "an unequivocal and resolute stand" would be taken toward it. And the puppet home minister, Choe Hyong-u, said "torture is permissible in interrogating political prisoners." This is an open threat to the pro-democracy forces and a new directive to suppress all people opposed to the traitorous "government" with the fascist bayonet, notes the news analyst, and continues: It is only too natural that the South Korean people should fight to build a new world free from aggressor and traitor. They can by no means be a target of repression at the point of the bayonet. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has turned South Korea into a more terror-ridden pandemonium of fascism than the dictatorial "government" of the "Sixth Republic" and is wringing the neck of the people with such treachery as rice market opening. Why should the people sit idle as if dead? It is the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique that must be thrown behind bars in South Korea. The venomous remarks of the Kim Yong-sam group are a desperate fascist frenzy motivated by its fear of the ever-growing anti-puppet, anti-"government" struggle of the people. It is inevitable that the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique will encounter stronger resistance from the people.
