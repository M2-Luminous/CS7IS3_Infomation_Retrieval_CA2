In remarks to foreign journalists, the minister emphasized that Zionist pressure had neutralized the positive signals sent by the Geneva summit. Clinton, according to Salman, has one of two choices -- either defend U.S. interests in the region and thus put his career on the line, or give in to Zionist pressure and thereby forfeit America's credibility. Salman charged that Israel was out to exclude the United States from the region by convincing it that its interests are best served by Israel. He produced an American document titled Syrian-American Cooperation to Combat Drugs in Lebanon, in which the United States applauds Syria's anti-drug measures over the past few years. Syria, Salman said, was bewildered by the drug charges, especially seeing that it has been coordinating with the Americans in the fight against these poisons. The pressure on Syria, he maintained, is calculated to undermine its negotiating position and split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at the talks with Israel. Salman contended that drug abuse and trafficking in Syria are virtually nonexistent. He explained that drug traffickers in Syria receive the death sentence and abusers receive at least three years in prison. In contrast, the minister said, drug abuse and trafficking were widespread in the West, in particular in the United States. On another subject, the Syrian minister said that even if the Oslo agreement was implemented to the letter, it would fail to bring peace to the region. The terms of the agreement are such that the Palestinian people will be in a large jail. The Oslo agreement has strengthened opposition Palestinian factions and made them more popular inside and outside the occupied territories, Salman added. 'Arafat's unilateral agreement with Israel has had a negative impact inside the occupied territories. There have been a disproportionately high number of Palestinian casualties since the Oslo agreement, which he said had a clearly negative bearing on the Arab negotiating partners. The Syrian minister denied that there are relations between Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, and Syria. He stressed that Hamas' activities are restricted to the occupied territories and the group is working to liberate occupied Palestinian territory.
