As far as market establishment is concerned, the State Council has entrusted planning departments with such responsibilities as guiding and promoting the establishment of a national market system; and formulating plans, overall strategies of, and major regulatory policies for the development of key markets across the country. Based on investigations and studies, the State Planning Commission has shaped its basic strategies in drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan and programs for nurturing and developing a market system for 2010. Main features of these basic strategies, which have been submitted to the ongoing national market work exchange conference for discussion, are: 1) to take circulation as an industry to reverse the sluggish and backward conditions encountered in developing China's circulation industry; 2) to prioritize service to both agriculture and peasants, paying special attention to the reform of the circulation system for agricultural producer goods and the establishment of rural markets; 3) to better serve urban and rural residents through availability of more living facilities; 4) to take advantage of regional superiority -- particularly superiority enjoyed by the central and western regions -- so as to gradually narrow the gap between the coastal and the central and western regions through nurturing and developing regional markets; and 5) to stress linking of domestic markets -- particularly factors of production and high-level markets -- with international markets, amid protection and promotion of development of national industry and commerce. Hao Jianxiu, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, presented the conference with a report entitled, "Try Hard To Create a New Situation in Market Work To Accelerate Fostering and Development of a Socialist Market System." Centering on speeding up nurturing and developing a market system, the meeting will focus its discussions on such questions as planning strategies for a market system, establishment of a major commodities reserve system, and market information networks.
