Ambassador Traian Chebeleu went on to read a statement on the so-called invitation to Romania's president from representatives of certain political parties, in which the president is to be summoned before Parliament. After reasserting that the president will appear before Parliament as often as necessary but solely according to procedures stipulated by the Constitution, Chebeleu said that President Ion Iliescu had initiated actions for new consultations with the leaders of the parliamentary parties. Currently, presidential advisers are engaged in negotiations with the leaders of certain political parties to establish a convenient time for the resumption of the head of state's talks with the parties. The spokesman also told the journalists that Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who is currently on a visit to Poland, conveyed a message from President Ion Iliescu to Polish President Lech Walesa. In this the head of the Romanian state accepts an invitation to visit Poland, noting that there is a good chance that this visit will take place this year. To a journalist's question, Chebeleu replied that the parliamentary strike initiated by the Democratic Convention of Romania represents the members of Parliament's abandonment of their responsibilities toward the electorate and a generalization of a method that has already been used by some parliamentary groups, namely to leave the hall when certain laws are being passed. Referring to the events in Cluj-Napoca, generated by the archaeological diggings in the area where the statue of Matthias Corvinus is situated, the spokesman said that President Iliescu had suggested to the Cluj mayor that he organize discussions with all the local factors, thus avoiding any escalation of tension in the region, which is viewed by Chebeleu as being artificial. He also added that lately an excessive politicization of certain gestures and actions could be observed and expressed his belief that the situation in Cluj could be solved calmly, after listening to all the sides involved in the dispute, our correspondents informed us.
