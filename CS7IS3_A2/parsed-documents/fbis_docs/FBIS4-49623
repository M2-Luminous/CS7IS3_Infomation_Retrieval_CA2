"We were told that two or three more applications could be available if needed," Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told newsmen Saturday [7 May] morning. Li said he received a phone call from Liu Gangqi, deputy secretary-general of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), saying Beijing has approved the entry of 40 Taiwan reporters, up from the previous quota of 30. SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of official contacts. Liu was quoted as saying that the mainland authorities are limiting the number of reporters because of transportation difficulties. The increase in the number of reporters has been perceived as a concession by Beijing to improve its image following a protest by Taipei on Friday. Mainland security authorities have accused three suspects of arson, robbery and murder in the March 31 crime and arrested a fourth suspect. Meanwhile, H.Y. Hsu, SEF deputy secretary-general, is scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Hangzhou on Sunday. The group will comprise the victims' relatives, forensic experts, and SEF staffers.
