FBIS4-15353 "drsov068cc_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS Intelligence Service: Baltics Treated Same as Europe Intelligence Service: Baltics Treated Same as Europe LD0604162194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1416 GMT 6 Apr 94 LD0604162194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] [Text] In contrast to CIS countries against which Russia does not wage any intelligence operations, Russia's Intelligence Service treats the Baltic states as any other European countries, the press secretary of the Intelligence Service Director Tatyana Samolis declared in her interview with Interfax on Wednesday. She voiced a supposition that the Federal Counterintelligence Service Director Sergey Stepashin, who declared at the scientific-practical conference in Moscow that the Eastern European countries as well as the former Soviet republics "make their intelligence activity against Russia more active," primarily meant the Baltic states. Samolis underlined that "Russia's tactics with respect to the Baltic states will be a corresponding one in case Russia's interests demand this." At the same time she specially noted that "if Russia does not wage intelligence operations in CIS countries it does not mean that it is not interested in the processes going on there." "In 1992 eight CIS states signed an agreement prohibiting intelligence activity against each other. Nevertheless, Russian intelligence follows the situation by all available means, including special ones, -- said Samolis. They include information collection via the third countries and analysis of open sources. For example, we receive part of the information about Tajikistan from Afghanistan. Russia's leadership does not remain without any analysis of the processes taking place in CIS countries."
