Melisa Soto has more details. [Soto] The Third Tax Disputes Court, presided by Judge Orlando Sarti, made the surprising decision after lawyer Rafael Balled Mardeni filed last Thursday a Constitutional amparo petition requesting the suspension of the IVA implementation. The lawyer felt the IVA implementation violates Articles 223 and 49 of the Constitution, as it undermines the rights of Venezuelan citizens since they are not duly informed about the implementation of the IVA. In the lawyer's opinion, this has lead to great confusion among the people and total anarchy on the part of merchants when they collect this tax. [Begin recording] [Balled] I sincerely feel we have prevented a mass uprising like the one that took place on 27 February, because there is no way to stop the merchants' abuses in collecting this tax from the people. [Soto] Do you not think this situation may cause greater confusion among the people. [Balled] Not at all. Henceforth, the government will have to properly inform the people about the tax, something they have to do now because of the amparo petition filed, and everybody will immediately stop paying IVA. [Soto] How long will the temporary suspension last? [Sarti] It is no secret people have been paying IVA since last year, although the law and its regulations stated it was going to enter into effect on 1 January 1994. It is no secret people have been paying it since last year. This has been true anarchy. As for a timetable.... [pauses] the court did not give the government a timetable, because it felt that the Executive Branch's wisdom, or rather that the government's wisdom may be reflected in whether it takes a long or short time in implementing a good information campaign of what this tax should be, namely, the people should be able to understand it. [end recording] [Soto] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] Senator Cristobal Fernandez intervened as a witness in this suit. [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We warned from the start that because this is a regressive and unjust tax it would be an unbearable burden on low-income groups and that ultimately it does not provide a solution to close the fiscal gap, which is what the government sought with it. We believe the next congress must establish a new tax collection system and a broader tax reform, which puts the burden on large income and luxury goods and avoids imposing such a heavy burden on the people of Venezuela. [end recording] [Soto] It is worth noting that any merchant who, starting at 1100 on Thursday, continues to collect IVA will commit an offense that may be punishable with jail. Upon learning of the ruling by the Third Tax Disputes Court suspending the IVA, Finance Ministry Adviser Alcides Villalba stressed the Constitutional amparo does not suspend the tax, so it will continue to be collected. [Pereira] Villalba added the amparo petition will be appealed if it is made official, since the Court has not handed the ruling to the Finance Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, or the Comptroller General's Office. In his opinion, this ruling only serves to confuse the people since some people refuse to pay this tax. Villalba stated the amparo brings about a suspension when it refers to other cases, but since this is a tax measure the amparo does not have this effect. This is an individual not a collective amparo, he noted, adding it cannot be carried out. He also said the survival of the Venezuelan State depends on the IVA. [Begin recording] [Villalba] As I understand it, based on news media reports, many of them reliable and others not so.... [Unidentified speaker, interrupting] It may be disinformation. [Villalba] Based on disinformation, the judge said there is widespread misinformation. I would ask the judge if he reads the newspapers. This has been in the media. This problem has been under discussion in this country for three years. [end recording] [Pereira] The Finance Ministry representative said this is a political decision, and if it had come at another time, he would have thought the purpose was to destabilize the government. Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said the IVA implementation is not a whim of the Executive Branch since it responds to the reforms to the tax system that have been under study for almost four years. He added the new tax is necessary to control the fiscal deficit that has been worsening the country's economic and social situation year after year. [Begin Velasquez recording] The IVA is a fiscal necessity. I want to explain that the government I have been leading since June did not invent it. It was part of a modernization program of the Venezuelan fiscal system, which had been agreed on since 1989. Along with the other laws that became part of the special powers law, the Congress was unable to approve them for basically political reasons. My government took on the responsibility of promulgating those laws. The state's fiscal deficit is profoundly harming the situation in Venezuela, because it leads to a permanent devaluation of the bolivar due to inflation and to this enormous social cost that 20 million Venezuelans are paying. Let us not say 20 million, rather 18 million Venezuelans; two million persons are not suffering. The oil revenues keep coming in, but it is no longer sufficient to meet all the requirements of the state, which has to pay 1.2 million public employees and state employees protected by collective agreements and which has the obligation to maintain health, education, public security, and road services and to maintain the equipment of the Armed Forces. We must find other fiscal resources that will, among other things, make it possible to lower the fiscal deficit, and -- this is something the government that will take office in 28 days will do -- seek other income formulas and resources that will make it possible to lower that deficit in one, two, or three years.
