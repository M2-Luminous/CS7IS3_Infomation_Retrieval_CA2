"Debts must be paid," he said, meaning the 220 billion ruble debt of television companies to the Ministry of Communications. At the same time Viktor Chernomyrdin said that it is necessary "to sort out to whom and how we broadcast." He believes that not all programs should be broadcast on state channels. The head of the Russian Cabinet did not rule out that in very near future a number of channels and TV studios may be privatized or sold off. Chernomyrdin expressed doubt in the necessity to continue the practice of broadcasting on all channels until 0300. "There should be broadcasting, but not on all channels," the premier underlined.
