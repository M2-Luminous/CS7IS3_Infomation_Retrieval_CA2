"The annual quota for allowable tree-felling must be strictly observed and all activities involving logging, transporting and processing of wood must be conducted under licences," the government announced. China's boom in construction and development has led to a worrisome imbalance between logging and new growth in the nation's forests, the statement warned. The supply of mature timber is almost exhausted, it was noted. Legal and administrative units of the government may not engage in such activities, the government said. Some inspections will be launched later this year to help implement the Forest Law and relevant regulations, according to the circular issued by the State Council, the country's highest governing body. All violations of the Forest Law and regulations, such as clear-cutting forests, illegally occupying woodlands and indiscriminate hunting of wildlife, will be severely punished, it said. Violations rose 16 percent last year, compared with 1992, said an official from the Ministry of Forestry. Large profits from trading in timber -- in short supply on the market -- attracted more people and even government departments to engage in the business, noted the official, who declined to be identified. Some culprits, often armed with weapons, had attacked forest keepers and looted timber from tree farms. Last year, 31 forest keepers and officials working at timber checkpoints were killed, and another 1,200 were wounded, according to the official. Booming construction and industrial development zones also consumed large amounts of woodland. Some local governments, ignoring the Forest Law and relevant regulations, occupied forest-land for other use without approval from authorities or sold woodland at very low prices in order to attract outside investment for industrial development. As a result, some 450,000 hectares of woodland was lost annually for various kinds of development programme or construction, said the official. In a bid to curb such unchecked tree-felling and to keep a balance between timber growth and consumption, the central government has since 1987 required licenses and implemented quotas for logging. Despite such measures, the quota was exceeded every year, the official noted. Although China has increased its forest coverage to current 13.9 percent from 12.9 percent of national territory five years ago, its mature timber is nearly exhausted, with only about 1.96 billion cubic metres left.
