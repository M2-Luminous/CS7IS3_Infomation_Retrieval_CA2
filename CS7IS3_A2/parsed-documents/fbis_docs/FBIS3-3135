And the system should also be managed through various forms and by managerial professionals, executives of the Daqing Petroleum Administration, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory and the Anshan Iron and Steel Works said. The reform of state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a new modern enterprise system are one of the pivotal and catchy juncture in China's reform of its economic structure as well as a "hot spot" of the ongoing second session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). As deputies, executives of the three industrial giants are attending the session. NPC deputies from enterprises have unanimously agreed that the establishment of a modern enterprise system is the fundamental way to invigorate China's large and medium-sized enterprises but the process will be "big project" and hard efforts are needed. After a dozen years of experiments, China has finally charted the orientation of establishing such a system for state-owned enterprises, featured by a clear definition of property rights, explicit responsibility and rights, separation of administration and enterprise management and a scientific management. Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing city and deputy director of the Daqing Petroleum Administration, said the establishment of a modern enterprise system lies in the introduction of a new property rights system or a system of property rights of enterprises as legal entities to separate investor rights of the owners and property rights of enterprises as legal entities. This would help rid the state of its boundless responsibilities for enterprises which stems from the dilemma of the status quo. In the status quo, operators are not legally liable though they are legal persons. As one of the country's mainstay enterprises in the basic industry, Daqing is willing to be selected to lead the industry in introducing the new system on a trial basis. In line with the policies mapped out at the third plenary session of the 14th Communist Party Central Committee late last year, mainstay enterprises in pillar industries are encouraged to introduce a shareholding system with state controlling a lion's share of the shares while allowing collective or individual capital to make up the rest. The Daqing oilfield has contributed half of the country's oil production since 1976 when its production bit the 50 million-ton mark. Unlike the Daqing oilfield, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Plant has already begun the experiment of the shareholding system and has basically completed an inventory and check of the stockpiles and capital of the enterprise. This year the plant is expected to complete the transition from the current structure to a three-tiered corporation structure: parent corporation, share-controlling company and subsidiary companies. To ensure the smooth transition, Geng Zhaojie, director of the plant, is now also the chairman of the board of directors of the First Automobile Group Corporation. Geng said, one of the effective approaches to establish the modern enterprise system is to decide who represent the state to manage the assets. What enterprises are worried about most in this regard is the trusting of government departments as representatives of the state-owned assets to manage the enterprises, Geng said. The outcome of the trusting will make it impossible for enterprises as legal entities to hold the responsibility for property rights. In his personal view, his parent corporation should be in the position to represent the state to manage and operate state-owned assets. Geng's view seems to be a common acknowledgement among entrepreneurs that investor companies, share-controlling companies or large enterprise groups using state fund as its main source of capital, can serve as representatives of state-owned assets, rather than government departments, in the form of legal entities. With an annual turnout of 240,000 cars, trucks and other vehicles, the No. 1 Automobile Plant is now ranked among the 500 biggest enterprises in the world. The plant is planning to manufacture one million vehicles by the year of 2005. Li Huazhong, general manager of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, calls for diverse forms of modern enterprise system. He said the representatives of the state-owned assets should be made up by professionals in enterprise management in the capacity of "members of the board of directors" or "supervisors". Leading the industry in the country, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works produced more than 8.5 million tons of iron and steel products last year. The works began experimenting the shareholding system as early as 1986 and so far has established several subsidiary companies in its efforts to find jobs for surplus laborers.
