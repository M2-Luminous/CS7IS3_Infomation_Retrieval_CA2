That view was expressed by Jack Segal, the consul general from the United States, on his arrival in Omsk. A U.S. consulate opened nearly two months ago in Yekaterinburg -- the only one in central Russia thus far -- with Segal as its head. The U.S. diplomat was the first of his colleagues to come to the city on the Irtysh, visiting several industrial enterprises and the pedagogical and medical higher educational establishments as well as Omsk Oblast's Bolsherechenskiy Rayon. Jack Segal had a meeting with Omsk Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev. The consul promised to inform the U.S. Embassy and American business circles of the potential of the region's industry and to help establish business contacts. In Jack Segal's opinion, only a stable political and economic situation in Russia can promote the emergence and strengthening of such contacts in the first instance. This may also explain the fact that many foreign firms, having signed a considerable number of protocols with major industrial enterprises in Omsk, are in no hurry to complete the matter; which, indeed, causes some skepticism among the people of Omsk.
