At the center of attention: the Home Guard. But not it alone... One must agree with Defense Forces Commander D. Turlais's statement that right now the threats to the independence and security of the Latvian state are greater than the ability to thwart them (interview in the newspaper LABRIT, 26 January of this year, "A Running Officer Provokes Laughter in Peacetime".) Previously (RIGAS BALSS, 4 January) I wrote "The Quiet, Merciless War" about the growth in Russia's legal activities related to the withdrawal of military forces from our country. We must return to these themes yet again, first of all because the government has finally seemingly recognized the priority of national defense and also the Saeima has approved supplementary sums for these needs. But this money will provide only evil if serious endeavors are not undertaken to clean up defense organizations. The complicated state defense system can be simplified in the classical way by thinking of it as a tiered fortress defense, in which the first line of defense is manned by diplomats, the second by ideology, the third by national industry; the fourth, though, is the fortress itself, that is the national military defense forces. If the first three lines of defense spend their time in uninterrupted struggles which the founder of military theory, Clausewitz, reminds us that peacetime is only imaginary, then defense forces in this time carry out only the role of catalyst. In an active battle they would be drawn in and their direct functions will be carried out only in time of military conflict, therefore in the event of final necessity, when the first three lines of defense have not achieved what is desired. Of course, the meaning and arrangement of these lines of defense varies from country to country. For example, in the over-militarized Russia, all defense is based almost entirely on the military complex and that dominates the diplomatic, psychological, industrial and other spheres. In such a country the diplomat Kozyrev or the politician Zhirinovskiy can afford to explore openly armed provocations; their national defense will not suffer from it, for that is guaranteed by a giant army, armed with weapons of mass destruction, and the consequences of their use scientists can only predict, but not precisely calculate. There are similar defense systems in all of the militarized great powers except Japan and Germany. The latter was not permitted by the victorious countries to develop a new Wehrmacht after its capitualation in 1945 and it now is seriously reviewing its defense doctrine. Similar defense issues are being resolved also in the war-vanquished Japan. Such a model of defense, which was forced on Japan and Germany, but on smaller countries because of meager resources, cannot protect and they came to establish a total defense system, in which all lines of defense flowed together in a seemingly amorphous formation, though actually each insignificant basic organization is subordinated in coordinated action from one center. The exceptions are the defense forces, which stand as a discrete organization carrying out training, supply, and the aforementioned coordination functions. That is a description of an ideal type, in which there would not be also military defense forces, but all the country's defense problems would be resolved by "public defense," which was offered as an alternative to the military by Albert Einstein Institute senior researcher J. Sharp in his speech at the symposium, "New Thinking About European Security." (It is known in Latvia in an expanded version as the brochure, "Defense of Independent Countries Without War and Destruction.") But Mr. Sharp should have known that science and philosophy would permit such an ideal--absolute harmony--only as a momentary pause, after which the rapid slide downward begins, so that the concrete process begins anew, a difficult ascent, but of a different quality. And that is a sufficient basis to conclude that "public defense" alone can never be an alternative to a military. If we truly want to defend ourselves, then we can only go down this road of plenty and there is no alternative. It becomes clear from the D. Turlais interview that Latvia still does not have a national defense doctrine, since the Defense Ministry must analyze potential threats to our country. But what should be the relationship between this analysis and the working out of the basic law on national defense? National defense cannot be implemented for just some individual event, but must be effective against any, often sudden and unforeseen type of attack. This defense force "umbrella law" must determine, according to a defense system developed according to some model, how we will arrive at the end result and how that will be integrated, first of all, with the Baltic states' mutual defense system. Two years have passed since the renewal of the country's independence. Yet, we still have no laws nor doctrines. But there have been no changes made in the composition of Defense Ministry personnel. And, if that has not yet been done, then there is a basis for thinking that in the Defense Ministry they are not exerting themselves by sitting on eggs that will never hatch, and that the empty nest-egg should be taken out. But, if we are talking about threats to our national security, then it would be interesting to know the conclusions of such a competent analysis regarding which is more dangerous: the activities of Zhirinovsky's without political anesthesia, self-declared, Russian "Derzhavniki" [Statists], or the masked "Western expansion," and what might be the defense against each of these events? Everybody knows the facts about the transfer of many millions of dollars, which the Central Committee of the CPSU donated to the Communist parties they maintained in various countries, not to fund picnics, but to maintain the dirty deals and destructive actions connected with associated companies in these countries. But now, right in front of our eyes, innumerable foreign companies with dubious reputations are establishing here practically uncontrollable foreign joint ventures, including Russian and local self-seekers. And all of the negative by-products of this process show that the characteristics of those activities are the same as those for which some USSR Communist party paid such collosal sums in the West. Just on 10 January of this year the conflict in Riga's Vidzeme borough plainly showed that making contact with with such puzzling organizations will be much more dangerous than the Skrunda radar remaining and that a whorehouse established by some foreign country's military personnel (their existence at their respective addresses is news to the municipal authorities) could give rise to a military conflict fateful to the country. These facts alone already create the belief that our government's publicized "Western investment" in Latvia is nothing more than the same Communist money flooding in through the West. And the apparent sharp disagreement provoked by the East serves only to deflect attention from this, our country's truly dangerous process. Although in Russia it has been even officially announced that for political purposes gigantic sums will flood into Latvia. It is clear that the delay in working out the basic law on national defense connects the Defense Forces commander and his actions in the work of the existing headquarters and creates chaos in subordination of defense forces, thereby directing them down the path of degradation. National defense cannot be developed today by fitting it to some personality or situational flow, but we must proceed in accordance with the law, in developing a concrete defense system. And we will immediately see where such unnecessary delay takes us. Today it is clear to every somewhat thinking person that Latvia's defense cannot be ensured by barbed wire fences and minefields on the country's borders, nor could it be done with a Maginot or Mannerheim line. Only the aforementioned seemingly amorphous national total defense formation can create the threat of unacceptable casualties to an invader and cool the heads of warriors. If we accept that right now the worries about our security are directly related to Russia's behavior, then Russia's critical demographic characteristic right now still shows that the former popular and military mass is not there any more and so this factor cannot be depended on. The most appropriate defense to develop in a modern state was the Home Guard. Correctly organized, well trained, armed and supplied, it could have become the basis for such a defense. But at that time, contrary to the accepted standards of defense development, it was not subordinated to the Defense Ministry and the supreme command of the Defense Forces. And what is happening there now? In the training for the officers of the Riga Home Guard brigade in October, company commanders spent a whole week learning how to determine proper protocol for a completely woozy person, that it is humane to hit someone sleeping on the street in the nose, to make it bleed, because without bleeding and some apparent trauma medics simply will not take this person and he will freeze, and that car theft does not qualify as theft, because such a crime is missing an "objective side." They clarified still others of the Russian criminal code demagogic absurdities actually in force and the militia's acquired tricks. And such training is paid for, so, as was said on television, more will be carried out! Theorists of revolutionary wars and practice prove that organizations established according to voluntary principles, such as our Home Guard, can have only one task: to protect the people and the country. Losing that, it disintegrates with the tendency of individual groupings to develop new or to integrate themselves with already existing criminal character organizations. Thus the world-renowned Italian mafia, "la Cosa Nostra," developed from the self-defense organizations of Sicily's inhabitants. Totalitarian regimes did not permit the existence of organized crime without state sanction (the coming into existence of those is one of the surest weaknesses of the regime and symptoms of imminent collapse), therefore after carrying out their assignment these organizations are simply liquidated. Thus totalitarian regimes liquidated the Oprichniki, the early Chekha, the Istrebiteli, Rem's Shturmoviki in Red Russia, and the Red Guards--the implementors of the "Cultural Revolution" in China. This same destruction theory and practice is safely and effectively used by psychological warfare specialists and parallel to the chief task in these organizations or popular movements with patriotic motivation brings in some side assignment or responsibility. With that division, the organization is innoculated with the virus and its movement in the main direction is practically halted. A glaring example of this sort of invasion is found in the actions of the Supreme Council, etc. The people who joined the Home Guard were patriots, and in the beginning it was organized to protect Latvia's independence. But now at such a critical time to the country, it is obviously being shifted to carrying out police auxilliary service functions! Thus, it is on the road to degradation and disintegration! One of the characteristics of revolutionary war tactics, to influence the enemy in the most painful way possible, is the fourth thesis formulated by Mao Zedong: "Concentrate in every battle on superior enemy forces." This thesis must be understood to mean that by pretending to rob banks, telegraph centrals and other objects one achieves their stationary guard. And, the more objects that are guarded, and the larger numerically are the guard units, the more beneficial the situation will be for the attackers. A well-planned operation in such an instance will involve a numerically small, well-prepared group of men, who can destroy many numerically large guard units in a few hours. Working out countermeasures to such tactics the German military specialist E. Vorwerk wrote: "One must have the perimeters of objects guarded by those who have a stake in saving the country. For the most part the existing protected objects and sensitive points must be locked together in object groups, which are close together, and they must be protected by roving patrols, but at irregular times." And what is our Home Guard occupied with right now? Chiefly with the stationary protection of companies able to pay to protect themselves! It is hard to believe that that is out of ignorance or circumstance; it is more logical to conclude that the Home Guard is deliberately being prepared in conformance with the aforementioned scheme or even without pretend robberies and noises, with the help of the same aforementioned Communist party money. An increase in funding from the state budget for the Home Guard in such a situation will only promote it as the collapse of the national defense organizations. And that is why it is without resistance subordinated to the Defense Ministry and the Defense Forces command, no matter how powerless and undeveloped this ministry is right now. The experience of Lithuania and Estonia is that with such a merging of defense forces protests from some Home Guard commanders or even units could be anticipated. But that will only prove that it is not in their own personal interest to subordinate themselves to anyone and it will clearly show how productive were the activities of the rotting invaders of the the Home Guard. Both the Defense Forces and the Home Guard still are short of weapons. We are talking here about the most basic soldier's armaments: mortars, grenades, machine guns, automatic rifles, flame throwers, etc. That must be labeled as particularly illogical because producing these weapons is simple in reality. The experience of war indicates that producing them without particular difficulty can be begun in a week's time wherever there are general-purpose metalworking tables. Latvia has enough specialists and all the prerequisites for light weapon production. In its place they open a monopoly company store, where Home Guardsmen must use their personal resources to acquire pistols and carbines, but not the automatic weapons needed for defending the country. In addition, even these limited arms end up in the hands of civilians who have money and a personal interest. No one in the government has shown any interest in weapons so essential to national defense, such as mortars, grenades and automatic rifles, and none of the Riga Home Guard batallions have any of that. One must must be severely limited to be unable to understand what kind of policies and from what quarters it comes! Production and sale of battlefield weapons is one of the most profitable businesses in any country and in the current situation it cannot be allowed to be managed by a private company. Such action will permit store proprietors to skim off public money intended for national defense needs into their own pockets, and state control over this branch would be lost. The battle readiness of the army, including the Home Guard, is determined by three factors. "If one of them is zero or only at a low level, then the level of battle readiness, irrespective of the strength of the other indicators, will not exceed the level of the lowest factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, then the remaining determinants of battle readiness cannot save you." For the sake of clarity in his interview Mr. Turlais should have expressed this axiom to its end, that is, "A government that sends into battle unarmed soldiers, is a criminal one." Completely puzzling in the interview are the Defense Forces commander's statements about the functions of the Defense Ministry, it activities and his relationship with this institution. In reality and also in essence, the Defense Forces commander also is a member of the government and democracy would not tolerate it if the supreme commander would also be the Minister and the Defense Ministry did not exist. The division of power principle would not change by that. Defense ministries were established in the highly organized countries to free defense force commanders from all the ancillary duties, such as supplies, finance and other similar questions and so they coiuld effectively resolve only one assignment: the military defense of the country. In addition, by establishing a total model of national defense, all civilian spheres are included and the defense ministry must resolve problems associated with it. Here, too, issues of a military character remain within the competence of the supreme commander. One can imagine what kind of defense that would be in war time, if military operations were planned by a civilian ministry and the commander received those plans the evening before the battle. In his ignorance the staggering officer will be no better than the running one to whom D. Turlais referred. And, freeing ourselves from Soviet thinking, we must still understand how to avoid falling into the trench of helplessness. The Defense Forces commander is and must be the person who has the final word in all military questions, within the national defense policy confines determined by the Saeima and Constitution, of course. And such a commander will have the recognition and support of the people.
