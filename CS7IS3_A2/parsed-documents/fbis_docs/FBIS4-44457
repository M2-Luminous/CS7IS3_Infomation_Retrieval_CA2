This is true. In recent years China has greatly developed its economy, a development that has been the focus of world attention; at the same time it has also made a big sacrifice of its traditional morals. Some of them deserved to be sacrificed and should have been sacrificed. For example, the birth concept of "there are three things that are unfilial, and to have no posterity is the greatest of them"; the marriage concept of "a woman must be faithful to one husband all her life"; the economic concept of "the gentleman does not manage money matters, and the scholar does not engage in commerce"--etc. But there are some concepts that do not deserve to be sacrificed and should not be sacrificed. For example, the major misplacement of the concepts of honor and disgrace has already endangered the entire nation's moral system, and this requires a high degree of attention and vigilance on our part. Misplacement of concepts of advanced and backward. Now, in the eyes of many people, being backward is not disgraceful and being advanced is not honorable. It is hard to be an advanced person: People do not like to do advanced deeds or speak advanced things. Some people hide the good deeds they do, fearing that if the deeds were known they would be the target of other people's freezing irony and biting satire. In the sixties, whoever found a wallet and returned it to its owner would win everybody's respect; today, whoever did this would be considered by people to be a "fool." In the sixties a "living Lei Feng" was an honorific; now, in many situations it has become a term of disparagement. If someone, irrespective of remuneration, does something to help the public good, someone else will mock him with a sneer: "Are you a living Lei Feng who is studying and using Mao Zedong Thought?" A "living Lei Feng" has become a synonym for someone who is foolish and stupid and who does not make money and is not good at gaining his own interests. It is precisely those people who haggle over every penny and who are insatiable whom, on the contrary, are looked upon by everybody as capable, skilled, and having a head for economics. Even mischievous people who do not abide by law or discipline, who do not obey leaders, and who "curse the mother while sucking the breast" have actually become heroes in the eyes of many people. Backward people no longer fear other people's criticism of their backwardness. If one of them is called a "backward element," his face does not turn red with embarassment, and he could, not without some pride, ask in return: "Advanced element, do you have money?" Misplacement of civilized behavior and ignorant behavior. Smoking and spitting anywhere in a public place are clearly uncivilized acts, and to strengthen the supervision and control over them is, without a doubt, correct. However, in bus and train stations, markets, cinemas and theaters, and even street corners, some people are often observed spitting anwhere they like and smoking indiscriminately, and they are not educated or fined by control personnel. Public opinion on the scene is often unfavorable to the controller while being sympathetic and supportive of those who disobey the controllers. It is also natural that car drivers who break the law by running red lights, not fastening safety belts, and not parking in designated places should be educated and fined. But public opinion on the scene always sides with the lawbreaker, and generally likens the police to "dogs trying to catch mice"--too meddlesome. Some people do not care for their elders when the latter are alive, but give them elaborate funerals when they die, commiting a lot of property to the flames and even burning Renminbi as an offering to the dead. Their behavior is extremely benighted, and is regarded by people as filial piety carried to a ridiculous extreme... and so on and so forth. Misplacement of thrift and extravagance. Thrift is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, but at times it seems to have become a synonym for the "small peasant's economic mentality." Extravagance is generally acknowledged as stylish and daring. The news media has even admired and publicized "golden banquets," "schools for aristocrats," as well as high-spending, lavish styles of consumption. For a considerably long period of time, when we publicize the excellent situation in the rural areas we will talk about how the peasants compare each other's wealth, which symbolizes the "soft" criteria for a peasant's wealth -- "nutrition in eating, smartness in clothes, and high quality in what is used," publicizing the starting up of markets and the stimulation of economic development by means of high consumption. The formulation "being thrifty and economical is a virtue" has already almost been forgotten. The tenet "being economical" means being incompetent and that one should stage "luxurious" scenes derive from the concept that "poverty is shameful and wealth is honorable." Therefore, some people, even if heavily in debt, have to slap their own faces and compare themselves to other people in what they eat, wear, and use. Those who are officials compare their sedans, housing, and .... Misplacement of honesty and dishonesty. Because of the objectively existing phenomenon of "flogging the fast cows," officials in some places have taken the lead in hiding the truth about output value, hiding the truth about interest and taxes, and would rather for a long period of time wear the label of being officials of "a county in sore straits," so as to get subsidies from the higher authorities. Therefore, in the view of some people, officials of "counties in sore straits" have been "blue skies"--just judges--and leaders who have thrown off the label of "a county in sore straits" have, on the contrary, become people "who sell out the county to seek honor." Because they want "to dispense rewards or honors according to merit," many people falsely report output values, calculate unhatched chicken eggs as live chickens that count as peasant income, and calculate overstocked rejects in warehouses as the year's output value. Afterward they divide up the bonuses and don the hat of an official. When personnel changes are made and it is found out that the funds available cannot pay the debts, then the state-owned enterprise becomes an empty shell. Fake commodities, fake receipts, fake diplomas, fake professional titles--fake people and fake things can be found everywhere, and the extent of a disaster, based on need, is at will magnified or minimized. When cheating in this manner, already people's faces do not change colar and they are not flustered. A popular rhyme in society is: "Honesty is not worth a penny. If you joke and lie you will win a prize every year." Misplacement of law-abiding and lawbreaking. In their economic activity, some places advocate "a policy of using feet and using talk," and go on to promote the slogans "Dare to run a red light" and "Dare to hit an edge ball [a table tennis term]" and make them experiences to popularize. The illegal evasion of taxes is shameful, but now many people think it is honorable, to such an extent that the phenomenon of corporate tax evasion has become an open secret. For example, signboards of false "three kinds of enterprises" are hung out, signboards of false "handicapped persons welfare enterprises" are hung out, in order to enjoy the benefits of tax reduction or exemption. After tax evaders are investigated and prosecuted, there are constant intercessions for them. The Qing government once, because it had given up its customs control rights to foreigners, was reviled by all the people in the country, and this was regarded by later generations as a great national humiliation. Now, many local officials openly propose that smuggling be made the new growing point of the economy. Even smuggling under armed protection. Using the armed forces to deal with one's own customs for the purpose of having lawbreaking foreign businessmen drive right in one's national gatge precisely matches the idiom "throwing the door open for a thief." If this shameful act is regarded by some people as a magnificent feat, then "the gauze cap will be carried away," there will be a deep feeling of being wronged, and people will think that whatever one does is for the purpose of becoming an official and making money. Misplacement of uncorrupt and corrupt. The practice of entertaining guests and sending presents, which is now in vogue in society, is generally acknowledged as a necessary "emotional investment." Sending presents as bribes is clearly corrupt behavior, but everybody thinks that if one does not pocket the bribe then one is not corrupt; wining and dining on a large scale is clearly corrupt behavior, but it is said "if one only eats but does not bring, then politics takes command"; and receiving sales commissions is clearly corrupt behavior, but now it is widely accepted by the common people. If a sales commission is for public use, the person receiving it will be commended. Therefore, the image of bing completely uncorrupt has already changed to that of being inflexible, rigid, and conservative; and much corrupt behavior has become examples of daring to charge ahead, daring to take risks, and daring to open up. Misplacement of righteousness and wickedness. In recent years the news media have repeatedly carried reports of evildoers committing in broad daylight physical assault, murder, rape, and robbery. In addition, in places where there are more people, there is more news about evildoers, and the more people there are who are armed the more the victims are isolated and cut off from help. There are also instances in which a person falls into a body of water and a crowd on the bank looks on while he drowns without anyone rescuing him. There are other instances in which someone who upholds righteousness gets burned while pulling someone else out of a fire, and the result is that even the one who was rescued washes his hands of the matter. It is bitterly disappointing to hear of such instances! Someone who sees an injustice and intervenes to help the victim has become "stupid," while someone who sees an injustice and runs away has become "smart"--what a preposterous misplacement. Now, in many places in succession there have been set up award funds for taking up the cudgel in a just cause, the purpose of which is to bring back the people's sense of righteousness. Misplacement of talent and wealth. "The superior man uses his wealth to seek the right path"--this should be a reasonable proposition, but now no one pays attention to whether one is on the right path or not, and only wealth is sought. One cannot see much stress being put on "talent," and "the head hanging upside down" has become old news. In economically developed regions, children are unwilling to attend school, which they leave as soon as possible in order to make money; in economically undeveloped regions, children also do not attend school and there is a serious problem of educational deprivation. An educational "fault line" between the generations is silently growing, and the concept of providing education for all without discrimination is regarded as outworn. It is unimportant whether one has talent or not; if one has wealth one has everything, including the ability to buy diplomas signifying talent and education. For many years we called loudly for respect for talented persons, with little effect, the main reason being that we did not have financial backing. Misplacement of self-esteem and self-belittling. When a star appears there is no need to use sunlight to see it. There are people who feign righteousness for fame, and they go to disaster areas to take the victims' money. This is clearly behavior that is self-belittling and that forgets one's integrity under the temptation of personal gain, but the party concerned is inclined to view it as behavior that shows self-respect. From ancient times begging has been shameful, but now some people see it as a good profession to become rich fast. [South] Koreans consider riding in foreign sedans as shameful; Chinese consider riding in foreign cars that have been smuggled into China as honorable. In the abovementioned phenomena, it is hard to avoid biased terms and the suspicion of exaggerating things just to scare people. But in flourishing times there is no fear of exaggeration. Exaggerating in flourishing times can sober up people and make the flourishing times more flourishing. Editor: He Yulin [0149 3768 7792]
