FR940804-1-00017 FR940804-1-00006 40 CFR Part 52 [TN 132&hyph;6436b; FRL&hyph;5009&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of Tennessee AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Tennessee for the purpose of redesignation of the Memphis and Shelby County area (classified as a marginal nonattainment area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O 3 ). In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: To be considered, comments must be received by September 6, 1994. ADDRESSEES: Written comments should be sent to Karen Borel at the EPA address in Atlanta, Georgia listed below. Copies of the redesignation request and the State of Tennessee's submittal are available for public review during normal business hours at the addresses listed below.
