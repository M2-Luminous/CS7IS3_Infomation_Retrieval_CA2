Mr Nilek Sulaiman, also an executive member of the Islamic Committee of Thailand, said the prime minister must not be confused by developments in the area, which are "politically motivated and have political implications." Mr Nilek said he met Mr Chuan by chance on board a plane on Friday while on his way to Pattani. The Prime Minister was at the start of a three-day official visit to the southern most provinces. Mr Nilek said he told Mr Chuan that tension and confusion in the area have been intentionally created. Mr Nilek ruled out reports that the bombing in Hat Yai and bombs found on the railway track in Songkhla's Chana District are the work of separatists. "They want to stir up more tension in the area, which no doubt would have direct impact on the Government," he said. "More tension will be created in the near future." Mr Nilek, whose sister is married to Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina, said he thought tension in the area had been created by a group of people who want to oust Minister Den. "He has so many enemies in the area and as long as he remains in his post, tension will be whipped up to discredit him and the interior minister," he said. Mr Nilek said the Pattani municipality of which he is a member has been put on full alert. "We can't know when they will create more trouble in the municipal area," he said. The Muslim deputy rector of Islamic Studies at Prince of Songkhla University (Pattani campus), Mr Worawit Balu shared Mr Nilek's view. Mr Worawit said he tended to believe that political motives lay behind the area's tensions in the past month. "I'm quite sure more trouble will be created in the area," he said. Many Muslim officials in the region do not believe that separatists are directly responsible for tension created in Hat Yai, he said. "It may be part of a plot to destabilise the Government. Without doubt, tension in the area is aimed at discrediting Gen Chawalit and Mr Den," he said. Fourth Army commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya yesterday briefed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for 30 minutes on counter-terrorism activities in the southernmost provinces. Lt-Gen Kitti spoke of the peace talks with key members of separatist movements in recent months. A source said Lt-Gen Kitti complained of the red tape which prevents local officials from taking prompt action when trouble occurs. The efficiency of intelligence gathering among government officials was discussed. Mr Chuan later told reporters in Pattani that only a small group of people are involved in attempts to create trouble in the area. He said the situation in the southernmost region is not as bad as the press makes out. He has urged local people to help the Government tackle the area's problems. Despite the peace talks, anti-terrorist operations will have to continue, he said.
