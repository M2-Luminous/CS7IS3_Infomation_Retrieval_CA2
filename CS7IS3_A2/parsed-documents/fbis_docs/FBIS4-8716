Since the Extraordinary SNS Assembly, which was held in Zilina in February, party membership has increased from 6,000 to approximately 6,700. This was stated by the SNS Central Council during a meeting in Cadca on Saturday [9 April]. Information on the meeting was provided by SNS Chairman Jan Slota and SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes. The SNS Central Council also considered the possibilities of forming a coalition for the upcoming parliamentary elections. The proposal was put forward to form a coalition partnership with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], but only in the event of the formation of pre-election blocs --a left-wing bloc, a right-wing bloc, and a national bloc. The SNS Central Council protests against the decision by Slovak President Michal Kovac to annul the results of citizens' petition for a referendum. The president preferred intrigues to a democratic solution to the problem, delegates stated in their contributions. The SNS Central Council issued a statement on the political situation, which it addressed to the citizens of Slovakia. It states, among other things: "A dangerous development has occurred on the Slovak political scene. Under the formal cloak of democracy, political culture and ethics have been trampled underfoot, the regular results of the free elections of 1992 have been reversed, and power has been seized by political entities that were either defeated in the free elections or did not even exist at that time. This situation is reminiscent of the elections of 1948 when Klement Gottwald usurped power in the former Czechoslovak Republic.... "Political purges have been set in motion and an endeavor has been launched to liquidate the sole opposition daily, REPUBLIKA. There is speculation that the September election date might be postponed," the statement says. A dirty role is played in this process by a greater part of the mass media. The present government's distrust of the Slovak Republic's independence is borne out by its downright Milovy-style capitulationism [reference to February 1992 draft treaty concluded between Czech and Slovak leaders in Milovy on the future shape of Czech-Slovak coexistence, which was subsequently rejected by Slovak Parliament as capitulationist] in its negotiations with the Czech Republic in the Customs Union Council, as a result of which the Slovak Republic will incur losses of hundreds of millions of korunas. It is borne out by the secret agreements between the current government coalition and Hungarian political parties that do not conceal their irredentism. The SNS emphatically demands the publication of these agreements. Citizens of the Slovak Republic have the right to get to know their contents. In conclusion, the SNS appeals to citizens not to yield to hopelessness and apathy and to express their attitude toward the Slovak Republic in the next elections. [Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 11 April on page 2 carries a 600-word interview with SNS Chairman Jan Slota by SMENA reporter Marian Hudec entitled "The Party Is Stabilized." In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Slota discusses the results of the Cadca meeting of the SNS Central Council. He confirms that the district organizations "tend to favor" the party's independent ticket for the fall elections and that only "in the event of the formation of pre-election blocs" would the SNS contest the elections jointly with the HZDS and, possibly, the Christian Social Union. Slota also reiterates the party's demand for the publication of the agreement concluded between the government coalition and the Hungarian political parties, saying that "the Slovak nation wants to know for how many Judas's silverlings it was concluded." In his concluding reply, Slota denies that the SNS leadership would meet with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, during his expected visit to Slovakia. "We did not invite him to Slovakia and do not consider establishing any contacts with him," Slota says.]
