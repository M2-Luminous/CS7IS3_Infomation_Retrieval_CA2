Funds Remain Unused"] [Text] Crisis reigns in applied research laboratories. The difficult economic situation has forced companies to cut back on expenditure and revise investment plans. Likewise R&D programs: Applications for funding submitted to the IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Real and Personal Property] (pursuant to Law No. 46 of 1982) over the past 10 months have almost halved compared to 1992. That is not all: Around 30 firms have even withdrawn projects submitted some time ago, and which were finally approaching their funding goal. Research therefore is undergoing a crisis. Although the last budget law provided for an allocation of 150 billion lire for 1994, 250 billion for 1995, and 300 billion for 1996, to supplement the IMI fund which had not received any contributions since 1988, companies are now tightening their belts. The 393 requests for funding totaling 2.6 trillion lire submitted in 1992, have dropped to only 203 projects for a total of 1.25 trillion in 1993 (October figures). The drop mostly involves independent programs, those performed by large and State-owned corporations: 194 in 1992 and 77 in 1993. Even the EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] internation research projects have fallen from 34 to 15. "I believe this decline to be a natural consequence of the present economic situation," remarked Giuseppe Colona, head of the applied research division at IMI, "and I do not think it is a result of lack of resources or other basic problems. For over a year now, after the sudden rise in interest rates in 1992, firms have had to tackle serious financial problems and therefore revise all investment plans." He added: "An analysis of the projects presented over the past year has also shown that the amount requested for each one has risen slightly. This means that preference is being given to more useful research rather than marginal topics." Therefore, which experiments which have been abandoned and which are being continued? "It would be highly risky for firms to abandon research that is closely linked to production needs, since this could automatically exclude them from the market," explained Gianni Cozzi, industrial innovation research director at IEFE-Bocconi. "I feel that the cutbacks refer to nonstrategic research. I also believe that the drop in funding applications is related to privatization of some State-owned firms which made large use of the rotating fund in the past." If the current economic situation is indicated as being the main cause for abandoning research, responsibility should also be shared with the lengthy funding mechanism. On average, a funding application takes three years to be fully approved by the IMI and the Ministry of Research as required by law. This is sufficient for an innovative project to become dated. "Firms are losing interest in funding granted by the IMI," said Roberto Ciarlone, in charge of industrial policy at Confindustria [Italian Manufacturers' Federation], "slow procedures and the lack of resources which have plagued the fund for years are no incentive. This is in addition to the fact that entrepreneurs are required to provide substantial financial guarantees, albeit not a legal requirement, and impossible for small firms." In the meantime, urged by Confindustria, the IMI, and universities, the Ministry for Scientific Research has reexamined the old project to amend Law No. 46. "We have planned a long series of amendments," explained Scientific Research Minister Umberto Colombo, "to streamline the law and toughen up the controls it contents. We will allocate funding after only eight months' reviewal, but we want the research funded to be truly applicable to production and markets." The first amendments, aimed at speeding up procedures, have been adopted through a circular from the ministry that is now awaiting the go-ahead from CIPE [Interdepartmental Committee for Economic Planning]. However, a bill has already been prepared for a more extensive reform: systems for monitoring and controlling the work of the companies financed, regulation of the government's rights over national research programs, and procedures adapted to small production units.
