They informed the listeners that there were about 110 thousand farmers in Lithuania. A half of the total try hard to take maximum advantage of their land, others are waiting for the time when they will be able to rent or to sell their land at high price. There are 200 thousand people who want to get their land back. There are 3 thousand agricultural enterprises. Unfortunately not all of them are economically strong, 11 percent of them will fall apart by the end of the spring. The officials warned that part of the land might remain unseeded this year. This firstly concerns the land which has no owners and there is nobody who could rent it. According to the estimations made by Agricultural Ministry, the fuel for the seeding period alone will cost 100 million litas. Extra money should be raised to liquidate the debts of industrial enterprises. The sugar-refineries owe 46 million litas. It is believed that the agricultural plague will be reduced by the council for purchase and coordination of produce.
