On the one hand, both sides have issues in contention and each wants to maintain the largest share of benefits; but on the other hand, compromise is indicated as they are both in the same boat. Therefore, even after the tax assignment system goes into effect, the Central Government has unceasingly carried out a campaign of persuasion in the interiors to facilitate administration of the tax assignment and other new systems. 20.5 Billion Yuan Check To Cover the Red Ink A high-ranking State Council official poured out his grievances when he said: "Why do we institute the tax assignment system? Because developed countries all do it, Japan, the U.S., Britain and France all have such a system in effect. We do it because the national treasury will not be able to function without it. The 20.5 billion deficits reported in the PEOPLE'S DAILY is a hard number. From January through October last year, provincial revenue receipts increased 18 percent, but the Central Government's only 0.03 percent, and this is the actual situation. The 20.5 billion deficits in the national treasury were only met by a check written in that amount, but this year we can no longer resort to using this method." Without holding back, he continued: "This year, China's fiscal deficits will likely increase greatly. With the tax assignment system in effect and other additional income receipts, the Central Government's treasury anticipated some revenue increase but [instead] had to spend 18 billion yuan in enterprise subsidies without which state-owned enterprises cannot survive. And adding to the 20 some billion yuan deficits this year is another hard number, and that is the increase in workers salaries and wages. With a wage increase of 85 yuan per capita per month, it comes to over 20 billion yuan for the country as a whole. And this figure has not included the part on wages in this year's civil service reform which, if implemented in the fourth quarter, will add another 7.5 billion yuan of national expenditures." This kind of fiscal situation is really like "the cleverest housewife can't cook a meal without rice." Even worse, concerned government departments have begun discussing publicly civil service and wages reforms, and while the Central Government originally wanted to postpone implementing this plan, deferment now appears impossible. And that is another large sum of expenditures. Provinces Taking Advantage To Extort From Central Government The above-quoted official continued: After the tax assignment went into effect, local governments continued to operate by the former system of transmitting parts of the taxes revenues collected to the Center and keeping the rest in the region and, because of this, their burden has not increased while the Center has to bear the deficits. Furthermore, many provinces and cities have asked whether that part of the former system which allowed tax revenues collected one year to be transmitted in a different year was abolished, for this was another opportunity to extort an amount from the Center. But the Central Government, hoping to maintain "successful cooperation" with the regions, has tentatively indicated that it "may be abolished," since the amounts transmitted by all provinces add up to only some 2 billion yuan which cannot solve the Center's problems. But the Central Government is firmly insisting that the required increased amount this year must be transmitted, and leaving the question of how to modify which part of the former system to be considered at year's end. In summary, the Central Government wants henceforth to increase its revenue intake, to coordinate among rich and poor [provinces] and, at the appropriate time, to allow regional authorities to retain more revenues in order to stabilize relationship with the regions. And there is more, the Central Government has indicated that "henceforth, aside from the nationally coordinated key projects, regional authorities can also plan and develop their own projects without having to coordinate every project with the Central Government." This amounts to meeting two objectives in one move, namely, decentralizing authority and lessening local burdens. Government Selling Shares in State-Owned Enterprises As the Central Government decentralizes its authority, regional governments take the opportunity to see what they can do vis-a-vis the production authority of state-owned enterprises. Those who make investments in China should not overlook the fact that this year, a large group of state-owned enterprises and shares in other such enterprises are up for sales or transfer of (from government to people, and from domestic investment to joint or foreign-funded investments). Although the state-owned enterprises whose shares are available for purchase are not the large mainline enterprises, but from the standpoint of further intensification of economic changes in China, this is a step with significant meaning. According to sources in the foreign businessmen circle, overseas investors with large amounts of venture capital today are watching closely for investment opportunities in China and are prepared, at any time, to buy shares in mainland enterprises including state-owned, collective and even sole-proprietor enterprises. At the same time, among the state-owned enterprises with assets in trillions of yuan, many are also searching for new partners to invest in their business. Therefore, this year is the time that both buyers and sellers are looking for; even if the government may not with great fanfare offer shares of state-owned enterprises for purchase, the momentum can no longer be stopped. State-Owned Enterprises Developing Toward "Privatization" A State Planning Commission official revealed that of the several trillion yuan worth of state-owned enterprise assets, only a very small number of shares have gone to private investors. Therefore, any trend toward "privatization" in state-owned enterprises is just beginning to unfold. China's State Economic and Trade Commission Chairman Wang Zhongyu [3769 1813 4416], speaking of selling shares in state-owned enterprises, described it in 10 characters, "reform, market, efficiency, technological reform, management." But he nevertheless put enterprise restructuring in first place. He said: "Reform is focused on two aspects, one is enterprise reform, the other is reform in the area of circulation. At the heart of the latter reform is the establishment of market mechanism. Enterprise reform has several major aspects: First, "rules and regulations" should continue to be implemented, and self management authority put into effect; second, reform should have a major effect on the structure of the organization. Within an organizational structure, reform should concentrate in areas of rents and leases, sales and auctions, transfer and merger, and on establishing policies and regulations governing these areas. Third is separation of the support system. Fourth is selection and disposition of surplus personnel. The crux is to invigorate operations of enterprises." According to different news sources from various mainland provinces and cities, provincial and local authorities in fact are privately or publicly making detailed inventories of state-owned enterprises located in their areas to see which ones cannot be touched, which ones may offer stocks for sale, and even which ones may be bought and resold. All localities, noting demands of the Central Government that "state-owned enterprises operate by market forces," anticipates that shortly after the end of this year, there will be a rash of state-owned enterprises seeking partnership with outside investors. Striving To Seek Export and Agricultural Markets When Wang Zhongyu talked about other reforms, he touched on the subject of market reform, saying "that enterprises should concentrate on opening two kinds of market, export markets and rural markets. The problem of not finding export markets is due to lack of understanding of international market. Enterprises should, therefore, vigorously seek to open up international market to increase exports. China's rural market is quite large, but in the last few years, income increase of peasants has slowed and their purchasing power declined correspondingly. Once rural markets are opened up, sales will pick up quickly." With respect to reform in technology, Wang Zhongyu said that in the latter part of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," China needs to set its sight higher and take larger steps toward reform in technology, and we must restructure existing enterprises before we can raise the levels of industrial craftsmanship, facilities and product quality. China is researching into whether it can restructure 300 key enterprises, and in 3-5 years raise their level of production, grade of products and thereby the overall production quantity. In fact, at present 100 state- owned enterprises are carrying out restructuring on a trial basis from ownership and structure to concrete operations, seeking to make fundamental changes. Pattern of a "Three-Part" System of Enterprises As the above-mentioned reforms intensify, the ratios of the different types of enterprises and of their production values will also undergo major changes. Based on projections of relevant government departments in China, by the year 2000, the production values of all enterprises will show a "three-part" pattern. In terms of the total industrial production value, it is estimated that one-quarter will be from state-owned enterprises, one-half from collectively owned enterprises, and one-quarter from privately owned enterprises; in terms of the total commercial retail sales value, one-third will be from state-owned enterprises, one-sixth from collectively owned enterprises, and one-half from privately owned enterprises. According to projections, by the year 2000, the industrial production value of state-owned enterprises, as a proportion of the total industrial production value, will drop to 27.2 percent, which is the inevitable result of the rapid decline beginning in the 1980s and continuing through the 1990s. On the opposite side of the picture, the total industrial production values of collective, rural and private enterprises will continue to rise. By the year 2000, the proportions [of total production values] of these three types of enterprises will increase 47.7 percent, 13.4 percent and 11.7 percent respectively, as compared to increases of 34 percent, 48.1 percent and 65.9 percent in 1990. At the same time, the total commercial retail sales of these three types of enterprises, as a proportion of the all commercial retail sales, are also clearly rising, with sales by privately owned enterprises increasing by more than 47.1 percent.
