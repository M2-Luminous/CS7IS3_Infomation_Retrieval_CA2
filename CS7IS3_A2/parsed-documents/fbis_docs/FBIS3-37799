In the words of Goncz, the major Russian political success consolidated its international authority and position on the world scene and enabled NATO to overcome the post-ultimatum situation with dignity. Goncz reminded Kozyrev of his latest meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin when the Hungarian state head said Russia will continue to play a key role in solution of European problems. On the same day, Kozyrev was received by Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross. The premier praised Russian diplomatic efforts to settle situation around Sarajevo and said decisive and constructive Russian efforts enabled Hungary to overcome a difficult situation, as it is geographically close to the Yugoslav conflict zone.
