FBIS4-51543 "dreas084_a_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Firms Said Turning Attention Toward Israel Firms Said Turning Attention Toward Israel OW0205132994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1144 GMT 2 May 94 OW0205132994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [By Ikuji Nakaya] [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- With peace talks in progress in the Middle East, once-reluctant Japanese businesses are beginning to turn to Israel with its high technology and the potential of Tel Aviv to become one of the financial centers of the region. Both on official and private-sector levels, Japan and Israel started exchanging various delegations in late 1992. The historic agreement reached by the Israeli Government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) last September on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip accelerated Japanese interest in business with Israel. On Wednesday in Cairo, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are scheduled to finalize the agreement, inviting dozens of top diplomats including japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. Akio Aoki, managing director of U.S.-based consultant TTT Technology Trade Inc., says the so-called Arab Boycott, hitherto believed to be the biggest hurdle in doing business with Israel, has become in effect "nominal." Aoki, who is head of TTT's Tokyo office, says Japanese firms are increasingly showing interest in Israel's high tech, especially in areas like medical equipment and biotechnology. TTT has recently agreed on a business tie-up with Nippon Investment and Finance Corp., an affiliate of Daiwa Securities Co., to provide small and medium-sized Japanese firms with information on business opportunities with Israel. Kiyoshi Tsuji, president of electronic equipment trader Kaytec Ltd. based in Tokyo, hopes to triple turnover this year. The company mainly sells Israeli-made software linked with the local area network (LAN) system to major Japanese System Integrator (SI) concerns. A Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry official agrees with Aoki that the Arab boycott, under which countries and companies could be subject to retaliation for doing business with Israel, is losing its power, and trade between Japan and Israel is actually increasing. "It is true that the Japanese business industry is interested in Israel," says Kanji Hayashi, assistant director of the Federation of Economic Organizations' (Keidanren) Asian affairs department. Keidanren sent a 14-member delegation to the Jewish state last year, mainly composed of executives at major trading houses. In addition to Israel's strong ties with the United States, Hayashi says, the country can serve as a bridge to European nations as well, while being one of the commercial centers of the Middle East. Auto manufacturers like Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (MMC) and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have considerable experience in exporting cars to Israel. Other manufacturers like Toyota and Nissan recently followed suit. An MMC spokesman said the company exports about 20,000 cars per year and the vehicles are sold through local dealerships, which the company considers will not be subject to the Arab boycott since it is not a direct investment. But, while showing interest in business with Israel, major companies, at least superficially, still express caution over taking risks in deals with Israel. A spokesman for trading firm Mitsubishi Corp. bluntly said, "the Arab boycott has never been canceled," while an Itochu Corp. spokesman said the company is merely "in the stage of collecting information." A spokesman for NEC Corp., a major electronics maker, acknowledged Israel's high technology but was skeptical about launching major business relations with Israel. In the financial sector, however, government sources said two to three brokerage companies, including one or more "Big Four" securities firms, are planning to open representative offices in Tel Aviv soon for the first time. Daiwa Securities, an affiliate of Nippon Investment and Finance, declined to comment on its strategy in Israel. An official with the Japan Securities Dealers Association says there is a good possibility that Israel will become a financial hub in the future. "We shouldn't be left behind then," he said, but the problem is the scanty knowledge Japanese financial institutions have of the Middle East, India and Pakistan. "All they think about is New York and London," he said. The official said the association is ready to designate the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as a preferred market for Japanese investors any time, but so far there has been no request from Japanese securities firms nor from foreign brokerage houses in Tokyo. Max Livnat, minister of economic affairs at the Embassy of Israel in Tokyo, says the country is seeking to attract direct investment from Japan in addition to trade of goods. He says it will be great business if Japan can do international marketing on products developed by Israeli research and development, which is one of the areas that Japanese firms are streamlining due to the economic slowdown. "To my surprise, they are still cautious," he said, but he believes it is "just a matter of time." Livnat said he is expecting a major reconciliation between Israel and the Arabs within this year and perhaps "faster than people believe," suggesting Japanese firms should not lose time by "being so cautious."
