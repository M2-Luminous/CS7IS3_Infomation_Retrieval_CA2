FR940627-0-00011 FR940627-0-00004 A commenter recommends that this AD action also cover inspections in two other locations in the MLG, the swivel pin and trunnion attach fittings. The FAA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on February 11, 1994, to seek comments regarding the best action (if any) to take in order to correct any possible problems with retractable MLG swivel pins. The FAA is currently reviewing comments from this ANPRM and has not determined that there is an unsafe condition that requires AD action under part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39). The MLG trunnion attach fittings are the subject of Piper SB No. 956, dated March 3, 1992. The FAA has evaluated all information related to this issue and has determined that AD action is not justified at this point. The FAA will continue to evaluate any additional information, and, if necessary, will implement future rulemaking. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. The manufacturer has informed the FAA that certain Piper Model PA34&hyph;220T airplanes (serial numbers 34&hyph;8133001 through 34&hyph;8233088) may be equipped with trunnion housing assemblies, Piper part number 39486&hyph;802 (left) and 39486&hyph;803 (right) with embossed forging number 67924&hyph;2. The FAA has determined that this AD should not apply to airplanes with these trunnion housing assemblies installed. The FAA has revised the Applicability section of the final rule to reflect this change. No comments were received on the FAA's determination of the cost impact of this proposed action upon U.S. operators of the affected airplanes. After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the compliance time change in paragraph (b) of the proposal, the Applicability section change, the addition of the provision to blend any lateral grinding marks, and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes, the addition, and any editorial corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. The FAA estimates that 2,265 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,484,700. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the required action. The FAA believes that some airplane owners have already accomplished the required actions. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of this AD will be much lower than the figure referenced above. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
