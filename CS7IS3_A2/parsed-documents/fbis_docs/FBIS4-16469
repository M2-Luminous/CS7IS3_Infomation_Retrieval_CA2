Budget Infusions To Be Put in Order"] [Text] The State Duma has made what might at first glance seem as minor amendments to its rules of procedure, but what in legal terms has marked a certain turn in relations between the representative and executive authorities. The issue is that under Article 104 of the Constitution draft laws that call for federal budget appropriations cannot be submitted for State Duma consideration without the government's expert opinion. By including this article in the Fundamental Law its authors tried to insure themselves against the practice of the RSFSR's Supreme Soviet and Congress where the adoption of laws to the greatest detriment of the budget seemed to be the domestic deputies' favorite sport. Out of inertia, the new parliamentarians have tried to go back to their former hobby only to run into Article 104. Initially, lawyers among deputies have found a loophole: what is required under the Constitution is just a government opinion regardless of what it says. For instance, a law on a 100-fold rise in the salaries of commercial bank directors to be financed by the state could cost 1 trillion rubles from the budget, of which the government would advise the State Duma, deeming the initiative inappropriate, but the deputies could well spurn the opinion and pass the draft law just the same. This is why the government did not see any reason to rush with writing its opinions. The State Duma's unilateral attempt to impose time limits on the executive branch would have certainly been unconstitutional. The situation was definitely abnormal, but the two sides have reached an agreement and decided to formalize it legally: On 11 April the government decreed that letters with opinions on draft laws regarding federal budget expenditures must be prepared within 14 days. The period may be extended to 30 days if it is necessary to obtain additional information which is not provided for in the state accounting system. Moreover, the government obliged federal authorities to draw up opinions on State Duma draft laws at its request within 7 or 15 days, the latter if there is a need to obtain extra information. Finally, should a sponsor of the draft law or a Federation component fail to submit the requisite information, the government decreed that the dispute would be resolved upon agreement with the lower chamber. The State Duma has gone its part of the way, too. The amendments to its rules of procedure effectively repeat the government document, except for the provision on giving assignments to executive agencies, something the lower chamber is not entitled to do. The State Duma was surprisingly swift in considering the rules of procedure amendments, and Deputy Baburin's remark that the decree is very important, because it affects the status of both the government and the State Duma -- which is why there is no reason to be too hasty in adopting it before the law on deputy status is passed -- did not find a response among the parliamentarians. Maybe one of the reasons is that the report on the agreement was delivered by "the biggest leaf on both branches of power" -- Sergey Shakhray, who is at the same time a deputy prime minister in the government and a State Duma faction leader.
