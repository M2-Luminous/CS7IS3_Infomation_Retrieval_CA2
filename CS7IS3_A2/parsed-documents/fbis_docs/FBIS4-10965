According to an officer stationed in Brasilia, despite the risks and complexity of this sort of action, intervention is appropriate, but it will probably be implemented too late. For less serious reasons, the Army intervened in Alagoas State. It did so, however, at the request of the Alagoas governor and under the orders of the president of the Republic. In the case of Rio de Janeiro, neither Minister Lucena nor General Benedito Leonel, the Army chief of staff, believe Governor Nilo Batista will call for military support. First, he would be announcing his inability to solve the problem, and second because Batista is involved in the numbers game scandal. The Army minister has been receiving visits from congressmen, most of them from Rio de Janeiro, at the Army Headquarters in Brasilia. To each of them, Gen. Lucena regrets the insecurity that reigns in Rio de Janeiro. He also comments on the legal impossibility of intervention in the absence of a request from the governor and an order from the president of the Republic. The Army minister believes intervention is necessary, but can only act if it complies with the constitutional norms, as he and Gen. Leonel said in Brasilia on 18 April. The two generals added that they are ready. If President Itamar Franco gives the order, the Army is ready to act. Their remarks do not seek to praise their military organization and are more than just a message: They are almost encouraging the president of the Republic to give the order. The Army has the intervention planned. For a long time, the military information and intelligence services have been following the actions of organized crime in Rio de Janeiro. They have reasonably assessed the arrival of weapons in the city and have precious information on the organization of criminals. The involvement of the Rio de Janeiro security apparatus in organized crime has convinced the military that intervention would consist of three stages: 1. To moralize the Military, Civil, and Federal Police, as well as at the Fire Department because, together with the Army, they will participate in the war against crime. 2. To effectively fight crime by occupying the hill slums. 3. To end the intervention period, when the Army will return responsibility for the security structures to the state government. In Rio de Janeiro, as well as in the federal administration, there are many restrictions on such a complex action. Last year, the Military Command of the East clashed with Leonel Brizola's opposition to an Army participation in a fight against crime. At the time, Brasilia also opposed military participation.
