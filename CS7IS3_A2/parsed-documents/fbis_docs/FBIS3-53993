Here is our colleague with a report on this. [Unidentified correspondent, by telephone] It is reported that fighter planes belonging to General Dostam and Ahmad Shah Mas'ud appeared in the Kabul sky today and bombarded each other's positions. During the past two days air attacks by warring forces have been very severe. While General Dostam's fighter planes have bombed the presidential palace and the Baghram military airport on several occasions, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's fighter planes have attacked several of his opponents' positions, including Charasyab, situated 25 km south of Kabul. According to reports the presidential palace has been severely damaged. Furthermore, yesterday's bombing of Charasyab caused great damage to the Afghan prime minister's television center. The Afghan Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] has, however, once again declared its neutrality concerning the current fighting in Kabul. The secretary general of the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party] said yesterday: The current war -- just like the other conflicts in the past 21 months -- will not have a decisive effect in resolving the Afghan political problems. He added: The only way to resolve Afghan problems is to set up a neutral government in which the principal participants would be the four main political and military groups; that is, the Hezb-e Eslami, Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, and the Afghan National Islamic Movement. Abdolali Mazari said: Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami cooperates with the other members of the Afghan Supreme Cooperation Council solely from a political point of view. Meanwhile reports coming from Jalalabad indicate that thousands of refugees from Kabul are stranded without any shelter in cold mountain areas between Jalalabad and the Pakistani border. Kabul hospital sources say that the fighting in the past three weeks has left hundreds dead and more than 8,000 injured.
