"It is enormously important for the Japanese Government to put all its energy into compiling such measures in June, because the U.S. is focusing on our June package," the top government spokesman told a news conference. Takemura's comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor rejected as inadequate a fresh Japanese market-opening package unveiled Tuesday. "We have reviewed these measures and they do not meet (our) concerns," Kantor said at a White House news conference Tuesday. Takemura said Kantor's negative assessment of the Japanese package is regrettable. But he also expressed hope for an early resumption of the stalemated "framework" trade negotiations saying he is paying attention to Kantor's remark suggesting there remain possibilities of resuming the bilateral trade talks if Japan makes further concessions. Kantor said, "we are not discouraged. The Government of Japan has described this as a first step and we see it as a work in progress." On Tuesday, Japan announced a set of market-opening measures designed primarily to pare down its lopsided trade surplus with the U.S., which amounted to some 60 billion dollars last year. The package features tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps to spur domestic demand, market-opening measures in four sectors and voluntary overtures in three priority areas of the trade talks with the U.S. The chief cabinet secretary denied that Tokyo plans to send a special envoy to Washington to officially explain Japan's efforts to boost foreign access to its markets and slash its trade surpluses.
