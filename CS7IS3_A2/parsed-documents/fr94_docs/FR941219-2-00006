FR941219-2-00006 FR941219-2-00002 Preliminary Results of Review We have preliminarily determined that the following margins exist for the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/exporter 1Margin (percent) Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation 6.47 Buxton International 6.93 Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Work Co., Ltd 10.67 Transcend International 10.67 Kuang Hong Industrial Works 10.67 San Chien Industrial Works, Ltd 10.67 Everspring Corporation 6.93 The Department shall determine and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning these respondents directly to the U.S. Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed firms will be those firms' rates established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a previous review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will remain at 6.93 percent as established in the LTFV investigation. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in Floral Trade Council v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all other'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposit in all current and future administrative reviews. The ``all others'' rate in the LTFV investigation was 6.93 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but not later than 44 days after date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written comments, from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments. This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: December 7, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31138 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
