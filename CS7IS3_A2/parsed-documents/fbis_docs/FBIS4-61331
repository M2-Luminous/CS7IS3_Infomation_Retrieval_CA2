President Askar Akayev addressed those present: The Karabakh conflict is a complex knot of problems that has centuries old traditions. Generations of people of the two fraternal republics should not be victims of historic mistakes and contradictions. It is our belief that these problems should be solved today on the basis of present day realities, on the principles of tolerance and mutual concessions. The fact that the Karabakh problem is being discussed within the framework of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which is led by the Vladimir Shumeyko, allows us to believe that Legislative Branches of power will find a safe mechanism for putting out the flame of the fraternal war. There are no winners in this war. Your efforts aimed at peaceful settlment of the Karabakh conflict will be appreciated by future generations and by history. I wish you success in your job, peace and well being to your people. [Signed] President Askar Akayev.
