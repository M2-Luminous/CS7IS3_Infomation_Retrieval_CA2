Having become a people left behind by time, who atrophied as a whole as a result of three centuries of a colonialist yoke, of being driven from their lands, and of great bloody massacres, our demographic numbers have grown rapidly during recent years and we are making up for our losses. Creation of geopolitical and demopolitical notions appropriate to our young Republic, which in terms of its expanse is one of the largest countries in the world but in terms of its population is fiftieth among 175 UN member nations, is a requirement of the times. From this point of view, noted scientist-demographer Maqash Tatimov's recently published book entitled: "Qazaq Alemi" is an extremely important work intended to make clear the weight of the Kazakh people among the peoples of the world, to investigate key questions involved with the formation of demopolitical notions, and to distinguish in detail the eras of demographic development from early times up to the present day. In the first chapters of the book, the author touches in detail on the demographic determinism which has had such a tremendous impact upon the national development and prosperity of the Kazakh people, that is to say, on the causes of its dependency. He offers specific scientific proofs as to why the Kazakh people were deprived of a total of 5,950,000 persons as a result of the destruction of Kazakh nationhood and the total breakup of the Kazakhs over a period of three centuries (1690-1990), beginning from the great disaster of "putting one foot before the other in the snow, the Alqakol deviation" [wars with the Dzungars]. In the next chapter which discusses the view of foreign scientists on the demographic state of the Kazakhs, the author criticizes foreign scientists in terms the inherent laws of demographic growth for endeavoring to compare to with another peoples at different levels of historical development. The conclusion that during the next two-three decades (by 2025), if things go well, "the number of our people will reach 15 million and will comprise two-thirds of all the inhabitants of our Republic," creates feelings of joy within us. According to data assembled by M. Tatimov, based upon archival documents, 2.5 million were wiped out during the years 1921-2 and from 1931-3 due to hunger. Nearly half a million fled to foreign countries during the era of forced collectivization and confiscation, and many thousands of innocent people were shot during the holocaust of the Goloshchekin genocide and Stalinist repression. All in all, our people were deprived of 3.5 million persons during this sad destruction lasting 30 years. The author explains: "this was one of the major excesses of the colonialists in the 20th century." He points out that thinking about ways to overcome the damages from this gradually and to improve demographic conditions in our country is an honored duty of our nation. As if to "put on a little weight," the numbers of our people, having suffered complete demographic disaster, started out from very low levels and are today well over 7 million in our own Republic and well over 10 million in the entire world. The demographer invites the more than 3 million our blood relatives living in almost 40 countries of the world to assemble under the black yurt [of Kazakhstan] and to return to the honored homeland. In fact, the time has arrived for numbers and quality to grow together. The idea of numbers and quality "must become the nucleus for national patriotism, our national psychology, and our state ideology," Tatimov concludes. The lands of Central Asia and of Kazakhstan are a region where the progeny of the Turkic-speaking peoples, which are broadly spread and dispersed about the great Eurasian expanses, have grown up and matured. The next chapter of the book presents tables about the demographic growth of the six major countries of Central Asia and Kazakhstan during a 112 year period (1897-2009) and shows us a difficult fate, a varied history. In terms the middle range of the demographer scientist's projections, the number of Turks in the entire world will grow 2.5-3.0 times and reach a number of 400-450 millions [by the end of the above period]. It makes the author shudder that the Kazakh people have still not been raised to the ranks of leaders in urbanization which is gaining ground among the developed countries of the world. According to calculations based upon the results of censuses at various times, the number of Kazakhs living in cities increased between the years 1891 and 1989 from 40,000 to 3,280,000, an increase of 82 times. It greatly shocks the scientist that migration is onesided, that the fact that our young people coming to the cities disappear down a blind alley, and that they are unable to establish themselves on a solid basis. This is having an adverse impact upon our demographic thinking and conduct and upon our growth. One of the demographic disaster areas which took shape in the Republic with the organization of the Soviet red imperialism was the nuclear testing area in Semey. The testing area, according to an explanation provided by the scientist, made the Kazakh people a social toy of the red empire, an economic toy, a sacrifice to gain experience with nuclear weapons. It was a coarse barbarism directed at our growth and development. Through offering the truth of long years about the Degeleng Mountains, which rumbled from below and became ill-starred, the author brings to our attention the harm to the people's growth caused by the nuclear explosions and adds his own suggestions for overcoming the ill effects of this contrary manifestation quickly. In the next chapter of the book: "Final Words on a Black Document," secrets are uncovered, a terrible sadness to move the soul. One other barbarism, a very severe disaster for the history of the Kazakh people, was the Stalinist repression. There is no doubt whatever that the facts and demographic projections of demographic science are extremely important. In this regard information, showing detailed modeling of all aspects of the demographic development of our people and showing projections about future growth, is provided very appropriately at the end of the book. These facts will no doubt have a greater influence on the minds of our people than words of simple information.
