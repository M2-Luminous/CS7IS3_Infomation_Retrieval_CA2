He talks to Enes Musabasic. In this program we have selected the prime minister's views on UN efforts to put an end to the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin Silajdzic recording] We have demanded that the United Nations follow the rules laid down in the UN Charter. Namely, it should help. There are [word indistinct] rules in this world that should be complied with. Unfortunately, not only have the United Nations and the UN Security Council in particular, and the five permanent members which for all practical purposes formulate its policies, failed to help us but they have made things worse for us. Although the international community says it does not want to intervene it has already intervened by imposing an arms embargo. Hence, having said that the United Nations is doing its job today, it is in fact saying that it is redressing to a certain degree the historic mistake it had made regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina--there is no such precedent. There is no precedent, as far as I know, there has been no repeat of the systematic violations of the UN Charter, such as in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, when we ask the international community to help us we want it to do what it should have done a long time ago. Because of these mistakes, the arms embargo above all, this intervention in helping the aggressor should come to an end. We have lost 200,000 people as a result of these mistakes. We have a ruined country and the kind of situation you all know too well. Hence, when we demand that the international community do something we are not begging for charity, but are demanding just a little bit of what belongs to us. Nothing can make up for the lost lives and the sufferings we have experienced over these two years. [end recording] [Musabasic] The very same international community has over a long period of time come up with a number of peace proposals, mainly based on an ethnic division of our country. [Begin Silajdzic recording] Europe has found solutions appropriate to its own nature, this has to be understood. Europe consists of national states, not of multicultural, multiethnic societies such as ours. Europe is not cosmopolitan--Europe only tolerates minorities. They are applying their own model to Bosnia. Europe says it wants to become like Bosnia, but at the same time, it allows the model of what it strives to become to be destroyed before its eyes. These are the dilemmas Europe is facing. As I said, Europe is looking for a solution in Bosnia--a solution that would be Europe-like and not a solution that we see as a good one. For this reason, the division into ethnic groups--although it is quite clear and we have always stressed that Bosnia is live tissue and cutting it along ethnic lines that have never clearly existed--means war, means bloodshed. It is live tissue, which has to bleed when cut along imaginary ethnic lines. Despite this, we have up till now failed to persuade Europe that this is the case, except for the act of the creation of the [Bosniak-Croat] federation, which to a certain extent makes a significant contribution toward the solution of the question of the restoration of Bosnia.
