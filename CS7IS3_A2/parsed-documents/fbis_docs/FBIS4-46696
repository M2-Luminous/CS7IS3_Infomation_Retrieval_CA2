There would be nothing peculiar about it--it is the right of the president to address anybody with any words--were it not for certain nuances which make this document somewhat strange. First, the president is appealing to a Supreme Council whose election was undesirable for him; this was shown by his appearances on television before the elections when, instead of appealing to the population to come to the polling stations and do their civic duty, he started to consider in public whether a parliament would be elected or not, and whether it would be full-fledged or not if it in fact was elected. Naturally, many people interpreted this step as a signal to the effect that the election to the Supreme Council was a secondary thing, and that it was not necessary to turn out for it. However, contrary to the prophecies and efforts of certain forces to frustrate the election, it was held, and the Supreme Council, although not its full membership, was elected after all. This is why the presidential message to it sounds somewhat hypocritical. Second, the president is addressing the supreme legislative organ of the country for the one and only purpose of postponing the next presidential elections, which, incidentally, are already going ahead full tilt; there are already candidates for the post of president who have collected the necessary number of citizens' votes in their support. This is happening after the president--to be sure, under pressure from the population and the threat of a miners' strike--himself agreed to the early elections but suddenly changed his position. Third, the president himself agreed to run for another term, having previously announced publicly that he would not take part in the early elections and reversed his position yet again by then. Such, putting it mildly, inconsistency is not random: It is the main trait of our president. Any number of examples can be given, but let us recall the most characteristic one when, heading to negotiations with Yeltsin in Massandra, our president had in hand the proposals for the even division of the Black Sea Fleet between Ukraine and Russia that had been developed by professionals, but at the last hour suddenly changed his mind and agreed to sell Ukraine's part of the fleet to the adjacent state. This is precisely what became the main reason that Morozov, minister of defense of Ukraine at the time and an honest and principled man, felt compelled to resign. However, let us revisit the content of the message. In substantiating the undesirability of early presidential elections, the president referred to three aspects--political, economic, and legal. The president thinks that, in terms of the political aspect, early elections will not only fail to consolidate the state but will also polarize political forces and exacerbate their confrontation. Well, it is no secret that the struggle in the elections will be between various political forces. However, this is precisely what democratic elections provide for, and it is the will of the people to make a particular force preponderant. The state may be consolidated precisely during the elections if the people make a specific program preponderant, for example, the idea of rallying all national-patriotic forces on the basis of the results of the 1991 referendum--this will be the consolidation of the state all right. On the contrary, the postponement of the early elections, which the president desires, will not only tighten the noose around the neck of Ukraine, as the well-known economist Volodymyr Chernyak aptly indicated, but may also cause a social explosion. So, let us recall that the decision on early presidential elections was made on the initiative of and under pressure from the miners. Is it really necessary for them to also become the guarantors of holding the elections, assembling once again in front of the Supreme Council or the presidential residence? Further on the president intimidates us with the possibility of the election campaign bringing about the federalization and dismemberment of Ukraine. This is not quite comprehensible, if for no other reason than because none other than our president comes out in favor of establishing special economic zones in Ukraine, thus creating a nutritive medium for the idea of federalization; none other than our president saw through a law on the autonomization of the Crimea during his tenure as chairman of the Supreme Council; it was his subsequent apathetic and passive position with regard to the development of events in the Crimea that caused the Crimea to be virtually lost to Ukraine. As far as the economic aspect is concerned, the president believes that the June elections may "bring about the destruction of the instruments of state influence on the condition of the economy." However, it was precisely this "state influence" that brought about the current condition of our economy and the impoverishment of the people. It has been commonly recognized that reforms are not advancing in Ukraine. Nor will they advance because they are not advantageous for the supreme echelon of power, which to this day advocates this "state influence" on the economy which makes it possible for this echelon to effect, under the guise of privatization, the redistribution of public property in its favor. By now it has become clear to all that economic reforms will only advance once profound political reform has been implemented. The June presidential and local elections are the first step toward the reform and the change of power which Ukraine desperately needs at present. The largest section of the presidential message is devoted to the legal aspect of the consequences of the forthcoming early elections. It contains discourse and thoughts; however, once again, everything is subordinated to proving the truth--the only one to the mind of the president--that the elections are infeasible. He said that the Constitution should first be adopted, the status of the president should be determined, and only later should elections be considered. Certainly, the Constitution should be adopted, but it would be feasible for it to be adopted by a Constitutional Assembly or a Constitutional Convention elected for this purpose alone rather than the Supreme Council, which is objectively interested in a Constitution "tailored to itself." However, in either event the adoption of the Constitution is a complex and lengthy process; if we were to follow the president, the Constitution may be in the process of adoption for so long that the state of Ukraine itself may no longer exist. In summation, let us ask this question: To whom is it advantageous to postpone the early presidential and local elections? Which forces stand to win by this? If we proceed from the fact that the forthcoming elections are nothing but a form of the aggravation of the struggle for the redistribution of power and property (or property and power), it will become understandable that postponing the elections means conserving the current authorities headed by the president for a period of time and giving them an opportunity to grow stronger and to complete "grab-it-ization." It is not early presidential elections that are a factor of instability in our state but rather the inconsistency of the president, the ineffectiveness of his policy, and the fact that an integrated effective program to overcome the crisis and develop Ukraine has not even been developed in three years. It is hard to predict what stance the Supreme Council will take with regard to the message. However, if it were to follow the president's lead it would, first, be guilty of a transgression against the miners who have ensured this early election and, second, would exacerbate the political and economic agony of the state, the possible outcome of which is easy to predict. However the June elections might end, they are acutely necessary from the political, economic, and social standpoints. Ukraine must go through these elections. There is no other way. Virtually all states of Eastern Europe, in which several governments and parliaments have changed over these years, have travelled this painful path. As you can see, Ukraine is late on this score, too. The mistake needs to be corrected, and the frustration of the June elections should not be allowed to occur, no matter how this frustration might be packaged for us.
