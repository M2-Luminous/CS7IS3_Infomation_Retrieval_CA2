FR941019-2-00131 FR941019-2-00080 Discussion: The Webb-Pomerene Act addresses only the question of antitrust liability under U.S. law. Although the U.S. antitrust laws confer an immunity on such associations, the Act does not purport to confer immunity under the law of any foreign country, nor does the Act compel the members of a Webb-Pomerene association to act in any particular way. Thus, a foreign government retains the ability to initiate proceedings if such an association allegedly violates that country's competition law. 4. Personal Jurisdiction and Procedural Rules 4.1␣Personal Jurisdiction The Agencies will bring suit only if they conclude that personal jurisdiction exists under the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. 90 Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §22, provides that any suit under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought in the judicial district where it is an inhabitant, where it may be found, or where it transacts business. The concept of transacting business is interpreted pragmatically by the Agencies. Thus, a company may transact business in a particular district directly through an agent, or through a related corporation that is actually the ``alter ego'' of the foreign party. 91 In all cases, the assertion of personal jurisdiction must satisfy constitutional requirements of minimum contacts with the United States, such that the proceeding comports with ``fair play and substantial justice.'' 92 90 International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). 91 See, e.g., Letter from Donald S. Clark, Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission, to Caswell O. Hobbs, Esq., Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Jan. 17, 1990 (Re: Petition to Quash Subpoena Nippon Sheet Glass, et al., File No. 891&hyph;0088, at page 3) (``The Commission *␣*␣* may exercise jurisdiction over and serve process on, a foreign entity that has a related company in the United States acting as its agent or alter ego.''); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 4. 92 International Shoe, 326 U.S. 310, 320. Once personal jurisdiction under the Constitution is established, service or process must be authorized by a particular statute or rule. The Clayton Act, which permits the service of process beyond the boundaries of the forum state, is the federal statute that authorizes service wherever the corporate defendant transacts business. Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co., Ltd., 885 F.2d 1406, 1414 (9th Cir. 1989). Under such a statute, the question is whether the party has sufficient contacts with the United States, not any particular state. Id. (citations omitted). 4.2␣Investigatory Practice Relating to Foreign Nations In conducting investigations that require documents that are located outside the United States, or contacts with persons located outside the United States, the Agencies first consider requests for voluntary cooperation when practical and consistent with enforcement objectives. When compulsory measures are needed, they seek whenever possible to work with foreign government involved. U.S. law also provides authority in some circumstances for the use of compulsory measures directed to parties over whom the courts have personal jurisdiction, which the Agencies may use when other efforts to obtain information have been exhausted or would be unavailing. 93 93 For example, 28 U.S.C. §1783(a) (1988) authorizes a U.S. court to order the issuance of a subpoena ``requiring the appearance as a witness before it, or before a person or body designated by it, of a national or resident of the United States who is in a foreign country, or requiring the production of a specified document or other thing by him,'' under circumstances spelled out in the statute. Conflicts can arise, however, where foreign statutes purport to prevent persons from disclosing documents or information for us in U.S. proceedings. However, the mere existence of such statutes does not excuse noncompliance with a request for information from one of the Agencies. 94 To enable the Agencies to obtain evidence located abroad more effectively, as noted in Section 2.91 above. Congress recently has enacted legislation authorizing the Agencies to negotiate bilateral agreements between antitrust enforcement agencies to facilitate the exchange or documents and evidence in civil and criminal investigations. 95 94 See Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197 (1958). 95 S. 2297 and H.R. 4781, International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act of 1994 (103d Cong., 2d Sess.) (1994). 4.22␣Hart-Scott-Rodino: Special Foreign Commerce Rules As noted above in Section 2.4, qualifying mergers and acquisitions, defined both in terms of size of party and size of transaction, must be reported to the Agencies, along with certain information about the parties and the transaction, prior to their consummation, pursuant to the HSR Amendments to the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §18a. In some instances, the HSR implementing regulations exempt otherwise reportable foreign transactions. 96 First, some acquisitions by U.S. persons are exempt. Acquisitions of foreign assets by a U.S. person are exempt when (i) no sales in or into the United States are attributable to those assets, or (ii) some sales in or into the United States are attributable to those assets, but the acquiring person would not hold assets of the acquired person to which $25 million or more of such sales in the acquired person's most recent fiscal year were attributable. 97 Acquisitions by a U.S. person of voting securities of a foreign issuer are exempt unless the issuer holds assets in the United States having an aggregate book value of $15 million or more, or made aggregate sales in or into the United States of $25 million or more in its most recent fiscal year. 98 96 See 16 CFR 802.50&hyph;52 (1994). 97 See 16 CFR 802.50(a) (1994). 98 See 16 CFR 802.50 (1994). Second, some acquisition by foreign persons are exempt. An exemption exists for acquisitions by foreign persons if (i) the acquisition is of voting securities of a foreign issuer and would not confer control of a U.S. issuer having annual net sales or total assets of $25 million or more, or of any issuer with assets located in the United States having a book value of $15 million or more; or (ii) the acquired person is also a foreign person and the aggregate annual net sales of the merging firms in or into the United States is less than $110 million and their aggregate total assets in the United States are less than $110 million. 99 In addition, an acquisition by a foreign person of assets located outside the United States is exempt. Acquisitions by foreign persons of U.S. issuers or assets are not exempt. 99 See 16 CFR 802.51 (1994). Finally, acquisitions are exempt if the ultimate parent entity of either the acquiring or the acquired person is controlled by a foreign state, and the acquisition is of assets located within that foreign state, or of voting securities of an issuer organized under its laws. 100 The HSR rules are necessarily technical, and should be consulted rather than relying on the summary description herein. 100 See 16 CFR 802.52 (1994).
