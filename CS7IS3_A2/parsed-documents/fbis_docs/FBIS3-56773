The capital's chief is worried about the fact that certain members of government are trying to "push through" a plan for the elimination of federal food stocks, introduce high customs duties on food, put a stop to preferential credits, and abolish foreign food subsidies. It is for the State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy to decide whether or not there is a deal between the organ of state power and the major economic bodies. But the fact remains that the adoption of these decisions can only benefit our food lobbyists -- the monopolists -- and will hit the pockets of practically all strata of the population hard. For example, Russian sugar magnates are greatly irked by the fact that imported sugar retails at 600 rubles [R] per kg, whereas sugar leaves our refineries at a price of R900 per kg. But since they do not want the bother of cutting production costs and so on, the monopolists dream about using their own sector ministers' hands to strangle foreign competitors. Moreover, the open letter points out, given the current decline in agricultural production, Muscovites can rely neither on Russia's regions nor on the CIS countries. For instance, in the first six months of 1994 the proposed volumes of purchases of vegetable oil for the capital are only 7 percent of what is required, while the equivalent figures for meat and meat products are 35 percent, for butter 41 percent, and for powdered milk 63 percent. "By informing you of this," Yuriy Luzhkov writes, "we hope, Esteemed Viktor Stepanovich, to secure your assistance and support and ask you to prevent the situation from becoming critical by immediately adopting the Russian Federation Government draft decree, elaborated by the ministries and departments in conjunction with the Moscow government in accordance with your instructions, on providing the population of Moscow with food. The examination of it by the Russian Federation Economics and Finance Ministries has been delayed for no reason since last November." Rather long-winded, but very urgent and timely. The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office, which, for obvious reasons, lives in Moscow, fully endorses its mayor's request.
