Work should be carried out to encourage and protect personnel, especially at the local level, either with regard to special laws or the financial aspect. To this end, the prime minister, added we have created of the post of a minister delegate in charge of local communities and administrative reforms. The municipalities are also a fundamental preoccupation of the government. As for the revival of the national economy, the prime minister said that it is a paramount priority, and that we have the will and the necessary means to achieve this revival. What is important is that our workers, entrepreneurs, traders, and industrialists are able to achieve the required production level. We will work to gradually eliminate all the obstacles that are hampering productive economic activities, and we will encourage all initiatives. He added that there will be no room for speculation or the black market which has greatly harmed the country and its citizens. We will also considerably reduce the rate of unemployment. Regarding national solidarity, and in addition to the economic measures that the government will take in favor of the socially deprived classes, the prime minister said that boosting this solidarity should take place not only through collective action but also within the family and inside the school. National action should become a part of civic action. He added that the State Secretariat for National Solidarity and the Family will coordinate with all appropriate circles to include the notion of national solidarity in the government's agenda. During the interview with APS and AL-SHA'B, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi talked about several national issues. With regard to implementation of the agreement with the IMF and its impact on the national economy, the prime minister said that the program of stability that we have adopted will radically change the conditions of management of the economy. It goes without saying, as he put it, that there is a need for restructuring of the state's role within the overall framework of national economy. The private sector should be allocated an important position on condition that all economic operators, irrespective of their legal position, should adhere to the same market rules.
