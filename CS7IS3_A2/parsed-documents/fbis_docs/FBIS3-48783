U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor "is ready to announce that competition policy should be the next main agenda for the next GATT round," Keio University Associate Professor Jiro Tamura, a participant in the Brookings Institution competition policy project, told a seminar sponsored by the Japanese American Citizens League. Tamura later told a journalist he was informed by a chief economist at the Washington-based think-tank earlier in the day that Kantor "looks like" he is going to propose competition policy as the new theme for the next round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT.) The last round of the 117-nation trade organization was finally concluded last month after seven years of negotiations. Tamura said trade negotiators are likely to meet toward the end of this year to mull over a topic for the next round, which will be conducted under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the new name for the GATT umbrella organization. Competition policy is a broad concept that includes better enforcement of anti-trust laws so that companies will compete with each other in a free and fair manner, he said. The term would include crackdowns on cartels and mergers, and restrictive business practices. Tamura told the seminar on Japan-U.S. relations in 1994 that anti-competitive practices such as company-led boycotts, where manufacturers agree not to provide products to discounters to drive them out of business, have been common in Japan. But he said that the U.S. approach to enforcing anti-trust laws is not suitable for Japan because of a tradition of cozy ties between regulators and industry. "The confrontational approach in this country just doesn't work," said Tamura, an adviser to Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC). Tamura said the FTC has been relatively ineffective in part because powerful bureaucracies such as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Finance Ministry have been uncooperative in the interest of protecting their turf. For competition policy to be successfully implemented in Japan, the powerful ministries must be given a role in carrying it out, he said.
