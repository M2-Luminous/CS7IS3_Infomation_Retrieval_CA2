He stressed that the Serb side would choose who will be the mediators in peace negotiations. "The European Union was completely pushed out of the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict after Washington launched its diplomatic initiative," Karadzic. He added that now "a new crisis has been created in which the United States can be proclaimed a warring faction." "This may be the moment for the European Union to return to the political scene in search of solutions to the current conflicts in Bosnia," the Srpska republic president said.
