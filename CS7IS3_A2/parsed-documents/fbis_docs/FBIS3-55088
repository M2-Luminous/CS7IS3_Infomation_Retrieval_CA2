This was announced by "Azerkyzyl" Vice President Valis Ismaylov. "Geotep," he noted, has assumed the purchase of specialized equipment and its delivery to the construction site. Predicted gold reserves in Azerbaijan are assessed at 1,500 tonnes. At the same time other precious metals, silver in particular, will be mined with it. The planned capacity of the first gold extracting plant is five tonnes of ingots a year. It will be possible to reach this level three to four years after the launch of the enterprise.
