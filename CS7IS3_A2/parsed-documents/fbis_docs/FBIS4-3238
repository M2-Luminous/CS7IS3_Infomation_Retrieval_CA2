After listening to speeches made by Guo Xianzhang, Tang Shenjun, and other Lanzhou delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang said: Lanzhou is at once the only hinterland city of Gansu that is open to the outside world and is the capital of Gansu Province. Lanzhou's development has undoubtedly had an important bearing on the province's overall development. Thus, Lanzhou should make every possible endeavor to tap latent potential, develop local superiority, deepen reforms, further economic exploitation, and step up infrastructure construction, especially infrastructure facilities concerning the livelihood of the broad masses of the people, guarantee sufficient vegetables and grain supply on the market, and properly tackle other pressing issues as well. After listening to speeches made by the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang stated: Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture should strive to develop local commercial and circulation superiority, press ahead with economic growth in every way, and successfully build projects to assist poverty-stricken areas. Economic development and nationality solidarity are two crucial issues concerning the development of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, which should make redoubled efforts to enhance nationality solidarity, develop educational undertakings, and push ahead with economic growth. Finally, Secretary Yan Haiwang emphatically called on the whole province to unit as one, work hard, brace up, make down-to-earth efforts, and push Gansu's economic growth to a new stage.
