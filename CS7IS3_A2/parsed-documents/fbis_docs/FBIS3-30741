The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army has reported that they opened fire on the area around the village of Biljani Gornji from recoilless guns and howitzers. Due to the intensity of fire, and because the soldiers, weapons and equipment of the Serb side were endangered, the Serb side was forced to respond. A statement says that while returning fire the Serb side destroyed one tank and one antiaircraft gun belonging to the aggressor. The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army warns that Croatia is using the cease-fire to regroup and bring in fresh forces and equipment to this section of the battlefield.
