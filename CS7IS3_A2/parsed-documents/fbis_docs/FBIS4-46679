Vasilyev On the Results of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock Market" From 29 March through 1 April 1994 in Izhevsk there was an all-Russian conference of check investment funds called "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock Market." The purpose of the conference was to resolve the following problems: 1. Completion of check privatization and solving problems of check investment funds and the development of the stock market in the regions. 2. Consideration of problems of forming the state investment program under conditions of the emerging capital market. 3. Discussion of problems of the development of the infrastructure for the stock market. 4. Consideration of the prospects for privatization of defense industry enterprises. Participating in the conference were more than 100 representatives of various regional check investment funds and representatives of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the Federal Property Fund of Russia, and the Ministry of Economics which, as a result of the discussion, adopted recommendations for further regulation of the activity of check investment funds after the expiration of the validity of the privatization check and further establishment of this institutional investor on the Russian stock market. Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock Market" (Izhvesk 29 March-1 April 1994) Participants in the all-Russian conference think that the check privatization that was conducted contributed to the creation of a foundation for a national stock market. At the present time more than 600 check investment funds are functioning, making up an institutional basis for the market for shares of privatized enterprises. A network of depositories in all regions of the country has been formed. The conference thinks that effective development of the securities market is possible only through consolidation of the efforts of all of its participants and also organs of state power and administration, and it recommends: 1. The Commission on Securities and the Stock Market in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia, the Ministry of Economics of Russia, and the Russian Federal Property Fund should analyze the socioeconomic consequences of check privatization and develop proposals for conducting monetary privatization. 2. The Federal Assembly of Russia should consider as a priority the legislative acts on regulation of the securities market in the activity of joint-stock companies, which should envision a procedure for issuing demand securities and protection of the rights of all stockholders in questions of paying dividends. 3. The State Committee on Administration of State Property and the Ministry of Finance of Russia should consider the question of reducing by 50 percent the profit tax on check investment funds when selling shares in privatized enterprises. 4. The State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia should make changes in the normative documents regulating the activity of check investment funds, particularly: --remove bans and restrictions on investments in securities of a single issuer, promissory notes, term contracts, and real estate; --permit the purchase of one's own shares; --bring the standard regulations of the public joint-stock company approved by Edict No. 721 of the President of 1 July 1991 into line with the "State Program for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation," approved by Edict No. 2284 of the President of 24 December 1993 with respect to determining the composition of the council of directors. 5. To approve on the whole the concept of state regulation of the investment process on the basis of the utilization of instruments of the stock exchange. It should be recommended to the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation that it create a work group for developing the concept with parallel testing of it in a number of regions and publish it in the press for widespread discussion by the scholarly community. 6. The Commission on Securities and the stock exchange should conduct a work conference in order to develop general principles of depository and information activity and prevent the market for depository and information services from being monopolized. 7. Stock market professionals should be guided in their activity by the Code of Professional Conscience of the Participant in the Securities Market. 8. The check investment funds should create work groups for developing a program for the participation of the check investment funds in the development of the organized security market. The Central Check Investment Fund should be instructed to act on behalf of participants in the All-Russian Conference on Parliamentary Hearings in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation concerning the state privatization program. 9. Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference should be published in the central and regional mass media. Participants in the conference consider the most important factor in the establishment of the stock exchange to be the development of depository service on the basis of the utilization of modern communications systems, and they note the positive work experience in this area of the Eurasian Regional Depository. Participants in the securities market may be interested in a new system of satellite communications developed with the participation of the production association Izhevskiy Radiozavod. It should be deemed expedient to increase the number of members of the group for developing a telecommunications system for the stock market, created in compliance with Edict No. 1186 of the President of October 1992, to include representatives of regional check investment funds, the Eurasian Regional Depository, and the main developers of satellite communications systems.
