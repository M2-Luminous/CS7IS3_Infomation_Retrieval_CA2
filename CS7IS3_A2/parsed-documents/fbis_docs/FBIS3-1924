The comrades present at the meeting pointed out: The fight against corruption over the past six months has been smooth; its development has been healthy; phased achievements have been made; and the expected requirements have basically been met. But vigilance in the fight against corruption should not be lowered, because negative and corrupt practices are likely to recur: As soon as you relax, they will come back. In the fight against corruption, no achievement can be made with one battle. Some participants pointed out: We are losing some of the achievements that we made in the previous period of fighting against corruption; in the next period, we should consolidate and develop the achievements we have made and should formulate the relevant laws and regulations to fundamentally resolve problems. This year the fight against corruption will face a heavy task and severe test. Comrades attending the meeting analyzed this issue from the following aspects: --This year is a year of reform, in which many major reform measures will be introduced. How should we increase the impetus of reform, promote development and stability, maintain the impetus of the combat against corruption, and produce better results? This is a serious subject and test which cannot be evaded. Comrades present at the meeting said: The process of deepening reform is a process of adjusting the relations of rights and responsibilities between the state, localities, enterprises, and laborers; this will inevitably involve interests in all areas and cause certain contradictions. Because the impetus of reform is becoming stronger and the formulation of behavior standards is falling behind, there will be an increase in violations of laws, regulations, policies, and systems. All levels of party and government leading institutions and leading cadres should devote more efforts to reform; if they cannot properly "do two types of work simultaneously," a situation will arise in which "one type of work is stressed to the neglect of the other." This will have a direct impact on the fight against corruption and will add to its difficulties. We are facing a prominent practical problem: Deepening reform and extensively adjusting the relations of interests will enhance the vitality of life in society, but will also cause new contradictions and bring about many sensitive problems. This point should be taken into account in the fight against corruption. --The next period of fighting against corruption will develop in a more in-depth way. Will there be a further breakthrough in it? This is also a test. The comrades present at the meeting pointed out: In the previous period of the fight against corruption, comparatively speaking, many achievements were made in looking into the symptoms of problems and in easy areas, but this year's work will involve more obstacles and difficulties as well as an in-depth and fundamental reform of the structure and system. We should make greater efforts. --In this new year, how should we maintain and develop a positive trend in the fight against corruption, preserve the masses' enthusiasm for this fight, and transform their worries into peace of mind and confidence? This is another test for us. The comrades attending the meeting said: The masses' feelings about the fight against corruption can be summed up this way: Their confidence is increasing, but they are still worried. On the one hand, they are happy to see the achievements in the fight against corruption; on the other, they are worried about whether this combat will weaken, cool down, and stop. The masses want the combat against corruption to be continued; they want to see new achievements in it and are unwilling to see a decline after a period of time. If a decline happens, this will seriously damage their initiative against corruption, will turn their hope into disappointment, and will even cause resentment among them. Without the masses' trust, support, or participation, it will be difficult to carry out the fight against corruption. General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech and Comrade Wei Jianxing's report have explicitly arranged this year's work. The comrades present at the meeting pointed out that their task is to ensure the implementation of the speech and report and to work to the satisfaction of the party and masses.
