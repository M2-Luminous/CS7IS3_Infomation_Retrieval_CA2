Do you believe that he really represents the Palestinian people? [Sagi] I believe 'Arafat is not the only one who has been weakened. The Hebron massacre has undermined the ability of Palestinians and Israelis in general to conduct a dialogue. This despicable incident has exposed the raw nerves of the Arab-Israeli conflict -- and especially of the struggle between Palestinians and Israelis -- with all its religious, national, traditional, and cultural aspects. 'Arafat's standing has been greatly weakened in the territories. His pictures are no longer proudly displayed in the homes of the relatives of the Hebron massacre victims. 'Arafat, however, is the symbol of the PLO, which is the largest and most dominant organization. True, 'Arafat is facing a lot of opposition in the territories, even without the massacre, with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] being the most prominent example. Public opinion in the territories, however, is less sensitive to political nuances and cares far more about security, standard of living, and being able to run their own affairs. Clearly, the more difficulty 'Arafat encounters in implementing his agreements with us, the weaker he will become. Time plays a critical role in his success in achieving what he regards as a favorable political settlement. If 'Arafat fails, his position will be undermined even further. [Peri] Let me quote 'Ali Jad, a representative of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jerusalem, who said: "Beware, 'Arafat, you are not going to live for long." [Sagi] These kind of statements are made by the rejectionist organizations which have political representatives as well as militant activists in the territories. [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat's life is in danger? [Sagi] The fact is that the lives of all political leaders who represent only part of their constituents are in danger. I think that 'Arafat's life -- just like the lives of other leaders who represent undemocratic societies -- is in danger. Especially if they take politically daring steps. 'Arafat's life expectancy depends, of course, on his ability to achieve a political arrangement. If and when he fails, we can assume that he will disappear. Paradoxically, if the political arrangement is a success, new and younger leaders from inside the territories will emerge. They are familiar with the conditions, the standard of living, and the security needs. They are much more knowledgeable about daily life than those who live in Tunis. [Peri] Despite the differences between the Palestinians there appears to be one common denominator: they all want a Palestinian state. [Sagi] There is no doubt about that. Their attitude has not changed. Although there is a higher degree of political realism in the territories now, they do not conceal their aspiration to establish a Palestinian state. 'Arafat, like the others, openly speaks about it. We expect them to demand the establishment of a Palestinian state. Moreover, in the Gaza-Jericho First concept, 'Arafat was at great pains to try very hard to include elements with clear links to the permanent arrangement; or in other words, the Palestinian state. [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat will be able to deliver the goods when he arrives in Jericho? [Sagi] There is no doubt that the ideological dream may shatter when he assumes control and is confronted by the harsh and mundane reality. I do not think that 'Arafat was ever very good at handling daily affairs, nor do I believe that they particularly interest him. At any rate, he makes no secret of his ambitions, which are greater than running things in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. In his opinion, he is the president of some sort of political entity. I therefore believe that he will engage in political activities that will necessitate his being abroad most of the time. According to his viewpoint, he would prefer not being mayor of Jericho at this stage. If and when the situation changes, he will set up permanent residence. [Peri] When you talk about 'Arafat's trips abroad, are you referring to fund collection drives? [Sagi] I mean taking care of the Palestinian economy, especially the budget. It is no secret that 'Arafat and very few of his closest associates have total control over the PLO budget. [Peri] The PLO's economic situation is bad. [Sagi] I cannot, understandably, present the PLO budget to the readers. Since the Gulf War the condition of the organization has deteriorated and external budget sources have quite closed up. They have certain reserves indeed, and I understand that the Sumud [as published] which is a senior economic organization controls the budget reservoirs, but in general, in my opinion, the PLO's financial condition is quite dire. [Peri] This is a pessimistic picture of the situation to those who believe it is possible to disintegrate Hamas through financial temptations. [Sagi] The PLO by itself, without outside aid and contributions, cannot for long guarantee control over events in the territories or the development and promotion of projects which will improve the quality of life there. Still, we have more than initial signs which indicate that if and when the Palestinian entity is set up, Hamas people will try to work their way into the system, as individuals if not as an organization, and the PLO leadership will agree. [Peri] You are talking about the PLO leadership, but 'Arafat is a sole ruler, after all. He complains about opposition, but in the end he does as he pleases. [Sagi] In theory, and perhaps also in practice, 'Arafat is a sole decision maker, perhaps also because he is capable of doing so. [Peri] Do the Palestinians in the territories adapt themselves to the idea that they will have to live alongside the settlers? [Sagi] The Palestinian aspiration is for the settlers to disappear naturally, but I believe that both sides, Israelis and Palestinians alike, understand it is better to put disagreements off for a later date, not because the problem will become smaller but with the hope that life will take its course and political maturity will enable the sides to solve this problem. Theoretically, the Palestinians would prefer that the settlements be dismantled and moved to another site, within the Green Line boundaries. I have no doubt that this is a very serious matter which will feature very prominently during deliberations at the next stages. As with the settlers, there is another, problematic and loaded issue: Jerusalem. Both sides agreed to postpone discussion of this issue to later stages. [Peri] To what extent is talk in Israel about the evacuation of settlers from Hebron construed by the Palestinian side as a precedent for the continuation of the negotiations? [Sagi] I would not like to comment on talk in Israel, but it is clear that the more diversified the Israeli positions are, the better the Palestinians' bargaining power becomes. [Peri] You have been following 'Arafat since the beginning of the negotiations. Has he indeed changed? [Sagi] I think you can say 'Arafat fully recognizes and controls his political actions. I am not going to comment on mental states attributed to 'Arafat that I have not observed. [Peri] We have heard about tantrums, shouting, and feet-stomping. Are these tactics? [Sagi] As human beings, we all get angry, and as political or military leaders, we all use different styles to attain goals or make things happen. 'Arafat requires no marks from me, but I would not say he has lost his way or control of himself. [Peri] May we have your assessment on an issue which troubles us all: Will there be Palestinian retribution for the Hebron massacre? [Sagi] Regardless of the various indications, the potential and desire for revenge requires no intelligence verification after such an incident. One cannot lie back and think that since some time has passed the fury will blow over and the incident will be forgotten. Paradoxically, I believe that the more time passes without any dramatic act of revenge, the more we can expect a serious act of revenge. [Peri] You have not calmed me. [Sagi] It is not my duty to calm. My duty is to try and objectively describe what I know and estimate the results. Subjectively, I believe the more time passes, the closer we are to such an incident. [Peri] It seems that you are not only preoccupied with the Syrian issue but it also interests you. Do you see any change with al-Asad's conception of the nature of peace? [Sagi] I have not changed my position about the Syrians' concept and their drive toward a political arrangement, nor about what al-Asad will employ to obtain his goals. Still, noting changes in Syria does not mean that al-Asad, in whom I have taken interest lately, has become friendly to the Zionist idea or more amiable to the State of Israel. I believe that al-Asad understood that Israel is stronger than Syria militarily, and he finds it difficult to reach strategic parity by himself in the face of what he defines as the Israeli threat. He surely feels isolated with his political concept within the Arab world. Despite his cooperation and close ties with Iran, he is very much aware of the danger of the fundamentalist Islamic wave. He understands he is totally isolated, and not only because the Soviet Union vanished but also because there is no super power other than the United States which is prepared to invest in our region. [Peri] Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights from Israel. What exactly does he offer us in return? [Sagi] I think that now more than ever, Syria understands that in return for sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights it will be required -- and I believe it will also agree -- to offer peace with its attendant components, including diplomatic relations. Still, I do not think that al-Asad defined publicly or to himself all components of normalization. [Peri] Why? [Sagi] At least for the tactical reason of conducting negotiations. In my opinion, he will refrain from unveiling the components of peace as long as he can help it. [Peri] From al-Asad's viewpoint, is there any room to talk about full peace without a full withdrawal? Is there room to bargain on the extent of the withdrawal on the Golan? [Sagi] I have not detected any readiness for compromise on al-Asad's part. From his viewpoint, he needs to believe he will receive the entire Golan Heights. Yet al-Asad also understands the other side of the coin, namely, that normalization with Israel is required. There is a very deep psychological gap between the parties, a credibility gap. Each side demands of the other, as a precondition, that thing which he psychologically finds difficult to grant. As long as the gap is not bridged, it is very hard to progress, especially since the Israeli-Syrian negotiations are indeed the key to achieve a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. [Peri] In the meantime, Syria continues to purchase weapons, to build up militarily, and to acquire missiles. [Sagi] Its military buildup is very impressive. The Syrians naturally claim that Israel is doing the same. It is clear the reference is not to two countries that are weakening militarily. It should be noted that as far as al-Asad is concerned, Israel has yet to clearly say "full withdrawal from the Golan Heights." [Peri] From Israel's viewpoint, al-Asad is perceived as a cunning, stubborn political fox that is prepared to patiently lie in ambush for its prey. Can you read him? [Sagi] I hope so. This is how I earn my living at least. Unfortunately, I have not met him yet. I read almost everything written about him that is available to me. I also take an interest in him in terms of intelligence, which has many aspects to it. It would be pretentious of me to say that I know him as I would a family member, but I think I know him well enough to form an opinion. Al-Asad is a very experienced person who knows the Middle East inside out. If I could wish for anything, I would prefer that he knew much more about the Israeli reality. [Peri] He is said to be a man of honor who honors his commitments. [Sagi] He is a man of reason, he is cautious and suspicious, and he has his reasons for this. To a very large degree it is possible to say that he is reliable as long as his interests are served. Proof of this is the disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria on the Golan, in effect since 1974. The stability of this agreement is almost unparalleled on any other border we share with the Arabs. Suffice it to say that if and when he signs an agreement, he will keep his word, but I do not want to engage in a millenial vision here as this would not be a realistic depiction of the situation. There are still deep conflicts between Syria and Israel, and Syria is a very strong military country, a country which builds itself up militarily and which views Israel as its number one enemy. [Peri] I would guess that as the sole leader at the top, al-Asad relies heavily on reports he receives from his intelligence services. [Sagi] I can only hope that this enhances his understanding of Israel and perhaps also of world-wide political reality. To the best of my knowledge, he is under exposed to visits and foreign elements. [Peri] Are we still defined in Damascus as "the Zionist enemy?" [Sagi] We are now the "Israeli enemy." I have no doubt that al-Asad too, not just others, needs to overcome a deep psychological barrier. [Peri] Since the regime in Syria is dictatorial in nature, does he at all need to prepare public opinion for peace with Israel? Will he have opposition? [Sagi] I think he will. This is not, indeed, public opinion in the open, democratic style with which we are familiar, but to change the views of a nation which has been educated and accustomed to a very certain outlook requires time and preparation. Al-Asad mentioned this point in public interviews. He expressed his opinion that it is not only Israel which must prepare public opinion. There is no opposition in Syria preventing al-Asad from pursuing the road he has chosen embarked, but I surely understand what he means when he mentions the need to prepare the masses. [Peri] Did the death of his eldest son, Basil, have an influence on al-Asad's political considerations? [Sagi] I do not know a well-balanced person who would not be affected by the death of his son, but this carries no political influence in my opinion. After all, we are talking about a man with a strong personality. [Peri] But he is not young anymore. Al-Asad is 64 and his health is not so good. What will happen when he dies? [Sagi] I do not know. Naturally, the question is when. I can detect enough stability among today's ruling group -- I am referring to four to five people -- to continue in al-Asad's direction, for a short period of time at least. [Peri] The Egyptians, the go-between between ourselves and Damascus, persist in their claim that an Israeli-Syrian peace accord will be signed within a year. Do you share this assessment? [Sagi] I prefer to be cautious, unless the Egyptians possess information they do not share. I cannot identify anything that would elicit such an unequivocal assumption. This may be a combination of wishful thinking and an assessment, although it is not totally unreasonable. I would be wary of setting such a binding timetable, but I agree that the chance of achieving a political settlement is better than before. Circumstances, as well as each sides' positions, might have reached a level of maturity necessary for such a settlement to become a reality. [Peri] How big a danger is posed to Mubarak's life, in your opinion? [Sagi] Islamic resistance in Egypt is not new, and to the best of my knowledge, President Mubarak and the security forces in Egypt are stable enough to overcome this resistance, not without problems, but Egypt still seems able to manage as far as security and the stability of the regime are concerned. At the same time, it is impossible to dismiss this danger completely. The Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic terror organizations in Egypt believe there is an alternative and that the regime had better be replaced. There is increasing evidence that the numbers are increasing, at least, the number of incidents involving these organizations in Egypt. [Peri] Are you troubled over what will take place if something bad happens to Mubarak? [Sagi] This question, like others, concerns me and requires due attention. Egypt is the leader of the Arab world which marked the road to peace in this world. I think that the Egyptian-Israeli model is a good point of reference to all those who participate in peace negotiations. This is something which the Arab world experienced and, in my opinion, found to be better than anything else. In my opinion, President Mubarak plays a very positive role in his readiness to show the benefits Egypt enjoys from its peace treaty with Israel and in his efforts to try to bridge the gaps between the sides. [Peri] What is King Husayn's state of health? [Sagi] According to official medical bulletins, I think he is in good health. For the time being, and to the best of my judgment, there are no negative implications or side effects. The king functions in a normal, reasonable, and full manner, and I wish him long life. [Peri] What is the condition of Saddam Husayn? [Sagi] Three years after the Gulf War, Iraq's internal problems are worsening, but not enough to threaten Saddam Husayn's control. This is demonstrated by isolation of the Kurdish enclave and the struggle with the Shiite population in the south. Saddam is in control of his army and of security. His regime, although exposed to relatively -- but not sufficiently -- difficult economic and domestic problems, is stable for the time being. On quite a few occasions he has been successful in circumventing the economic embargo on Iraq by cooperating with foreign elements on both official and less official levels. [Peri] What is your opinion of the reports and intimations that Saddam Husayn is interested in joining the peace process? [Sagi] These are merely gimmicks and speculation. They are not worthy of any serious consideration. [Peri] What about the other alternative? Should we expect more nasty surprises from him. [Sagi] Iraq's military capabilities have not improved since the Gulf War. Their order of battle is small. They have maintenance problems and the army has to both protect the regime in Baghdad, deploy around the borders, and confront the Kurds. In addition, they have tense relations with Iran and are deeply involved in a struggle against the Shiites in the south. The Iraqi Army is still large and capable of protecting the regime but the danger of Iraq launching a military campaign against Israel without the backing of a united Arab coalition or some kind of strategic military upheaval in the region is reduced. Obviously, I would prefer not to comment on Saddam Husayn's ambitions, which he may have not renounced. It would be irresponsible of me to say that there were definitely no signs or remnant of Iraq's strategic surface-to-surface missile or chemical warfare capabilities, or even of his continued attempts to develop his nuclear project. If the international supervision efforts are sufficiently effective, they may perhaps guarantee that Iraq will not regain its previous strength. I am not optimistic, however, concerning the effectiveness of the inspection teams. [Peri] Can Israel monitor what is happening in Iraq today? [Sagi] We do our best. But this becomes more difficult as distances grow. I would say that our ability to know what is happening and to monitor developments in Iraq has improved compared to the past. But we will never be able to confidently state that we know everything. I can note with satisfaction that in light of the intelligence need to cover every location whenever possible, the level of cooperation between Israel and other countries has increased. [Peri] Are you referring to our intelligence cooperation with the United States? [Sagi] Yes, but not only that. [Peri] Despite all the warnings, assessments, and information, two IDF soldiers were killed in Lebanon this week. [Sagi] Terrorism in Lebanon is not a new phenomenon. It is merely the scope of terrorist activity that changes. [Peri] Does what happened last week constitute a violation of the understandings reached during "Operation Accountability." [Sagi] I do not think so. It is most infuriating and painful but the way I see things there was no violation of these understandings, except for the firing of the katyusha rockets. Hizballah claims, although I disagree, that operations against the IDF and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the security zone does not violate the understandings we reached. If we retaliate against such activity, the situation will deteriorate. [Peri] Who should restrain them? [Sagi] The question is not who should but rather who is capable of restraining them. Nobody made such a commitment. It is no secret that Syria has the capability to control Hizballah or at least restrict its actions. They know how to do this and try to stop things from getting out of control. [Peri] Now that we are conducting peace talks, do you detect mental blocks or inhibitions among your staff in running a different kind of intelligence service. Is there such a thing as peacetime intelligence? [Sagi] I am not familiar with such an expression. My responsibility is to provide assessments for both the military and political echelons. I would even say that we are responsible for providing economic and technological information in all fields that present a threat to Israel. Only the integration of all these elements enables me to fulfill this responsibility and provide intelligence assessments at the national level. Times have changed and sometimes the emphasis is placed on different things. The way we collect, analyze and process intelligence has also changed. It is the actual assessment report itself that highlights these different aspects. It is important to stress that the IDF Intelligence Branch's top priority is still to give early warning about military threats to the State of Israel. This despite, and perhaps even because of, the political process. The political process undoubtedly forces us to carry out a great deal of study and research. It necessitates our deep involvement. I would like to praise my people, who, despite the emphasis on early warning about military threats, correctly assessed, some three years ago, that a political shift of strategic significance for Israel was taking place. [Peri] Are you primed to identify signs of peace? Tomorrow will mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt, and I remember President 'Ezer Weizman remarking at the time that our intelligence dossiers had not been in step with developments. [Sagi] I think it is our duty, and not only our privilege, to predict such developments. I think we have been successful enough to give Israel time to adequately prepare itself. [Peri] What has really changed in the concepts and modus operandi of the Intelligence Branch since the start of the peace negotiations? [Sagi] The Intelligence Corps is a large body, and not everyone necessarily does the same job. The integration process takes place at the higher levels. Some people handle the military side of things while others deal with the political process. The higher one goes up in the Intelligence hierarchy, the more integration is needed. As for the threats, our intelligence package has greatly expanded. Today, collecting intelligence on threats in Iran, Iraq, or Libya is no longer a fantastic notion. This has a profound impact: we have to invest heavily in people, equipment, input, and in formulating concepts. The political aspect requires additional information-collection investments in people and places. Without singing my own praises, I think we have good intelligence. I do not believe that Israel suffers from an intelligence block that prevents the political echelon from making decisions. [Peri] Did you think that the political process would be as long, winding, complex, and complicated? [Sagi] I said that the process would be complicated and strewn with crises. Difficult, with many stalemates. But the general trend I identified -- and I still adhere to my position -- will be progress toward a political settlement. Whether or not such a settlement will really be achieved depends on both parties. [Peri] What will the Middle East look like in another two years? Will there be peace and open borders or hunger and Islamic terrorism? [Sagi] The fundamental problems will continue. Economic problems will grow worse. There are very serious demographic problems and a lack of resources. The Islamic wave has not reached its crest yet nor has terrorist extremism. On the other hand, additional progress will be made in the political process which will moderate things to a certain degree. We may reach agreement with the Arab world on issues of joint interest. The water problem and the military threat will remain. However, I believe that the Arab countries will not expand their budgets for military buildup purposes. Even Syria, which has systematically built up its army, has not increased its military budget. [Peri] What about war? [Sagi] War is still a threat in the Middle East but that does not mean that the prospects for war have increased. On the contrary, I think that the chances for a war in the foreseeable future have been greatly reduced. The probability of war does not necessarily grow if and when the political process runs into a problem. Nevertheless, if the political process runs aground, developments in Syria will warrant special attention and a higher level of interest from us. [Peri] Who in your opinion is the most intriguing Arab leader? [Sagi] All of them are intriguing. However, I would say that personally I am most interested in al-Asad. He is the Arab leader that can have the most impact on the realization of my assessments. [Peri] During your tenure as head of the Intelligence Branch, which Arab leader has made the most progress? [Sagi] 'Arafat. It is interesting to note that he thinks the same thing about us. He is not alone in this assumption. There are other Arab leaders who think that Israel was the one to come a long way. [Peri] Which Arab country would you like to visit? [Sagi] I would like to go everywhere. I have been to Egypt because that is allowed. [Peri] The hottest topic of discussion in both Israel and the Arab world is the commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. Are you following the hearings? [Sagi] Like every other Israeli citizen. [Peri] And as a major general in the IDF, how do you feel about it? [Sagi] I do not wish to comment on issues outside of my purview. [Peri] Where do you see yourself in another year or two? [Sagi] I hope that I will still be functioning and in good health.
