The secretary general and the Chinese leaders discussed the possibility of increasing our exports to China and the decision to encourage new and constructive bilateral relations. Eduardo Bauza later admitted the possibility of increasing our exports to the PRC, which is a very favorable market for Argentina. [Begin Bauza recording] They are in the middle of an important opening and modernization process. This is a very important delegation because it is headed by one of the most outstanding members of the Chinese Communist Party. Their visit is within the framework of this new Chinese opening to the world. Our current trade exchange with China is not very large. It involves about $270 million in imports from China and approximately $250 million in exports to China per year. Their market has great unexplored potential. China has more than 1.1 billion inhabitants compared with 30 million here, so their market may be entirely favorable for us. [end recording] Asked about other markets for our products, Bauza said other countries are members of the southeastern Asian region because of their development and their purchasing power. [sentence as heard] Bauza said he believes Argentina is growing up and going out into the world to offer its products. The Chinese delegation is headed by Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo and a deputy of the Chinese National People's Congress. The delegation includes (Li Semin), (Tan Iongui), and (Liu Pein) who are the directors of the Latin American International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party.
