EPA is proposing that the enhanced ILEV fleet program be applicable to only vehicles purchased by covered fleet operators in the South Coast due to the fact that even with all the additional emission controls being proposed today, the South Coast is still not projected to in compliance with the ozone NAAQS by 2010. EPA requests comment on extending the enhanced ILEV fleet program to the other two FIP areas. EPA also requests comment on whether the program should be revised to ensure that vehicle turnover does not become artificially low in response to the enhanced ILEV fleet program but rather remains at or near current levels. B. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Heavy-duty Vehicles 1. Applicability EPA is proposing that the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program be applied to all new engines used in on-highway vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVWR, beginning in model year 1999. All such heavy-duty vehicles offered for sale or registered exclusively in California will need to comply with the enhanced vehicle standards described in the sections which follow. (As described in the section on 49-state vehicles, importation of heavy-duty vehicles not complying with the requirement of this program is prohibited after 1999.) Requirements that apply to multi-state registered vehicles are discussed later, in section B(7). The enhanced vehicle program would, as an option, allow manufacturers to certify engines for use in MDVs of GVWR between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds to engine-based standards, similar to the approach taken in California's program. However, such vehicles would need to meet all of the requirements of the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program described in the sections below. The application of the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program on a statewide basis is considered necessary because of the large volume of heavy-duty vehicle traffic flow into and out of the areas covered by the FIP. Any program requiring usage of enhanced vehicles only in the FIP areas would be extremely difficult to implement and enforce. Also, EPA is concerned about the emissions from HDVs from other states operating in the FIP areas, and about the potential for an increase in this interstate traffic due to higher costs associated with enhanced HDVs. This issue is addressed in section B(6). As with light-duty vehicles, EPA is interested in the possibility of achieving earlier inventory reductions by phasing in new vehicle emission standards sooner. The inventory reduction achieved by earlier implementation could reduce the rate at which heavy-duty vehicle turnover would have to occur. Therefore, in addition to requesting comment on the program proposed below, EPA requests comment on an earlier phase-in, requiring a portion of the 1998 model year heavy-duty vehicles sold to meet the enhanced vehicle requirements. 2. Authority As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section 110(c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that the state could take and EPA believes that it, acting on behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt a motor vehicle program or supplement California's own motor vehicle program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the criteria of section 209(b) for a waiver of federal preemption. These criteria are discussed above in the context of the enhanced light-duty vehicle program.
