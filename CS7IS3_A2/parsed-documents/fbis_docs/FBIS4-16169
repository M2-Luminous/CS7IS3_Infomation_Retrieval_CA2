For example, in the days of the Ottoman empire it advocated the protection of the Christian peoples, who needed support in their national liberation struggle. Later, during World War I, the Russian emperor accomplished a special Christian exploit by standing up for fraternal Serbia -- in many ways a suicidal step. In World War II Yugoslavia was our ally. But in the cold war era our interests were better served by a neutral Yugoslavia, which made it easier to organize strategic defense in the southwest sector. As the Russian president's special envoy who deals directly with the questions of Yugoslavia, how would you express Russia's present-day interest in the Balkans? [Churkin] In the first place it seems to me that Russia, as a great European power, has an interest in a stable Europe. But there cannot be a stable, peaceful Europe without stability in the Balkans. That is axiomatic and it stems from the historical experience which you spoke about. In addition, the war in former Yugoslavia is crippling the whole region because economic and cultural ties are breaking down and normal political cooperation has stopped. The fact is that because of the traditional ties that we have with the Serbs and with other peoples of this region, Russia can play a role in a settlement. Furthermore, the world has finally come to realize recently that without Russia there can be no settlement in the Balkans at all. Here, it seems to me, we have traveled a complex path in the development of our diplomatic line: Moscow has moved from what was to some extent an anti-Serb position to a more complex maneuver in which it began to use its channels of communication with the Serbs so as to encourage their constructive approaches to a political settlement.... We also have economic interests and opportunities. We now have quite good economic ties with Croatia. Just look at how many different firms from the former Yugoslavia there are in Moscow. Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian firms -- despite all the sanctions-related difficulties those firms are still in Russia. So I think that our interest is manifold -- political, economic, and psychological. [Sidorov] Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of state, was once asked the secret of his diplomatic skill. He said it was that he always told the truth. This sounds paradoxical -- diplomats usually employ a lot of flowery language for just one purpose -- to hide what they are really thinking. Tell us the truth, how does the West understand the thesis that the settlement in the Balkans is impossible without Russia, and how do you understand it? [Churkin] You have asked quite a complex question. It is hard for me to say how the West views this. I proceed from the premise that the Americans, for example, have stated to us authoritatively at the very highest level that they do not see the possibility of settling this conflict without Russia. Furthermore, these declarations have been backed up by practical actions. The result of those actions is that we are in constant contact with the U.S. representative, Redman, virtually every day. We discuss the strategy and tactics of future actions. When in the past couple of weeks we put forward the initiative of holding meetings with the Krajina Serbs and the Croatians to conclude a cease-fire agreement, which took place in our embassy in Zagreb 30 March, the Americans were involved in this. And they did their part of the work honorably. Even though this was a purely Russian initiative. So, based on the principle of truthfulness, I would put the question plainly in these terms: Russia must take a most active part in the Yugoslav settlement. Otherwise it will not be possible to bring the sides together and reach the agreement everyone needs. [Sidorov] It is obvious that without the solution of the Serbian national question there will be no real settlement and peace in the Balkans. [Churkin] I entirely agree with you, of course. [Sidorov] The West, in my view, has its own concept of the settlement. In a certain sense the United States openly supported the historic striving of the Croats and Muslims for self-determination. Is Russia ready to support the Serbs living outside Serbia and Montenegro in their legitimate striving for self-determination? [Churkin] First I would like to draw attention to the following fact. The United States put forward the concept of a Croatian-Muslim federation and a confederation between it and Croatia based on the sovereign rights of the Croatians and Muslims. But this does not mean the creation of an ethnically pure Croatian or Muslim state. On the contrary, this concept is based on a mix of Croatians and Muslims within the framework of a federation inside a single state. Plus a definite linkup [pristegivaniye] through a confederation with Croatia. What are we ready to do and what have we already achieved in the light of these proposals from the Americans? We have achieved recognition of the fact that the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be resolved unless it is taken into account that in Bosnia-Herzegovina there are three peoples capable of forming a state [gosudarstvoobrazuyushchiy narod], each of which, including the Serbs, has its own sovereign rights and can make its own sovereign decisions. There is also the understanding that the solution of the problems of the regions of Croatia which the United Nations is protecting and the Serbs inhabit is also impossible without full regard for their rights. [Sidorov] It is very difficult to try to understand what is happening outside the historical context or if you do not know how the conflict began. After all, it has long been known that it was not the Serbs who began the "ethnic cleansing" itself. [Churkin] It is curious that each side has a completely opposing view on absolutely all questions, including history. But there is something that I would like to stress now. The world community, I am sure, will never accept that national problems be resolved by the forcible expulsion of the representatives of other nationalities. Unfortunately, all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia embroiled in the conflict did not understand sufficiently that it is necessary to take into account the national interests of other peoples. That is what ultimately led to the conflict. [Sidorov] There are several internal causes of the conflict. But the Balkans have always been a sphere of interests of the great powers. Stability emerged there when they found a balance of those interests. In my opinion, the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims would have reached agreement long ago if there had not been outside interference. Let us take the policy of united Germany. Its interest was shown, among other things, in the fact that former FRG Foreign Minister H.-D. Genscher did his utmost to secure the recognition of Croatia from the members of the EC. Even though nine Community members opposed the premature recognition of Croatia, where hostilities were in progress. This was how "international recognition" of the forcible breakup of Yugoslavia began. Russia sided with the EC at that time. You surely were right when you said that this was more an anti-Serb position in Russian policy, which is generally speaking uncharacteristic of our relations with that people. After all, this was the destruction of the state in which the Serbian question and indeed other questions had been historically resolved. It was destroyed in the name of supporting the self-determination of the national republics. [Churkin] No, I did not say that with regard to this specific question. What I said generally was that we were pursuing a more subtle policy. But let us examine this issue. It is a very important question. I hold the completely opposite viewpoint. It is that no matter how hard we -- the intermediaries, peacemakers, call it what you will -- try, until the sides themselves agree, until they decide that the time has come to make peace and reach agreement, there will be no peace. And no one can help them there. Now about Genscher and Germany's role. My view of matters is this. I would not disagree if you said to me that Germany wanted to see Croatia and Slovenia as independent states. They have their own historic ties. But it would be an exaggeration to say that Germany's position and the sentiments there were the prime cause of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The decision on recognition, even it was a mistake, as events subsequently showed, was motivated by the desire to prevent the spread of war. But what happened was the complete opposite, as can be seen particularly clearly in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It seems to me that one lesson for the international community must be that it should have shown a certain modesty. There are international conflicts which cannot be prevented or settled merely by the authority of the international community. It is necessary to begin by understanding the logic of what is going on and not to immediately try to impose some kind of decisions. [Sidorov] But yet the international community, as you call it in general terms, even though it consists of specific states with specific interests, and despite the warnings of many politicians, is recognizing Croatia, followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina. And then, to the roar of the guns, it seemed to say as an aside: This was a misunderstanding. It seems strange to me that Western diplomats could make so many mistakes. Is there not some other factor in evidence here? Perhaps the geopolitical cataclysms of the period of the disintegration of the USSR encouraged the temptation to "capture" spheres of influence in the Balkans, too? [Churkin] Well, clearly this was influential. Admittedly, I do not know whether we should seek some evil design here. This is simply how things coincided. As the experts attest, people began talking about the danger of the disintegration of Yugoslavia back in 1980. In other words, it all began earlier over there. Probably if at that time we had not been so absorbed with our own internal problems we could have played a more energetic role in the international arena. And perhaps if we had acted jointly with others we could have alleviated or even prevented some things. But this is all hypothetical and, as we know, the hypothetical does not exist in history. [Sidorov] Do you never get the impression that the war in Bosnia has nevertheless served someone's external interests? A unique, controllable crisis has arisen against the background of which various peace plans have appeared only to disappear. While essentially what we have is the division of Bosnia in two -- between the Serbs and the Croats. [Churkin] I do think so. I can say this because I have conversed on this topic with Muslims, with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic. There are politicians who have not deemed feasible or correct any solution which would lead to the creation of a Muslim state, albeit a small one, in Bosnia. This concerns even plans for a union out of the three republics. Even here they have seen the specter of the emergence of a Muslim state, fearing that the union would subsequently collapse while the state remained. On the other hand, there are very many questions which are intertwined here. But it is difficult for me to imagine a rational, cool decision by the world community that it is necessary to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina in two, as this creates an extremely dangerous precedent of national demarcation as a result of war. As far as the most promising ways of securing a political solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned, however, it seems to me that what we could have is the creation of a union in Bosnia and Herzegovina consisting of two parts -- a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic, or that part could be called something else. With the capital in Sarajevo. Here each part of the union will possess pretty extensive rights, but the territorial integrity of the state will nevertheless be preserved. [Sidorov] I would like to return to what we started with -- Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement. As I see it, former Yugoslavia was a bipolar country. At the one pole you had Slovenia and Croatia, which gravitated toward the West, and at the other Serbia and Montenegro, traditional representatives of Eastern Christian culture. Such a state could exist as a single, stable formation only when you had a geopolitical balance between East and West. When people began talking about the need for Russia to be more active in the Balkans, I thought perhaps the West had realized that the world needs a distinctive role by Moscow which would restore some kind of balance in Europe. But, you know, you can only get a balance when Russia speaks in its own voice. Let the Americans play the banjo, while the Russians play the balalaika. It's a fine instrument, after all. [Churkin] I simply have to agree with what you have said. But here a host of questions can harbor a host of subtexts. I will not enter into interpretation, because those who loudly demand, say, the restoration of the Warsaw Pact or the Soviet Union sometimes start exploiting the logic of discussion. That is history. What happened happened because of certain historical causes. This has undoubtedly had negative consequences. And both we ourselves and to some extent Yugoslavia too have suffered from this. But we are returning to major international affairs undoubtedly because in a certain sense the period of maturation of Russian foreign policy is complete. It has been very difficult for us, because it would be fundamentally wrong to suppose that Russia is the same as the former Soviet Union, only smaller. A new geopolitical situation, a very complex, multidirectional play of forces had arisen. And time was needed to grasp our position in the world, to sense our potential, to curb the chaotic processes under way on our borders, and to get a precise idea of the approaches of our partners -- not only Western partners but our Eastern partners too -- toward the new Russia. And then to adopt clearer stances in affairs which go beyond the crises happening literally on Russia's borders.
