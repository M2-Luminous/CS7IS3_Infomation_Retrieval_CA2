In addition to a cultural agreement, the ministers also signed a framework agreement for the "promotion of cooperation in alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident." According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel stressed Germany's interest in stability in Belarus and recommended participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace, which he called an important building block for an all-European security architecture. At a subsequent press conference, Kravchanka was restrained in his comments and only called the offer "interesting." The cutting off of gas supplies by Russia is not a political problem, but only due to bureaucratic "problems of accounting," Kravchanka said. In the reduction of conventional armament, Belarus has become a collection pond of about 2,000 tanks so far, the scrapping of which it cannot carry out on its own. It asked France, Great Britain, and Germany for financial and technological aid. Belarus' greatest tragedy is, however, still the Ukrainian Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Almost the entire territory was contaminated by the radioactive fall-out, which moved northwest. An increasing number of lethal cases of thyroid cancer in children has given Belarus a sad front ranking in the international statistics, Kravchanka stated.
