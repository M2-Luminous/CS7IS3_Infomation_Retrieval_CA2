FBIS4-9728 "drlat063_c_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-063 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 MEXICO Poll: More Guadalajara Residents To Vote for PRI Poll: More Guadalajara Residents To Vote for PRI PA3103152294 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 30 Mar 94 p 12 PA3103152294 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO Spanish BFN [Report by Maria Eugenia Mondragon] [Text] The number of Guadalajara voters who will vote for the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] in the August presidential elections increased from 49.2 percent to 64.6 percent, according to a poll carried out by the Opinion Studies Center (CEO) the day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was murdered. CEO Director Cesar Morones Services explained that due to a lack of time, the poll was to find out what the citizens' state of mind was following Colosio's murder. The survey was only conducted in Guadalajara and not in the 13 cities of Jalisco initially planned. The survey results showed that the 49.2 percent of the people who would vote for PRI increased to 64.6 percent. In contrast, the 11.4 percent of the people who would vote for the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] dropped to 6.1 percent. The people who would vote for PAN [National Action Party] increased from 15.0 percent to 17.3 percent. A Voluble Judgment Morones Servin explained that the results do not predict what will happen in the 21 August elections, but they do reflect the way the people felt at the time they were polled in the street. "The citizens' opinion can change when they get to the ballot boxes," he said. According to the poll, 12.7 percent of the people in Guadalajara believe the PRI is guilty of Luis Donaldo Colosio's death; 14.4 percent say Mario Aburto killed him on his own; and 24.2 percent say they do not know. Although it was reported yesterday that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is the PRI's new presidential candidate, the citizens of Guadalajara favored Manuel Camacho Solis as the proper person to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio. On a personal basis, Morones Servin said preference for the PRI had increased in Guadalajara after Colosio's death because "citizens voted in favor of the country's political stability." He added: "Citizens reject any violence manifested in the country." According to the poll, he added, support for the PRI increases when violence occurs "so that it can guarantee what it has given us for so many years: stability. Colosio left PRI preferences very high and held a great gap between his candidacy and that of his closest opponent." It is possible, however, for the new candidate to change those conditions, he asserted. The CEO, a decentralized organization of the University of Guadalajara, held its first pre-electoral poll from 16 to 22 March. As a result of the 23 March events, some of the information gathered by the CEO was superseded. Other information, however, such as how many people want to vote, how many have their photo ID's, and the degree of trust in the electoral organizations remain valid. Poll in 13 Cities The CEO held its first poll in 13 cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa, Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, and Puebla. The CEO considers these cities to represent 32 percent of the country's total population, that is, one out of every three citizens in the republic had the possibility of being polled. This makes the survey very representative. In those 13 cities, 78.6 percent said they would vote in the upcoming elections; 8.5 percent said they would not vote; and 10.0 percent have still not decided. This shows people are very interested in participating. If this is the case, abstentionism will be surmounted. Of the total number of people polled, 81.7 percent said they already had their photo ID's and 15.2 percent said they did not have them. Regarding the people who said they did not have their ID's, 41.3 percent said they were being processed but they had not received it yet; 23.8 percent said they had not requested their cards; and 9.5 percent had not picked the card up yet. Regarding the degree of trust that the upcoming elections will be honest, 45.5 percent said they did not believe in electoral honesty; 20.7 said they did; and 27.8 percent did not know. Asked if foreign observers would give the electoral process more security and credibility, 54.1 percent said no; 29.6 percent said probably; and only 14.3 percent said yes. Opinions on the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) were divided because 37.3 percent do not believe it is a trustworthy organization; 34.3 percent do; and 26.4 percent did not answer. With regard to the main national problem that the next president will have to attend, 23.8 percent said it was to improve the people's purchasing power; 21.0 percent considered it to be increasing the number of jobs; 14.2 percent said the main problem to be confronted was to have clean elections; and 16.8 percent believed it was the quality and quantity of education. The opinions of the people polled were even more divided with regard to the personal characteristics a presidential candidate should have. Most of the people polled (32.4 percent) said he has to be responsible; 20.9 percent said intelligent; 22.2 percent said honest; 3.0 percent said intelligent [as published]; 3.9 said he has to be a peacemaker; 5.0 percent said strong; and 7.1 percent did not answer. All of this data, said Morones Servin, is subject to "natural" variations. The CEO, however, will conduct six more polls to survey the citizens' feelings. The results of the last poll will be announced on 15 August.
