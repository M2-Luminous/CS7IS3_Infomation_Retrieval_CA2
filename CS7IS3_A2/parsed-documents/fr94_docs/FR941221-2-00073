FR941221-2-00073 FR941221-2-00060 National Park Service Notice of Intent to Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Heard Museum, Phoenix, AZ AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior ACTION: Notice Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate a cultural item presently in the possession of the Heard Museum, Phoenix, AZ, that meets the definition of ``sacred object'' under section 2 of the act. The item consists of a rawhide bandolier, 13 inches in diameter, decorated with small shells, a cobalt-blue glass bead, two natural crystals and an obsidian arrow point. The bandolier is wrapped with wide rawhide strips and fringed. The bandolier was acquired by the Heard Museum in 1974 as part of a larger group of items donated by Woodard's Indian Arts. No information has been obtained relative to the acquisition of the items by Woodard's Indian Arts. The original museum records identify the object as NA-SW-NA-J&hyph;183, a Navajo rawhide necklace. In November, 1993, the Museum supplied a summary of its holdings identified as ``Navajo'' to authorized representatives of the Navajo Nation. In May, 1994, a representative of the Navajo Nation Cultural Preservation Office examined the collection and the bandolier was identified as a sacred object. The item was further identified in an October, 1994 letter from the Navajo Nation as used in the Enemy Way ceremony. In the letter dated November 7, 1994 Representatives of the Navajo Nation identified the bandolier as one needed, `` *ยง**so that the rawhide necklace can be re-initiated for the coming seasons. This particular item is not meant to be in the hands of non-Navajos because it is used in ceremonies that involve cleansing from foreigners.'' Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Heard Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between the bandolier and the Navajo Nation. Officials of the Heard Museum have also determined that the bandolier meets the definition of sacred object pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C). The Museum's Board of Trustees agreed to deaccession the item on November 23, 1994, in preparation for repatriation. This notice has been sent to officials of the Navajo Nation, Ramah Navajo Chapter, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this cultural item should contact Martin Sullivan, Director, The Heard Museum, 22 E. Monte Vista Road, Phoenix Arizona 85004&hyph;1480, telephone (602) 252&hyph;8840 before January 20, 1995. Repatriation of the cultural item to the Navajo Nation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. Dated December 15, 1994. Francis P. McManamon Departmental Consulting Archeologist, Chief, Archeological Assistance Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31259 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;F
