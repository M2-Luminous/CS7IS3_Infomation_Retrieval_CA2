The Higher Appeal Court [Gjykata e Kasacionit], the Albanian judiciary final resort, has had its final say: The 10 former functionaries of the Albanian Workers Party must pay a total of more than 2 million leks. But this is not all. The presiding judge, although confirming the charge made by the Tirana District Court of "creating social inequality by colluding to create privileges," has softened the sentence of the Appeal Court by reducing the number of years that those convicted will spend languishing in prison cells. Thus the trial of the blockmen has concluded in Tirana, and with it one of the chapters in the history of communism in Albania. Judge Zef Nika issued his final verdict in one of the Higher Appeal Court's halls at 1400 on Thursday [17 March], by announcing: "A conclusion to the civil case obliging all those convicted to pay the following sums in compensation to the Government Services Directorate: Qirjako Mihali, 227,944 leks; Pali Miska, 213,086 leks; Besnik Bekteshi, 257,733 leks; Vangjel Cerrava, 128,834 leks; Prokop Murra, 269,439 leks; Llambi Gegprifti, 195,023 leks; Muho Asllani, 168,357 leks; Hajredin Celiku, 142,787 leks; Foto Cami, 202,154 leks; and Lenka Cuko, 283,220 leks." The Higher Appeal Court has also reduced by a total of 13 years the sentences given by the Appeal Court to the blockmen. Qirjako Mihali, Foto Cami, and Lenka Cuko profit most from this, with reductions of two years each. The others' sentences are reduced by one year each. The final stage of the blockmen's trial began at 1230 in the Higher Appeal Court. As the law demands, this time the accused were not present in court, and only their lawyers faced the bench of three. The blockmen's defense was heard for the last time for almost 40 minutes, as their lawyers asked for a reduction in their sentences, considering them to be "excessively severe". Prokop Murra's lawyer asked for a review of the verdicts of the Tirana District Court and of the Appeals Court that had among other things stripped him of the decorations and medals he had received. "At least let the decorations awarded for the period of the National Liberation War be recognized." Only a few minutes sufficed to read the accusations and to come to the end of this vitally important trial. Now the accusations have also been finally defined. The Higher Appeal Court has left intact the charge leveled by Tirana District Court of "creating social inequality by colluding to create privileges," and has overthrown the Appeal Court's "collusion for the abuse of office." Judge Nika also left in force the decision to remove titles and decorations, refusing to make an exception, as Prokop Murra's defense counsel had requested, for those awarded for the period of the war.
