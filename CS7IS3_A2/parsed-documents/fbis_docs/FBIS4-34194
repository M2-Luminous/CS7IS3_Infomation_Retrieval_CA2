However, in the wake of numerous statements on individual positions each president has regarding the Cuban issue, the U.S. economic blockade, and President Fidel Castro's unexpected speech yesterday, the leaders decided to meet or have lunch here at the convention center to discuss, behind closed doors, the positions presented on the Cuban case. Later on, at approximately 2100 GMT, the last working session will be held. Tonight, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem will close the event. They will be the only speakers at the ceremony.
