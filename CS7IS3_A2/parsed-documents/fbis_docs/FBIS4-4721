They worry because the departments and officials of the government are expressing different views. We requested an urgent interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu who returned home yesterday from his visits to China, the United States, the UN Headquarters, and Japan. How are you, Mr. Minister? You were on the spot when the UN Security Council issued its presidential statement. How would you appraise it? [Han Sung-chu] The UN Security Council's action came in the form of a presidential statement. It is more important how many countries supported it and how strong the wording of the statement is than the form itself, whether it is the presidential statement or a council resolution. The permanent member states, including China, and all the 10 nonpermanent member states supported the presidential statement. Therefore, the statement has considerable weight. With the participation of China in the efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, the success of the presidential statement is appreciable. [Yi] The preconditions for the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks were North Korea's acceding to the inspection and the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys. There are views expressed, from the government, particularly the Foreign Ministry, that the envoy exchange can be withdrawn from the preconditions. What really is happening to this issue? [Han] The Foreign Ministry has never come up with that policy. There is no change in our government's position. Our position, as well as the U.S. position, remains unchanged that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can only be held after the envoy exchange is made. [Yi] North Korea rejected the UN Security Council's presidential statement as soon as it was issued. North Korea says that it cannot accede to the resumption of inspections. Furthermore, it claims that it should normalize its nuclear activities. What is the government measure to cope with this? [Han] North Korea is very repulsed by the UN Security Council's presidential statement. North Korea seems to be perturbed by the participation of China in the issuance of the statement. We will endeavor with continuous discussion and cooperation with the United States, Japan, China, and all other countries concerned, so that the objective of the UN Security Council's presidential statement may be fulfilled. [Yi] Attention is focused on the recent remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who said that North Korea has already developed two nuclear weapons. What is your view of this? [Han] Secretary Perry is concerned that his remarks are often reported with exaggeration. He has never said, commenting on the North Korean nuclear capability, that North Korea has two nuclear weapons. One has no proof supporting one's statement on the number of the nuclear weapons North Korea has. We have to make efforts to prevent North Korea from making any further development of nuclear weapons.
