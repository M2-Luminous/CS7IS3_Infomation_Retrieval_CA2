It Will Soon Have a President"] [Text] One of the latest pledges of Buryatia Supreme Soviet deputies to the population, which has slowly been "coming to the boil," has been acted upon. The parliament session has adopted a constitution in whose first chapter the republic near Lake Baykal recorded its adherence to the idea of constructing a democratic, rule-of-law state as part of the Russian Federation. Buryatia's political circles have generally proclaimed, and are proclaiming now, their loyalty to Moscow while not concealing their recent dissatisfaction with the correction of the president's and the federal government's economic course. In its turn, the emergence of "quiet opposition" in Ulan-Ude is connected with the so far blurred, after the adoption of the republic's new Fundamental Law, political prospects. Under the Constitution, state power shall be exercised in Buryatia by a nationally elected president, a numerically small (55 persons) professional parliament (People's Khural), government, and courts of law. Future presidents shall be elected by popular vote for four years. The deputies insisted that future candidates should know the republic's economy well and be able to speak two state languages -- Buryat and Russian. The future head of state shall form the government team, but unlike the team, he shall not be accountable to parliament. In addition to the Constitution, the session, which is continuing, will pass republican laws "On Presidential Elections," "On Elections for the People's Khural," and "On Organs of Self-Government." According to observers' assessments, however, the main struggle between parties, movements, and blocs is still ahead. Shortly before the Constitution was adopted, the founding congresses of agrarians, young people, and athletes, who stated their preferences, took place in Ulan-Ude. It was not for nothing that there was a stir in Ulan-Ude around the court examination of a 50-million ruble libel suit brought by Buryatia parliament speaker Leonid Potapov against the parliament-government newspaper BURYATIYA. Incidentally, the newspaper filed a countersuit last Monday accusing Leonid Potapov of lying, and demanding that he pay 100 million rubles.
