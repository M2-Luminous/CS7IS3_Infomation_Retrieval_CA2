[Begin recording] [Perez] You cannot mistreat a man who has struggled 50 years for Venezuela and has twice been president of the Venezuelans! [Unidentified reporter] The terms of the document.... [Perez, interrupting] The Venezuelans believe in me! [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Perez] The fact is there are no charges against me. That is a...[pauses] that report published in EL UNIVERSAL is shameful. The fact is there is no evidence about anything, yet the charges against me are incredible. I am accused of helping stabilize democracy in Nicaragua and that the person who received Venezuelan state security funds was President Violeta Chamorro, an prominent Latin American woman. This accusation is interference in the executive branch's purview of international relations. [end recording] The former president reiterated that under no circumstances does the law allow him to reveal how the secret funds were spent. [Begin Perez recording] No one knows how the secret funds were distributed because it is a secret, and the law forbids me to reveal that. Second, there is absolutely no evidence or proof of anything. Third, international relations is the exclusive purview of the president of the Republic, meaning the executive branch, and the CSJ is interfering in the executive branch's activities when it tries to establish guidelines for how to handle the state's foreign security affairs. [end recording] Following these statements, former President Perez left the PTJ facilities and went to the site of his imprisonment, that is El Junquito Jail. The triumphant way in which the former president left was surprising--waving to all those had gathered in front of the PTJ building.
