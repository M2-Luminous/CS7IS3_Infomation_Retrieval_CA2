FBIS4-60350 "drnes100_s_94007" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Iran Editors Refuse To Meet U.S. Counterparts Editors Refuse To Meet U.S. Counterparts U.S. Media's `Black Record' Cited NC2105115094 Tehran KEYHAN in Persian 14 May 94 p 2 NC2105115094 Tehran KEYHAN Persian BFN [Commentary by the Public Relations Department of KEYHAN Publications] [Text] The respected director general of foreign press and mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has sent a letter to the chief editors of the country's newspapers, inviting them to attend a meeting with 13 chief editors of American publications affiliated with the Association of American Editors which is to be held at the ETTELA'AT publications office this afternoon. The respected director general's letter does not indicate who invited this 13-man delegation and what the objective behind this dialogue is. He also does not clarify if the dialogue with the Iranian chief editors is the only program or if something else has also been planned. The choosing of the ETTELA'AT offices as the venue of this meeting gives rise to the strong belief that the American chief editors have been invited by ETTELA'AT Publications to Iran! If this is so, then the question is: On what criterion was this invitation based? And if there was no criterion, then what is happening? The letter from the director general for foreign mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to the Public Relations Department of KEYHAN Publications invites some of the chief editors of KEYHAN Publications to attend a dialogue with the American chief editors. Since the aspects of this dialogue have not been clarified and the experience of the past few years has clearly shown that the American mass media, namely American publications, have continuously had a spiteful attitude toward the Muslim people and the Islamic revolution, and since the ugly and black record of the American mass media and publications shows that they have always distorted facts and disseminated false reports in order to poison public opinion toward Islamic Iran and its people, none of the chief editors of KEYHAN Publications will attend the meeting. The esteemed Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is asked to give more explanations on why this invitation was extended and what the objectives behind it are.
