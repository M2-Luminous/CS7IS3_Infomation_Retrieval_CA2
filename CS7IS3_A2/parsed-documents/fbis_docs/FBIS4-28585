A ministry source said there have been reports that dissident Burmese may try to protest the presence of Burmese representatives and try to obstruct them from attending the meeting that begins July 11. Foreign Affairs Division director Praphakon Samiti said some Burmese students at Ban Maniloi, also called the Burmese Students Centre, which is located in Ratchaburi province's Pak Tho district had telephoned private organisations and the mass media, and tried to project a negative image of the centre. There are now about 150 Burmese students at the centre, 20 of them women. Deputy Interior permanent secretary for security affairs Chaloem Phromloet, meanwhile, has ordered Ratchaburi authorities to take preventive measures and at the same time instructed Burmese students and people living in the vicinity of Ban Maniloi, who have lately been locked in confrontation, to exercise restraint and try to settle their problems in an amicable way. To that end, he has issued the following instructions: -- Students who feel they are not being justly treated should lodge a complaint with the provincial governor who may set up a committee to investigate their complaint. -- Students are to refrain from causing trouble, hurting authorities or damaging anyone's property otherwise they will be subject to legal action. -- Provincial authorities are to seek cooperation from local villagers to ensure that they don't beat up Burmese students, or they will face legal action.
