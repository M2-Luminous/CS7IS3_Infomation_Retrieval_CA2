"It will also bring a turnabout as compared to the preceding forty years, the underlying cause of economic decline and social disintegration in the past four years," he said. The chairman of Hungary's biggest opposition party addressed a celebration, marking the fifth anniversary of the approval of the "The Program of Transforming the Regime", the first party manifesto on democratic transition, a document which later became known as the "Blue Book". On this occasion, the Free Democrats came forward with an electoral manifesto entitled "Turnabout, Stability, and Growth". The Free Democrats intend to become determining factors in the new government which will dismiss the current coalition, Peto said. The SZDSZ will only form a coalition with any party if it becomes authorized by its membership at a delegates' assembly after the elections, he said. "The main question of the elections is whether the government to follow the present coalition will be led by liberals or socialists," the SZDSZ chairman said.
