On 12 December six persons, including (Wu Yanguang) and (Wang Xingwu), from Changting County in Fujian Province, flew to Dalian from Fuzhou. The trip was arranged by (Zheng Yuguan), head of a local illegal emigration ring. They were waiting to leave the country there. A certain individual called Wang, head of the illegal ring at the Bayuquan Harbor, hid the six illegal emigrants in the cargo hold of a foreign ship on the early morning of 18 December after his several-day scheme. When the foreign ship was sailing on the sea area of Yantai, the ship's crew discovered the stowaways. In line with the relevant regulations, the ship's captain handed over the six illegal emigrants to the embankment inspection station. Upon receiving the report sent by the embankment inspection station of Yantai, the border-defense inspection station at the Bayuquan Harbor dispatched its personnel to Yantai to take the stowaways back, captured the individual called Wang and detained him for investigation, and cooperated with the local public security organs in line with the clues confessed by the stowaways. The case is being further investigated.
