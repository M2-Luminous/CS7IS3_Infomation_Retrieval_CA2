Can you tell us more about the arrangements reached in Cairo last night? [Peres] No, I prefer reporting about things that have been finalized, and that has not yet been finalized. Important progress has been made though. [Zissowitz] What points are still left open? [Peres] There is unfinished business on both issues discussed. [Zissowitz] Including the issue of the Palestinian police force? [Peres] Yes, there are problems of numbers and powers, but I do not want to go into that because it only increases the gaps while negotiations are still in progress. But the very fact that the negotiations are back on track and progress can be made on them is the most important thing that took place in Cairo. [Raz] Mr. Peres, I would like to ask you about the Palestinian police. Although things have not yet been finalized, how will it be possible to maintain security there since so many elements are involved? [Peres] There might be many elements, but there will be one element responsible for all decisions dealing with opening fire. There will be no negotiations during an operation. [Raz] What will happen for instance if the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has an operation against a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] squad, as was the case this week, and the Palestinian police force is deployed between the IDF and the structure in which the terrorists are holed up? [Peres] We continue to have overall responsibility for security in the territories. We will not and cannot free ourselves of that responsibility. The State of Israel will continue to be responsible for the lives of all the people and will act against those who endanger lives, whether of Jews or Arabs. [Zissowitz] Is it clear to whom the armed Palestinian police will be subordinate? [Peres] I do not want to go into that, but it is clear that they will be subordinate to a single authority. [Zissowitz] On which issue has Israel given in to the Palestinians in the talks? [Peres] The problem is not of giving in. Israel faced a new situation. Let us discuss the real problem. A monster surrounded by wild weeds appeared among us, something that does not have easy solutions. We must find solutions to situations we did not ask for and we are also dealing with the sensitivities of the residents. It is not a symmetric situation whereby there is a Arab state facing an Israeli state and a Palestinian police force facing an Israeli police force. There is a single state responsible for security, and an issue which starts with peoples' sensitivities. Before you see a knife you have to consider what is motivating it, before you look at a rifle you have to consider what causes somebody to pull the trigger. We must deal with all that in a responsible way. We are not in some circus where you check the trapeze every day to see how far you are jumping. We are a very responsible and determined government. [Raz] Mr. Peres, will the Palestinian police in Hebron impose its powers on the Jewish settlers? [Peres] It will not deal with that at all. We are not in favor of mixing powers, but I do not want to go in to all those details; it is too early. Only when the negotiations are completed will we be able to make public all the details. We are aware of the subjects you have raised. We do not want to bring about friction and clashes; on the contrary, we want to reduce friction and prevent clashes, we want to assure security. [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinians withdrawn their demand to evacuate the Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron? [Peres] They never presented it as an ultimatum. When they raised the issue, even though not as an ultimatum, we told them unequivocally that the issue of settlers, settlements, and population dispersal are Israel's sole responsibility and we will not agree to any change because of pressures or negotiations. In the negotiations themselves we agreed that all the settlements can remain intact. [Zissowitz] At least for the time being, will the Jewish settlers remain where they are? [Peres] I do not know what for the time being means. It is hard to constantly operate with a stopwatch and count the hours. [Zissowitz] I would like to know whether the demand to evacuate the settlers has been removed from the agenda? [Peres] It does not depend on the Palestinians at all, it is a decision Israel must make in a responsible way and on its own. I have nothing to say about proposals or intentions. A government does not have to make public proposals and intentions on a daily basis. When it decides to make a decision it does so. [Raz] Mr. Peres, on Tuesday the Gaza-Jericho talks resume and that is in fact the main issue in the negotiations. [Peres] That is correct. [Raz] How long will that phase take and when will the new deployment on the ground -- the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho -- start? [Peres] There is no doubt that there will be speedy negotiations. All the committees, including the economic committee, will convene in Cairo in order to coordinate and speed up the negotiations. There are differences of opinion. There are those who say it will take two weeks and there are those who say it will take three weeks. What I can say with certainty is that all the sides, definitely our side, will contribute everything needed to speed up the process. [Zissowitz] The talks with the Palestinians will continue in Cairo and not Washington? [Peres] Two different things have to be made clear. The Gaza-Jericho negotiations will be held in Cairo. The negotiations on the autonomy will continue in Washington, as has been the case up to now. We are, in fact, talking about two different processes.
