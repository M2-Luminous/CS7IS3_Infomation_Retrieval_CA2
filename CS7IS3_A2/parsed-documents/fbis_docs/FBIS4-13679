FBIS4-13679 "drnes078_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 JORDAN U.S. Embassy Blamed for `Blackout' on Muscat Talks U.S. Embassy Blamed for `Blackout' on Muscat Talks JN2104111994 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 21 Apr 94 p 24 JN2104111994 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Congratulations"] [Text] We would like to congratulate the U.S. Embassy in Amman for being able, over the past 48 hours, to impose a complete media blackout on the stand of the Jordanian observer at the multilateral water talks held in Muscat. The Jordanians did not know what really happened there. They only know the bits that were broadcast by the Israeli media, which celebrated the occasion, and the bits that were broadcast by the BBC, which is usually interested in details such as the kinds of fish that are threatened with extinction in Iraq's marshlands or the red collar of General Garang in southern Sudan. We began by announcing that we will not contribute to the peace process so long as the siege imposed on our country continues and we ended with sending an observer to Muscat and with imposing a complete blackout about what happened in the Omani capital. What happened is not far away from the Israeli-U.S. game. What is required now is to consolidate both the principle of siege and negotiations. What is required now is to achieve regional cooperation with Israel before reaching peace. What is required is to set up a center for water studies, without mentioning the region's water, the rights of the participant countries, or Israel's theft of this water. What is required is to set up a Palestinian water authority without mentioning its powers or the extent of its responsibility for Palestine water on the land of Palestine. It is the same game faced by the Jordanian negotiator who places the issue of al-Yarmuk River on the negotiating table. Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiator pushes away the Jordanian negotiator's figures and maps and says in a disgusting way: The entire region needs water. So, why do we not think of big desalination projects? Why do we not start big projects to draw the water of the Turkish rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan ? All this means that the al-Yarmuk River is not a subject for discussion, that you must accept God's distribution of water, that the Jordan Valley must depend on technology and drip irrigation, that the Jordan River will be part of the environmental issues, and that all these issues will be discussed within the multilateral talks. It is the same game. The important thing is the negotiations -- negotiations in Washington whose objective is to hold negotiations provided that they are secret negotiations. The objective also is to hold many negotiations provided that they are held in Arab capitals -- in whose hotels and streets Israeli officials will walk freely -- and provided that the Israeli television carry these talks live to the people who are besieged in their houses in villages and cities in the occupied territory, to the families of the victims of al-Aqsa and al-Ibrahimi Mosques, to the Israeli Defense Forces, and to the settlers who shoot indiscriminately and kill pregnant women and children at play. It is fine for the Jordanians not to know what their observer has done in Muscat while satellites bring them the latest summer fashions from the well-known Paris fashion houses.
