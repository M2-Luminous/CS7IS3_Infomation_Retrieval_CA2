According to the prime minister, this was on of the main results achieved as a result of the work of the integovernment Russo-U.S. Commission for Economic and Technological Cooperation which met in session on Wednesday. Late on Wednesday, Chernomyrdin answered journalists' questions. He came out for lifting restrictions impeding the establishment of normal trade and economic relations between Russia and the United States. Chernomyrdin mentioned Jackson-Vanik's amendment which is still in effect as one of these obstacles. Touching upon the problem of the possible shut-down of Russian reactors for the production of plutonium and a ban to use them for the production of nuclear weapons, the prime minister made it clear that "Russia fulfills its international commitments." According to Chernomyrdin, during the talks with the American delegation an agreement was reached "on the U.S. participation in the construction of special storages on Russia's territory." The sides agreed that Russia would shut down double-purpose reactors, while the United States, in turn, would partially recompense the cost. Chernomyrdin confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin would pay an official visit to the United States in September, adding that third session of the Russo-U.S. commission which is currently under way in Washington can be regarded as the first stage of the preparation for the Russo-U.S. summit.
