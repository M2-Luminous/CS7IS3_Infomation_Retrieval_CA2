The fact that Kim Il-song is personally handling state affairs has been verified by visitors to the North. Kim Yong-chu, who returned as a Political Bureau member, said that the succession to power will not take place until Kim Il-song dies. In addition, as is known, a resolution concerning the delay of succession to power was adopted at a session of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Political Bureau in October 1993. It has been learned that Reverend Billy Graham, based on talks with President Kim Il-song during his recent visit to Pyongyang, had an impression that Kim Il-song is personally handling the nuclear issue more attentively than before and is surely controlling state affairs. According to an intelligence source, during his visit to North Korea Rev. Graham presented gifts to President Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and received a present in return from Kim Il-song, but not from Kim Chong-il. When Rev. Graham visited Pyongyang in March 1992, he received gifts, including return presents, from both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. When Rev. Graham visited in 1992, President Kim frequently mentioned Kim Chong-il, but he was never mentioned during this visit. Moreover, he appeared to be avoiding mentioning Kim Chong-il. This information, confirmed by close associates of Rev. Graham, evokes speculation that certain abnormalities might have been ignited in the succession to power in North Korea. The atmosphere of Rev. Graham's visit to North Korea gives an impression that the situation has changed from the past and that the responsible figure for state affairs is Kim Il-song himself. Besides, sources on North Korean affairs confirmed that the party Political Bureau meeting in October 1993 adjusted the schedule of Kim Chong-il's succession to power. A foreign news report noted that Kim Yong-chu -- who at one time, it was learned, was nominated as successor to Kim Il-song but disappeared from the power structure then returned to the Political Bureau last year, said in a conversation with diplomats from the third world that "Kim Chong-il will retain the posts of secretary of the Workers' Party and supreme commander of the People's Army until Kim Il-song dies." His remarks mean Kim Chong-il's early succession to power will be denied and suggest that something abnormal is occurring in the succession to power. Relevant officials observe that such a trend remarkably differs from the remarks made by Kim Il-song in an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES on 12 April 1992, when he said: "Secretary Kim Chong-il is controlling the overall national administration." However, phenomena totally denying such observations have been published by the North Korean press and mass media. Since the beginning of this year, the North Korean press has intensified its idolization campaign of Kim Chong-il, which has even surpassed the idolization campaign of Kim Il-song. In addition, Kim Il-song's New Year address, which has been repeatedly broadcast on several occasions each year in the past, was repeated only once this year. Thus, broadcasts related to Kim Il-song have been reduced. On the contrary, intelligence organizations have noted that the propaganda campaign on Kim Chong-il's greatness and events inspiring loyalty to Kim Chong-il have increased. Concerning such two contradictory trends, relevant high-ranking government officials and experts in North Korean affairs cautiously put forward a hypothesis that "the schedule of power succession is being readjusted and early succession will be delayed." They said: It is apparent that a session of the North Korean Workers' Party Political Bureau on 18 October 1993 adopted a resolution that Kim Chong-il temporarily retreat from the seat of power and Kim Il-song again control the national administration. The intensive changes in the power structure, which took place after the Supreme People's Assembly conference in December 1993, have aroused constant speculation concerning the change in Kim Chong-il's position. This speculation is based on the fact that Kim Yong-chu has returned to power as a Political Bureau member and vice president; Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the Workers' Party in charge of South Korean affairs and close associate of Kim Chong-il, was relieved from the post; and Kim Tal-hyon, vice premier and chairman of the State Planning Commission, was reassigned to a manager of a vinalon enterprise. Viewing this, it is observed the present atmosphere indicates that by reshuffling his close associates, Kim Chong-il was called to account for handling the national administration and his early succession to power, which has been constantly raised in the past, has become void. In view of the characteristics in the power structure within the North Korean system, adjustment of the schedule of power succession is not meant to basically shake the structure of succession and power organization, but to make Kim Il-song appear as the seat of power to handle overall state affairs for the time being. As a result, it is likely that even after Kim Chong-il's retreat from the present position of power, a propaganda campaign for him will be intensified in the future, thus showing dual trends.
