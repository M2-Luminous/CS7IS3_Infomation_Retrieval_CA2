FBIS4-36366 "drnes110dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Quray' on PNA Expenses, Israeli `Temporization' Quray' on PNA Expenses, Israeli `Temporization' JN0306140794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1030 GMT 3 Jun 94 JN0306140794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with PNA member Ahmad Quray', in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] PNA [Palestinian National Authority] member Ahmad Quray', the expenses required by the Palestinian Authority are not small, especially those needed to run the police. Where will the money come from to cover these expenses? [Quray'] In the long run, the Palestinian authority will have no problem coming up with the money. But in the interim, the donor nations are duty-bound to make available all the finances required for the security forces and other departments of the authority. I cannot make sense of this hesitation and foot-dragging in providing the finances for the Palestinian authority. We cannot overstate the importance of this factor, if the peace process is to be kept going and its momentum maintained. [Mu'addi] It is now a month since the Israeli-Palestinian accord was signed, and yet the Palestinian authority, which has to tackle major challenges, has still to become operational. What's the delay? [Quray'] We trust the Palestinian authority will be operational before long. Cadres of the PNA were supposed to begin all their duties in earnest so the transformation could become visible to the Palestinian man in the street, and in order for the world to witness the Palestinians' ability to deliver. The security forces are now deployed, and I think ordinary Palestinians are happy with their performance. We trust the bureaucracies will become operational soon. [Mu'addi] The tax and customs crews have not begun their work yet, which may result in reduced revenues. When will that be? [Quray'] At the moment, strictly speaking, there is no tax collecting agency to raise money to pay for the PNA's expenses. We have no choice but to organize the tax collecting authority. We hope that, now that there is a Finance Ministry, this department will institute this agency soon. [Mu'addi] How do you propose to quicken the slow pace of implementing the economic agreement and opening the Israeli market to goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip? [Quray'] The Israeli side is, inexplicably and inexcusably, responsible for the slow pace. We had thought they would be anxious to put the agreement in place without reneging on any of its clauses, particularly given that, in this equation, they are the stronger side. I just cannot understand, nobody can understand, why there are obstacles to the export of Palestinian agricultural produce to the Israeli market. If this clause is not implemented, what else is left of the agricultural agreement, or even the trade accord, to implement? Of all matters, there should not be any foot- dragging on this thing. The Israelis are in a position to settle this issue promptly. Their temporization is inexcusable. [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Thank you so much. [Quray'] Thank you.
