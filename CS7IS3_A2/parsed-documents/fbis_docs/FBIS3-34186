Speaking today before a bankers' forum in Tel Aviv, he said that time is not of the essence, reiterating the famous phrase: There are no sacred dates. Israel is committed to the political process, hence, the date is less important. Last week he also introduced another element that has to be concluded before the agreement is signed -- the economic talks to be held in Paris. There is a wide range of issues still to be discussed, which will take a long time. Thus, there is no reason to assume that the negotiations or the implementation will end by 13 April. The prime minister told leading Israeli bankers today that anything that is not finalized might turn into a detonator for future mishaps. This is an agreement between two entities which, to say the least, do not love each other and are constantly in friction. Therefore, the current agreement on Gaza and Jericho, as well as the agreement on the autonomy, serve as a test case for the possibility of making progress toward the permanent agreement. For that test case to succeed, the appropriate conditions must be prepared and misunderstandings should be avoided. I would like to call attention to another remark by the prime minister regarding the events in the former USSR. National forums are thinking about this and holding consultations on this matter. Israel is definitely following and is worried by the events in the CIS. After his meeting with the bankers, Rabin spoke to the media. We will begin with the negotiations in Cairo next week and the routine consultations that are currently being held. [Begin recording] [Rabin] I will not go into detail here. When Peres meets 'Arafat in Cairo on 7 February, the goal will be to wrap up the issues on which great progress was made in Davos. I speak of wordings that must ensure clarity on the issues of security -- including the border crossings and the size of the Jericho area -- in order to really attain agreed-upon, clear, and understood results. After this, we will also have to advance on economic and administrative issues, and arrange the Palestinian administration. Also, we have not yet held an in-depth discussion on the structure and size of the Palestinian police. Many issues are still pending. At the same time, as far as the security issues are concerned, the heart of the matter was dealt with in Davos, and I hope it will be completed in Cairo. [Raz] Are there differences in nuances between the Foreign Ministry and the defense establishment? [Rabin] Come off it. In the discussions there are different officials from the Foreign Ministry and the defense establishment. They have different views. In general, we are speaking of matters that are not of prime importance, rather about the a practical implementation of the issues in the everyday life. [passage omitted] [end recording]
