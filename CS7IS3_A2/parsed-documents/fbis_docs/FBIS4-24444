The measures stipulate that enterprises in this category with registered capital up to and including $2 million should contribute the whole sum within six months after the operational license is issued. Those with registered capital between $2 million and $5 million inclusive should contribute the whole sum within a year after the issuance of their operational licenses, and those with a registered capital between $5 million and $10 million inclusive should contribute the whole sum within two years after the issuance of operational licenses. Those with a registered capital ranging from $10 million to $30 million inclusive may have the deadline appropriately extended according to their conditions, with the approval of the organizations in charge of examination and approval and the organizations in charge of registration. If enterprises violate the regulations of the departments in charge of registration, these departments may directly decide to suspend their operating licenses. The new measures also provide: It is totally unacceptable for the Chinese side in a foreign-funded joint venture to contribute the registered capital on its foreign partner's behalf. When the organizations in charge of registration discover that this has occurred, these cases will be handled as failures to contribute capital. If the Chinese side in a joint venture is found to have provided foreign investors with nominal shares as a reward or has borrowed the name or materials of some foreign businessmen to deceitfully acquire an operating license, as soon as the case is verified, the joint venture's license should be suspended and the appropriate penalty should be meted out according to the relevant laws and decrees. State-owned enterprises that use their stock assets to apply for running joint ventures or enterprises in cooperation with foreign business enterprises should simultaneously submit the Chinese side's asset evaluation reports, which must be certified by the administration of state assets. For joint ventures in which a foreign partner invests by providing equipment or other goods in kind, the real prices of the equipment and goods must be explicitly stated in the contract, which must be certified by an intermediary notary authority acceptable to the two sides. When a central-level enterprise sells shares to foreign firms or uses part or all of its state-owned stock assets to launch joint ventures or cooperate with foreign firms, it must submit documents to the relevant state department for examination. At this moment, no approvals or registrations will be granted to the local authorities who want to use the stock assets of the state enterprises -- the enterprises operating a single trade or running a business which incorporates various trades -- to launch joint-venture projects with foreign firms. For the projects of this type that are already in existence, a good job should be done of weeding them out in coordination with the organizations in charge of examination and approval. In the contracts submitted by joint ventures with Chinese and foreign investment or cooperative enterprises, if there are clauses which violate the principle of shared interest and responsibility for running risks, separately provide guarantees for investment loans according to the investment proportion of the two sides involved, or make the Chinese side guarantee profit rates of foreign investment through loans, bonds or other instruments, the organizations in charge of registration are authorized to require the parties involved in joint ventures to revise them according to the stipulations of state laws and decrees; otherwise, their examination and registration will not be granted. Figures from economic circles have indicated that these measures presented by China primarily target the low rate of foreign capital actually contributed; presently, the foreign capital contributed as investment in China accounts for only 20 percent or so of the negotiated amount.
