In a letter to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, UN High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said she was saddened by the event. She also took "strong exception" to the "manner" in which the repatriation was carried out by the Thai Government. Except for a number of Thai military officers who actually supervised the repatriation, no outsiders -- not even UNHCR representatives or members of the mass media -- were allowed to witness the event. In fact, the UNHCR had requested access to the displaced people, but this was rejected by the Thai Government. According to an explanation offered by National Security Council secretary-general Kachatphai Burutphat, the situation at the time was confused and permission was, therefore, not granted. Because the repatriation was done in such a clandestine manner,it was natural for the UNHCR to harbour suspicions that the Cambodian refugees might be forced back into Cambodia and that their lives might be at great risk due to the continuing fighting. Besides, there had been previous instances -- which were well-documented -- of forced repatriation of Cambodian refugees into dangerous areas. Had access been granted in the first place to UNHCR representatives or the push-back been carried out in a transparent manner, a protest would have been avoided and the country's image and reputation would not have been affected. And the trip organised by the Supreme Command for Bangkok-based reporters to monitor the situation in the Chanthaburi border area would have been unnecessary. It is unlikely to help much in eliminating the mistrust of the international community, anyway. Of course, the Thai Government's foremost responsibility is towards protecting national interests. The Government has every right to repatriate the Cambodian refugees or even to deny them entry if it felt their presence would jeopardise national interests. But since we are not alone in this world and are part of the international community, we have to recognise and accept some of the universal principles laid down by the world community, such as human rights. The Government was right and should be commended for opening the border to receive the asylum seekers from Cambodia. It is unfortunate that the Government then chose to hide from the public eye when it decided to send the refugees home. But to view the Thai Government's action in a negative light without taking a serious look at the root cause of the refugee problem is very unfair to Thailand. The Cambodian Government's accusation that Thailand violated human rights by driving Cambodian refugees back into their home country sounds hypocritical because it has to take the full blame for starting a war which sent its people fleeing in panic across the border. All the warring factions in Cambodia must share the blame for their stubbornness and selfishness which resulted in their inability to reconcile among themselves. The United Nations must also be held responsible for its ineffectiveness and complete failure to disarm the Khmer Rouge guerrillas as well as their rival factions, leaving behind an unaccomplished task and a country which is still very much at war, much like the day the first UN peacekeeping troops marched triumphantly into Cambodia to restore peace and supervise general elections. If the Government feels it has fulfilled its humanitarian responsibility and considers it to be safe enough for the Cambodian refugees to go home without risking their lives, there is no reason to hide from the public the manner in which it carried out the repatriation or will carry out any similar operations in the future.
