Legal Authority These regulations would be promulgated under the authority of sections 1006, 2002(a), 3001&hyph;3007, 3010, 3013, 3016&hyph;3017, 3018 and 7004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6921&hyph;6927, 6930, 6937&hyph;6938, 6939 and 6974 (commonly referred to as RCRA). II. Background A. The Toxicity Characteristic Under section 3001 of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with defining which solid wastes are hazardous by identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and by listing particular hazardous wastes. Toxicity is one of the four characteristics used by EPA to identify waste as hazardous (along with ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity). EPA promulgated the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Characteristic (EPTC) on May 19, 1980. The EPTC regulated eight metals, four insecticides, and two herbicides. Section 3001(g) of RCRA, added by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, required EPA to revise the EPTC. On March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11798), the EPA promulgated the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) to revise the existing EPTC. Like the EPTC, the TC and its associated testing methodology, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) is used to define the toxicity of a waste by measuring the potential for the toxic constituents in the waste to leach out of an unlined municipal landfill into groundwater and contaminate drinking water wells at levels of health or environmental concern if not subject to Subtitle C controls. The TC implemented an improved leaching procedure that better predicts leaching and added several hazardous waste constituents. Twenty-five organic hazardous waste constituents were added to the TC and a model was developed to predict their fate and transport in the groundwater. If wastes exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic they are subject to the hazardous waste management requirements of RCRA Subtitle C. As discussed in the preamble to the Toxicity Characteristic Rule (March 29, 1990, 55 FR 11813), the regulatory levels for the TC metals were not changed by the promulgation of the final TC rule. EPA retained the regulatory levels set by the EPTC rule, pending further study of the fate and transport of metals in groundwater. The Agency is continuing longer-term developmental work on a metal speciation model, called MINTEQ, to be used to evaluate the fate and transport of the TC metals (including mercury) for purposes of reassessing the toxicity characteristic regulatory levels for the TC metals. EPA's preliminary analysis indicates that mercury that would leach out of landfills would not all necessarily travel far enough through the groundwater to contaminate drinking water wells, depending on the distance to the well. A certain percent (still to be determined) will combine with other substances in the soil (via complexation, adsorption, etc.) to form solid substances and remain in the soil. Therefore, the regulatory limits for mercury if re-assessed using the MINTEQ model, when completed, might be higher (less stringent) than the current limits because mercury may be less mobile than the current TC rule indicates. However, these studies are still ongoing (U.S. EPA, 1991b). Available data (included in the docket for this proposal) indicate that as a result of the use of mercury in the production of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, a relatively high percentage of these lamps, when spent, exhibit the characteristic of toxicity. (U.S. EPA, 1992a) However, all generators of spent lamps that exhibit the toxicity characteristic may not have to manage those lamps as hazardous waste. EPA has specified different requirements for generators of hazardous waste depending on the amount of hazardous waste generated per month. Conditionally-exempt small quantity generators (CESQG) generate less than 100 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste each month and can send their waste to a hazardous waste facility, or may elect to send their wastes to a landfill or other facility approved by the State for industrial or municipal non-hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.5). Generators of more than 100 kg of hazardous waste per month are required to fully comply with Federal hazardous waste regulations (although generators of between 100 and 1000 kg of hazardous waste per month are subject to certain reduced regulatory requirements).
