The residents climbed on rooftops and other high places to follow the actions of the three airplanes and a helicopter in this location where the presence of guerrillas had been unknown. The rebels responded to the bombing with submachine-gun fire. The number of casualties is unknown. The action occurred about 10 km from the center of San Cristobal, a town which the EZLN members maintained under their control on 1 January. The battle site is alongside the highway linking San Cristobal with Ocosingo, toward which the guerrilla forces are reportedly pulling back after issuing a "declaration of war" against the Mexican Government and Army on 1 January.
