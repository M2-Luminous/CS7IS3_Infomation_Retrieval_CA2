The new system is intended to prevent the increase of military forces and a reoccurrence of war in the region so as to guarantee peace and security. DPRK's Deputy Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong said at a press conference here that recently the United States, in defiance of the armistice agreement of Korea, has continuously increased its military presence and massed troops on the Korean peninsula and in surrounding areas. "This has actually turned the armistice agreement into empty words that cannot guarantee peace on the peninsula and the Korean Military Armistice Commission exists in name only," he said. Song stressed that in order to eliminate the hostility between the United States and the DPRK, to realize reconciliation and guarantee genuine peace and security on the peninsula, the armistice agreement should be turned into a peace agreement and a new peace safeguard system be established to replace the armistice institution. In reply to questions from reporters, Song said that before the DPRK and the United States reach agreement on establishing the new peace safeguard system, the dprk would continue to faithfully abide by the armistice agreement. But he said the DPRK would not deal with the United Nations forces who were a party to signing the armistice agreement, but would prefer to continue dealing with the United States. Song appealed to the United States to respond to the DPRK's proposal and hold consultations with it on establishing the new peace safeguard system to ease the tension on the Korean peninsula.
