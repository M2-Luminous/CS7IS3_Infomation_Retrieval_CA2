Meanwhile, he said, every individual and region had to abide by the existing Constitution. Kravchuk thought that as much power as possible could be given to Crimea on the proviso that Ukraine remained an integral whole. He recalled that under Ukrainian legislation and international law Crimea was part of Ukraine and this should not be changed. The conflict of Crimean and Ukrainian legislation started on 20 May 1994 when the Crimean Supreme Soviet restored the initial 6 May 1992 wording of the Crimean Constitution under which the relations between Crimea and Ukraine were to be guided by a treaty between them and Crimean residents could have dual citizenship. Kiev demanded that the Crimean Constitution be aligned with Ukrainian legislation.
