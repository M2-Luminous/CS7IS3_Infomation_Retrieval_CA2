[passage omitted] Clark said there is a feeling that the entire effort was never devoted exclusively to the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and that it has always been, in the UN's judgment, an essential way to begin the resolution of more substantive issues. He denied that he was unwilling to take over the new mission in Cyprus, saying: I had a difficult schedule in Canada, to which I will return permanently in one month, and it was difficult to get away. He added, however, that he wanted to come to Cyprus and he hopes he will have constructive talks. He avoided giving details of what he will discuss with Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. He also avoided commenting on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's reference to the need to find alternative ways of promoting a Cyprus solution. He added that we need goodwill from all sides to get some movement on the issue. [passage omitted] A DIKO [Democratic Party] statement on Clark's arrival in Cyprus mentions that this is another effort to find a formula that will represent Ankara and Denktas as accepting the CBM's. DIKO calls upon the UN secretary general, the British, and the Americans look to Ankara and Denktas for a just solution instead of pushing us to make concessions to the Turkish positions and demands. DIKO said it is angry about this stance and concerned about the course of developments on the national issue. The party reiterated its adamant opposition to the confidence-building measures. A Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] statement expresses concern at the continuing activity by UN envoys regarding the CBM's. On Clark's visit, EDEK mentions that this does not aim to find a new procedure but to modify the measures to help the Turkish side and put pressure on the Cypriot Government to accept an amendment to the 21 March UN document. In its statement, EDEK says it is time to declare the CBM's dead and to turn our attention toward convening an international conference to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue on the basis of international law.
