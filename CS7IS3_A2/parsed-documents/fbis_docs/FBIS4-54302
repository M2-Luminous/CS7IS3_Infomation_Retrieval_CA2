"It's good that the US will also consult us," Gen Wichit told reporters at Government House. He was responding to a statement made by Mr Kent Weidemenn, US deputy assistant secretary of defence, during a visit to the Thai- Cambodian border last Tuesday to assess the Cambodian war's impact on Thailand. Gen Wichit said he did not personally meet with Mr Weidemenn and so did not have the chance to exchange views with him. However, he was briefed on Thailand's position that military assistance to the Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge would only perpetuate the war in Cambodia. He also said Mr Weidemenn's visit to the border was useful in providing first hand information about the impact of the fighting inside Cambodia on Thailand. France, Australia and the U.S. are considering a request by the Cambodian government to provide military assistance to fight the Khmer Rouge.
