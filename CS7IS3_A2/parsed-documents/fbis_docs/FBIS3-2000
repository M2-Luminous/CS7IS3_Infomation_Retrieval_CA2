Contracts now stipulate duties, obligations and rights of both employees and the State. This encourages competition and motivates workers. Of the 80 million workers in State firms, 23.3 million work under collective contracts, according to statistics from the Labour Ministry. The ministry is urging more enterprises to sign workers to contracts in the future. Despite this, there are no labour laws governing the contract system . So a contract labour law is being drafted and will be submitted this month to the National People's Congress for examination and approval, said Dong Ping, a Labour Ministry official. Although contract and lifelong "iron rice bowl" systems still co- exist in State firms, most new workers are hired under contract. Some well-developed coastal cities like Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Yamen are encouraging all workers to be hired under the contract system. In shanghai, China's largest industrial city, nearly 1.5 million workers are under labour contracts, or 97.53 per cent of all employees in State firms. At Shanghai No 5 Steel and Iron Plant, the trade union bargained for a collective contract for all the employees. More enterprises are expected to follow suit, Dong said. In East China's Shandong Province, 9,359 State firms switched to the contract system, employing 2 million labourers. Several pilot cities--Anyang in Henan Province, Zhuzhou in Hunan, and Yancheng in Jiangsu--have signed all State workers to contracts. And provinces such as Guangdong, Hainan, Jilin, Hebei and Liaoning are also expanding contract employment to all State-owned enterprises, Dong said. It is still, however, in the experimental stage in remote and underdeveloped regions. The contract system first began with new workers in some areas in 1986, and has been on a trial basis nationwide since 1987. Under the system, those working at full enthusiasm receive a pay raise. Most State-owned enterprises have been revitalized by the new employment system, Dong claimed. And workers have benefited as well. For instance, more workers now defend their own interests as stipulated in the contract. Recently, an official survey conducted among 2,400 State workers found that about two-thirds favour the contract system. Those surveyed said the greatest fears under contract are job stability and salary. Some, especially those working at foreign-invested firms, complain they would be fired by their bosses too often.
