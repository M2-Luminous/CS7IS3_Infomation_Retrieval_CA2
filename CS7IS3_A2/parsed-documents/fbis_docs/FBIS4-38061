Remember how ministers and Knesset members [MK] used to react when asked for their camp affiliation? "There are no camps in Likud," they would say as the war of the camps raged and deals between camps flourished. "What camp I am in? The Likud camp." Now, that the political negotiations are back in the headlines, MK Eli Dayan uttered the two sentences that will from now on describe the situation of the Labor Party: "I have no group in Labor," he said. "I belong to the Labor Party group." There are no camps in Labor, there are only "groups" or "ideological circles." Here is yet another example of the process of privatization the ruling party is undergoing. The process does not aim at promoting some ideology or supporting the peace process. It aims at pushing the person or persons heading the circle into a realistic slot on the next Knesset list: The Ma'alot circle of MK Rafi Edri; the New Direction circle of Minister Shim'on Shetrit (who recently established a "group" named The Jerusalem Forum); Ra'anan Kohen's Re'ut circle; the Unification of Ranks circle of Shlomo Buhbut; Rafi Elul's social lobby group; Mikha Goldman's Next Generation circle; the Lamerhav circle of Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino, members of which are 'Imanu'el Zismann and other veteran hawks; the Alternative circle of Ofir Pinhas who appeals to the party's young members; The Forum for Political and Social Thinking of Shlomo Ben-'Ami and Avigdor Ben-Gal who want to be MK's (if not ministers) in the next Knesset; the Hofit circle of Ori Or and the hawks gang; The Histadrut Forum of Pini Shumer, a member of the Rabin camp; the newly founded circle of Minister Moshe Shahal, which last week convened at the Oil Institute in Tel Aviv; and Minister Mikha Harish's Leshiluv Circle which is currently inactive, but there is reason to believe that it will soon be revived under this or other name. And there are the doves' Kefar Hayaroq and Mashov circles; Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer is expected to establish his own circle soon; and Minister Efrayim Sne already has a "group" and a "circle" is expected to be founded soon. "You can no longer see the party from the circles and groups," MK Eli Dayan said grumpily. "I heard there are MK's who belong to several ideological circles and groups," he said. Dayan himself is indeed a living example for this: He is associated with Rafi Edri's circle, with Shim'on Shetrit's circle, the new Shlomo Buhbut circle, and may soon set up his own circle. After Hayim Ramon quit the party, and after it transpired that Gershon Gelman [head of the Labor list of the Tel Aviv labor council who signed a local coalition agreement with Likud] can disregard Yitzhaq Rabin's directives, early preparations for the primaries for the Labor list for the next Knesset elections have begun. In an interview with Lili Galili and Amnon Abramovich for HA'ARETZ, Shim'on Peres made very frustrated comments about this. Nevertheless, Peres -- with some of his men behind several of the new circles -- also understands that this phenomena taking place because of the need to replace the crumbling organizational infrastructure of Labor. In a closed meeting with members of his camp, Prime Minister Rabin described the situation thus: The main problem Labor is facing today is the fact that Histadrut employees, most of whom are party members, are about to be laid off and become unemployed. "Some 1,500 of our men are facing an economic, existential problem," he said. What is he going to do about the unemployed party activists? "Believe me," Rabin went on, "when I was defense minister I fired 3,000 people." In other words, Rabin will not find new jobs for them because Rabin, just like Ramon, no longer believes in the outdated organizational structure of the Labor Party. It can be assumed that the activists without income will join some of the groups and circles only to have something to do, and perhaps find a source of income. "None of the groups is ideological and none of the groups is serious," said Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, who today cooperates with the Mashov and Kefar Hayaroq circles. "People want to prove they exist because the primaries' race has begun. Hayim Ramon is everybody's role model. Because he succeeded, they are trying to show the public what they are worth. All the power structures of Labor in the local labor councils and the Histadrut Executive Committee are falling apart. In this atmosphere of uncertainty, people are beginning to think about their personal future. I have even heard that some of the MK's and ministers have begun collecting funds for the primaries." It is to be assumed that in the coming year the registrar of non- profit associations will be busy registering associations established for noble causes which will begin collecting funds from businessmen for the next Knesset race. One of those competing for the next Knesset last week said that he had contacted several businessmen asking for their contribution. The businessmen asked him whether he was in any way connected to Hayim Ramon because, they said, they have already invested in Ramon. The next Knesset elections will take place in two years' time, but already now, some 18 months before the party primaries are held, tension could be easily felt. Minister Moshe Shahal -- one of the first Laborites to speak about recognizing the Palestinians and establishing a Palestinian state, even before Yosi Beilin -- today speaks about the need to "return to the center of the political map." That is to say that the primaries might not only have an impact on the frequency of appearances by politicians on TV talks shows, but also on the political process.
