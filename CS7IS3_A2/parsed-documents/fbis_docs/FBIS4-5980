Six organizations of Mali including the Malian Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the Malian Peace Movement and the Anti-Imperialist Youth Union of Mali called an emergency meeting on April 1 and issued a joint statement. The statement sharply denounced the United States for recklessly acting against peace and security of the world by stepping up preparations for a new war on the Korean peninsula. Noting that the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea might carry the situation of the Korean peninsula into extremes, it expressed indignation and apprehensions for the grave situation created in the region owing to the unjustifiable attitude of the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Communist Party of India (Marxism) in a statement said the U.N. Security Council should get itself free from the U.S. pressure and take a fair and aboveboard position to find a negotiated solution of the problem of nuclear inspection. The Socialist Party of Kazakhstan in a statement April 5 said it has in the past invariably supported the efforts of the DPRK to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way. It expressed the belief that the DPRK's efforts would surely be successful. The presidium of the Committee of "Peace and Today" of Russia in an appeal sent to the U.N. Secretary General on March 30 pointed out that the all-out campaign launched by the United States and its followers is aimed at creating another "flash point" on the Korean peninsula. The appeal called upon the United Nations to exert due efforts to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way, not by unjust pressure and policy of strength or "sanctions".
