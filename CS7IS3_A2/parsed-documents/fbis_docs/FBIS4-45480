There are currently 20 proceedings related to the "laundering" of money originating in the drug traffic. There have been no detentions, nor even dates set for trials. According to a Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] official, most (nearly half) of the laundering cases are associated with the Lisbon area. The industrialized zones in the north and the Algarve recreational areas are other sites mentioned in the proceedings. The same police source also notes that, in the respective proceedings, the amount of money laundered is unknown. However, when one observes the sectors chosen for its application (gold, hotels, casinos, etc.), it is not difficult to conclude that "the sums of money involved are too large for the local environment." One of the main ventures of the individuals engaged in money laundering in Portugal is the purchase of lottery tickets. According to the agents from the Central Directorate for Narcotics Trafficking Investigation (this being the section dealing with all laundering cases, since all those known are associated with the drug traffic), the method consists of purchasing large numbers of whole tickets at prices slightly higher than those stipulated. There is almost always a guarantee of profits accrued by whoever sells them. In the case of the casinos, the money is "blended" through the purchase of chips, which are later exchanged for cash. "`Dirty' money is used to purchase chips, and then, after a few bets, the same chips are exchanged for money; and, at some point, the player no longer has any illegally procured assets." The police call this rotation "blending." There are also some who illustrate the operation by using the example of a sausage stuffing machine: "The pork enters at one end, and the sausages emerge from the other. When the operation is finished, there is always meat." As for the nationalities of those involved in the proceedings that are under way, although the majority are Portuguese, there are also individuals born or settled in "other European countries (heroin trafficking cases) and on other continents (South Americans connected with the cocaine business)." Trials Could Take Years The absence of detained persons and, particularly, the uncertainty regarding when the first trials for laundering can begin, are justified by the late date on which Portugal obtained proper legislation. It was not until 15 September of last year that a Community directive issuing regulations pertaining to this crime was adopted. The slowness of the proceedings is also attributed, by Criminal Investigations Police officials, to the fact that the suspects identified to date are individuals of considerable means. Therefore, "they have sufficient financial capacity to engage the best lawyers, thus achieving foot-dragging in the procedures, through funds and more funds." The Portuguese proceedings and law relating to money laundering are, moreover, included among the topics for discussion during the seminar to be held at Vilamoura from 29 May to 2 June. Besides the Portuguese police, officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stationed in Madrid, and police from Spain, Gibraltar, Andorra, Italy, and probably Sweden, will be present at the meeting. Contrary to previous reports, the International Seminar on Money Laundering is not the Portuguese authorities' first attempt to deal with the problem. In fact, last year the issue prompted several meetings between the PJ and other police forces affiliated with Interpol.
