FR941102-2-00101 FR941102-2-00071 3. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common management company to fund a variable annuity separate account of one insurance company and the variable annuity separate accounts of other affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies. Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding while Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) permits mixed funding but precludes shared funding. Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting variable life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of such an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit mixed and shared funding. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. In connection with scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial exemption from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15), however, are not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an investment company that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same or of any affiliated or unaffiliated insurance company (``mixed funding''). In addition, the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available if shares of the underlying investment company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies (``shared funding''). Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting scheduled premium variable life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor of such an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold in connection with both mixed funding and shared funding. 2. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(6)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and to any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) permit mixed funding of flexible premium variable life insurance but preclude shared funding. Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor of such an account from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold to separate accounts in connection with shared funding. 3. Section 9(a) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) (i) and (ii), and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii), provide exemptions from section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management or administration of the underlying management company. 4. The application states that the partial relief granted in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) from the requirements of section 9 of the Act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section 9 of that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. The Applicants state that those Rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in (or invested in by) that organization. Applicants state that it is also unnecessary to apply section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. Applicants argue that applying the requirements of section 9(a) because of investment by other insurers' separate accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. The application states that the participating insurers are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the Fund and that those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. Furthermore, the increased monitoring costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners.
