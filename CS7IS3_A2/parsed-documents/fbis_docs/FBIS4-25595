IPP refers to those specializing in power generation wherever it is necessary and without any prerequisites of building massive power transmission grids. HIPDC, a joint venture founded in 1985, was the first of its kind aimed at raising funds, mostly foreign capital, to speed up China's power construction. There is a great shortage of electricity supplies compared with the swelling demand resulting from China's rapid economic development. This venture now has 11 power plants across China, with operational generating capacity totaling 6,100 mw -- all accomplished in just nine years. It also has sub-stations of 8,620 mva [expansion unknown] and 3,470 km of high voltage transmission lines, in addition to the corporation's growing involvement in other trades and sectors. According to a corporation source, a total of more than 2 billion U.S. dollars in export credits, mixed government loans and commercial loans have been utilized over the past nine years. Yu Minji, spokesman of HIPDC, said complete advanced power generating units were imported from Western countries and Japan to equip nine of the 11 plants now in operation. He said that along with this procedure, advanced technology was brought in to fill the gap in China's power industry. The Shanghai Shidongkou Second power plant, for example, was the country's first to install two 600 mw coal-fired super-critical units, in a bid to raise fuel efficiency and lower energy consumption. The introduction of the fume-gas desulphurization equipment in Luohuang power plant and the combined cycle gas/steam turbine in Chongqing gas turbine power plant were also both "firsts" for China. These plants also adopted a management system and model common in developed countries in order to upgrade themselves to international standards. Their streamlined structure allows them to operate with half the staff, or even less, usually required by other Chinese plants with similar capacity. Yu said the corporation is expanding. Four power plants -- Yingkou, Shantou, Nanjing and Beijing Co-Generation -- are under construction. He said that negotiations or preparations are being carried out for another four projects -- two extension projects and Dandong and Jinling power plants. After their completion, the gross generating capacity of the corporation is expected to reach 10,500 mw, the spokesman added. The corporation's practice epitomized China's drive to tap the international financial market for more power supplies. The country's whole power generating capacity stands at 180,000 mw and the figure needs to more than double by the end of this century if China's thirst for power is to be eased. Yu said his corporation will build another 8,000 mw of generating capacity in seven years. More methods, such as joint investment and project financing, will be tried to make use of more foreign capital, he added. Huaneng Power International, a company formed by HIPDC and its partners, is scheduled to begin offering its shares globally and is to be listed on the New York Stock Market later this year. The company, composed of five power plants with their generating capacity amounting to 2,900 mw, is one of the five enterprises first approved by the State Council Securities Commission for New York listing.
