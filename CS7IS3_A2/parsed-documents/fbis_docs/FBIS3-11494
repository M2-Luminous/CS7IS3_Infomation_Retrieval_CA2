Citing a study, he pointed out that in 1993 the volume of international agricultural-livestock trade fell, and this trend is expected to continue, constituting a shortfall for Mexico, despite the prospects for growth opened by GATT and NAFTA. In addition to a drop in global demand prompted by the demise of the defunct Soviet Union, the major exporting countries are maintaining subsidy policies that cause serious distortions in the international market, pushing prices of most agricultural-livestock products to their lowest levels in history. Once GATT's Uruguay Round agreements and various global agreements such as NAFTA are consolidated, the distortions in the market should give way to price increases. The Mexican situation is not promising. Although 1993's agricultural-livestock trade deficit ($121.4 million) was lower than the one for 1992 ($761.4 million), the expanded [ampliada] agricultural-livestock trade balance presents one of the highest deficits in history, even higher than for the period of the lost decade [reference to Latin America's economic problems of the 1980's]. Although some exports are increasing, including legumes, fresh vegetables, cattle, tomato, fresh fruits, and coffee, the expanded agricultural-livestock trade balance has reached $2.3 billion.
