Korea''--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published a white paper on 2 May denouncing the South Korean puppet clique for stepping up nuclear armament through the development of the fast breeder reactor, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. The South Korean rulers' design to develop the fast breeder reactor began in the '80s and they started the development of a prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan at the beginning of the '90s, the white paper said, and continued: The ``government'' authorities signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of atomic energy with Japan on 25 May 1990, and agreed with it to ``promote the exchange and joint study of atomic technologies.'' It discussed with Japan ``the joint promotion of the development of technologies of the next-generation atomic reactor'' at the ``South Korea-Japan consultative meeting on atomic energy'' held on 9 November 1990. At the tete-a-tete between Kim Yong-sam and Morihiro Hosokawa in Kyongju on November 6, 1993, they agreed in secrecy to proceed with the joint development of nuclear weapons on condition that South Korea makes a clean sheat of Japan's past crimes. The ``government'' authorities decided to invest about 2,000 billion won in the researches and development of atomic energy including the development of the fast breeder reactor and began developing a prototype reactor in 1992. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now running about to get the international community to recognize the ``legality'' of the development of the fast breeder reactor. They hosted an ``international symposium on the reactors of next generation'' in October 1993, in Seoul at which they wrested a promise from some officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to ``cooperate in the development of the next-generation reactor in South Korea.'' Noting that the development of the fast breeder reactor accelerated by South Korea with desperate efforts together with Japan, though its economic advantage and stability are not guaranteed in the world, is motivated by their design of nuclear arms development, the white paper explained the following reasons: Firstly, the development of the fast breeder reactor makes it possible to breed large quantities of plutonium necessary for nuclear bombs. Secondly, it offers a ground for justifying the purchase of plutonium from other countries. Thirdly, the fast-breeder reactor must be accompanied by reprocessing facilities. This fully explains why the Kim Yong-sam group is trying so desperately to possess reprocessing facilities through the development of the fast breeder reactor. Fourthly, the development of the fast-breeder reactor itself is a process of nuclear bomb development. The designing of the fast-breeder reactor is identical with that of nuclear bombs from the technical point of view. This stark fact clearly proves that it is none other than the South Korean ruling group of traitors that reduced to a piece of waste paper long ago the joint declaration on denuclearization agreed on between the North and the South and have been hell bent on nuclear arms development on the Korean peninsula. The white paper demanded that the South Korean authorities eliminate the pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor and, at the same time, promptly stop the development of the fast-breeder reactor and that the international reactionary forces including Japan discontinue working hand in glove with the Kim Yong-sam group in the development of the fast breeder reactor directly linked to the production of nuclear bombs. It expressed the hope that the unbiased opinion of the world will persistently keep tabs on the development of the fast-breeder reactor and nuclear weapons by the South Korean rulers and invigorate the activities for checking it.
