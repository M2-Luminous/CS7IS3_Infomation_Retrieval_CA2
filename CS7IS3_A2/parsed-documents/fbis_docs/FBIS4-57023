Reports indicate that only a few details regarding this list of products to be submitted for negotiation are pending review. Those details are being studied jointly with the production sectors because these sectors have directly demanded that their products be included in this package. Agricultural-livestock and fresh and processed fruit products head the list of products for which Mexico will demand immediate inclusion. Mexico is negotiating this immediate inclusion through NAFTA for the med-term. Secofi revealed unofficially that talks to expedite schedules for tax-elimination [calendarios de desgravacion] were still in the preliminary stage, agendas have barely been agreed on. This is occurring despite the fact that the U.S. and Mexican Governments signed a commitment "as part of NAFTA supplemental negotiations to conclude the review process of the tariff acceleration 120 days after the treaty's entry into force on 1 January, that is, 1 May." The deadline has passed. The United States seeks to expedite particularly the elimination of taxes from products such as wine, plate glass, electric appliances, hardware materials, wood products, among others which make up the long list of goods in the negotiations, however. Secofi even promised to disclose the list of products to be negotiated by the end of the week of 25 April or the beginning of the week of 2 May at the latest, but this never happened. A report indicated that this package is entirely ready for negotiation, however. One line of products for which Mexico wants an early opening is that of processed fruits and vegetables. In this line, 62 percent of the exports must go through a 10-year period before tax exemptions go into effect. Twenty-one percent of sales to the United States face a 15-year protection period. Only three percent of the market is tax free. It is important for Mexico to have an early opening in this line of goods because this is one of the few lines in which the country has a positive trade balance. The main products in this line of exports to the United States, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, however, must wait 10 years before the tax-exemption process begins. Tax-exemption on frozen orange juice will begin in 15 years; 10 years for frozen strawberries. The tax-exemption deadline for processed and preserved tomatoes, for processed avocados, and, in general, for vegetables, is five years. Mexico will request immediate tax exemptions on these products.
