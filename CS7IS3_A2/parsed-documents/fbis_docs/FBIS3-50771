Alarcon said this donation expresses the French people's constant friendship and solidarity for the Cuban people. [Alarcon] "In this solidarity we see an expression of the friendship and support we are receiving from the French people and workers. You have come to a country that is currently facing very complex and difficult times. I hope you have had an opportunity to see, first hand, something of what we are experiencing." The ANPP president also talked about the efforts made by the Cuban people during 1993, the most difficult year since the triumph of the Revolution, and the steps being taken to overcome the crisis. [Alarcon] "We are currently studying measures to be adopted to improve our internal finances. These measures will also help us confront a changing international situation, one that is quite different from the situation that prevailed throughout the past 30 years." Alarcon also said that we are facing a situation similar to the one confronted by practically all the countries of the Third World and that a solution, based on our possibilities and goals, must be sought. [Alarcon] "This is why we have said that we are attempting to find solutions through socialism, and for socialism."
