Within this framework, U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and asked him to decide on a new date for talks with Israel. In a telephone conversation, Warren Christopher also called on Yasir 'Arafat to begin negotiations with the Zionist regime. Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator in the compromising talks, endorsed the issue in his meeting with 'Arafat in Tunis. With this concerted effort, the United States is seeking to salvage the Zionist regime and to depict the blood of the victims of the catastrophic massacre of the fasting Muslim worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi shrine in occupied Palestine as worthless. The more the level of the direct involvement of the Zionist regime's armed forces in the tragedy of the massacre of the Palestinians transpires, and new documentary evidence continues to emerge, the greater the White House effort to support the terrorist echelons in Israel. U.S. President Bill Clinton is quite unattentive to the wounded sensitivities of the Palestinian Muslim nation and the indignation of the international public and the people of the Islamic world and is ignoring the repeated violations of human rights and international norms by the Tel Aviv officials. He is expected to meet Yitzhaq Rabin, the Zionist regime's prime minister, at the White House. Rabin has met the U.S. secretaries of state and defense in Washington and had military and political coordination with them. It is being stated that this Friday, that is, three weeks after Hebron, finally, the Security Council will issue a resolution regarding the killing of the fasting worshipers at the shrine of the Prophet Abraham, peace be upon him. Since the incident, a resolution has repeatedly been promised; in practice, it has not been issued, due to U.S. opposition. It appears unlikely that this promise will be fulfilled to mitigate people's anger over the meeting between the U.S. President and the terrorist head of the Zionist regime. Washington's unconditionally supportive policy for the Zionist regime's officials, which can have no other effect but to enhance their audacity to suppress the Palestinian Muslims, remains a source of concern.
