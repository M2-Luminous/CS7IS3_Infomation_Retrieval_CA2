During the meeting President Berisha told Anderson: We are assessing your mission's efforts to preserve stability and prevent the conflict, because Albania is deeply interested in preventing this conflict. However, we observe with anxiety that the tension continues to remain high and the danger great. The latest developments in Gorazde and the defeat of the United Nations and other institutions have greatly increased possibilities for the conflict to spread down through the region. Regarding the crisis in Albanian-Greek relations, President Berisha stressed that the Albanian side has continuously tried for a policy of understanding and cooperation with its southern neighbor. However, he said, we ascertain that besides the Greek-Serb alliance, the Greek Government has continuously used the Albanian refugee factor as pressure against our country's sovereignty. On the other hand, Greek Government officials have attempted to manipulate certain minority elements to fulfill Greece's open territorial vindications against Albania. The last case -- the massacre by the Greek commando at the recruit barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme -- was an attack against Albania's sovereignty, for which the Greek Government should bear responsibility. The Greek commando came from Greek territory and returned to this territory, too. It had all the characteristics of a commando of the Greek special forces or forces with special training. That is why we have raised this problem to the UN Security Council and the CSCE and have asked the European Union to set up a commission, despite investigations carried out by our both commissions, because Greece cannot be a party in the judgment. However, we are determined to overcome contradictions through dialogue and hope that the other side shows the same will as well. Regarding Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], President Berisha stressed that Albania is profoundly interested in cooperation with this Republic and in its stability. A considerable percentage of the population in that Republic is Albanian. I can say that with their participation in the government, the loyalty they have shown toward the coalition, and the democratic means and methods they have used and continue to use to realize their human and national rights, the Albanians are and will be a factor of stability. Without negating the achievements in the field of rights and freedoms, we insist that the realization of their human and national rights is an important condition for Macedonia's stability. In this aspect, the census of the population, the opening of the schools, and the increasing commitment of the Albanians in the official structures can be considered by us as important steps. For his part, Anderson expressed his concern over the situation in the region and particularly in Macedonia. The pressure exerted from Serbia, the possible explosion of a conflict in Kosova, and the blockade from the south endanger the stability of this Republic. In this direction, the cooperation between Albania and Macedonia is useful and serves stability in the region. We consider the solution of many questions that preoccupy the Albanians there to be an indispensability and we are insisting that the Macedonian Government fulfill the demands of Albanians. We are presently working to accomplish the census of the population and hope that it will be held in June this year.
