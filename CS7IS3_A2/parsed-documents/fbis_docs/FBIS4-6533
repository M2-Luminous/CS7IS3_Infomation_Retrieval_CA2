"We received all the inspections needed to guarantee the continuity of safeguards that have been agreed with the United States," said the North Korean official. "We are willing to discuss the issue of additional, regular and special inspections of our nuclear facilities and Pyongyang's return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) once the third-round talks are held." Asked about the possibility of resuming working-level meetings for further high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang, the official said that "it is not clear for now at least. The important thing is that the United States suspend Team Spirit (the annual South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise) as Washington agreed Feb. 25 and hold the third round of talks."
