Following measures taken by the state, illegal levies and labour duties imposed on farmers dropped for the first time last year since the mid-1980's, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) and the Ministry of Agriculture. Illegal levies--including various kinds of committee charges, administrative fees, and fines--dropped from 12.4 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in 1991 to 7 billion yuan ($804 million) last year. Labour duties dropped to a maximum of 20 working days for the average individual farmer. Fees imposed on farmers for "collective funds"--to pay for administration costs and welfare projects--declined from more than 7 percent to 5 percent of farmers' income, the legal figure stipulated by the central government in 1991. In total, the reforms cut farmers' tax bills and fees by 1.2 yuan ($0.14) last year, a 2.5 percent reduction. At the same time, farmers' per capita income in 1993 rose 14 percent, reaching 921 yuan ($106), according to the SSB. Before last year's reform, farmers had to spend 5 to 8 percent of their income on illegal charges, according to a national survey by the Ministry of Agriculture. Their tax payments totalled 10 per cent. "Farmers have contributed a great deal to the nation's economy but they have not received their due share of rewards," said Li Xiangang, division chief with the Department of Rural Co-operative Economy under the Agricultural Ministry. For years, the government's allocations, investment and price policies had focused on industrialization instead of agriculture. Disadvantage Economic reform has delivered higher income to farmers since the early 1980's, but much of that has been offset by various levies imposed simultaneously. This has left farmers with a sharp disadvantage in the distribution of national wealth. Many local governments demanded collective funds exceeding the stipulated maximum 5 percent rate. Many collected extra fees for constructing public welfare projects, although the farmers had already paid collective funds for them. In some areas, farmers used to have as many as 130 different fees and taxes to pay. Illegal financial burdens have taken much away from farmers' funds that could have been used to finance farm work. This has disrupted normal agricultural production. In some areas, taxes and fees intensified the contradiction between farmers and local leaders. The State Council passed an urgent circular early last year to have local governments eliminate unfair levies imposed on farmers. Officials from the State Council, State Planning Commission, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Supervision checked all state documents on fee collecting from farmers to see if they were legal. Following the survey, the State Council cancelled 80 levies and modified another 24 last July. Similar examinations of local government documents involving financial charges imposed on farmers have since been conducted nationwide. By the end of 1993, the items cancelled by central and provincial governments reduced the total burden by 10 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) nationwide, or 10.28 yuan ($1.18) for each farmer, according to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture. Cutting fees, however, does not remove the root of the problem, said Li. "If local governments' motivation for collecting excess levies is not eliminated, illegal burdens may worsen again in coming years," he said. Local officials' achievements have been assessed mainly by counting their regions' total output value, or the number of construction projects completed, encouraging local authorities to emphasize local industries, instead of agriculture. This naturally resulted in the collection of funds from farmers for industrial projects. If the evaluation system remains unchanged, excessive levies in the countryside cannot be cured. Statistics from the SSB also show that most farmers worry about a renewed increase in illegal levies this year. Besides, the invisible burden of the price scissors--the gap between administratively imposed high prices for industrial products and low agricultural goods--also constricts farmers. Agricultural experts say it is crucial for the nation to reform systems for redistribution and investment. Chen Jiyuan, director of the Rural Development Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that national policies for fiscal expenditures and wealth redistributing should place greater emphasis on agriculture. "Agriculture needs more investments," he said. "The prices of farm products should be increased while those of agricultural machinery and fertilizers should be dropped." The government has made some efforts to narrow the price scissors. During the last 10 years the government has substantially increased the prices of farm products three times. The most recent one was implemented on June 10. Both Li and Chen suggested that local cadres should be evaluated according to more realistic figures, such as regional grain output and farmers living standards. Efforts should also be made to help strengthen the farmer's abilities to protect themselves, said Li. Many farmers have followed every requirement of their local officials. They are unable to judge whether requirements are legal or not. The central government issued a regulation on the farmers' charges and labour duties in 1991, stipulating that the total amount of collective funds imposed on the farmers should not be more than 5 percent of their previous year's total income. But as much as 43 per cent of farmers in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province know nothing about the regulation, according to an SSB sample survey. About one-third of them do not know that they can reject fines unless proper legal papers are provided. Farmers should be better informed, said Li. The Agricultural Ministry plans to broaden public understanding of the nation's legal requirements.
