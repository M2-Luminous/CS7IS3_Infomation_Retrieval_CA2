What is your view of the state of Ukraine's home and foreign affairs? [Kravchuk] To be brief, we are, indeed, going through a very difficult time, and it is clear why. All nations making a transition from one system to another have gone through a similarly difficult time. That is why it is wrong to see only the negative, there is also a positive factor here. But, since life is very complicated, and with the rise of inflation, the fall of production, and various social problems involved, people sometimes fail to see the positive part of our life, while the negative factor is often used by different political forces. One must understand that it can be no other way, because in a democracy, where there is an opposition and a power struggle, all this is taken advantage of in a certain sense. What ways do we see out of this situation? First of all, we are taking very specific steps to create a proper industrial structure to live up to Ukraine's interests. Second, we are solving problems concerning fuel supplies. Despite all the difficulties, we have been able, in the recent years, including the last one, to create conditions for sowing the harvest. The national economy continued to function in winter, and people were provided with heating and all necessities. Of course, all these factors, both positive and negative ones, unfortunately, negative ones to a greater extent, make an impact on people's feelings, socially and politically. Political stability, too, has its roots in the economy, although there are other factors involved. We can see our miscalculations. Already, after two and a half years of my presidency, I can see how many mistakes could have been avoided, but, unfortunately, what has happened has happened, and we can only use these lessons to avoid similar mistakes in future. The one who wins this post can also use the mistakes we made to avoid repeating them in future. Since Ukraine gained its independence, our foreign policy has been aimed at protecting Ukraine's interests by diplomatic means. The main effort was made to promote Ukraine's further integration with European structures, to strengthen economic and political relations, and to develop such relations with the CIS countries and with our neighbors, above all, Russia. Thanks to our consistent foreign policy, Ukraine has taken its place among world powers and is now occupying an important position on the international stage. The trilateral statement signed on 14 January in Moscow made a great contribution to improving the international atmosphere around Ukraine. This has given us clear guarantees for the recognition of our sovereignty and territorial integrity and the granting of financial, economic, and technical assistance. This statement secured a world image for our state. Ukraine, as you know, was the first to sign Partnership for Peace and become part of this NATO program. On Tuesday, 14 June, I am going to Luxembourg where I will sign a document on Ukraine's accession to the European Union on the principles of partnership and cooperation. Naturally, Ukraine as a European state will always lean toward close ties with Europe. But we take a realistic view of the situation, and we cannot follow one track only. Our greatest priority is cooperation within the CIS. Ukraine is part of the economic union. It has signed all the important economic agreements of the CIS. Within the CIS, we have a traditional, friendly partner, Russia, with whom we have signed over 75 documents, and agreements of various kinds regulating our economic, political, and other ties. A broad-scale agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with Russia is currently being drawn up that will place our relations on a qualitatively new level and register fundamental principles of our relations predetermined by our way of life, our history, and our future. It is a very important document, and I hope we can sign it immediately as soon as we solve another urgent problem in Ukrainian-Russian relations, that of the Black Sea Fleet. [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, what ways do you see out of the difficult economic situation in the light of your election program? [Kravchuk] These ways are outlined in the election program, but let me focus our attention on them again. These problems are already being tackled today. First of all, this concerns the entire block of financial problems: Mutual payments, credits, and banking. They are the most painful and urgent ones today, and we not only declare them a priority, but we have agreed a concrete program and concrete ways of improving the situation with the Cabinet of Ministers and the management of the National Bank. The second problem concerns the priorities that must be clearly singled out. I always put forward two priorities that I believe to be basic: Foodstuffs and energy. Any other problem can be solved in the course of time, but these two cannot wait. This is something a person needs every day. These two core priorities must be basic to all of our activities. The successful solution of these issues, that is the development of agriculture and power engineering with related industries, will give an impetus to the development of other sectors, because these are huge industries with a demand for a variety of other products, and will provide for the people's vital needs. Another priority is the reduction of costs in all spheres of the national economy. This problem has never been seriously dealt with. Another concerns the creation of a proper investment climate both for domestic and foreign partners who are very sensitive toward any changes in our legislation and activities. Incidentally, Ukraine's (?constitutional) climate was extremely badly damaged by the cabinet's decrees amending two important laws passed by the Supreme Council. I attend dozens of meetings now that reveal a lack of confidence in ourselves. If we continue to change our laws as frequently, we will never be trusted. Next are the banking, budgetary, monetary and taxation systems. Taxation must stimulate development. We have certain projects in this area that we are sending to the oblasts to develop them further and submit to the Supreme Council. It is clear that we will not be able to avoid a monetary reform. There is one basic principle: It cannot be implemented in a confiscatory manner. People must know that it will be implemented on the basis of social justice, openly, and without any secrets. Next is social security. People who are today in need of support, pensioners, people with many children, and not all pensioners, but only a certain group, require both financial and direct aid, by means of special shops and special opportunities. Now, as we prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's liberation and the victory in the Great Patriotic War, provisions should be made and relevant directives passed on to the local authorities to make it work for the individual. The next aspect includes economic problems: Privatization and demonopolization. These must be pursued openly, under supervision. It implies problems, and there are ways of solving them. [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, how do you see further development of nation-building in Ukraine? [Kravchuk] Nation-building currently boils down to the Constitution. The state must ensure the development of the individual, their rights and freedoms. The overriding principle must not be that of the individual for the state but that of the state for the individual. All this time, the state has been the best protected one. Now, we must protect the individual. But without a Constitution, without legal acts, this is impossible. Therefore, first of all, a Constitution must be adopted, together with elections that are already underway, and there is no denying that elections must be held. But the Supreme Council must pass laws before the elections to guarantee normal development of society, subordination, division of powers, and all related functions. Then it is necessary to stop all discussions as to what we are building and where we are going. I believe that we must be clear about what system and what form of government we should have. If the elections take place, and I am sure they will, and a president is elected, this will mean that the people will have voted for a presidential, parliamentary republic. This must put an end to all discussions, a Constitution must be adopted, relevant structures and authorities must be set up, a strong government, a strong president, and an authoritative Supreme Council must be formed, and we will proceed from there. [Tabachenko] Another question, Leonid Makarovych. What can you say of the successes and problems in the spiritual sphere of our life. Because there are many complaints that it, too, is in decline. [Kravchuk] You see, in such a period as this one, there is either a renaissance or a decline. Sometimes, economic decline may be greater, but revolutionary pathos may inspire a renaissance in the arts. Our development is evolutionary. This evolution may not be seen on the surface, which prompts some to say that there is some kind of a spiritual decline. I would not say so. No creative union has been closed down. All publishing houses are working, books are being published, newspapers are in circulation, television and radio is working, textbooks are being written. Yes, it is difficult, but it is there. Scientists are working, discoveries are being made. There have been a lot more discoveries and practical applications recently than before. We should not dramatize the situation, but look at it comprehensively. Yes, culture needs financial support. That is the way of the world. I believe that the next quarterly budget that will be submitted to the Supreme Council, and I have instructed the government to this effect, will again show support for the arts. There are presidential decrees in support of science, culture, and publishing, but it is not enough. We must make clear budgetary provisions for such support. Using this opportunity, I would like to wish all radio listeners and all voters good spirits and good health. I hope they will all come to the polls, not only in the presidential but also in the local elections, and vote for those people who can ensure Ukraine's peaceful, democratic, and legal development, economic reforms and improvement in the people's living standards.
