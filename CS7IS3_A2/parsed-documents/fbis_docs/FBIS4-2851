"We can't change money, we're too frightened," said the stallholder in the Ritan clothing market, a centre for the illegal trade in the Chinese yuan. "The police closed down lots of stalls and arrested the stallholders last week for continuing to change money," she said, adding that the crackdown followed the murder last month of a trader from northwestern Xinjiang province. "He was murdered during a moneychanging deal. We don't know who did it," she said. At least four nearby stalls were closed, with notices reading "Shut on April 8, 1994" pasted across their doors. The stallholder said the market was still crawling with plainclothes police. China's black market has continued despite this year's currency reforms, which included the unification of the dual rate system that had previously pegged the yuan officially at 5.7 yuan to the dollar compared with about 8.7 yuan on swap markets and on the street. Traders were buying dollars for up 8.87 yuan last month, when the foreign exchange market rate was 8.69 yuan and banks, with their hefty commission, were giving individuals just 8.48 yuan. The stallholder said she did not know the present black market rate.
