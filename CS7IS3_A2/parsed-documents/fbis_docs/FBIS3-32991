International news agencies reported on Wednesday [9 February] that specific groups, made up of persons of Cuban descent and operating in Miami, asked the U.S. Government to provide $500,000 to the island's "dissident movement." According to a spokesman for these groups, quoted by the sources, the request was made officially to Alexander Watson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, during a meeting they held in Miami last month. The "dissidents" would use the money, the spokesperson noted, to acquire equipment to receive information and guidance from abroad. Such equipment could include fax machines and satellite reception dishes. The spokesman concluded by saying that they had not received any official answer from the State Department, at least as of the time of the meeting. [sentence as received] A spokeswoman for the State Department did not want to comment on the issue, nor did she confirm if in fact Watson had accepted the request. The Spanish news agency EFE recalled that these small groups moving in Havana, under the Reagan and Bush administrations, received funds from an agency whose budget is approved by the U.S. Congress: The National Endowment for Democracy [previous name in English]. Toward the end of January, 1992, other news sources reported that this same organization "aided in bringing about the end of communism in Eastern Europe." The group later sponsored seven projects related to Cuba and allocated $500,000 of its overall budget to activities directed at the island. That figure is almost double the amount approved in 1990. Now, just 48 hours before a spokesperson reported the aforementioned request, U.S. authorities discovered a ship off the coast of Florida carrying a large amount of weapons and money, presumably headed for the island's so called "internal opposition." According to THE MIAMI HERALD, the vessel, and its seven passengers, were carrying 50 rifles and pistols, about 25,000 rounds of ammunition, and "a few thousand dollars in cash." The HERALD states that Rodolfo Frometa, a member of the terrorist Alpha 66 organization, was the mission's leader. The mission's target was to land a commando team on Cuban soil. Some recalled that the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted another group of Cuban subversives in the area last Spring. The Coast Guard follows a government order issued by the Clinton administration rejecting this type of illegal activity. On 29 December, 1991, Cuban authorities captured three heavily armed men carrying explosives, whose mission was to contact the leaders of these small groups -- who call themselves defenders of human rights -- as well as carrying out terrorist operations. More recently, during the third Ibero-American summit in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, the Brazilian police reported the possibility of a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. Personalities who openly and systematically encourage "dissident" activities in Cuba were reportedly linked to the plot. [passage omitted]
