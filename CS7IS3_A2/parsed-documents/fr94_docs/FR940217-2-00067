FR940217-2-00067 FR940217-2-00033 [2171] Program Announcement and Proposed Funding Priorities for Special Project Grants to Schools of Public Health for Fiscal Year 1994 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Special Projects Grants to Schools of Public Health under the authority of section 762, title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed funding priorities. Approximately $2.4 million will be available in FY 1994 for this program to support 18 to 20 competing awards averaging $120,000 to $133,000. Previous Funding Experience Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program. There were no competitive grant cycles in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. In FY 1991, HRSA reviewed 32 applications for this grant program. Of those applications, 53 percent were approved and 47 percent disapproved. Seventeen grant projects, or 100 percent of the approved grant applications, were funded. Purpose Section 762 of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended, authorizes the Secretary to award grants to accredited schools of public health for the costs of planning, developing, demonstrating, operating, and evaluating projects that are in furtherance of the goals established by the Secretary for the year 2000 in the area of: (1) Preventive medicine; (2) health promotion and disease prevention; (3) improving access to and quality of health services in medically underserved communities; or (4) reducing the incidence of domestic violence. The period of initial Federal support will not exceed 3 years. Eligibility Eligible applicants for this program are accredited schools of public health. ``A school of public health'' means a school as defined in section 799(1)(A) of the PHS Act which has been accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health pursuant to section 799(1)(E) of the Act and which is located in a State as defined in section 799(9) of the Act. Applicant schools must assure that the students of the school will, through participation in the project for which the award is made, receive training in the activities carried out by the project. Section 762(e) of the PHS Act provides that the Secretary establish goals for projects under this authority and shall require as a condition of the receipt of a Special Project Grant to Schools of Public Health that schools carry out activities in furtherance of meeting the goals. Also the law provides that the Secretary establish and implement a methodology for measuring the extent of progress that has been made toward the goals by schools receiving such a grant. A Report to Congress describing the progress made by projects is due not later than February 1, 1994. The goals required by section 762(e) are currently in development and are expected to be available to be mailed with program application materials. National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 The Public Health Service urges applicants to submit work plans that address specific objectives of Healthy People 2000. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238).
