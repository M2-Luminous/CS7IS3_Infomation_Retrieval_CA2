SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the SEC. Applicants' Representations 1. The Fund is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund is composed of eleven separate portfolios. Currently, shares of the Fund are sold only to Northbrook Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (the ``Companies'') to fund flexible premium variable annuity contracts issued through certain of their separate accounts. Dean Witter InterCapital Inc. (``InterCapital''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co., is the investment manager for the Fund. InterCapital and the Companies were previously under common control (ultimately owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co.). 2. The Fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of various insurance companies to fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts (collectively, ``variable contracts''). Insurance companies whose separate accounts do or will own shares of the Fund are referred to herein as ``participating insurance companies.'' It is anticipated that participating insurance companies will rely on rules 6e&hyph;2 or 6e&hyph;3(T) under the Act, although some may rely on individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts.
