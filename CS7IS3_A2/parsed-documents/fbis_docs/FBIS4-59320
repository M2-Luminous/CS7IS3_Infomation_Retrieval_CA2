However, these forces have noble values and objectives that stem from their concern about all the sons of our people, especially the residents of beloved Aden. This is why these forces would never permit terrorizing the residents of the city of Aden or any other city. But this treacherous gang that has abandoned all religious and moral values is determined to provoke the feelings of our people and the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy by striking at residential neighborhoods in the steadfast city of Sanaa with the missiles of treachery and meanness that have claimed the lives of many innocent citizens. However, the gang of the vile killers will never escape the people's retribution. May God have mercy on the righteous martyrs, the victims of treachery. It is a true promise to the sons of our people to take revenge on the killers and their criminal, cowardly leader al-Bid and all those who advocate secession and apostasy.
