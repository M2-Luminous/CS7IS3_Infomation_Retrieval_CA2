FR940118-2-00088 FR940118-2-00054 The fourth group of surveillances concern calibration of RPS electrical protection assembles (EPAs). Based on the inherent lack of drift of the EPAs and the accuracy of the system logic, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending these surveillance intervals. The licensee also proposed reestablishment of the baseline for the ``N times 18 months'' cumulative surveillance interval for response time testing by extending the cumulative surveillance interval to coincide with the individual extensions discussed above. Extension of the cumulative interval would not be for more than the individual extensions requested. Due to the fact that the individual extensions have been shown to present no significant increase in risk as discussed above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending the cumulative surveillance interval for response time testing. 2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The extension of the surveillance intervals will not result in any changes in plant configuration or operation. Therefore, the extensions will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated or analyzed. 3. The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. For the reasons cited in Criterion 1 above, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P&hyph;223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
