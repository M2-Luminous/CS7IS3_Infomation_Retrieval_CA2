Today we have reprinted a commentary on the problem published by SHICHANG BAO [MARKET DAILY] in the hope of calling public attention to the matter. The "rush of peasants job hunters to the cities" stems from the imbalance in social economic development and also shows that rural labor is moving toward the market. The present problem, however, is that the spontaneous rush of surplus rural labor to the cities has been very haphazard and has brought great pressure to bear upon the departments responsible for transportation and urban management, causing much inconvenience for those peasants who are going to work in urban areas and causing a waste of labor in circulation. The departments concerned must do a good job in diverting and protecting the rush of surplus rural labor to the cities. The plan for organizing an orderly transregional migration of rural labor put forward by the Labor Ministry sets the principal requirements as follows: "The transfer of labor to other regions should be well organized; labor that is transferred from other regions should be well managed; labor circulation services should be provided; and the circulation of labor should be properly regulated and controlled." This plan, which tackles the problem head-on, is a positive measure for solving the haphazard flow of surplus rural labor. The departments concerned should do their utmost to coordinate their efforts and make a success of their organizational and propaganda work so as to effect an orderly transfer of surplus rural labor. SHICHANG BAO published today carried a reporter's commentary entitled "When Will There No Longer Be a Haphazard Flow of Surplus Rural Labor?" The commentary analyzed the present state of migrant workers and stressed the need to channel the increasing "rush of peasant job hunters to the cities" onto a normal course -- specifically, to promote and achieve a rational and orderly flow of surplus rural labor. According to the commentary, recently a large number of peasants have been gathering around Chongwenmen in Beijing every day, resulting in the formation of a spontaneous "labor market," where employers can choose the laborers they need. Many peasants, however, failed to find a job in half a month. A survey has shown that migrant workers currently number 20 million nationwide. They primarily are rushing to the economically developed regions, including the Zhujiang Delta, the Changjiang Delta, Beijing, and Tianjin from Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, and other inland provinces. Surplus rural labor is currently estimated at 130 million. This reveals a serious level of insufficient employment in rural areas. Because "many peasants spend three months doing farm work, one month celebrating the New Year, and eight months idling about" -- which is a saying that truly portrays the plight of many peasants -- they are choosing to work in the cities. But some peasants fail to get a job because they do not have quick access to information or are up against keen competition. Making a futile journey and then failing to find a job causes them economic losses and mental anguish. In the meantime, the practically simultaneous rush of a large number of peasants to a few cities puts extremely great pressure on transportation and other basic industries, which are already considerably burdened, and also makes urban administration and construction more difficult. The commentary pointed out: Allowing for the transregional flow of the comparatively surplus rural labor is an effective way to develop and tap labor resources in rural areas and to give jobs to peasants as well as an important method of transferring surplus labor. Broadly speaking, this practice is in line with the law governing economic development. What matters is that the rush of job seekers must be rationally guided and controlled so as to promote what is beneficial and what is harmful. Some experts predicted that there will be more than 10 million migrant workers in the period around the Spring Festival, because the underlying factors that have caused the rush will still be there. Guangdong has formulated a set of effective measures to alleviate the desperate situation. In 1992, Guangdong established transprovincial (transregional) labor coordination relations with nine provinces (autonomous regions) including Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi to organize transprovincial (transregional) labor transfer in an orderly way. This has enabled them to gradually effect an orderly migration of this huge population. In 1993, the number of new migrant workers coming to Guangdong only accounted for 5 percent of the total migrant workers in Guangdong and represented a 70 percent decrease over the 1992 figure. The commentary stressed: To put the increasing "rush of job seekers" onto a normal course and to promote a rational and orderly flow of surplus rural labor, it is necessary to formulate fundamental rules and regulations and to form an information system and a service network which are suited to the market economy to facilitate transregional labor flows. From a long-term point of view, the basic ways to standardize transregional labor migration and eliminate the negative effect of the rush of peasants seeking jobs, are to promote the development of rural labor and create more job positions in rural areas by developing the range and quality of agricultural production, developing township enterprises, stepping up the construction of small towns, and developing tertiary industry in townships and towns.
