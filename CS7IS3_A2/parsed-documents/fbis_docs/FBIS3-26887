This could "needlessly complicate our relations with foreign countries and even create incidents inimical to our national security," said Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ople made the remark in the wake of reports that 97 congressmen had co-authored a House resolution calling for a review of the country's relations with China and Taiwan. The resolution came out just one day after the clandestine meeting in Subic of President Fidel Ramos with Taiwanese leader Li Teng-hui, for which the Chinese Embassy here had already lodged a protest with the Philippine Government saying the incident had violated the agreed one-China policy. "The sphere of foreign policy with respect to China and Taiwan is fraught with perils and this should be treated with great sensitivity, not knee-jerk emotional reactions or rank amateurism," Ople said in a statement. He said that "(the House) move will be prone to misunderstanding and may cause unintended consequences." He added that the country's political leaders should share President Ramos's attitude that friendly relations with China should be preserved and nurtured for the sake of the national interest. "We want and we seek a mutually advantageous economic relationship with Taiwan, and value their cooperation, but this should be conducted in a manner consistent with our solemn undertakings under the 1975 covenant with China on a policy recognizing only one China," he said.
