The party cannot approve the market opening schedules the government has submitted to the secretariat of the general agreement on tariffs and trade because they were prepared without consultation with the DP, he told parliament. Yi then called for scrapping the National Security Law, which he called "a leftover of the Cold War era," and enacting a new law protecting democratic order to replace it. Commenting on political reforms, he echoed ruling Democratic Liberal Party chairman Kim Chong-pil's call for passage of the reform bills by parliament during its current session. The redistricting plan being studied by the ruling party should be limited to merging counties into their adjacent cities, and the central government should delegate many of its powers to local governments for effective local autonomy. The ruling party should not make use of the redistricting plan to achieve its political objectives, he warned. Yi also called for an immediate summit meeting between North and South Korea, adding, "I believe that even if a summit is out of question now I, in the capacity of the opposition leader, must meet the North Korean leaders to solve inter-Korean issues." He welcomed North Korea's belated decision to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities and said, "there still remain problems and the government should make diplomatic efforts to solve the nuclear issue in three-way negotiations among Washington, Pyongyang and Seoul." Calling for revision of the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula, which bars North and South Korea from possessing nuclear fuel-reprocessing facilities after the settlement of the nuclear issue, Yi said the annual military exercise with the United States, "Team Spirit," must be suspended as it stands in the way of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. The government should give top priority in its economic management plan to fighting rising costs as the people now suffer from runaway inflation, he stressed. He called for the central bank to be independent from the government, tax reforms, amendments to labor laws, a law replacing the emergency presidential order requiring the use of real names in all financial transactions, and measures against water pollution. The opposition leader urged President Kim Yong-sam to present a clear direction for his reform program and to carry it out lawfully, calling the reforms of the past year "a reform for show and demonstration."
