It is like a father. Then one meets a girl...." So says Marco Zacchera, the man whom Fini has appointed as head of "organization." "There has never been a bust of Il Duce on my desk... On the contrary: The other day, as soon as my appointment became official, a party member said to me: `Marco, I am going to bring you something nice, a souvenir...' I quickly retorted: `Thanks, but I am interested only if it has a value on the antiques market....'" Marco Zacchera, 42 years old, with a 14-year-old daughter, sits behind the new desk assigned to him by MSI [Italian Social Movement] Secretary Gianfranco Fini. A desk that suddenly has become a nerve-center. He was appointed to "head the organization of the party." It is he who will have to resolve the squabbles that break out in the party's sections and local headquarters, including those stemming from the disruptive presence of the new symbol, the AN [National Alliance]. It is he who will oversee the issuance of membership cards. Previously, Alterio Matteoli headed membership. He is now assigned to environment issues. But previously, the MSI was an opposition party. And previously, above all, there was not that still mysterious catchall called the AN. Zacchera, a Piedmontese, a Bocconi graduate in economics and trade, a former regional councilman, and now a newly elected member of the Chamber of Deputies, is aware of having taken on a thankless task: "This is not an easy moment for our militants. Many still have the mentality of those who have always been on the outside. They use the blunt language of opposition. After years of darkness they see people arriving whom they do not know, people appearing on `their' electoral lists, those from the AN... And they ask themselves: `Who are these people? Where do they come from?' I understand bewilderment and diffidence. I do not understand, and I reject, nostalgic attitudes, attitudes of outward bunkering; those, I do not understand; they only do us harm. On the outside we are still branded, labeled; but in all truth, the MSI's members sometimes bring it on themselves." The so-called Fini team consists of the 40-somethings within the party. They will have to deal with those who, like Teodoro Buontempo, of the purist and hard-line wing, called for a "moratorium" until the party congress. Deputies Roberto Menia from Trieste and Gianni Mastrangelo from Apulia will be working with Zacchera. They will have to coordinate with Antonio Mazzone, a deputy from Naples, the new head of local agencies, who in turn will have four teammates: Riccardo Migliori (regional policies); Giuseppe Tagliente, mayor of Vasto, (mayoral activities); Vincenzo Nespoli (municipalities); and Marcello Perina (provinces). As yet unfilled is the void in the public relations sector, a sensitive task. The candidate's name most frequently whispered is that of Gianni Alemanno, a Rauti follower. A party made up solely of "Finians?" Zacchera smiles: "Obviously, the secretary prefers to put himself in the hands of people who are in agreement with him. But this does not mean being dogmatic. I have many friends also among the Rautians." First rule: Develop the art of getting along. "I learned that in the family," the new head of organization says. His family is of DC [Christian Democratic Party] extraction and culture. In 1946, his grandfather was the DC leader in Verbania, Zacchera's hometown. His father was deputy mayor of Stresa. Five brothers, "five diverse opinions." "My brother Vittorio," says Zacchera, "was a communal councilman in Verbania under the banner of the hammer and sickle. I was there too, but as group leader of the MSI..." "I am not a nostalgic," says Zacchera. True, but there are a lot of nostalgia still about, and it will be difficult to get them to swallow the secretary's "reform" views... The nostalgists are afraid to lose their roots. They want neither to abjure nor to repudiate them, and they do not appreciate the passage in Fini's remarks to the Chamber, in which he said: "Antifascism has been an essential step toward democracy..." Zacchera leaves no doubt as to his leanings: "I identify fully with those remarks... I am a convinced supporter of the AN. The MSI must be structured in such a way as to be able to talk with the AN. It must convince its members of this... Dissolve the MSI? I am absolutely certain that the secretary has no such thought of doing it, just like that, on the spot, one two. Only a party congress can decide to merge with the AN. But these things must be worked out little by little..." What relations does Zacchera have with the old party? "The party is like a father. You love him, you respect him. Then, one day..." One day... enter the AN? "Yes, one day, you find a pretty girl and you fall in love. Father remains in your heart, but you marry. And you can only hope he will bless the nuptials... and life goes on."
