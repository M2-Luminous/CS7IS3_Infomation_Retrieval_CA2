Three weeks after his success in the elections, he was expelled from Bulgaria. He is persona non grata in Austria, and Germany refused him a visa. He subsequently threatened Germany with a third world war. We have with us live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Good evening. It is hard to believe you when you say that you wish to crush Germany in a third world war when you come to power. Did you really say that? [Zhirinovskiy] No. I wanted to visit Germany once again. I visited Germany previously, on four occasions, but I would like to say that if future events in Russia unfold as they do now, or as they do in the Balkans, or in some other parts of the world, a third world war may break out one day. I want to prevent this, I want to take measures now to prevent the risks of a new world war. [D'Arvor] You seem to long for a Russia that would expand into a Great Russia. You say you wish to recover the Baltic states, Finland, and Poland. Where will your yearning for expansion stop? [Zhirinovskiy] No expansion. On the contrary, we now have a situation where, for instance, Tajikistan and some Transcaucasian republics want to be with Russia once again. But I for one, together with my party, do not want this. We want the opposite. This is a recurrent lie. I say these countries should develop on their own as independent states, but I also say they will never be like independent states, because they joined Russia 200 years ago. This was always the tragedy of these peoples. They tell me they have no possibility of being [independent] states, now this is the same problem, always the tragedy of Tajiks, or of Georgians, of Armenians, of Azeris. We are [word indistinct] here in Russia and I favor the pullout of all Russian troops back to Russia, to Moscow. You will see for yourself that a terrible war will start there between Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran. The same thing is happening now in Afghanistan, without a president, without a government, with gangs, with groups, with a commander or something similar. This is not a state, this is not civilization. This is already a part of the third world war because there are millions and millions of people living there, and they are in a situation of civil war within their country, or in a state of war with other states: Armenia and Azerbaijan, Abkhazia and Georgia, Tajikistan and Afghanistan. This is already a part of the world war because it is a vast territory from India to Athens, to Serbia. It is larger than Europe during the World War II. [D'Arvor] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, do you yourself wish to return to the former Great Russia, that of the tsars? [Zhirinovskiy] I want to see our state within its historical borders, but not through violent means, only through economic means, through civilization, culture, law. For instance, if one day they want to return, if they call on us, and if you in the West, in Paris or in London, say we too will help these people to live, to remain alive, then perhaps can we take positive steps. However, now, we do not want them to come back within Russia, all the peoples from the south, from Tajikistan to Chisinau. We do not want this, my party and I are against this. [D'Arvor] Does this include the Baltic states? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, the Baltic states too, but I say we must have economic relations. This does not mean constant aid for the Baltic states. If we stop selling our energy and mineral resources cheaply to the Baltic states, contrary to what we are doing now, their existence as independent states is over. I say: If I lead the Russian Government, we will immediately stop all economic aid to the Baltic states and to any other country. Trade yes, but pay, pay: Pay with hard currencies and no more economic aid. After that, the existence of the Baltic states as independent states is over. [D'Arvor] I understand. When you say if I lead the Russian Government, does this mean that you wish to replace the current prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin? [Zhirinovskiy] Could you repeat your question more slowly? [D'Arvor] Do you wish to see the current prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, resign and hand over power to you? [Zhirinovskiy] I believe that he will stay for a few months, but in March or April, we will have another prime minister. Our president, Mr. Yeltsin, wants to keep Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister and also some other ministers from the previous government. It is their ultimate mistake; if they make it, it will be over for this government in April, and we will have a government led not by myself -- I know I said that I would lead the government -- but by a more neutral person, perhaps from Siberia. He will lead the new Russian Government with new ministers, but Mr. Gaydar's team, with its conception of this economic reform that only brings negative results...[pauses] Programs must be changed, we need reforms, but through other programs. It is the same as medicine: You must have medication, but prescribed by another doctor. [passage omitted]
