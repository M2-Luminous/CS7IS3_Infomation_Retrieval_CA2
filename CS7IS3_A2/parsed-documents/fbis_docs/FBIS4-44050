This visit will "open a new chapter" in relations with the People's Republic of China and might have an impact "throughout the coming decade," Wang Yanyi, the new Chinese ambassador, stated at a news conference in Vienna. Particularly in terms of economic cooperation, there are still "great opportunities," Ambassador Wang pointed out. It is true that the trade volume has increased since the establishment of official relations in 1971 by 400 million to 11.5 billion (1993) [currency not given], but it only accounts for about 1 percent of overall foreign trade in both countries. Above all, China is interested in Austrian technology for hydroelectric power plants -- special Elin turbines for rivers with low water levels, for example. Prime Minister Li Peng (65) himself studied hydroelectric engineering in Moscow at the beginning of the 1950's and then worked in the sphere of energy, which is vital for China's development. After political talks in Vienna, the Chinese prime minister will visit the Steyr-Daimler-Puch test site near St. Valentin and the state-owned steel works in Linz. After a visit to Salzburg, he will travel to Germany on Sunday. If expressed "to a moderate extent," criticism regarding the human rights situation in China will not endanger the course of cooperation that has been started, the Chinese side announced. China is not only carrying out political reforms, but the legal system is also being expanded. However, China wants to balance reform, development, and stability. A situation like in the former Soviet Union or the former Yugoslavia is to be avoided.
