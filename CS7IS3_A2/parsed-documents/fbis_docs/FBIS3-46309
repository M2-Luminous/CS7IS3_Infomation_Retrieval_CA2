A vice foreign minister of the ROK, speaking to reporters yesterday, said that because the missile threat from the North is very real, the ROK hopes to strengthen the U.S.-ROK joint defense capability by the deployment of Scud [as heard] missiles. The foreign ministry official said that the missiles to be deployed in the ROK will not be purchased by Seoul but that they will only augment the arms equipment in the U.S. military base. An ROK military figure said that the plan on the deployment of missiles was proposed by the U.S. side and that the ROK is worried that this step might provoke [chagugul chuge toelkkabwa] North Korea [choson]. A U.S. official on 25 January had said that the demand for the deployment of the missiles in the ROK had been made by the commander of the U.S. Forces in the ROK. The U.S. official stressed that the United States does not intend to provoke North Korea by the deployment of the missiles in the ROK or to use the Scud [as heard] missiles as a leverage for the nuclear arms negotiation between the United States and Korea.
