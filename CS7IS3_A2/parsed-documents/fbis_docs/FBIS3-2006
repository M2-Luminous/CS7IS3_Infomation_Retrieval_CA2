With the country's 100-plus real estate companies taking part, the exhibition has been mounted in Beijing's newly-completed building material mansion. The exhibition is sponsored by the Construction Commission of the Beijing municipal government and jointly hosted by the Beijing real estate development market and the Dayin Real Estate Exhibition Center. Being displayed are the achievements and recent development of real estate all over the country. Deals on houses of various grades built for sale on the open market are taking place at the event. Personnel from the municipal housing management departments, banks and legal departments are on hand at the exhibition to handle on the spot such matters as transfer of ownership for house-buyers. The Beijing municipal government has also provided well-designed apartments -- on sites totalling two million square meters in area -- for sale at the exhibition so that ordinary salary-earners can enter the house market as well.
