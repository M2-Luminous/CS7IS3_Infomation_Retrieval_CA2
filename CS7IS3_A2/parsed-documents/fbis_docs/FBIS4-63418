But his removal from his post and the appointment of Vice Adm. Igor Khmelnov to act as commander have certainly not sent the Pacific Fleet's officers into great raptures. Moreover, many of the fleet's cadre officers are openly voicing their categorical protest at such a substitution. One Pacific Fleet officer, who asked not to be named, declared that the fleet's officers are displeased because Vice Adm. Khmelnov (until recently Adm. Gurinov's deputy) does not, unfortunately, command significant authority in the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, some Pacific Fleet officers directly name Vice Adm. Khmelnov among those probably responsible for the recent disaster (the blowing up of the Pacific Fleet Air Force's combat supplies)! The point is that directly after a similar explosion in the Pacific Fleet last year it was Vice Adm. Khmelnov who was entrusted with investigating the causes of what happened and taking measures to prevent the possibility of a repetition of such disasters in the future. The vice admiral reported back on the work done. Now a year has passed, there has been a new and far more terrible disaster...and Pacific Fleet officers are amazed that Vice Adm. Khmelnov is at once being appointed to command the fleet, and is being appointed at a time when we can still see the smoking ruins of the weapons dumps for whose safety Vice Adm. Khmelnov personally was responsible.... Flagrant sloppiness and negligence in guarding the arsenal caused the Pacific Fleet's aviation dumps to blow up. The Pacific Fleet's counterintelligence staffers have established that one of the sentries, during his rest period after being relieved from his post, found an electrical assembly of a missile's solid-propellant booster in the dump's grounds and started taking it apart with a knife. Another sentry of the same shift was nearby. A blow from the knife caused the propellant charge to ignite, and the sentry could think of nothing better to do than to throw the burning electrical assembly into a thicket of last year's grass, which at once caught fire. A stack of rockets was nearby! The fire embraced it, and a few minutes later an explosion thundered forth. The sentries fled the scene without taking measures to extinguish the fire or notifying the unit's command. The garrison's military prosecutor's office has instituted criminal proceedings in this regard, and the investigation is continuing.
