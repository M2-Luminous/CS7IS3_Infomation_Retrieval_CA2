According to the official Xinhua news agency, Wei was released shortly after being picked up and questioned by police Friday as he was attempting to return to Beijing from the nearby port city of Tianjin. "The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau summoned Wei Jingsheng and had a talk with him yesterday," Xinhua said in a brief dispatch late Saturday. "Wei left the bureau immediately afterwards," it added. The dispatch gave no reason for Wei's detention and no indication as to his present circumstances. However, Wei's secretary Tong Yi, who was travelling in the same car as the 43-year-old dissident when he was stopped and detained on the outskirts of Beijing, said Sunday that she was unaware of his release. "I have not seen him and he hasn't called me," Tong said by telephone, adding that she had no idea of his whereabouts. The secretary had earlier said that she hoped Wei would be released after 24 hours, as happened when he was detained during a police sweep of at least 15 dissidents in Shanghai and Beijing in early March. Following his release at that time, Wei left Beijing on March 6, for what his secretary said was a period of recuperation, and had not attempted to return to the capital until Friday.
