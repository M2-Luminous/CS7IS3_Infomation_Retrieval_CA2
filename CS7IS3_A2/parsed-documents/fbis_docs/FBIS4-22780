FBIS4-22780 "jpusr046___94013" FBIS-USR-94-046 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 13 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Antimonopoly Committee on System of Goods Certification Antimonopoly Committee on System of Goods Certification 944E0738A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 13 Apr 94 p 2 944E0738A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "The Commission on Operational Questions: The Antimonopoly Committee Revolted Against the System"] [Text] The members of the governmental commission on operational questions yesterday unequivocally accepted the opinion of the Antimonopoly Committee that fundamental reform of the Russian system of goods certification is needed. However, the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures] did not really expect to convince all opponents immediately; obviously one of its objectives was simply acquainting first vice premier Oleg Soskovets with an alternative viewpoint on this problem. Sergey Bezverkhiy, chairman of the Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, presented his view of the department's problems in present conditions. According to him, Russia has now joined three international certification systems and is already completing negotiations to join several others (certification of metals, composites, and railway transport). But there are a number of unresolved problems in the domestic system. Above all this means the weak legislative base; in Russia only 6 normative enactments "cover" this area, while there are 33 of them in Japan, 160 in the United States, and more than 300 in the European Community. Moreover, the switch from the Soviet certification system to a purely Russian one--GOST R [All-Russian State Standard]--must be accompanied by a concurrent reworking of the "Soviet" standards. But the Committee's capabilities do not allow it to conduct refinement of the 26,000 old GOST's quickly. Oleg Soskovets gave his opinion on the report briefly: "Resounding, but nonsensical." The first vice premier treated the Antimonopoly Committee expert's report, which generally questioned the feasibility of preserving the Russian certification system in the present form, with much greater attention. In the GKAP's opinion, at least two defects are inherent in it. The first is, that from a practical standpoint, the mandatory procurement of a certificate of compliance with national GOST's (which, incidentally, is a purely Russian invention) provides the Russian exporter with no advantage--the quality of the Russian (Soviet) standards themselves is yet to be proven in the West. By the way, even on the domestic market the system of total certification has not resulted in better quality goods. The second defect is that monitoring and commercial functions are combined in the Committee--the right to issue certificates of compliance is delegated only to testing centers and laboratories under the Committee's jurisdiction. At the present time, GKAP specialists possess information on "arrangements" (for example, by the certification company "Rostest-Moskva" [Russia-test Moscow] with Moscow customs) which result in the formation of a monopoly on this type of services. [First Box] During the period 1992-1993, more than 225,000 certificates were issued on Russian output, including 180,000 for foodstuffs. Moreover, about 108,000 certificates were issued for imported output, and of them about 100,000 were for food products. More than 2,600 types of goods did not receive certificates because they did not meet safety requirements, and that includes 2,000 types of food products. [Second Box] Russia has joined the following international certification systems: - highway transport means certification system (Geneva Convention of the United Nations European Economic Commission); - MEK [International Electrotechnical Commission] electrical equipment testing system for compliance with safety standards (accreditation of Russian laboratories within its framework scheduled for May 1994); - Brussels Convention on Mutual Recognition of Control Marks for Firearms and Ammunition (accreditation of Russian laboratories scheduled for June 1994).
