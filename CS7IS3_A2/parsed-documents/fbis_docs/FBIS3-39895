The concrete reason is Volker Ruehe's intention to refrain from using partly brand-new combat and transport helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8) of the GDR [German Democratic Reublic] National People's Army (NVA). In the opinion of the Audit Office, the use of the equipment might save up to 1.5 billion German marks [DM] from 1994 to 2002, while, "however, the transport and operational opportunities of the Bundeswehr helicopters would be improved." At the same time, the Cabinet committed Ruehe to saving an additional DM1.25 billion in his budget in 1994 alone. The helicopters are the only armored ones owned by the Bundeswehr and they could thus effectively support dangerous humanitarian missions (Somalia) or such of the new "crisis-reaction forces." It is assumed that the reason for Ruehe's resistance is that he either does not want to correct a former decision of his house or fears that the plans for new helicopter models would then be stopped for the time being. The budget committee of the Bundestag will deal with the topic at the end of February, since an agreement between the Audit Office and the ministry was not achieved last week. According to the Audit Office, the limited use of the NVA helicopters would permit the earlier replacement of outdated or unfit helicopters and accelerate the planned transition to more powerful machines. Moreover, the planning of new construction programs by the Bundeswehr and industry is ensured. The Audit Office also criticized the delayed and incomplete delivery of documents. In May 1993, the Audit Committee of the Bundestag (a body in the Budget Committee) called on Ruehe "to check the further use of the total stock of all available helicopters by means of cost-benefit analyses and analyses of demand and to reconsider, above all, his decision to refrain from using the Mi-24 combat helicopters and the Mi-8 transport helicopters." The Defense Ministry stated that all necessary examinations had already been carried out earlier. The Audit Office said: "Nevertheless, a new examination, which was internally checked by the Defense Ministry until January 1994, was going on until September 1993. The present report contains a survey of the 'Bundeswehr's helicopter planning'; however, it neither contains the requested analyses of demand nor cost-benefit analyses, but it only recompiles already known information." According to the Audit Office, the Defense Ministry's assumptions in its cost accounting for the use of the two NVA helicopters are "incomplete or incorrect," which disadvantages the NVA material. The Defense Ministry's statement that there are no documents that show the costs of use by the NVA are not available is "wrong."
