Prokofyeva video report from Chita; from the "Utro" program] [Text] [Prokofyeva] We have become wiser now and we know that if a number is attached to the name of a city it means it is a closed facility of military significance. We are in Chita-46, the home of missile forces. It was here that some of the missiles were destroyed in the presence of U.S. observers. How many remain? Naturally we do not have an answer to this question, but of course the most modern ones, the latest generation remain. Here in the forest one of the missiles was stored in a special silo. We also do not know where the remaining ones are stored today. Strange incompatible things seem to coexist in our lives today. Right here in the forest you can also find the hothouses where the military and their families grow vegetables and potatoes to survive. If previously, towns of this sort had a special status and received special supplies, now this is no longer true, and wages are being delayed here just like everywhere else. One can probably get used to anything, even to the fact that your neighbors are missiles with nuclear warheads. Nevertheless, people want guarantees of their safety and of their children. This is understandable. [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] What safety guarantees are there? [V.A. Kornauk, head of the town's administration] Safety guarantees lie in the reliability of our weapons, the work of high-class specialists, and the fact that work is carried out in strict accordance with instructions and by people who know their job. Any danger to the surrounding population, as I know and understand it, is excluded. [end recording] [Prokofyeva] However physicians have their own opinion on this score. Facilities of this sort were always under the control of the Third Main Administration of the Ministry of Health which dealt with professionals. Neither medical services nor rural, rayon, or city physicians had access to their information. This was the reason for numerous tragedies around such places as Semipalatinsk, Chelyabinsk, Novaya Zemlya, and other similar places, and there are more of them in Russia than we know. [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] Aleksey Yakovlevich, so you feel the radiation situation is a real problem? [A. Ya. Miloserdov, chief state medical physician of Chita Oblast] The first domestic uranium was mined in our oblast and an underground nuclear explosion was carried out in our oblast in the past. Two military districts operate in our oblast with all the subsequent consequences, and according to our data about 220 natural radioactive anomalies have been established in our oblast. Scientists of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences worked here recently and they found that the people of Baley city, for example, have considerable depressed health reserves. In particular abnormalities are common as well as problems with cancer and immune deficiencies. If you compare immunology charts of people who live in the Semipalatinsk test range region with those here, the local ones are much worse. This is why together with the Committee for Ecology and the oblast administration we have formed a program of urgent measures to normalize the radiation situation. This program has passed its first expert examination in the Ministry of Ecology and it has been mostly approved. We are now completing it and will present it to the expert commission for adoption. This should give us the necessary funds. I think questions of rehabilitation of ill people in these regions will also be addressed. In particular, we must very seriously and comprehensively work out a plan for the rehabilitation of children from these places. [end recording]
