This evening, the Government Ministry released a press note reporting that it also agreed to "clean" El Zungano region of any military presence. The rebels headed by Jose Angel Talavera, also known as "Chacal," operate in that region. According to official information, the EPS will only leave a small unit in the Cautalu sector, another bastion of approximately 400 former rearmed "contras," known as "recontras." "Seven days after the opening of the (recontras') reconcentration zone, the (eight-point) agenda will be discussed in total. This agenda was presented by the Northern Front on 15 February," the note added. These counterproposals by the government will be sent to "Chacal" at an undetermined date through the OAS' International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) which, together with representatives of the church, is serving as a mediator in these negotiations. In addition, the government will focus its efforts on social development in the country's northern area with the support of ministries and other state agencies and with the opening of an interinstitutional office in Quilali, near the border with Honduras. A group of six from the 3-80 Northern Front's staff demanded the incorporation of "recontra" chiefs to the Jinotega and Nueva Segovia Police in order for them to disarm and demobilize. Other (recontras) should be incorporated into the Quilali, Jicargo, Murra, San Juan del Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, Ciudad Antigua, la Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay Police. They also asked for the creation of a development center located in Quilali, the reconcentration of the EPS' troops, and the maintenance of no more than 60 soldiers in those municipalities, except in Murra. Other rebels demands are the demilitarization of the northern part of the country -- once the 3-80 Northern Front's disarmament progresses -- as well as benefit programs for the wounded, widows, and orphans. Additional rebels requests are the repair of rural roads in the region, the creation of a special fund for the north's economic reactivation, and legal status for the "3-80 Northern Front" organization. The first direct meeting between the government of Nicaragua and "recontra' chiefs of the 3-80 Northern Front slated to be held today, Monday, was put off for several days after the rebels argued that "there was still strong Army presence in the nation's northern regions." The problem of the rearmed rebels arose in 1990 shortly after President Violeta Chamorro took office as several thousand of the 22,000 former demobilized "contras," not happy with the government, broke the agreement to turn over their weapons and once again took up arms.
