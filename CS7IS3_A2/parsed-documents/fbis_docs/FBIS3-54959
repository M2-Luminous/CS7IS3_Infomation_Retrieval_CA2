It is marking its centennial today. It all began with the "Duks" bicycle. [passage omitted] Later the "Duks" plant became the "Znamya Truda," working exclusively for military aviation during the past decades and achieving unique productivity and quality. However, perestroyka, together with a wrongly understood theory of conversion, almost made the plant lose its aviation specialization. Strange as it may seem, this giant plant was saved by the "Aviatika" light biplane, which is being assembled in the same premises as the awesome MiG-29. [passage omitted] It has to be admitted that the Russian Government has not ordered a single aircraft yet. However, it seems that abroad demand for our aircraft equipment is growing. Although this path has its problems too.
