In the North, the restriction on electricity consumption has been lifted since the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant began operating. In the past, due to a shortage of electricity, households and production establishments were supplied with limited electrical power. Those who used electricity beyond the fixed limit had to pay a higher fee or a progressive rate for the extra units used. From now on, the restriction on the use of electricity and the progressive fee system are totally rescinded throughout the country. The energy sector will strive to meet all the electricity demands of production and business establishments and other consumers.
