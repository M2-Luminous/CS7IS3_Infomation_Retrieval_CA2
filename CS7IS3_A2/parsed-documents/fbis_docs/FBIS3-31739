I am an active military man, I am enjoined by the Constitution not to get involved in politics and I do not even intend to do that. Therefore, this war is waged unilaterally, without an adversary. All I can do is clarify things for the public, through decent means that are specific to the army. The accusations against me are gross inventions." This is a statement made by the minister of national defense, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, and was caused by the "war" being waged against the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor through the pages of ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA. Certainly it is unpleasant that such a stage has been reached. In similar situations, the prime minister of a Western government would have supported or dismissed one of the members of the government that he is heading, depending on whether the respective person had been accused without justification or had been accused on the basis of fact. Mr. Spiroiu chose a dignified way, rejecting point by point all the accusations against him. The Military Prosecuting Magistracy's investigation of the "Kent" affair has established that the renting of the storage rooms that belonged to the Autonomous Public Corporation "Romtechnica" (which is not subordinated to the Ministry of National Defense) was legal, the only violations resulted from customs tax evasion by Lebanese citizen Nassar Elias, who used fake stamps. The military cadres who are guilty of negligence, through which customs evasion could have been committed, have been removed from their positions and turned over to the appropriate legal authorities. The money representing the damage to the Romanian state was recovered entirely and Nassar Elias, after being arrested, paid a substantial penalty. The Lebanese citizen was able to benefit from the respective facilities because he was the brother of the person who represented Romania's best client, covering 95 percent of the "special" trade that any arms producing country practices. The Ministry of National Defense leadership was also accused of reducing the country's combat capability, whereas Romania did nothing except reducing combat technology in accordance with the provisions of the programs established under international treaties approved in the parliament. The minister of defense also denied those accusations regarding the import of tanks from Israel. On the contrary, our country exports tanks, and Romania has not imported anything from Israel except special technology required for the modernization of MIG-21s in Bacau, and it seems that Israel is the country that will purchase the Romanian IAR-109 that is currently being tested. The army's supply of equipment is ensured 74 percent by the national defense industry, which guarantees to fulfill export orders and provide products intended for civilian use. Mr. Spiroiu affirmed that he could not possibly damage the prestige of the army through an argument with Vadim Tudor at various district Tribunals, and therefore, he preferred the action that he has currently chosen. The only effect of Vadim's attacks was that, as was said at the news conference, "nobody in the Military Command reads ROMANIA MARE anymore." Regarding the Partnership for Peace, Mr. Spiroiu said that Romania derives no advantage whatever from being the first to sign the document. There follows now the drafting of the presentation documents (a stage finalized by the Ministry of National Defense) after which, in the second half of this year, the partnership "contract" will be signed. Certainly, the whole nation is concerned about what is currently happening in the former Yugoslavia. Eventually, a NATO intervention seems imminent. In this case, it is well known that international accords provide that, in the event of an intervention of NATO troops in a certain country the neighbors of that country should not become involved. The National Defense Ministry leadership believes that in case of Sarajevo one should take into consideration only political-diplomatic solutions. Romania has signed seven international military accords. As was stated at the news conference, another accord with Spain will be signed in Madrid in March. Mr. Spiroiu said that relations with Russia have continued uninterrupted. An accord with that country was missed twice. Once after the Moscow coup and the second time because of demonstrations in front of the Russian Embassy in Bucharest, where the Russian defense minister was expected. "An accord that is similar to the ones signed with the Netherlands and Spain will soon be concluded also with Russia," Mr.Spiroiu affirmed. The restructuring process and the reform in the army also depend on the speed of implementation of the army law, the law on the status of conscripts, and people employed on a contract basis, as well as of four other specific laws. General Spiroiu claimed that structures similar to NATO will be achieved, that is, highly mobile units that would participate in actions under the aegis of the United Nations and CSCE. Referring to a documentary broadcast on 30 December 1993 [on Marshal Antonescu's execution], the defense minister said that he did not know about it, although he is a government member and the respective documentary was produced by the government studios. As is known, the rehabilitation of General Antonescu provoked a certain reaction from Moses Rosen [chief rabbi of the Jewish Community of Romania], a reaction to which the minister of national defense did not respond because the military historians will do it and they will soon publish four volumes of documents referring to that troubled period in Romania's history. It is worth mentioning that the Romanian Army contributed numerous documents to the Holocaust Museum in New York [city as published].
