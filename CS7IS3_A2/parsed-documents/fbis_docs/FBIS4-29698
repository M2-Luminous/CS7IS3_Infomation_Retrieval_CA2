The existing standards, which were created from the viewpoint of manufacturers and suppliers, will incorporate with the objective of promoting products that are kind to the elderly and environment. The new long-term plan will be completed by the summer of 1995 and will be the focus of "The 8th Industrial Standardization Promotion Project" which will start in fiscal 1996. The Japan Industrial Standards Investigation Committee (JISC) (Kozo Iizuka, acting chairman), which is the JIS consulting organ, soon will set up a special subcommittee for establishment of the new program and begin specific deliberations. The subcommittee will review details of existing standards and how they are defined with an eye toward the arrival of an aging society and a growing awareness of environmental preservation will deliberate on the creation of domestic standards that are consistent with international standards, and compile proposals by next year. Consumer goods such as daily necessities account for about 20 percent of JIS certified products, but many of the existing standards were created for quality control and to reduce costs on the manufacturer's side, and there often has been criticism that they lack consideration for consumer protection. For this reason, the JISC is proceeding withits review of standards by revising JIS definition guidelines to include considerations for the elderlyp.
