This is the second time. The regiment's officers and men separated the opposing sides in summer 1992. Our nonstaff correspondent's conversation with the regiment commander focused on the everyday lives of the peacemaking troops from the Volga Military District. [Gulko] Vladimir Fedorovich, what is the situation like today in the region where your regiment was operating? [Nikishin] Just like last year, the regiment fulfilled its duties in the heightened security zone on both banks of the Dniester River. It served at five posts in accordance with the documents of the joint control commission. On the right bank it served together with peacemakers from Moldavia [Moldova] and at seven posts on the left bank together with people from the Dniester Region. There are also posts in Dubossary, Bendery, and at the Kitskany bridgehead... Our main mission was to perform the functions of military observers, to monitor the movement of combat hardware and troops, and to inspect transport which might possibly be carrying weapons, ammunition, explosives, or drugs. Thanks to strict monitoring the shipment of this entire range of goods through the Dniester Region has virtually ceased. But this does not mean that the peacemakers are no longer needed here. Everything is peaceful in Moldavia today but the Russian soldiers are still the guarantors of stability in the region. The attitude toward our officers and men on the part of local inhabitants on both sides of the Dniester is the very best. And that is true despite the reports filtering into the Moldavian mass media about the urgent need for the withdrawal of the peacemaking forces from the region. [Gulko] The specific conditions of your service have surely had an impact on the combat training process. What are the characteristic features of that training in the Dniester Region? [Nikishin] Exercises were planned and organized according to the program for the training of Russia's peacemaking units. They were held on a daily basis, according to a schedule, and involved all personnel apart from those on actual service. Fire practice took place at the 14th guard's army range, the remaining subjects were studied at our own base at Bendery in an old fortress reminiscent of the Russian Army in Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov's time. Admittedly, the shortage of officers and NCO's at platoon-company level took its toll: We had 10 officer vacancies and 17 NCO vacancies. People were in no hurry to come here, for understandable reasons... Including social reasons. [Gulko] But it has been stated numerous times at various levels that the social and everyday problems facing men serving in the "hot spots" have all but been resolved. There are, after all, laws which provide various privileges... [Nikishin] Those privileges have not been prescribed for us. The peacemaking forces are only covered by the defense minister's order on privileges -- unlike the 14th Army, which enjoys privileges laid down by edict of the Russian Federation President for servicemen serving in the "hot spots." Why is that? Formally speaking we are serving in the Volga Military District. However, we were stationed in the Dniester Region not through choice, but from the state's need, a fact which is not taken into account. Of course, we made our own efforts to obtain privileges for officers and NCO's. For example, we are doing a lot to that end at the winter quarters in Totskoye. Officers, NCO's, and men were sent on regular furloughs. In short, we tried to keep people's spirits up. But all that, of course, is not enough. Now we have been relieved by the regiment under the command of Colonel Aleksandr Grigoryev and I hope that our wishes will be taken into account when it comes to providing backup for its service.
