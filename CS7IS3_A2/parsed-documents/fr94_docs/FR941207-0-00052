FDA will address these devices in a future issue of the Federal Register. FDA received no adverse comments on 148 of the devices that it proposed be exempted from the requirement of premarket notification. For these 148 devices, FDA has concluded that manufacturers' submissions of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of such submissions will not advance its public health mission. Thus, FDA is finalizing the exemptions for these 148 devices from premarket notification procedures. IV. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. V. Analysis of Impacts FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. Because this final rule reduces a regulatory burden by exempting manufacturers of devices subject to the final rule from the requirements of premarket notification, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.
