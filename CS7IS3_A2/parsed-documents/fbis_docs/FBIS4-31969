Command Reorganization The deactivation of the Western and Central Military Commands and their replacement by two corps commands headquartered in Tabor and Olomouc were reported in the 19 April issue of ARMADNI REPORT. Lieutenant General Frantisek Podesva, newly named commander of II Corps, told the military journal that "the purpose of the Army reorganization is creation of a new concept of operational command levels." The general stated that the new corps would assume some of the functions of the old military commands, such as basic training and responsibility for "mobilization-asset acquisition," but that some duties, such as property management, would be assumed by other components. Below the corps level, the Central Military Command Army divisions in the the II Corps area will be converted to three mechanized brigades in mid-July, according to ARMADNI REPORT. Two Western Military Command armored divisions will be reorganized as the I Corps brigades by 1 July, while the transformation of the 20th Mechanized Division into a brigade within the I Corps will be completed in 1995. Upon assuming command of the I Corps, Major General Lubomir Jura stated that the emphasis of reorganization and training efforts will now shift to the company and platoon levels. Jura noted that Army downsizing had so far led to the deactivation of 54 regiment- and division-sized units and the release of 16 bases to civilian uses. Training Area Reduction Army cutbacks have included a consolidation of military training areas. MLADA FRONTA DNES of 19 May indicates that the number of Army training areas has been reduced from eight in 1990 to five currently. The facilities that were terminated were those located at Dobra Voda in Klatovy district, at Ralsko in Ceska Lipa, and at Mlada in the districts of Nymburk and Mlada Boleslav. The largest remaining training areas are now those in Libava and Hradiste. Libava, in the vicinity of Olomouc, is used for practice firing from hand-held weapons, self-propelled artillery, infantry-combat-vehicle guns, tanks, and field artillery. As of 1994, it also includes an aerial target range for fighter and bomber aircraft. The Army also has 12 firing ranges in the Hradiste military training area near Karlovy Vary, better known as Doupov, of which the largest are tank, infantry, and helicopter firing ranges. The 25,000-hectare Boletice training area in southern Bohemia has seven firing ranges, including one for helicopters. Training takes place mainly in artillery and armored-personnel-carrier, tank, and hand-held weapons fire. A similar area at Brdy, near Pribram, serves for artillery and tank training as well as air bombing and strafing. The oldest training area in Brezina in the Vyskov district, established in 1935, is used for practice firing by tanks, infantry combat vehicles, and artillery. It is the smallest of the training areas, comprising 15,000 hectares. MLADA FRONTA DNES notes that civilian populations in the regions surrounding the training areas tend to complain about the disruptive effects of military operations on their daily lives. Rapid Deployment Force The establishment of an elite rapid deployment brigade was described as one of the "key elements" in Army reorganization by a 14 May LIDOVE NOVINY article, which also noted that the brigade "is one of the few development programs the military is able to afford, in view of its tight budget (27 billion korunas [Kc])." According to LIDOVE NOVINY, the rapid deployment brigade should become operational by 1 July of this year, and its formation will cost approximately Kc800 million. The paper quoted the colonel in charge of organizing the new unit as rejecting any "theories" that the professionalization of the Army might fail. He did, however, concede that the substandard physical condition of many recruits and the poor condition of military housing facilities are obstacles to the establishment of an effective professional fighting force. An article in the 19 April military journal A REPORT described a press conference by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys that was almost entirely devoted to the rapid deployment brigade. Baudys said that, like the rest of the military, the new unit faced a shortage of qualified junior officers. "Finding young people for the brigade should be the start of a fundamental change in this respect, but it is a process that will require a number of years," stated the minister. As a result, said Baudys, the rapid deployment brigade will start as a semiprofessional unit to be converted gradually into a fully professional one. He added that new methods of attracting qualified recruits were being tried, such as use of the concept of "extended service time," under which the soldiers would receive a one-time cash payment or "temporary retirement pay upon completion of [their] term of service." PM Wants Further Cuts During a recent visit to II Corps headquarters in Olomouc, where he was briefed on the status of Army modernization and restructuring, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that progress in transforming the military was proceeding at about the same speed as that of the rest of Czech society. The 7 May issue of the Moravian daily ROVNOST quoted him as saying: "After completing most of its reorganization, the Army is now entering the stage of routine buildup and improvement." Klaus added, however, that the Army still needs to "reduce rather than add weight."
