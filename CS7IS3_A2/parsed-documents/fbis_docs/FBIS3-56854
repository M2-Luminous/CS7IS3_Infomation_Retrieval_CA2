Ministries and departments which were not subject to reorganization under a recent Presidential decree function normally. The composition of the heads of these ministries was not reviewed. As for the new appointments, first of all in the upper echelons of executive power, all the candidates have been agreed upon between Victor Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin and the decree on their appointments was signed on January 18, V. Sergeyev noted. He also reported that Victor Chernomyrdin "was very skeptical about the enthusiasm of volunteers who suggested to form a new government or who stand up for the resignation of the present cabinet. There is no need to do it," V. Sergeyev quoted the prime minister as saying, "the government exists, it works and continues the course of reforms." When asked about who was appointed the vice premier V. Sergeyev named the First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov were appointed vice premiers. The decree of the President of the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin on the main appointments will be published on January 20, said V. Sergeyev. Meanwhile Interfax has learned that the decree on the government has not yet reached the presidential office. According to some unofficial reports Boris Fedorov may remain in the position of the finance minister, while Aleksandr Shokhin was appointed the economics minister. Other sources from the entourage of the prime minister V. Chernomyrdin noted in their turn that the issue of B. Fedorov's presence in the reorganized government had not been settled so far.
