Albania's decision to hand over the Gjader air base in the vicinity of Tirana for the siting of radio monitoring equipment and the use of U.S. pilotless surveillance aircraft with an 800-km range are two links in a chain that now has to be explained to the overtrustful Balkan peoples. In itself, the ASSOCIATED PRESS's disclosure of the U.S. spy plane flights over the Balkans would be merely worrying, if other facts were not notable by their absence. The readiness of the Albanian authorities to hand over air bases for combat aircraft in the event it becomes necessary to bomb Serbian positions, doubts about the building of a military base for the U.S. land forces in what was formerly the most up-to-date testing grounds for the Yugoslav People's Army at Krivolak in central Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the additions to the U.S. "blue helmet" contingent, the gradual replacement of Scandinavian troops with U.S. troops,... all these are only some of the steps being made to step up the military activities of the United States in the southern part of the Balkans, now that it is free of Russian influence. Although the forces and hardware that have been concentrated, in the classical sense, in this region have their attention directed mainly toward the events in former Yugoslavia, our criminal insouciance as immediate neighbors may, at a certain stage of development, at the very least turn out to be a bad thing for us. Judge for yourselves. The Democratic Party of [Albanian] President Sali Berisha and Eduard Selami, which sits firmly in the saddle in Tirana, chose the U.S. military presence as a means of settling accounts with Serbia in their dispute over Kosovo. On the other hand, Tirana managed to provide solid financial backing for itself by getting Albania, a country with a varied religious composition, accepted into the Islamic Conference Organization. What is worse is that the troops who have come to monitor the Serbian border are casting their eyes more frequently toward the border with Bulgaria. One also notes that the military hardware that is transiting Bulgaria is suspiciously heavy-weight in nature, and that the white plane that infringed our airspace (in the region of Gyueshevo) last week was certainly not a Macedonian one, and was even less likely to be Serbian or Greek. You may say, what then? With our knowledge and consent or not, the strata in the Balkans have begun to move and the "hunting reserves" are beginning to change hands. In other words, the United States is now a state with a firm footing in the straits, at the surviving Greek bases, in Albania, and in the newly restored Republic of Macedonia. The concluding stage of the realization of this great goal is associated with numerous moves of the most varied kind: Montgomery's readiness to amend our Constitution at a certain juncture; the U.S. patronage of the illegal Ilinden United Macedonian Organization and of Kamen Burov's Pomak Democratic Party; its interest in so-called artificial minorities; the location of the American University nowhere else than in Blagoevgrad; the articles about Bulgaria's territorial claims on Macedonia that have been appearing with surprising consistency; and the formation of a pro- American lobby among our politicians, who, to further their own careers, are ready to turn their backs on and betray their own country's national interests. In the context of all this open and surreptitious activity, AP's allegedly sensational revelations of U.S. spy plane flights over the Balkans only mark the beginning of something far more serious that might shake the states established in our eruption-prone peninsula. If those of our statesmen that still nurture pro-American feelings have not yet realized our geostrategic situation, I advise them to spend an hour or two perusing the map. The Balkans are not yet the [Persian] Gulf, although some people are very keen on them becoming so. One thing, we have no oil, and another, not all of us are yet inclined to become Muslims.
