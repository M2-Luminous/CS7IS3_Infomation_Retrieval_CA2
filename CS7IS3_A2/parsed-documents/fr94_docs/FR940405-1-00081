FR940405-1-00081 FR940405-1-00013 OSHA seeks comment and data on whether dietary intake of nicotine should be considered a significant factor in modelling nicotine metabolism for assessing risk due to ETS exposure. The second issue associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker is the possibility that there is a longer half-life for the elimination of cotinine at very low biological concentrations, associated with the slow release of nicotine from binding sites [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167, 4&hyph;254]. This longer half-life at very low concentrations could have the effect of overestimating exposure to ETS in the lowest exposed population. At this time there is not sufficient evidence to quantify the potential magnitude of this effect, but it is likely to be small. OSHA seeks comment on this issue. 5. Description of Pharmacokinetic Models for Nicotine and Cotinine For many purposes, an essentially first order process such as the kinetics of cotinine can be effectively modeled with a simple compartmental kinetic analysis [Exs. 4&hyph;27, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82]. The compartmental approach has been used to relate steady-state urinary cotinine levels to atmospheric nicotine concentrations [Ex. 4&hyph;263]. For investigating some of the concerns associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker, however, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) description would be preferred. The advantage of the PBPK approach stems from its biologically motivated structure, which permits the direct incorporation of biochemical data and the biologically constrained comparison of model predictions with experimental timecourses to investigate such issues as dose-rate effects, exposure-route differences, pharmacodynamic processes, and other potential nonlinearities [Ex. 4&hyph;57]. PBPK models of nicotine and cotinine have been described for both rats [Exs. 4&hyph;112, 4&hyph;255] and humans [Exs. 4&hyph;254, 4&hyph;270]. A physiological model of cotinine disposition [Ex. 4&hyph;112] was developed to analyze intravenous infusion of nicotine and cotinine and bolus dosing of cotinine in rats. In general, the observed cotinine time profiles in blood and tissues were consistent with linear kinetics, but the distribution of cotinine into all tissues appeared to be roughly three-fold greater following infusion of nicotine than following infusion of cotinine, and the clearance of cotinine following bolus and infusion dosing was significantly different. A more recent rat model [Ex. 255] featured a physiologically based description of nicotine kinetics and a compartmental description of cotinine. This model provided a successful description of the plasma kinetics of both nicotine and cotinine for intraarterial or intravenous bolus dosing of nicotine. The timecourse of nicotine in most tissues was also consistent with first order kinetics; however, it was necessary to include a description of saturable nicotine binding in the brain, heart, and lung to adequately reproduce nicotine concentration profiles in these tissues. This rat model has also been scaled for use in predicting mouse and human pharmacokinetics [Ex. 4&hyph;254]. The human model has recently been expanded to include a physiological description of cotinine as well as a forearm compartment, and is now able to describe nicotine and cotinine kinetics following intravenous infusion of nicotine in humans [Ex. 4&hyph;266]. Another human model [Ex. 4&hyph;270] has also been developed which includes physiological descriptions of both nicotine and cotinine. This model, which assumes linear kinetics, predicts results which agree with published data on the kinetics of nicotine and cotinine in blood following nicotine infusion as well as cotinine in the blood following the infusion of cotinine. 6. Application of Pharmacokinetic Modeling for ETS Exposure Estimation Both of the human models described above possess a reasonable biologically based structure, and either model would provide a useful starting point for the development of a PBPK model which could be of use in examining the relationship between cotinine concentrations in body fluids and inhaled nicotine. However, neither of the models currently possesses all of the features which would be necessary for such an analysis. The most useful application of PBPK modeling would appear to be to support an analysis of four issues related to the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure: (1) Estimation of the contribution of dietary intake of nicotine to cotinine levels in the plasma, saliva and urine of nonsmokers; (2) Estimation of a plausible upper bound for cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva and urine associated with ETS exposure (to identify individuals wrongfully identifying themselves as nonsmokers). This can be viewed as a way to validate misclassification results derived from surveys; (3) Evaluation of the potential impact of high affinity, low capacity binding of nicotine and cotinine in nonsmokers with low exposure to ETS; and (4) Evaluation of the potential impact of pharmacokinetic uncertainty and variability on the use of cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva or urine to infer an individual's ETS exposure. The necessary features for accomplishing these analyses include both inhalation and oral routes of nicotine exposure, a salivary compartment, and a description of nicotine binding in the brain, heart and lung. In evaluating the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure, two kinds of uncertainty must be considered. The first kind of uncertainty embraces those factors which could tend to bias a risk estimate. Two such factors are dietary intake of nicotine and nicotine binding. In both of these cases, the impact of ignoring the effect, if it were significant, would be to overestimate exposure (and therefore risk) for the least exposed individuals. The second kind of uncertainty includes those factors which tend to broaden the confidence interval for the risk estimate. The most significant factors in this category are uncertainty in the fraction of nicotine converted to free cotinine, and the rates of metabolic and urinary clearance of nicotine and cotinine. An example of such uncertainty is results reported for half-lives of cotinine in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186], showing a mean of 16.2 hours, with a coefficient of variation of 0.22. 7. Analysis of Uncertainty It is useful in this evaluation to distinguish uncertainty from variability. As it relates to the issue of using pharmacokinetic modeling in risk assessment, uncertainty can be defined as the possible error in estimating the ``true'' value of a parameter for a representative (``average'') individual. Variability, on the other hand, represents differences from individual to individual. For the purpose of evaluating the usefulness of pharmacokinetic modeling for estimating exposure, the uncertainty and variability in the various parameters for the pharmacokinetic models can be grouped into four classes: the physiological parameters (volumes and flows), the tissue distribution parameters (partitioning and binding), and the kinetic parameters (absorption, metabolism, and clearance).
