The GNP growth rate for 1994 has been set at 9 percent (industry will be 15 percent and agriculture 3 percent). Deng Again Urges Seizing Opportunities and Developing the Economy Recently, Deng Xiaoping said to CPC leaders: The document adopted by the 14th CPC Central Committee at its Third Plenary Session is pretty good. It has novelty. What counts is to see how many solid things will be done next year (1994) in accordance with this line of thinking to lay a solid foundation for greater development in the last years of this century. As I see it, in the coming year, we must still seize opportunities and accelerate reform and development, naturally, with efficiency. Reform is aimed at solving this problem. The current international and domestic situation is to our advantage. Without too much trouble facing us, now is precisely a good opportunity for us to concentrate our energy on developing the economy. Your tasks in the coming year are not easy. While we old people are still around and can still make suggestions on certain issues and offer help if some big problems occur, you (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and others) must boldly do your work and not be afraid of dangers. Overall, in 1992 and 1993, we did pretty well, witnessed economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress, and achieved great successes. We must continue to work hard in the coming year. We are happy and so are the people throughout the country.... These remarks of "great encouragement" from Deng Xiaoping served as a stimulus to the CPC's top leadership in working out a plan for work in 1994. However, what merits attention is that, although in 1994 the CPC will take bigger moves and more measures than in any previous years to carry forward economic structural reform, this has not evoked any great enthusiastic response among the common people on the mainland. On the contrary, quite a considerable number of people are indifferent. Answers and statistics acquired from the questionnaire-based sample survey on "the attitude of the common people across the country toward supporting reform," which was recently conducted by some mainland sociologists, shows that the common people's sense of participation in reform is far below that of the early 1980's. People have expressed strong dissatisfaction over such problems as "unfairness in distribution," "the widening of the gap between rich and poor," "corruption among officials," "poor social order and practices," "the wild spread of political preaching," and "attempting and accomplishing nothing in political structural reform." The sociologists maintained: The CPC's decisionmaking body has landed in an error zone: The mainland's socialist system is thought to be good in all aspects other than weakness in economic strength. The sociologists pointed out: If the CPC top leadership does not get out of this zone, while carrying out the overall plan for economic structural reform on a large scale, they will find it difficult to handle social contradictions and crises using other means once the plan suffers setbacks. What is worrying is that while the mainland is preparing to energetically implement the economic reform plan in 1994 and is inadequately prepared in terms of public opinion and ideology, "commemorative" activities were conducted on a large scale by capitalizing on the "birth centenary of Mao Zedong" and activities were sponsored to show "100 films on education in patriotism and revolution" in an attempt to restore and reestablish the ethical standards and norms of traditional socialism and win popular support by means of uncritical, non-analytical, and blind eulogies and glorification. If this situation continues, this is bound to present a serious psychological and mental hindrance to economic reform. [passage omitted]
