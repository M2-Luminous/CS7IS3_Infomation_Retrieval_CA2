Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj believes that the twin republic could be one of the principal beneficiaries. Caricom heads are expected to sign the agreement when they meet in Barbados in July. Minister Maraj says that while NAFTA will also be high on the agenda, efforts to bring about a Caricom single market must continue at least for now. Nicole Huggins tells us more: [Begin recording] [Huggins] The trade agreement between Caricom and Colombia will allow some Caricom producers duty-free access to the Colombian market and a fees reduction of up to 33 and a third percent of duty on other goods. Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj says this is similar to the agreement which already exists between Caricom and Venezuela. [Maraj] It is an improved agreement, even though you have reciprocity, and I think that view is shared by the experts in the field as well as the businessmen who will now be seeking to take advantage of this agreement. [Huggins] After four years, Caricom countries would be required to provide reciprocal access to Colombian products. Caricom heads are expected to sign the agreement when they meet in Barbados in July. Also on the heads of government's agenda are studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement and its possible impact on Caricom countries. Although countries such as Trinidad and Tobago have already applied for individual entry into NAFTA, Minister Maraj insists it is not too late for a regional approach. [Maraj] I think there was a wisdom in the effects of [passage indistinct], and I think that that is now commonly accepted, and I feel that as you say, we will have an even more, well a more certain and [word indistinct] approach to the whole matter. We also need to get more information as we engage in the negotiating process, which is to come at a later point in time. And once we have that information, it will strengthen our position to do justice to ourselves. [Huggins] The heads will also continue work on a common Caricom currency, an integral part of the proposed single market. Given the uncertainty of NAFTA, Minister Maraj says this subregional effort must continue. [end recording]
