At the end of a 30-minute tour of the center, Ouchi said he had told the Diet there is no cause for concern over chemical residue in imported rice, and that his own tour of the center had satisfied him that he had seen "an internationally high standard of surveillance." Ouchi said he was relieved to be told at the center that staff have "not yet found anything dangerous" in the rice they have inspected. Ouchi also said he is grateful to staff at the center for working weekends to clear a backlog of imported rice.
