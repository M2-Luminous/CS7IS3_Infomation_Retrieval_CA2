[passage omitted] Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, has said she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft, as certain versions have reported. She added there was no attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their weapons on the car, damaging it badly. According to another version, unidentified gunmen were following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior minister. [passage omitted on funeral]
