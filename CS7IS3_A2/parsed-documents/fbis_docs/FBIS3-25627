According to these results, the opposition officially won 38 seats as against 37 for President Eyadema's supporters and one for Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. According to CEN Chairman Sipohon Gaba, it is now up to the Supreme Court to deliberate on the case of five constituencies where incidents disrupted the votes. It should be recalled that the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the former single ruling party led by President Eyadema, accused the opposition of being at the origin of the incidents that marred the votes in several polling stations and of "organizing fraud to such an extent that it was impossible to validate the results of the contested constituencies." The opposition has rejected all the accusations leveled against it and affirmed that "the RPT should accept defeat instead of confusing people." One of the opposition activists who is also member of the CEN, Mr. Ali Diabate, affirmed that the opposition had definitely won in the five constituencies contested by the RPT. He warned that "if the government does not proclaim the full results, the four opposition members belonging to the CEN will resign." The Supreme Court, to which all the results and various reports were submitted on 23 February, has about 10 days to deliberate on all the contested cases before proclaiming the final results. For their part, foreign observers believe that despite the regrettable incidents that took place on 20 February, "the second round of the legislative elections took place in satisfactory conditions."
