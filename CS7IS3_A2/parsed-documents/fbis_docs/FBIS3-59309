I believe that in order to realize this goal, we should institute as quickly as possible associated tax, fiscal, and financial system, as well as conduct investment control system reform to provide a basic framework for the attainment within three to five years of a national macroeconomic regulation and control system in the socialist market economy. At the same time, we should actively promote reform of the state-owned assets control system to lay the foundation for a new equity rights system in which public ownership is paramount in the operation of the market economy. 1. Intensification of taxation, fiscal, finance and banking and investment control system reform and moving ahead with state-owned assets control system reform is urgently required for the building of a socialist market economy to solve deep-seated problems in development of the nation's economy. Since 1992, China's reform, opening to the outside world, and modernization have entered a new era. The overall reform and development situation is good, but some deep-seated contradictions and problems remain in the operation of the economy. One is that an effective macroeconomic regulation and control system and microeconomic restraint systems have yet to be built; thus, a new round of high growth of total social demand is in the offing. Second, demand inflation and structural imbalances exist at the same time. Improvements to the product mix, the industrial structure, and the irrational enterprise organizational structure have not been great. Structural inconsistences further complicate overall balance. Third, despite the rapid economic growth, overall economic returns remain not very high. State-owned enterprises' losses continue high, and a serious problem exists with enterprises delaying payment of their obligations. Fourth, the fiscal and financial situations are grim; thus, the central government macroeconomic regulation and control capabilities are extremely weak. On the one hand, the trend is toward an increase in the central government fiscal deficit, the government being able to obligate only approximately 38 billion yuan each year for the capital construction of key projects. Government is unable to change the seriously backward state of basic sectors. On the other hand, structural readjustment pressures are transferred to the banks. This intensifies the trend toward greater government underwriting of credit. Central bank difficulties in controlling the main throttle valve of total money supply adds to inflationary pressures. The current economic situation suggests that inflation has begun to appear. Naturally emergency actions will have to be taken at once to deal with it in order to prevent a deterioration of the economic situation. However, grim realities indicate that given the existing institutions, the effect of the actions we are able to take will be limited. Thus the root causes of large scale economic ups and downs will remain. During the near term, a basic action is to accelerate macroeconomic system and enterprise system reforms, readjusting the benefits stimulation mechanisms in enterprises, and governments at all levels, improving risk limitation mechanisms, and provide the policy tools needed for indirect macroeconomic regulation and control for the building of macroeconomic system that realizes policy goals. The existing macroeconomic system suggests the main reasons for the foregoing inconsistencies and problems to be as follows: The problems with the tax system are manifested mostly in a narrow tax base, too great a dependence on processing industries, and inability to respond to sources of revenue, all of which make for unstable fiscal revenues. Second, taxation plays too great a role in the readjustment of the industrial structure and enterprises under different ownership systems. Tax policies have too great a bias; thus, the various taxable items and tax rates are too complex and the tax burdens are not equal. Third, the overly biased revenue policies not only render the attainment of policy goals difficult, but they damage the unity and the coherence of the tax system, thereby opening many loopholes for tax evasion and tax cheating, which increases tax collection and administration difficulties. Neither the existing "fiscal contracting" nor the impending fiscal system of "contracting tax sharing" provide an institutional basis for regularizing financial distributions between the central government and local governments. First of all, the division of fiscal revenues is still according to administrative subordination, which is detrimental to the separation of government administration and enterprise management. Second, an overly large percentage of turnover taxes, which have a substantial impact on the economic structure, go to local jurisdictions. This results in redundant construction and vying among jurisdictions for high speed growth, which intensifies economic fluctuations and regional separation. In addition, the haggling and the strict guaranteeing of base figures associated with fiscal contracting produce a regressive mechanism in central government fiscal revenues in which the central government lacks financial strength, and the ability of the central government to apply fiscal measuresto adjust the structure becomes weaker and weaker. Finally, as the economy grows, growth of fiscal revenues slows. During the "real estate craze" of 1992, enterprise profits increased, and industrial growth reached 20 percent, but land-use revenues and income tax revenues declined for the period January through October, while product taxes increased only 5.2 percent. Moreover, the overly rapid increase in fiscal expenditures causes a widening of fiscal policies. Fiscal revenues that are lower than production increase has become a serious problem in 1993. During the first quarter of the year, fiscal revenue growth amounted to only one-half the increase in GDP, and only one-third the increase in industrial production. The functions of the finance and banking system are ill defined and lacking in vitality. First, the central bank carries too heavy a responsibility for readjusting the economic structure. Some of its expanded administrative tasks frequently conflict with its goal of controlling total demand. Second is too great reliance on administrative fiat to regulate and control the money supply, and the central bank's lack of policy tools for indirect regulation and control of money makes effective and flexible readjustment of total demand difficult. Third, the operating mechanism of the specialized banks have a strong administrative coloration. They lack vitality, and they have numerous accounts pending, unpaid debts, and bad debts. The quality of their assets has declined further. Therefore, whenever total demand inflates excessively, both effective monetary policy tools and a finance and banking system that can attain monetary policy goals are missing. These banks continue to have no choice but to rely on administrative fiat and command style methods to control total demand. The result is they can neither control money outside plan nor can they prevent damage to key construction projects covered by state plan. The planning system has yet to break free from controls on microeconomic activity. Static control methods for achieving equilibrium in planning are still adopted, a substantial amount of effort going into the setting of norms, the apportionment of investment, project approvals, and sharing foreign exchange. Ability to integrate macroeconomic policy methods in a comprehensive way is weak. Investment decision-making authority is still too greatly centralized in government departments at all levels. Control methods continue to be mostly administrative fiat, control of scale, and project examination and approval. The most conspicuous problem is that investment project decision making, fund raising, construction, production, and operation, as well as debt repayment, are divorced from each other. A mechanism is lacking for spelling out responsibilities and for limiting risks. This leads to ill-advised investment, redundant construction, and low returns that causes serious waste. With the further deregulation of prices, operation of the economy -- particularly the degree to which enterprises' operating activities will be oriented toward the market -- will accelerate greatly. Failure of macroeconomic system reform to keep up will mean that frictions between the existing control system and enterprises or markets will become worse and worse. This will directly impair sustained and steady national economic growth. Therefore, further intensification of macroeconomic regulation and control system reform has become an urgent necessity in the building of a market economy and in ensuring the nation's steady, high speed economic growth. Delay in reforming the state-owned enterprise equity system is one of the basic reasons for the various economic problems mentioned above. So long as state-owned enterprise equity rights are unclear, there is no separation of government administration and enterprise management, and the limits of authority are not spelled out, formation of genuine market entities will be difficult. Enterprises cannot be expected to react fully to macroeconomic regulation and control signals. Only enterprises whose equity rights are clear, who make their own operating decisions, and who are responsible for their own profits and losses can be the nucleus for a market economy. However, effort to reform enterprises' operating mechanisms entirely from the microeconomic angle cannot fundamentally change this situation. Thus, reform of the state-owned assets control system is needed, rebuilding the state-owned enterprise equity rights system by transforming the state-owned enterprise equity structure. 2. The Basic Pattern of the New System of State Macroeconomic Regulation and Control, and the Goals of System Reform We have the following tentative ideas about the goals, basic functions, division of labor among various sectors, and the goals of system reform that take into account both the requirements for a market economy and the state of China's economic development. A) Main Goals of State Macroeconomic Regulation and Control: The main goals of state macroeconomic regulation and control are to regulate total demand, and to ensure economic stability and growth, as well as to balance international receipts and expenditures; to remedy shortcomings of the market mechanism so as to be able to provide public products and services to society, regulate income distribution, ensure social equality, and promote balanced regional development; and to adopt appropriate industrial policies in order to advance structural improvements and increase total supply capabilities. B) Basic Pattern of the Functional Division of Labor of Main Macroeconomic Policies. Regulation and control of total supply is achieved mostly through monetary policy, and through appropriate readjustment of the economic structure and fiscal methods. Industrial policies are largely functional policies. Too wide ranging tilt policies are not used since the goal is to promote change and upgrading of the economic structure. The tax system is gradually moving in a neutral direction. This basic pattern has the following several components: First, the main functions of the taxation system are to provide the government with a steady revenue base and to create a fair environment for market competition. Taxation policy mostly regulates the distribution of income. Taxation policy is gradually changing awaya from the use of preferential taxation policies to allocate resources; ultimately, taxation will become neutral. Thus, for a fairly long time to come, indirect taxes -- mostly added value taxes -- will predominate. Land taxes and resources taxes should also hold an important position. Enterprise income taxes will decline as a percentage of all taxes, and the position of the individual income tax will gradually rise, ultimately becoming one of the main kinds of taxation. A transition will be made gradually from mostly indirect taxation to direct taxation. In order to ensure a broad tax base and steady revenues, a fairly high percentage of indirect taxation, such as added value taxes, is currently necessary. However, added value taxes are taxes levied on key element income. They differ fundamentally from turnover taxes such as product taxes. The added value tax can ensure steady revenues from a wide range of sources while avoiding the double taxation of the turnover tax and the structural distortions. Second, The main function of the fiscal system is to use the redistribution of fiscal revenues and the use of government funds to promote balanced regional development; to provide public infrastructure and social services to sustain long-term, steady, and balanced economic growth; and to use fiscal policy to regulate the level of total demand. Exercising this function requires institution of a standard tax distribution system that spells out the powers and fiscal authorities of the central and local governments so as to ensure the active interest of both parties. When organizing fiscal revenues, the central government must have the lion's share, this apportionment serving as the foundation for building a system whereby the central government transfers payments of fiscal revenues to local government, thereby increasing the central government's regulation and control capabilities. Performance of this function requires the building of a new long-term financing system for policy purposes that relies on the state's credit to attract funds to be used over a long period, the state paying compensation for their use, these funds being used for the building of infrastructure and basic industries requiring a long period for recovery of capital. This forms a new fiscal system that is fairly able to normalize relations between the central government and local government, that fairly equitably balances fiscal capabilities between one region and another, and that effectively adjusts the economic structure. Third, The central bank is a key player in the finance and banking system. The central bank's monetary policies are important means of macroeconomic regulation and control. Monetary policies are basically restraining policies who goal is to stabilize the currency as a precondition for ensuring total supply capabilities. The central bank must exercise supervision and control over banking and safeguard the financial order; however, it must not interfere in the business of the specialized banks, much less, may it directly perform the business of the specialized banks. The central bank may no longer use the granting of credit for policy reasons for direct readjustment of the economic structure. Its functions require the building of a highly skilled and highly efficient central banking system, development of nationwide and regional commercial banks, and the establishment of special banks that function to meet policy needs. Fourth, the main function of the planning system is the study of long-term strategy, the drawing up of long-term plans and industrial policies, and making economic development forecasts and providing overall balance. Doing this requires a new concept of planning, improvement of planning methods, and a change in the work focus of planning units. Fifth, The almost complete deregulation of prices has given rise to a price formation mechanism in which the market decides prices for the most part. The state's pricing policy consists of mostly the following: support prices for basic agricultural products, and regulate and control prices in sectors where a natural monopoly exists, the overall price level and industrial monopolies regulated and controlled through overall demand policies and monopoly regulation measures. 3. Basic Tasks in Reform of the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control System, and Steps To Be Taken for Their Implementation. A) Tasks in Tax System Reform and Steps To Be Taken for Their Implementation (1) Need to build a new tax system that has a broad tax base, in which tax burdens are fair, and in which collection and administration are efficient. Establishment of a new tax system requires readjustment of the current turnover tax structure, changing the current turnover tax system of one tax for domestically owned and another for foreign owned enterprises, and regularizing the turnover tax system. It also requires changing the separate enterprise income tax that is based on whether an enterprise is Chinese for foreign owned, and separate income taxes for Chinese citizens and foreign citizens, establishing a uniform enterprise income tax and individual income tax. The land tax and the resources tax should be broadened; tax burdens should be made more equitable; preferential tax policies should be revamped; and ways to collect a uniform social security tax should be studied. Accomplishing the above tasks will require a new tax structure that not only provides a broad tax base, ensures steady revenues, and causes little damage to industries, but also provides considerable choices of taxes to divide up between the central government and local governments in the regularization of the tax sharing system. In addition, a standard added value tax, and a uniform income tax provide conditions for effective collection and administration of tax revenues. Once the new tax system is in place, every effort must be made to make fiscal revenues a greater percentage of national income than they currently are. (2) Carry out tax reform and price reform more or less in tandem. Simultaneous with regularization of the added value tax should be corresponding readjustments of the range of products covered by the product tax. Since raising prices or decontrolling prices of basic products results at once in either overly low or overly high product taxation rates for basic sector processing industries, readjustment of the product tax becomes an urgent task of primary importance. The tax on a small number of luxury goods should be retained, and redesignated an excise tax. A one or two tier tax rate added value tax should replace the tax on other products. Uniform tax rates should be promoted across the board, calculation and collection of the added value tax should be regularized, and uniform receipts that show the tax paid or deducted should be used. These methods should be used to establish a new pattern of indirect taxes as a substantial percentage of all taxes to ensure steady fiscal revenues. At the same time, in the handling of distributions between the state and state-owned enterprises, taxes and profits should be separated, indebtedness repaid after taxes, and profits distributed after taxes, in addition to which the summarization of experiences should be used as a basis for perfecting debt repayment and profit sharing methods. Uniform fiscal accounting standards should form a basis for merging the Chinese owned and foreign owned enterprise income tax to bring tax rates into line in fact as well as in name, and the Chinese and foreign personal income tax should be made uniform as well. Reform of the land tax and the resources tax, broadening the application of the land and resources tax to regulate differential revenues from primary products following price decontrol. In view of the current development of the real estate sector and development zones, land taxes should be reformed at once. Taxes should be levied on land sales, land use, land trading, and land appreciation to increase fiscal revenues and ensure equitable distribution of social resources. - - Re-examination of tariffs, integrating this task into domestic tax system reform and with requirements for entering GATT for timely readjustment and reform of tariffs. Nominal tariff rates should be reduced gradually, all item reductions and exemptions controlled, the current very low actual tariff rates and the overly high nominal tariff rates fundamentally changed. Currently, China's nominal tariff rate averages 22.5 percent, but because of various reductions and exemptions, the actual import tariff rate averages only about 10 percent. This is lower than the average 14 percent rate of developing countries. - Separation of national tax collection agencies and local tax collection agencies. First of all, for the sake of centralization and efficiency, everything possible should be done to centralize in the central government all tax legislation that is under national government control, then turn over to local government for collection the kinds of taxes that local government can collect more efficiently, local taxation then being expanded somewhat. Local government should be given some right to legislate local taxes. Central government and local government tax collection agencies should be set up to keep strict control over tax reductions and exemptions. Turnover tax contracting or contracting in a disguised form must be resolutely halted. B) Tasks and Steps To Be Taken in Reform of the Fiscal System (1) Standardizing the tax sharing system, building a system for revenue transfer payments, and building a system for long-term financing of projects of a policy nature are basic tasks in system reform. Standardization of the tax sharing system requires clarification of government functions at all levels, authority defined on the basis of function, and payments made on the basis of authority. The general principle for defining authority is that each level of government will not meddle in the operation of enterprises. In the division of powers between the central government and local government, the central government is to be responsible for ensuring stability of the social order, and ensuring uniformity in markets throughout the land. It is additionally responsible for important economic structural tasks such as the building of a national infrastructure that cuts across regional lines, and for readjustments in the regional and industrial sectors. Local governments are responsible for matters directly related to local social and economic development, principal of which are social services including basic local facilities, environmental clean ups and scientific, educational, cultural, and health matters, local revenue distribution, and social insurance policies, as well as promotion of the development of commercial and other tertiary industries, and improvement of the investment climate. Standardization of the tax sharing system also requires determination of central government and local government revenues. In the organization of revenues, the central government must have the lion's share. In defining the kinds of revenues that go to the central government and local governments, the current contract system for sharing revenues must be changed. In the division of income taxes, the division of revenues on the basis of the administrative subordination of enterprises must be demolished, and turnover taxes cannot be invariably shared jointly by the central government and local governments. The pooling of taxes must be reduced or eliminated. Definition of the expenditures and revenues of government at all levels should form the basis for the central government's concentration of some revenues for use in balancing local governments' fiscal capabilities. A system should be set up whereby the central government makes transfer payments of fiscal revenues to local jurisdictions, i.e., the central government concentrates appropriate amounts of fiscal revenues for the subsidization of different areas according to set standards (such as population, nature of the terrain, and per capita GNP). Building of a new long-term financing system for policy purposes. The basic function of long term financing for policy purposes is to enhance the building of infrastructure, making up for the shortage of budgeted funds. The main sources of financing for policy purpose are funds for which compensation is paid such as postal savings, retirement funds, and government bonds. Central government treasury offsetting of financing costs provides assurance that improves financing conditions. The main fields of financing activity are basic public facilities, basic industries, and long-term export credits that take a long time to recoup capital, produce low profits, and pose high risks. Public projects from which it is impossible to recoup investment through profits are paid for by fiscal budget gratis investment. The government financial sector may no longer meddle directly in the financial activities of state-owned enterprises. Financial accounting systems that closely meet international standards have been promulgated, and the role of independent accountants is becoming stronger; therefore, fiscal department agencies responsible for running state-owned enterprises' fiscal affairs should be abolished, and the functions of fiscal, tax, and state assets administration units should be straightened out. (2) Fiscal system reform measures should be coordinated with price and tax reforms, reform of the revenue sharing system conducted step by step. - Concomittant with price and taxation reform, subsidization of losses incurred for policy reasons should be phased out. - Reform of the standardized tax sharing system should be done in two steps. In view of the difficulty of defining power and establishing a transfer payments system, receipts should be handled before expenditures. As a first step, fiscal expenditure base figures at all levels should be frozen, reform conducted in step with reform of indirect taxation and the income tax, and the relationships between the central government and local governments on revenues changed first. Inasmuch as different kinds of taxes have different effects on the economic structure and fiscal revenues, and bearing in mind collection and administration capabilities, the following tax sharing pattern should be established for several main forms of taxation: Excise taxes, added value taxes, tariffs, and major resources taxes to revert to the central government; business taxes, real estate taxes, and social security taxes (or program evaluation and review funds) to revert to local governments. Once the income tax has been regularized, revenues from it may be jointly shared or revert to local governments. Local government shortfalls between receipts and expenditures should be subsidized out of the central government treasury. In addition, reforms for the separation of tax collection agencies should be carried out to set up two separate tax collection and administration systems. Second is the setting of expenditure base figures and the make-up of expenditures on the basis of power, simultaneously setting up a regularized system by which the central government can make transfer payments to local governments, the central government using this system to equalize the financial resources of different jurisdictions and to subsidize backward areas. - Simultaneous with reform of the tax sharing system should be improvement of the redundant fiscal budgeting system. Applicable functions of fiscal units and planning units should be readjusted or merged for the formation of long-term fiscal financing plans. Policy purposes banks such as import-export banks and development banks should be established as institutions for long-term financing for policy reasons. C) Financial System Reform Tasks and Steps for Carrying Them Out (1) Perfection of the central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism, setting up a highly skilled, highly effective central banking system with primary level branches in the major administrative regions. The central banks should apply indirect regulation and control methods to control currency and regulation and control total demand. - The central bank should gradually replace control of the money supply with control of total credit, changing its primary reliance on limited direct credit for gradual implementation of indirect macroeconomic regulation and control. This means using its own funds, buying up or selling off government bonds, changing rediscount rates, and adjusting interest rates to control basic money, thereby attaining the goal of control total money supply. - Readjustment of the People's Bank organizational structure, eliminating branches and sub-branches below the primary branch level, and setting up one or more national commercial banks and regional banks. The business of transporting currency and the clearing business should be handled by commercial companies. - Cutbacks on the range of central bank activities, turning over matters done for policy reasons to banks set up for that purpose. The People's Bank should no longer handle special loans, nor should it finance nonbanking financial institutions. The central bank should actively promote open market business, gradually increasing the percentage of government bonds among the central bank's assets. Simultaneous with the government's halting of overdrafts on the central bank and the establishment of banks that function for policy purposes, postal savings may be used as a source of funds for long-term financing for policy reasons. (2) Establishment of banks to meet policy needs and the development of commercial banks. Vigorous reduction of loans granted for policy reasons, establishment of banks to meet policy needs, and making loans granted for policy reasons a part of the system for long-term policy-related financing. - - Separation of specialized banks' policy purposes business from its regular business, determining the organizational structure for specialized banks, and reforming their financial systems and labor wage systems to make them real commercial banks. - Exercising control over the ratio between assets and liabilities of commercial banks, as well as controlling assets risks and liquidity, encouraging commercial banks to engage in competition, using competition to impel the banks to improve their services. (3) The basic tasks in foreign exchange system reform are to make the renminbi freely convertible within certain limits for ordinary international current account receipts and expenditures (including the repatriation of profits from direct investment in foreign trade, posts and telecommunications, communications, and transportation); and to reduce administrative interference in the use of foreign exchange. - First is a change in the way in which the central government uses foreign exchange. Except for foreign exchange needed for special purposes such as national defense and foreign exchange, which the state supplies at the posted price, all foreign exchange to be supplied at the negotiated price. - Acceleration of exchange rate reform, merging different exchange rates into a single one and developing foreign exchange markets. This should be followed by foreign exchange retention, exchange rates being allowed to fluctuate, thereby making the renminbi freely convertible within certain limits for current accounts. (4) Separation of the banking and the securities business, independently supervising and controlling the securities business. A) Basic Tasks in Reform of the Investment System and Steps for Carrying Them Out (1) Setting up an investment system having different categories of control. Construction projects may be divided into three general categories on the basis of the field of investment, recovery of investment, and the profits to be made. First, enterprises and banks should have broader decision making authority about investment in competitive industrial sectors and in the tertiary industries field, a "declaration system" ultimately replacing the "examination and approval system." The government should no longer interfere in investment activity. Second, governments at all levels should continue to include in their fiscal budgets money for investment in public services and facilities of a nonproductive nature such as the building of schools, hospitals, and cultural facilities. Government authorities in charge should continue to exercise direct control over such investment. Third, the government should provide policy-related credit for infrastructure and for investment in basic industries and the sophisticated technology sector, as well as for regional development. Such investment credit, which has a bearing on the economy of the whole country, should be made a part of the nation's policy-related long-term financing system. Banks that have been set up to meet policy needs should exercise control in accordance with state regional development plans and industrial policy. (2) Bearing in mind existing conditions and possibilities, energies should be concentrated, first of all, on reforming the state policy-related long-term investment credit system. Investment in the first category cited above [i.e., in industry and tertiary industries] accounts for more than three-fourths of all investment; however, rationalizing this investment activity will ultimately require changing enterprise equity rights, building a standardized taxation system, and perfecting the finance and banking system. Prominent problems existing today in state construction and development investment that the central government regulates and controls directly, and in the credit field are mainly the following: Lack of investment responsibility and a mechanism for limiting risk; a shortage of funds, the central government having insufficient ability to regulate; a problem-plagued fund raising, fund use, and fund administration system; and the central bank and the specialized banks getting into policy-related credit, which injures monetary policy, lowers the efficiency of the specialized banks, and gets in the way of finance and banking system reform. Unlike first category investment activities, state directly regulated and controlled capital construction cannot automatically improve as reforms in other fields intensify. Thus, it is both necessary and possible to begin at once to reform state long-term policy-related credit and the credit system so as to solve current extremely serious structural problems, and to set the stage for reforms in other fields. (3) Basic tasks in reforming the state-policy-related long-term investment credit system - Beginning to build an investment decision making and risk limiting mechanism that links rights and responsibilities, completely changing the present operating mechanism in which rights and responsibilities are separate and government administrative agencies directly interfere excessively in investment. Establishment of a development bank. The basic function of a development bank is to issue medium- and long-term credit for investment in infrastructure, basic industries, newly emerging leading industries, and regional development, using state long- term economic development plans and industrial policy as a guide. A development bank provides preferential interest rates for projects producing a marked public benefit for which the investment recovery period is long and economic benefits low. Development bank funds may not be invested in equity shares. %Widening of sources of policy-related long-term credit funds, soaking up idle capital in society to improve the central government's ability to guide investment activity and readjust the investment structure. %The main source of development bank funds is the issuance of bonds. The treasury should arrange construction fund purchases of long-term low interest or interest-free debentures. The state should direct that postal savings and social security fund surpluses, and insurance company surpluses must be used to purchase regular interest rate development bank finance bonds. The state should also adopt policies to encourage financial institutions and individual to purchase development bank bonds, financial institutions being able to use the development bank bonds they hold as collateral for People's Bank loans. Guided by state macroeconomic plans and controls on the scale of credit, the development bank should set up a credit project evaluation and examination system, a control system, and operating procedures that link control over the ratio between assets and liabilities and control over assets risks. A) Attendant Reform of Planning Work The task in planning is comprehensive balance and the formulation of industrial policies. Reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control system poses a need for a high order of comprehensive balance in planning work, and the ingredients of industrial policy should also be changed. Once the pricing system, the taxation system, and the fiscal system have taken care of the market signals problem and the distortions of benefit relationships, there will be no further need for excessively biased industrial policies. Nor will frequent artificial tinkering with the various market parameters be needed. The main ingredient in industrial policy, which consists primarily of functional policies that improve the overall quality of the economy, is improvement of social and economic infrastructure, the fostering of management, technology, and planning, and the simultaneous adoption of export-oriented trade policies to bring about an optimization of the structure through the melding of the domestic economy with the international economy. In addition, industrial policy must pay close attention to the development of one or two leading industries, tilting policies in their favor to an appropriate degree to stimulate an upgrading of the industrial structure. One important means for implementing industrial policy is policy-related long-term financing. Planning units should accelerate reforms in the following several regards: - In the investment control realm, as system reform intensifies, and the mechanism for restraining investment entities grows stronger, planning units should curtail the examination and approval of routine investment projects, gradually substituting a "declaration system" for the "examination and approval system." In the process of building a development bank, the planning sector should work together with the fiscal and banking sectors to make appropriate readjustments: - State use of foreign exchange, no longer employing planning quotas, for gradual institution of an exchange purchase system. - Large scale cutbacks in various licensing systems to promote implementation of trade policies. - Make vocational training an important part of planning work 4. The Different Roles of All Sectors in the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control System in the Building of a Socialist Market Economy System First, fiscal system reform is the most important task in the establishment of a new system. It should be given priority consideration in the building of systems. The taxation system is the most basic institutional framework for a market economy. Therefore, only from the foundation of a standard tax system can a market economy be built in which competition is equal, resources are allocated effectively, and distributions are relatively fair. Second, the urgency of finance and banking system reform is manifested, first of all, in the ability of the central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure economic stability. The finance and banking system has two basic functions in a market economy. One is to regulate and control the money supply through the central bank to ensure economic stability. The current economic situation suggests that this reform should be accelerated. The second is to provide a well-developed financing system for economic activity to promote growth and increase returns. The entire financial markets system must steadily develop and improve with the development of China's market economy. Therefore, reform and perfection of the entire finance and banking system is a fairly long-term task. Third, In overall terms, reform of the investment system cannot be achieved within the investment system alone. As reform of the enterprise system, and of tax and finance and banking institutions proceeds, and as the functions of government organs change, transformation of the investment system will become easier to achieve. However, a state policy-related long-term investment credit system must and can be inaugurated as early as possible, both to help solve glaring structural problems in the present economy, and to set the stage for reforms in other regards. The foregoing analysis does not mean by any means that these reforms should be carried out alone. Each system has different functions, but overall integration is necessary in the process of conduction reform. 5. Reform of the State-Owned Assets Control System, Building a State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure in Which the State Holds Shares Indirectly and Directly Control Shares as a National Legal Entity A) Fundamental Reform of State-Owned Enterprises Must Begin With the Enterprise Equity Rights System. Since the beginning of reform and opening to the outside world, China has adopted a series of enterprise reform measures that have brought definite results. The face of state-owned enterprises has changed very greatly. Nevertheless, it must be realized that no fundamental changes have been made in the situation of no clarification of the equity rights of state-owned enterprises, no separation of government administration and enterprise management, no clear-cut responsibilities, and enterprise mechanisms that do not operate smoothly, not very high vitality, and not very good returns. There are another two steadily growing tendencies that require very close attention. One is that large quantities of state- owned assets are being drained away through various open and hidden means. State-owned assets have become the most important sources of sudden wealth for small groups, individuals, and foreign investors. This draining away is a redistribution of wealth that is very unfair and that may lead to social unrest. Second, enterprises living off of their capital, technological stagnation, and inadequate development stamina will seriously impair upgrading of the entire national economic structure and international competitiveness. This is because China' energy, raw and processed materials, and heavy chemical industries, and the key industries that provide mechanical equipment are still its large- and medium-sized enterprises. Looked at in these terms, ability to completely turn around the current trend in state-owned enterprises is a matter that affects the basic strength of China's economy and its long-range development prospects. Therefore, enterprise reform must explore new approaches. It cannot just work within the existing management system, or continue simply to take actions that delegate authority and make concessions. It must solve problems at their source. It must reform the existing state-owned assets control system and operating methods, rebuilding the publicly owned equity rights system. B) The Key to State-Owned Assets Control System Reform Lies in Rebuilding the State-Owned Enterprise Equity Rights Structure, the Main Objects of Reform Being State-Owned Large- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (1) Two basic principles must be adhered to in the rebuilding of the state-owned enterprise equity structure. First, is the principle of clear-cut equity rights and the separation of government administration and enterprise management, using the formation of state holding companies to create juridical organizations, and using share control and share participation to separate state-owned enterprise ownership rights from governments at all levels. This means the building of a new equity rights structure, demolishing the mechanism whereby government directly interferes in the operation of state-owned enterprises. Second, is the principle of demolishing industry monopolies and the diversification of equity rights. In founding state holding companies that hold state-owned enterprise shares, the formation of new industrial monopolies must be guarded against. Administrative monopolies exist in the traditional system, government departments monopolizing major decisions in enterprises. If we simply trade the former government units in charge for industrial corporations, these corporations managing and administering the state-owned enterprises in those industries, we will end up in a new kind of industrial monopoly. This will distort market signals and enterprise actions, thereby lowering the efficiency of the market economy. The harm will be no less than that of the administrative monopoly in the traditional system. Therefore, we must carefully design control organs for the new state-owned enterprise juridical entities, institute the swapping of share holdings, and diversify equity rights to prevent a national holding company from monopolizing an industry. (2) The key to reform lies in changing the equity rights structure of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. Most medium and small state-owned enterprises may be found in the ordinary industrial sector and in tertiary industries. In a socialist market economy, there is no need for state ownership of these enterprises. Furthermore, as a practical matter, these enterprises can fairly easily clarify anew their equity rights relationship through leasing, mergers, joint ventures, and sale, becoming market entities that make their own operating decisions and are responsible for their own profits and losses. The difficulty in reforming the state-owned enterprise equity rights system lies in how to establish a state-owned large and medium size enterprise equity rights structure that is both consistent with requirements of the market economy, and also does not change the character of ownership. In reality, China's state-owned large and medium size enterprises hold a dominant position in terms of infrastructure and as basic industries. They are also in the leading sectors of the national economy. These sectors are technology and capital intensive. They are also characterized by marked economies of scale and substantial investment risk. They have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. This is not a field suited to the investment of private capital. State-owned enterprises will still have to play a major role in these sectors. Therefore, finding a new state-owned enterprise form for state-owned enterprises in these fields has become a problem in urgent need of solution. C) Theoretical Basis for the Building of a State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure and Basic Goals Basic economic theory holds that independent equity rights are the foundation for operation of a market economy. The key to reform of the state-owned assets control system means building a form of ownership having independent equity. The development of modern share corporations and their juridical entity control structure have greatly enriched equity concepts. It has given rise to equity mechanisms in which the ultimate ownership rights and the occupancy rights, control rights, and operating rights that derive from them are mutually separate and mutual restricting. Operating rights are held by enterprise management teams who are responsible for the enterprise's day-to-day operation and decisions. Control rights are held by the board of directors. They include the appointment and payment of compensation to management teams, and decisions on the enterprise's important development strategies. Occupancy rights belong to the enterprise's juridical entity. As the occupier of all enterprise assets, it is responsible for indebtedness. It can mortgage and lease, and it bears all losses. Ownership rights are held by all shareholders. Their rights include the right to earnings, and to make strategic decisions through shareholder meeting approvals of the board of directors. So called separate equity rights means the separation, independence, and mutual limitation of the foregoing four kinds of rights. In view of basic economic theory in conjunction with practice in reform of the country's enterprises and foreign experience in state-owned assets control, we believe the basic goals of state-owned assets control system reform to be the building of a new state-owned assets equity structure. Broadly speaking, this includes a structure having the following four levels: First, ultimate ownership of state-owned assets is in the hands of the state. Second, the state (an NPC Standing Committee-empowered agency) controls the equity rights (state directly controlled shares) of national level holding corporations through full funding, control of shares, and share participation. Third, in their status as independent juridical entities, state holding corporations employ share control or share participation to control state-owned enterprise equity rights (juridical entity directly controlled shares). Fourth, as independent juridical entities actually holding state-owned assets, the managers of enterprises possess decision making authority for day-to-day operations. Such a structure in which the state holds shares indirectly and a juridical entity directly holds shares does not change the dominant position of public ownership in terms of ultimate ownership rights. However, it does permit a separation of state-owned assets control functions and operating functions. Thus it builds mutually restricting ownership rights, control rights, occupancy rights, and operating rights, thereby enabling a genuine separation of government administration and enterprise management that enables state-owned enterprises to become market entities that make their own operating decisions, and are responsible for their own profits and losses. D) Ideas About the Specific Make-Up of a State-Owned Indirect Shareholding, Public Juridical Entity Direct (Swapped) Shareholding Plan First, the members of the public ownership system committee established under the NPC Standing Committee are elected by the NPC Standing Committee. The public ownership system committee acts as the ultimate personification of state-owned assets, or what might be termed the ultimate board of directors for all state-owned assets. The public ownership system committee has authority to select members of the board of directors of national holding corporations on the basis of their special skills and the achievements of national holding companies. The work of the committee is subject to supervision of the NPC Standing Committee and the electorate. Second is the building of multiple national level holding companies. During the period when national level holding companies are being created, the committee will appropriate some state-owned assets to the holding companies or give each of the holding companies a substantial amount of equity rights distribution certificates to be used for the purchase of state-owned assets. This will serve as a means whereby the public ownership system committee invests in national level holding companies, the state-owned system committee using full funding or share control to get possession of national level holding companies. It will appoint members of the board of directors of national level holding companies. Two methods may be used to demolish industrial monopolies and diversify equity rights at the time when national level holding companies are founded. Method number one is the establishment in each sector of a national level industrial holding company, administrative means used to allocate one-third of the equity rights of state-owned enterprises in that industry to the national level holding company in that industry. Then the national level holding company limits the percentage of total shares sold that enterprises whose shares it controls might hold. The remaining two-thirds of equity rights is given to the national level holding company for that industry. Method number two is the establishment of several comprehensive national level holding companies, the public ownership system committee giving each holding company a sufficient amount of share equity distribution certificates. The public ownership committee places a limit on the percentage of shares it controls in any single industry, and it allows holding companies to freely choose the purchase equity in state-owned enterprises in different industries. This method first requires first that all state-owned enterprises change to the share system. Third, as independent juridical personae, national level holding companies might use share control and participating shares to maintain or obtain equity in state-owned enterprises having independent corporate status. Simultaneous with holding companies swapping of their holdings of state-owned enterprise equity rights, each enterprise also has a certain percentage of equity that can be held by other juridical persons or private individuals. Thus a diversification of enterprise equity occurs that helps start the establishment of a competitive corporate structure. E) Several Main Tasks in the Transformation of the State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure (1) Transformation of shares in existing large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. First of all, an inventory of assets is required to determine the amount and value of enterprise assets. The enterprise's assets are then represented by capital stock that is divided into various shares, and the enterprise's juridical corporate status decided upon. Only after this is done cam the national holding company buy equity in the enterprise for the formation of a controlling share or participating share relationship. At the same time, shares are openly offered to attract capital from other juridical persons and private individuals. (2) Selection of methods for founding national level holding companies. Generally speaking, national level holding companies might be newly founded, or existing banks, insurance companies, funds, and investment corporations might be made into holding companies. Several different choices exist in the actual founding process: One proposal is to prohibit banking institutions from holding shares. This is because even though the source of banks' shareholding funds is not savings but administratively allocated equity rights or equity rights distribution certificates, nevertheless, should recovery of capital invested in shareholdintgs become impossible, the banks would be at considerable risk. Should a crisis occur at a participating share enterprise, the banks stability would be shaken. Thus, it has been proposed that national level holding companies be founded by personnel drawn from the former Ministry of Industry. However, in order to guard against industrial monopolies, most of the equity rights of formerly subordinate enterprises would be dispersed into other shareholding companies. Another proposal is for all national level holding companies to be financial institutions. State-owned enterprises throughout the country are generally fairly heavily in debt to banks. If they held shares, banks could swap indebtedness for equity, thereby solving the enterprise indebtedness problem while simultaneously making banks shareholders. In addition, large corporate blocs generally mostly exercise financial control over subordinate companies, so bank share holdings would help the development of large entrepreneurial blocs around banks. We believe both methods might be mixed. (3) Founding of second level national holding companies. China has more than 1,000 large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises under central government control. Nationwide, large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises number in the thousands. The founding of only 10-odd primary level national holding companies would scarcely suffice to complete the restructuring of the ownership of state-owned enterprises. Thus, the founding of second level national holding companies is needed. First level holding companies might hold equity in second level holding companies, and second level holding companies might also swap shareholdings among each other. Second level holding companies could also hold equity in enterprises. They would be like the presently existing entrepreneurial block companies. (4) Selection of methods for the swapping of share holdings between national holding companies and enterprises. One method is a pyramidal ownership structure. This means a share holding relationship with swaps only downward and sideways. This means that the holding company at the top of the pyramid would have substantial authority and control capabilities, while second level national holding companies as the core could easily spawn numerous large entrepreneurial blocs. Through its control of shares, the state would wield tremendous economic power. Another method is the network ownership structure in which swaps could be made either laterally or vertically. A necessary precondition is fairly centralized equity in national holding companies, particularly in second level holding companies, enterprises also being able to hold equity in national holding companies. This is the kind of structure for the swapping of share holdings among juridical entities in Japan. We believe a rather appropriate method would be to use the first method for the most part. Later on, control could be gradually loosened, a title made toward the second method. Adoption of this transitional method includes an assumption that initially the state will provide full funding for the national holding company's equity. Then later on, depending on the spread of individual holding company equity in different industries and fields, such as ordinary industries and the tertiary industry field, a change can be made gradually toward a form of holding in which state control of shares and share participation is paramount. (5) Associated Government Agency Reform Establishment of national holding companies, separating enterprises from direct government control, requires simultaneous reform of government agencies to bring about a genuine transformation of government functions. All industrial departments in charge must be basically eliminated. Those departments that have been in charge of industrial planning and administration may be a part of the Economic Relations and Trade Committee once they have been reduced in size. The Economic Relations and Trade Committee will be responsible for functions similar to those of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]. As a transitional organization, once personnel cutbacks have been made, it may regain administrative organs for basic industries and sophisticated and strategic industries such as energy, communications, aviation, and shipping. Founding of a large three-in-one fiscal mechanism made up of public finance, taxation, and national assets. The Ministry of Finance should abolish departments and bureaus in charge of enterprises' financial matters. It should reform the existing system of direct control over the finances of state-owned enterprises, changing to indirect control methods made up primarily of income tax collection, and supervision of returns from state-owned assets. Correspondingly, the fiscal budget should be changed to a three account form consisting of recurring, construction, and capital accounts. The basic functions of the State Administration of State Property are administrative supervision of state-owned assets, protection of the rights of enterprises as juridical persons, and to examine, verify, and coordinate. Establishment of a public ownership system committee chosen by the NPC to serve as the ultimate board of directors for state-owned assets. Not only will it appoint members of the National level holding company board of directors, but it will also decide national investment, empowerment, and the taking back of empowerment. (6) Founding of mechanism for the circulation and transfer of juridical entity equity for the fashioning of market competition among public juridical entities and among other juridical entities. Thus, after state-owned enterprises have been turned into stock companies, more limited liability companies will have to be set up and listed for exchange when conditions warrant. In addition, a juridical entity equity exchange organ must be established. A negotiable securities exchange must also be established for gradual expansion of the number of juridical entity shares listed. This is to promote the circulation and transfer of juridical entity equity for optimum allocation of resources. Public juridical entity equity exchanges must also include second level national holding companies. An equity exchange percentage may be set, fluctuations in share price becoming an important indicator for holding companies. In addition, this will also stimulate holding companies more, which is good for competition. (7) Transformation of the local state-owned enterprise equity system. Local state-owned enterprises or a portion of them may be designated for local public ownership. Alternatively, the NPC Standing Committee may empower local people's congress standing committees to set up local public ownership committees as plenipotentiaries for local state-owned Assets. Local state-owned equity organizations may be rebuilt using the methods explained above. This could accelerate the conversion process nationwide. However, consideration also should be given to the founding of an equity relationship for swapping of local state-owned equity between the central government and local governments, and among local governments. A minimum amount of sales should be set to improve the effective allocation of key resources within the market nationwide. F) Sequence and Steps in the Transformation of the State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure The first step is a wide-ranging inventory of the assets of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises to speed up and widen the process of changing enterprises to a stock system. This means issuing capital stock for enterprise assets, dividing the stock into shares, and determining enterprises' juridical corporate status. The second step is setting up national level (or bi-level) holding companies, selecting existing banks, insurance companies, funds, and investment corporations for conversion to holding companies. The third step is reforming government agencies, share companies dividing up equity rights at the same time, swapping holdings, and beginning open share subscription. The fourth step is listing of share corporations as conditions warrant, and beginning equity trading in securities exchanges to advance optimum allocation of publicly owned equity. Reform of the state-owned property control system is an enormous piece of systems engineering that ramifies into all parts of the economy. It requires painstaking planning and long-term preparation. Therefore, we should begin to do it as soon as possible, learn as we go, and gradually move ahead. One fairly safe way to proceed is to select several sectors, and one or two cities as pilot projects. This will both help summarize experiences as work proceeds to make revisions and improvements, and will also reduce social shock.
