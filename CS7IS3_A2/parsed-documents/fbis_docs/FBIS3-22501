For pregnant women who were examined at the hospital it was found that 7 percent had the AIDS virus. There were many that were not examined by the hospital, and it was thought that the figure might be higher than this. Dr. Anan said the reason for the increased spread of AIDS in the seven provinces of the lower South was that there was still little awareness of AIDS prevention in any group. The use of female prostitutes caused more and more wives to acquire the virus from their husbands. Changing the custom of using prostitutes, if it were possible, would reduce the incidence of AIDS.
