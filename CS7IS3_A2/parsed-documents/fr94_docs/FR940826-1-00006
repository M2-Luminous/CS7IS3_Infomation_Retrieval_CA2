FR940826-1-00006 FR940826-1-00001 The NMPF witness offered testimony and evidence in support of the testimony of the MIF/IICA position. The witness compared the actual Class II price each month under the Chicago Regional order with what the Class II price would have been under their alternative proposal for the six-year period from 1988 to 1993. These comparisons on average, the witness said, would neither have increased handler's costs nor have changed prices received by dairy farmers. This proponent witness maintained that this alternative proposal would have generated more stable prices over the past six years and that the range between monthly high and low prices would have been less than the actual Class II price range. According to the witness, their proposal assures that monthly fluctuations in Class I and Class II prices will be identical. Also, according to the NMPF witness, under the current Class II pricing formula, Class I and Class II prices could, and often did, move in opposite directions in the same month. They maintained that consistent movements in Class I and Class II prices would lessen confusion and mitigate marketing problems that arise when Class I and Class II prices move in opposite directions in the same month. The NMPF proponent witness testified that their proposed alternative for determining the Class II milk price is simple, easy to understand, and can be calculated as soon as the basic formula price is announced by the USDA. In addition to joining the MIF/IICA position in support of Proposal One, this witness asserted that based on data for the past six years, adoption of their proposal would result in no changes in either Class II prices paid by handlers or prices received by producers. Additionally, this witness observed that there would be little overall price impact, but prices would be more stable, and market conditions would improve. A joint brief filed by the MIF/IICA and the NMPF reiterated their testimony calling for adoption of Proposal One. The witness for Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc., offered testimony in support of the need to adopt the MIF/IICA and NMPF's Class II pricing proposal. This witness offered testimony supporting the proponents' observations of the pricing problems and business impacts that occur when Class I and Class II prices move in different directions in the same month. This witness attributes, in part, the decline in sales of Class II products to the wide price swings of the Class II price and how retailers have reacted to these swings. The Prairie Farms witness asserted that adoption of the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal would not negatively affect farmers, that returns to processors would be more constant, and that consumers would see a more stable average price on Class II products, which might result in increased sales.
