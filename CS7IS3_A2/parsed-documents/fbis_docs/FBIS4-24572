He told the White House press conference that his country should see relations with China within the broader context of policy in the Pacific-Asian [as heard] region. He said China has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and U.S. exports to China last year were valued at more than $8 billion, creating job opportunities for 150,000 Americans. But Clinton also said the U.S. would maintain the existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989. China has welcomed the decision on the renewal of the MFN. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday, saying that the decision would create favorable conditions for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic cooperation between the two sides, and the improvement and development of relations overall. It said the decision serves the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples. The Foreign Ministry said MFN, which is granted by both the U.S. and China, is beneficial to both sides. The Foreign Ministry said China has consistently opposed linking MFN with issues not concerned with trade, or attaching conditions and requirements. The statement expressed regret for the maintenance of U.S. sanctions against China, stressing that the U.S. side has made unjustifiable accusations about China's human rights situation. It said this decision constitutes an interference in China's internal affairs, which is absolutely unacceptable to China. It hoped that the U.S. Government would lift all sanctions against China at the earliest possible date, and abandon all measures detrimental to the development of bilateral relations. The Foreign Ministry statement said China and the United States share a broad range of interests. The current situation offers a historic opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government attaches importance to such relations, and has made and will continue to make major efforts for their improvement and development. The statement believes that Sino-American relations will enjoy smooth and healthy progress so long as both sides strictly abide by the guidelines and principles outlined in the three Sino-American joint communiques, develop mutual trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and refrain from confrontation.
