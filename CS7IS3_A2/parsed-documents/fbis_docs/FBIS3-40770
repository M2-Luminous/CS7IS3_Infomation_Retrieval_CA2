Narasimha Rao and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, to further intensify their bilateral, cooperative interaction for mutual benefit. The five MOUs related to joint ventures under private sector, investments, railway construction, telecommunications, rubber industry, professional education and airconditioning industry and the agreement related to technical cooperation. Earlier in the day, the two Prime Ministers had a 40-minute exchange of views agreed and underlined the need for cooperation among developing countries in the context of the recent G-15 (at all levels) meetings to consult together with a view to find ways to fulfil their aspirations. Such cooperation, Mr Rao pointed out, was of great importance in a changing world which often had the habit of marginalising developing countries. He also welcomed the close interaction with countries like Malaysia. Agreeing with Mr. Rao, the Malaysian Prime Minister stated that in a world situation like the current one it was important that countries like India and Malaysia should consult each other regularly. They should exchange views on the developments in their region, he added. Both the leaders emphasised the need to develop bilateral political and economic cooperation. Dr. Mahathir Mohamed wanted that specific areas to be identified for infrastructural requirements and cooperation. Both leaders noted that India and Malaysia were countries with strong historical and cultural background. Such countries had their own ways of looking at things, based on their own ethos and some times their national genius could provide solutions to present day problems more effectively rather than simply trying to graft solutions from the developed world. This one-to-one meet was followed by a full delegation level meet where the two Prime Ministers led their respective teams, Indian delegation included, apart from senior officials, the External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, the Commerce Minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee and the Minister of State, Mr Buvanesh Chaturvedi. The Malaysian Prime Minister was assisted by his Foreign Minister and a high level team of officials. Mr Rao said there had been satisfactory and comprehensive discussions at the recent G-15 meetings of the personal representatives and Foreign Ministers. It was necessary to follow up bilaterally to see that the outcome is not neglected through a lack of high level attention. He also pointed out that the present bilateral relations between India and Malaysia is an example of how countries could keep in very close touch to further their cooperation. Dr Mahathir Mohamed agreed with these views and said that Malaysia had the same perception and concerns. Mr Rao said that in South Asian region's SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] had made a slow but steady progress. "It has come of age," he added. He made inquiries about the ASEAN. Malaysian Prime Minister mentioned that though the G-15 summit had to be postponed, he said, he was happy to be in India as his country attached great importance to its relationship with India.
