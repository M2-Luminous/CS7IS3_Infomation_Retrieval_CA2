This openness achieved by the PUNR is the most important political moment in Romania life since the parliamentary elections of September 1992. Within the framework of this political partnership, the PDSR and the PUNR have established the scope of their cooperation at parliamentary, governmental, and territorial levels. The assumption of the political responsibility of the government act by the PUNR will take concrete shape in the drafting of an anti- crisis and anti-inflationist governmental program capable of dynamizing the mechanisms of reform and privatization and of contributing to the efficient resolution of the people's social problems -- the communique received by telephone from Mr. Ioan Gavra points out. Contacted also by telephone, PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase confirmed the signing of the protocol and said that it is the outcome of negotiations conducted on the evening of 31 January by the five parties of the parliamentary majority, namely the PDSR, PUNR, the Socialist Party of Labor, the Greater Romania Party, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania.
