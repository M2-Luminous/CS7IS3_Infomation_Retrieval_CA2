FR940610-1-00044 FR940610-1-00007 (ii) Exceptions. If, in the case of the allowance of the credit for tax on a prior transfer under section 2013, the tax in the transferor's estate was finally determined without regard to the fact that one or more measuring lives were terminally ill at the time of the transferor's death, the value of any transferred interest dependent on any of those lives shall be determined for purposes of section 2013 without regard to the fact that those measuring lives were terminally ill. In addition, the value of a decedent's reversionary interest under section 2037(b) or 2042(2) shall be determined without regard to the physical condition of the decedent immediately before death. (4) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1._Simultaneous deaths. The decedent's will establishes a trust to pay income to the decedent's surviving spouse for life. The will provides that, upon the spouse's death, or if the spouse fails to survive the decedent, the trust property is to pass to the decedent's children. The decedent and the decedent's spouse die simultaneously in an accident under circumstances in which it was impossible to determine who survived the other. Applicable state law presumes that the decedent died first with the result that the property interest is considered to have passed in trust for the benefit of the spouse for life, after which the remainder is to be distributed to the decedent's children. Therefore, the spouse's life income interest may not be valued under this section. Example 2._Terminal illness. The decedent bequeaths $1,000,000 to a trust under the terms of which the trustee is to pay $103,000 per year to a charitable organization during the life of the decedent's child. Upon the death of the child, the remainder in the trust is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The child, who is age 60, has been diagnosed with an incurable illness, and there is at least a 50 percent probability of the child dying within 1 year. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the decedent's death is 10.6 percent. The standard life annuity factor for a person age 60 (7.4230) may not be used to determine the present value of the charitable organization's annuity interest because there is at least a 50 percent probability that the measuring life will die within 1 year. Instead, a special section 7520 annuity factor must be computed that takes into account the projection of the child's actual life expectancy. (5) Additional Limitations. Section 7520 does not apply to the extent provided by the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings or revenue procedures. (6) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are effective with respect to estates of decedents dying after the date these regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal Register . PART 25_GIFT TAX; GIFTS MADE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1954 Par. 5. The authority citation for part 25 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣* Par. 6. Section 25.7520&hyph;3 is amended by adding the text of paragraph (b) to read as follows: §25.7520&hyph;3 Limitation on the application of section 7520. * * * * * (b) Other limitations on the application of section 7520 _(1) In general _(i) Ordinary beneficial interests. For purposes of this section: (A) An ordinary annuity interest is the right to receive a fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth of the right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor. (B) An ordinary income interest is the right to receive the income from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the right to receive the income from $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. However, in the case of certain gifts made after October 8, 1990, if the donor does not retain a qualified annuity, unitrust, or reversionary interest, the value of any interest retained by the donor is considered to be zero if the remainder beneficiary is a member of the donor's family. See §25.2702&hyph;2.
