FR940707-2-00079 FR940707-2-00049 Where appropriate, applicants may propose project periods which are shorter than the maximums specified in the various priority areas. Non-Federal share contributions may exceed the minimums specified in the various priority areas when the applicant is able to do so. For multi-year projects, continued Federal funding beyond the first budget period, but within the approved project period, is subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government. F. Grantee Share of Project Costs Other than the exception described below, Federal funds will be provided to cover up to 75% of the total allowable project costs. The total allowable project costs are the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, the non-Federal share must amount to at least 25% of the total (Federal plus non-Federal) project cost. This means that, for every $3 in Federal funds received, up to the maximum amount allowable under each priority area, applicants must contribute at least $1. For example, the cost breakout for a project costing $100,000 to implement would be: ‚ê£ 1Federal request 1Non-Federal share 1Total cost $75,000 $25,000 $100,000 75% 25% 100%
