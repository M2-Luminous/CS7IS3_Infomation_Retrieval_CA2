Urgency and Necessity of Reorganizing State-Owned Assets When we refer to reorganization of state-owned assets, we mean this to contain, chiefly, the following three levels of reform: first, carrying out reorganization of state-owned assets concerned with the enterprise property organization system, which means incorporating the great majority of state- owned enterprises, converting them into joint stock enterprises with state single capital, state-controlled capital and state-shared capital; the second is to reorganize state-owned assets within the scope of an industry, which means putting support for pillar enterprises at the center, and perfecting the organization of state-owned enterprises' assets within the same industry, to form a "national class group" of enterprises within that industry which will have competitive strength in international markets; the third is to reorganize assets among industries, which means allowing state-owned assets to be withdraws from ordinary industries, while gathering in the domestic pillar industries and other major industries through transfer of property rights. The necessity of accelerating reorganization of state-owned assets is determined by the inappropriate contradictions between the state-owned economy's competitiveness in the current period and the missions it should undertake, and the circumstances surrounding these missions. First, after 14 years of reform, up to the beginning of this decade, there has been a fundamental change in the traditional Chinese economic pattern which was characterized by state monopoly. The nonstate-owned economy developed rapidly, and especially with a great deal of foreign capital coming in over a wide scale. This brought competitiveness in international markets not only to ordinary manufacturing industries, but also to the raw materials and excavating industries. It even had this result for the backbone industries of the domestic economy which were originally regarded as natural monopolies, ones which should be state monopolies, such as railways, aviation, finance, insurance, electric power, etc. State-owned enterprises must be highly efficient and high profitable in order to survive. If the state-owned enterprises lack the ability to compete, not only will they be unable to play the key role in the domestic economy, they cannot become China's main force for joining in the international market competition, and they will even lose what positions they already hold in the domestic economy, and will not demonstrate the superiority of the socialist state-owned economy. Therefore, strengthening "commercial battle" knowledge and "competition" knowledge should become the principal idea in the 1990s for state-owned property rights management in China. Second, the practical situation of China's state-owned economy is very unsuitable to the heavy assignments it is undertaking and the conditions of serious competition. Looking at the world wide picture, about one-third of the state-owned enterprises are obviously losing money, one-third are of potential losers, and assets operations never get themselves out of the difficult position of low efficiency. Looking at the industrial scale, big enterprises are not really big, small enterprises are specialized, and there is serious competition and regional and production separation as well. Compared with overseas competitors, the state-owned enterprises are obviously quite distant from being a powerful force. What is especially deserving of attention is this kind of distance among our pillar industries. Taking automobile manufacturing as an example, the 16 overseas automobile manufacturing enterprises which occupied over 70 percent of the world's gross output had an average scale of assets of $45 billion, with an average yearly output of over 2.5 million cars, while the entire fixed assets of China's automobile industry was only 18 billion yuan (RMB). In addition, this industry was scattered over 2,600 enterprises, among which the fixed assets of the eight major automobile manufacturers occupied only 30.5 percent of the entire industry. It is forecast that by the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan, the gross assets of these eight major enterprises will be up to 50 billion yuan, which is still less than $10 billion. Our industry's average assets scale is even less than the amount major overseas enterprises invest annually in scientific and technical research and development. Looking at the distribution of output, the output of over 95 percent of the enterprises in our automobile industry is less than 50,000 cars, with 80 percent of the enterprises having an annual output of less than 10,000 cars. Obviously, if we do not soon alter this situation of scattered resource distribution and increase enterprises' economic power, joining the competition in the international market will be merely an illusion. How to change the inappropriate situation between China's economic competitive ability and its mission, given its circumstances? One way is to rely on the state's investment. This is doubtless necessary, but presents considerable difficulties. Some concerned experts estimate that if before 2000, we can form two to three pillar enterprises in China's automobile industry, making their output occupy over 80 percent of the gross national output, the production capacity of each pillar enterprise should be at least one million cars, and the gross assets should be over $6 billion, which is about 35 billion yuan RMB, and this will be 10 times again the net assets of the No 1 Automobile Group--the largest automobile manufacturing enterprise group at present. Our state finances have no way of assuming such a huge investment increase at the present time. Another way is to rely on the enterprises themselves, aided by the market operation system, going the way of association and merger. This is the basic means of remolding the state-owned assets under the market economic operation system. But it will be a long process for the market economy operation system to come into full play. At present, the market economic operation system in China imperfect, so this process will be a very long one. Another way is by using the state-owned assets property rights controlled by the government, reorganizing state-owned assets. This method can compensate to a certain degree for shortcomings in financial capacity, as well as speed up perfecting the enterprises' self-reorganization. We believe that under the conditions of the socialist market economy, it is not necessary that the state- owned economy must be manifested in the industries to the same degree as state ownership, but function chiefly as the state-owned enterprises' competitiveness and play the lead role in the domestic economy. Thus, we must change our thinking, conscientiously adjust the operational scale and structure of the state-owned economy, strengthen pillar industries and increase their competitiveness ability, and bring the state-owned economy's leading role more efficiently into the domestic economy. II. Difficult Points, Countermeasures in Reorganizing State-Owned Assets To reorganize state-owned assets we must smash the old pattern of making regional and production distinctions in asset allocation for industrial economic development, perfecting reorganization. Because each industrial management department undertakes a "united management" (industrial management) function for enterprises of their entire industry and simultaneously a "responsibility" (state-owned assets property rights management) function for its attached enterprises, in practice, it is usually the case that "united management" is false, "responsibility" is genuine, as industrial plans and policies are often difficult to implement efficiently due to interference from the departments responsible for enterprises. This can be regarded as the major point of difficulty in current state-owned assets reorganization work. How to ease the contradiction between "responsible" and "united management" in the process of industrial management? Our conclusion from the past 14 years' experience and lessons from reform is that in order to reach a basic resolution of the contradiction between "responsible" and "united management" in the process of industrial management, to guarantee and promote successfully the reorganization of the state-owned assets system, we should set out to support reform from multiple directions, including the following major six aspects: First, accelerate establishment of a modern enterprise system. The contradiction between "responsible" and "united management" comes first from the undivided responsibility for administration and enterprise activity in the state-owned assets operational activities. The state-owned enterprises cannot become merchandise producers and operators of enterprises which are self operated, responsible for their own profits and losses, self restricted, and self developing. Through defining enterprises' property rights, establish a modern enterprises' legal person system. Remolding state-owned enterprises by incorporation will aid in correcting the property rights relationships between the state and state-owned enterprises, will achieve the separation of enterprises from administration, will permit state-owned enterprises to become genuine merchandise production operators and independent principal entities in market competition, and will establish a good foundation for resolving the contradiction between government's "responsible" function and "united management" function. Second, government management of industries gradually tends to be synthesized. The finer the division of labor among industrial management departments, the more specialized will be their management, the more numerous will be the number of responsible departments, and the easily will there occur the contradiction between "responsible" and "united management." In determining the management departments, there must be attention to letting the scale of their management be suitably wider, so that the number of responsible departments will be fewer; this will help to weaken the contradiction between "responsible" and "united management," which will be favorable to reorganizing the state-owned assets. Third, have different patterns for state-owned asset's property right management for different industries. For ordinary industries, such as food processing, beverages, etc., which are regular daily consumption producing industries and some service industries, the state-owned assets can by plan be gradually and automatically withdrawn, and the contradiction between "responsible" and "united management" will disappear with it. For competitive domestic economy pillar industries, such as automobile manufacturing, the oil and chemical industry, heavy machinery, electricity, etc., we should cultivate and develop a state-owned enterprise group which is centered on pillar enterprises. This will more densely concentrate the state-owned assets in that industry, as well as handling well the relationship between "responsible" and "united management" by making pillar enterprises the intermediary. As for domestic economy pillar industries which are natural monopolies, e.g., railways, posts, electric power, etc., which have such technical and economic characteristics as constituting a high proportion of the state-owned economy, with large scale enterprises, single products, little crossover between industries, etc., these can take on the state-owned assets' property rights management pattern of taking industrial management departments as dominant factor. Fourth, establish an organic combined organizational pattern and system which will be favorable to state-owned assets property rights management and industrial management. Looking at the current situation, one task is to establish an interdepartmental coordinating committee for remolding state-owned assets, to strengthen leadership. A second is to establish an industrial or comprehensive state-owned economy strategic study center. This will strengthen research on strategy and tactics for the state-owned economy to compete in the market, and provide reference service for industrial management departments and management of state-owned assets. A third is to establish work relationship between the branch organs of state-owned assets property rights management inside industrial management departments and state-owned assets management departments. These branch organs should also make policy suggestions concerning the scale of state-owned assets operations and the structural readjustment and operational policies for the industry. Fifth, change the concept of state-owned property rights management, to improve the quality of managers. The qualification of managers is the key to whether the management system can operate regularly. However, if we do not completely abandon the state-owned property rights management concept which formed under the traditional system, it will be impossible to establish a new type of state-owned property management system. So, we must further liberate our ideas, study and grasp market economic theory and the operating regulations for state-owned property under the conditions of the socialist market economy. Sixth, vigorously cultivate and develop a market for enterprises to exchange property rights. Although state-owned assets reorganization is a planned governmental property rights management activity, we absolutely cannot look upon it as identical to the "close, stop, merge, and exchange" of enterprises under the traditional system. We should build a base on enterprise self operation, provide appropriate intervention and policy guidance to accelerate necessary concentration of state-owned assets. The formation of an enterprise property rights exchange market is a necessary condition for reorganizing state-owned assets and propping up pillar industries and enterprises under the market economy.
