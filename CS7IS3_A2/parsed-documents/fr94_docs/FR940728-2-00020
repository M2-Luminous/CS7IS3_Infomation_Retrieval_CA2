FR940728-2-00020 FR940728-2-00014 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;081. Applicant: University of Minnesota, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 111 Church Street, SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455. Instrument: Fabry-Perot Interferometer System. Manufacturer: JRS Instruments, Switzerland. Intended Use: The instrument will be used as part of a laser scattering system to obtain plasma jet temperature and velocity distributions with emphasis on the effects of entrainment of surrounding gases. Experiments will involve line shape analysis of the scattered laser light from the plasma jets at various plasma operating conditions, for obtaining heavy particle and electron temperatures and plasma jet velocity with adequate spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, the instrument will be used in the courses ``Introduction to Plasma Technology'' and ``Plasma-Aided Manufacturing,'' with the objectives of introducing fundamentals of various plasma processes and enhancing the awareness of importance of plasma technology in advanced materials processing and various industrial applications. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 14, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;082. Applicant: National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, 1400 Jackson Street, Denver, CO 80206. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer System, Model API III ``Plus.'' Manufacturer: Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Canada. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for conducting the following studies: (a) structure elucidation of metabolites of arachidonic acid from the 5-lipoxygenase, epoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and autooxidation pathways, (b) peptide sequencing of portions of proteins isolated from in vitro experimentation and synthesized using molecular biology techniques, (c) quantitative analysis of leukotrienes and leukotriene metabolites by HPLC/MS/MS and (d) quantitative analysis of platelet activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-3-glycerophosphocholine. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 20, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;083. Applicant: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Purchasing Division, 506 Wright Street, 207 Henry Administration Bldg, Urbana, IL 61801. Instrument: Biological Monitor, Model MOSSELMONITOR. Manufacturer: Delta Consult, The Netherlands. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to provide continuous analysis of organism response during proposed research with the objective of developing methods to perform in situ measurement and analysis of episodic event toxicity associated with stormwater flows. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 29, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;084. Applicant: University of Illinois at Chicago, Center of Molecular Biology of Oral Diseases, School of Dentistry, 801 S. Paulina St., Chicago, IL 60612. Instrument: Stopped Flow Spectrofluorimeter, Model SX-17MV. Manufacturer: Applied Photophysics Limited, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to study the rates of interaction of proteins of mammalian blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems with each other and with protein and polysaccharide modifiers of their biologic activity. The immediate studies will examine the interactions of the blood coagulation protein inhibitor omission and with the natural polysaccharide, heparin, which activates the inhibitor. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 29, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;087. Applicant: University of Maryland, School of Medicine, 655W Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201. Instrument: Robotic Micromanipulator System. Manufacturer: Scientific Precision Instruments, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of rat hippocampal neurons, either acutely dissociated or tissue-cultured. Experiments will consist of studies of whole-cell or single channel patch clamp recordings of transmitter-gated receptor activity in hippocampal brain cells. The aim of the experiments is to identify the location on the cell of these various subtypes of receptors. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 7, 1994.
