She noted that the decision to lift the parliamentary immunity of certain Democracy Party [DEP] deputies is Turkey's internal affair. In reply to a reporter's question aboard a plane on her way from Ankara to Balikesir, Ciller said that she explained the situation to the European Parliament officials with whom she met. Ciller recalled that a similar case had occurred in Belgium and that the immunity of certain deputies had been lifted. Turkish Radio and Television correspondent Yurdaer Tartan reports that Ciller said that democracy means freedom and that the True Path Party is the party that attaches the most importance to this principle. Ciller said: Everyone is commenting. Democracy is a regime in which freedoms and rights are balanced. No one has the right to help murderers under the guise of exercising their right to freedom. No one has the right to violate the constitution. That is not a state of law but one of anarchy.
