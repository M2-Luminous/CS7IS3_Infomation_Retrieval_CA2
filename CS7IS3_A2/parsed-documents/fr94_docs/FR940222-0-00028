FR940222-0-00028 FR940222-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary 32 CFR Part 199 [DoD 6010.8&hyph;R] RINS&hyph;0720&hyph;AA08&hyph;0720&hyph;AA10&hyph;0720&hyph;AA13 Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); Coverage of Screening Mammography and Papanicolaou (PAP) Tests, Certified Marriage and Family Therapists, and Requirements for Coverage and Reimbursement of Services of Physicians in Teaching Settings AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DoD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the exclusions and limitations of the CHAMPUS regulation pertaining to preventive care and unnecessary diagnostic tests not related to a specific illness, injury, or definitive set of symptoms, to allow coverage for screening mammography and PAP tests on a preventive basis initially following the recommended guidelines of the American Cancer Society as a basis for coverage. The final rule also removes the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and family therapists; requires all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full; ensures that the relationship of certified marriage and family therapists is consistent with other mental health practitioners with comparable education and training; protects the CHAMPUS beneficiary from incurring added out-of-pocket costs for care rendered that is not part of the current CHAMPUS mental health benefits package; and better defines the specific requirements of existing CHAMPUS policies for coverage and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians and physicians in training.

The effective date for changes in §199.4, paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(37)(vii) and (g)(37)(viii) and (g)(39), and section 199.6, paragraph (d)(6), related to screening PAP tests and mammography on a preventive basis is November 5, 1990; the effective date for changes in §199.2(b), ``marriage and family therapist, certified,'' ``pastoral counselors,'' ``mental health counselor,'' §199.4, paragraph (c)(3)(ix)(A), and §199.6, paragraphs (c) (1)(iv) and (3)(iv), related to certified marriage and family therapists is May 23, 1994; and the effective date for changes in §199.2(b), ``approved teaching programs,'' ``attending physician,'' ``physician in training'' and ``teaching physician,'' §199.4, paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (c)(1)(i), (c)(3)(xiii), and 199.6, paragraph (c)(1), related to services of teaching physicians and physicians in training is March 24, 1994.
