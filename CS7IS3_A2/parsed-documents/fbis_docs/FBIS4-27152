FBIS4-27152 "dreas104_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 South Korea President, Opposition Leader Discuss DPRK President, Opposition Leader Discuss DPRK SK2805093994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0844 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805093994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and opposition Democratic Party (DP) chairman Yi Ki-taek met for the second time this year Saturday, agreeing to hold summits often and establish a partnership between ruling and opposition parties to realize productive politics. In talks that lasted some two and half hours, President Kim held forth on the North Korean nuclear dispute, the issue of North Koreans fleeing Siberian logging camps and the reality of the situation up North, asking for the DP's cooperation in diplomacy and inter-Korean issues. Kim promised to instruct the government to fully cooperate with the National Assembly' activities within the legal boundary when the opposition leader called for the president's firm action to resolve the currently deadlocked house probe into the Sangmundae political scandal fund, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. The president explained that North Korea already changed more than half of its 8,000 nuclear fuel rods and that recent talks with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ended in failure. He said it also was hard to predict what would happen to talks between the United States and North Korea, slated for June. "More than 90 percent of North Korea's arms are Russian made and Russia automatically has to intervene when there is a war on the Korean peninsula. I'm going to specifically address these issues when I visit Russia," Kim said. He added that Seoul informally proposed to offer some of its reserve rice to North Korea to resolve its food shortages, but the communist country refused. The president urged the ruling and oppostion parties stop wasting energy disputing and instead carry out partnership for productive politics to raise national competitiveness, Chu said. When Yi raised the issue of abolishing the National Security Law, Kim said the subcommittee formed by lawmakers for the the matter and legal experts should continue to discuss to reach a good conclusion, contrast to the president's flat opposition to the proposal in previous summit talks. Explaining the inevitability of the birth of the world trade organization and Uruguay Round [UR] agreement, Kim sought the main opposition party's cooperation in the National Assembly's ratification of the UR agreement. Yi, however, firmly answered that his party opposes to house ratification of the UR treaty. When Yi called for a stop to inspections on Peace Foundation chairman Kim Tae-chung's house, the president promptly said such inspection activities could not be tolerated and should never exist, recalling his experience in the past as a opposition party leader. After the talks, Yi announced that the president and he reached agreements in the issues of Sanmundae probe, revision of National Security Planning Law, investigation into Kwangju uprising, revision of unified medical insurance law, and reforms in educational and scientific policies. "The president said North Korea had changed half of its 8,000 nuclear fuel rods and that the IAEA inspections had hit a deadlock. Prospects for the third North Korea-U.S. talks were, therefore, unclear and there was a possibility that the North Korean nuclear issue could be referred to the UN security council after hearing the IAEA report on its inspections," Yi said.
