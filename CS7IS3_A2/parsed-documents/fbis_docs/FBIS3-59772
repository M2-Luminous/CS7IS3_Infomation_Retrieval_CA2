The giant U.S. aircraft maker has not officially nixed the project itself, but it is believed that the program will wilt in light of Boeing's recent decision to simply remodel its 737 into a successor known as the 737X, according to Japanese sources. The Japanese view that it had little choice but to bow out underscores how tightly this nation's aircraft industry has tied its fate to Boeing. Even as the YXX program fades away, new projects are on the horizon for Japan, but all of them in one way or another depend on Boeing's moves. The relationship dates back decades, but a key turning point was in 1981, when Boeing planners envisioned that the follow-on to their highly successful 737 would be the 150-seat 7J7, known in Japan as the YXX. In a move that brought howls from U.S. critics who claimed Boeing was giving away America's key technologies on a silver platter, the firm turned to Japan for 25% of the investment dollars and a piece of the development and manufacturing responsibilities. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry regarded the YXX project as an important step toward the eventual goal of a Japanese-developed passenger aircraft. Several Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., have spent more than a decade researching and developing aspects of the YXX. MITI recently revealed it has decided to suspend the YXX project next fiscal year, beginning in April. Bureaucrats have reduced the proposed spending for the YXX project in the 1994 fiscal year budget to an amount needed simply to pull loose ends together. For the post-737 aircraft, Boeing has decided to modify its existing 737, in order to save on development costs. The 737 is the world's best-selling passenger aircraft, with total orders of more than 3,000. MITI officials concluded that, in light of Boeing's plans for the 737X, a YXX wouldn't be competitive. Industry sources said Boeing and Japan have reached a basic agreement on Japanese participation in the new 737X project. Boeing has proposed to limit Japan's share to wing-related parts, the sources added, becausethere will be only limited modifications to the 737 aircraft. Most parts and components of the 737 have been manufactured within the U.S. and will continue to be. Given that Boeing is implementing drastic streamlining measures, including slashing employees, offering jobs to Japan is quite unlikely, Japanese officials said. In addition, the appreciation of the yen and relatively expensive labor cots would make Japanese parts costly for Boeing, they added. On the other hand, Korea announced recently that it would take part in the 737X project. Japanese officials also suspect that China would join the project. Earlier 1993, Japan's major aircraft builders started shipping components for Boeing's new 777 passenger plane. The industry hopes such shipments will help offset business lost because of declining Japanese defense spending. While the decline of the YXX project is a setback for Japan's hopes to invigorate its aerospace industry, MITI has another plan in the works. The budget is expected to balloon next year for another proposed aircraft, the 75-seat YSX regional jet. This time the project is being led by a private Japanese consortium, heavily backed by the government, which is hoping to attract other nations. Officials would especially like to lure China into the project since that nation's 21st-century appetite for regional jets is expected to be huge. It also is said in Japanese circles that the tables are being turned on the U.S. It is Boeing, according to industry sources, that is knocking on Japan's door in hopes of getting a piece of the project.
