You also expressed great satisfaction with the fact that both parties had unanimously agreed that they would continue talks until the dispute was settled. Unfortunately, the talks were soon broken off. What is more, Greece once again imposed a blockade on Macedonia -- first of all it denied it the access to the seaport at Salonika. What led to this sudden increase in the tension between Athens and Skopje? [Gligorov] The Republic of Macedonia has all along believed, and it still does, that direct talks are the only way to settle any disputes. I do not know any more effective method. Only political dialogue at a common table can help reach a compromise. Last year's talks at the United Nations were indeed very promising. Unfortunately, Greece unilaterally broke them off. It justified this decision with the holding of parliamentary elections, which, incidentally, was true. One could accept this argument if, after the elections, the dialogue had been resumed. Such a course of events might then be considered normal. However, this did not take place. It is worth recalling that as early as the election campaign, Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] supported slogans that were very radical and not conducive to the climate of reconciliation; when the new authorities came to power, they did not only make no any attempts to resume the talks, but in addition a decision was made to further flame the political atmosphere, which was already very hot and unfavorable for us. Thus, populist undertakings were chosen. At great rallies the nationalistic passions were further excited. This method could only lead to the radicalization of public opinion, to the decreasing of maneuverability, and to the limiting of the role of the Greek delegation in further talks. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Exactly. Can you see any chances of resuming the Macedonian-Greek dialogue? What concessions is Skopje prepared to make, and what concessions does it expect from Athens? [Gligorov] The Greek economic embargo has considerably deteriorated our economic situation, which was already difficult; this poor economic situation was caused by the sanctions slapped against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was one of our important economic partners. We have not retaliated and will not retaliate by imposing a similar embargo. We will not organize any rallies intensifying the anti-Greek atmosphere in Macedonia in reply to the Greek rallies. Our borders are wide open to the Greeks and to Greek commodities. [passage omitted] The dispute between Macedonia and Greece is irrational. It is emotional and does not make any sense. We are, after all, close nations, with a common religion and possibly good prospects for economic cooperation. Macedonia is the Greek road to Europe and Greece -- the Macedonian access to the sea. We are a small, peaceloving country. We have made it clear in our Constitution that we have no territorial claims on any of our neighbors. We are not a military superpower that might threaten Greece, which has five times as many inhabitants as we do. Moreover, Greece is a member of NATO and the European Union. Thus, if one takes into account all these things, one cannot help but draw the conclusion that it is possible to resolve this irrational dispute through rational means. [passage omitted] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What hopes do you pin on Macedonia's participation in the Central European Initiative? [Gligorov] My country is definitely pro-European. We believe that the integration of the Republic of Macedonia with this European association is the most important, fundamental goal for us. We link it to the process of Europeanization of the entire Balkans and Eastern Europe. We believe that it results from the internal need of the individual states -- from the new European architecture. The Central European Initiative may be of great assistance in the process of accelerating the introduction of European Standards, in the integration of states of the post-socialist region with the EC. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] It is here, in Skopje, that we heard of the idea of forming a Slavic-Orthodox alliance. What is your opinion on this initiative and would Macedonia join such a union? [Gligorov] I believe that any ideas concerning new alliances, such as Slavic-Orthodox, Muslim, or others, are detrimental; they may prove tragic for the Balkans and for Europe. Along with the downfall of socialism and the division into blocs, Europe had a great chance to overcome and curb the process of creating new ethnic, religious, and other divisions. Such alliances mean a return to painful experiences, as well as the creation of new conflicts and a road leading to calamities. The Republic of Macedonia would not decide to enter into such alliances, today or ever. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Macedonia was the first country to which UN peacekeeping forces were sent before -- as it is most often called -- the "fire" broke out. What is your evaluation of the preventive policy of the West in this part of Europe? Do you feel safe? How can lasting peace be ensured in the Balkans? [Gligorov] The preventative mission of UN forces in Macedonia is of great importance, which extends beyond our borders. It was a wise, far-reaching decision. The settlement of conflicts, the prevention of fires makes far greater sense than putting them out only later on. The UN forces in the Republic of Macedonia, which also include a U.S. contingent (almost half of the soldiers), give us a feeling of greater security. The presence of the said units is interpreted as proof of UN and U.S. support for the maintenance of Macedonia's territorial integrity, peace, and stabilization. Lasting peace in the Balkans can be guaranteed first of all through respect for and maintenance of the present borders, prevention of any attempts to alter them by force, countering of the policy of ethnic cleansing, and the granting of rights to national minorities. The policy of territorial claims, breaches of human rights and the rights of minorities, as well as the cultivation of historical myths and territorial appetites may only lead to new conflicts. Tragic proof of this is the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Every now and then there appear disquieting reports about preparations on part of the Albanian minority (according to official data, they constitute 20 percent of the population, whereas the Albanians claim that they represent 40 percent) to gain -- even with the use of force -- considerable autonomy. In this connection there are rumors about the danger of the outbreak of civil war, about the danger of drawing the Albanians from Kosovo and from Albania into such a conflict. Also, the possibility of an armed intervention by Serbia is taken into account. How can "the writing" of this tragic scenario be prevented? [Gligorov] In the Republic of Macedonia, aside from the Macedonian people (approximately 69 percent of the population), live many national minorities. The most numerous is the Albanian minority (approximately 21 percent of the population). There are also Turks, Gypsies, Romanians, and Serbs. This year we will conduct a national census, under the auspices of European establishments, to once and for all dispell the myths and end the speculations about the size of the minorities, especially the Albanian minority. This minority has several parties, two of which are represented in parliament and constitute the third most numerous political force. Representatives of this minority are also members of the coalition government. It is true that certain radical groups or individuals are making attempts to establish semi-military organizations, but they do not meet with great support from the Albanian community in Macedonia. I believe that this is mainly because the Albanians and the Macedonians have never in their history been in a conflict. Thus, prevailing is the striving for coexistence, mutual respect, tolerance, and dialogue. All the predictable "black scenarios," which you have mentioned, will be real as long as the Bosnian "fire" is raging. They will be dangerous until the situation in Kosovo is normal. Also, one cannot rule out the possibility of any outside attempts to destabilize the situation in our Republic. Each of these dangers threatens an all-Balkan fire, which might soon spread to the whole of Europe. Frankly, I hope that this will not take place. [passage omitted]
