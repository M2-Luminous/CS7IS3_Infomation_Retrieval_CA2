This action followed a series of incendiary articles seeking to sow mistrust, engender tensions, and question the validity of international border agreements. Many in Chernivtsi feel that it is high time that the Romanian Culturological Society imeni Eminesku, of which the Play is the official publication, should be held accountable for their campaign. The issues are complex since Romanians make up 20% of the electorate, a fact not lost on local politicians. Even the most tolerant of stoics would be annoyed by the activities of the Eminesku society which, from its very beginnings in the 90s, always had more to do with politics than culture. The leaders, Oleksadryna Chernova, Iliye Zehrya, Vasyl Teretsanov, speculate on Ukrainian poverty with a variety of changing demands: now a Romanian university in Chernivtsi, then special privileges for Romanian-speaking conscripts, or finally dual Ukrainian-Romanian citizenship. Their inspiration comes from the Christian Democratic Alliance of Romanians in Ukraine which is registered in Kiev, although its activity is limited to Chernivtsi. Recently the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice had to caution the Alliance about interfering in government affairs. Their activism peaked in 1992 when the new Ukrainian state was coming into its own and many Moldavian village councils in Chernivtsi region seized the opportunity to raise the Romanian tricolors. At that time there were already six Romanian societies, but the Eminesku group strove for pre-eminence as the true torch bearers and martyrs of the `Romanian idea'. Romanian press reports indicate that at the end of 1993 the editor of Play Rominesk, Teretsanov, had received the National Prize of the "Greater Romania Fund" for his poetic and journalistic works on behalf of reunification of Bukovyna with its Romanian mother, all of which he is said to have accomplished despite savage persecution. But Bukovyna is not a festering boil like the Transdniester. While Teretsanov hankers for laurels from Iliescu for his martyrdom--and there are many politicians in Romania ready to finance his activities--there is no hope that the Ukrainian government or local authorities will play along by arresting and executing him. In the meantime, the Eminesku society has to put up with 55 kindergartens and 86 schools with Romanian as the language of instruction, a chair of Romanian language at the university, Romanian organizations at educational institutions, reinstitution of historical placenames, as well as friendly relations between Ukrainians and Moldavians. This is true not only of Ukraine, but also of Moldova. The Moldavians and Romanians in the Ren district of the Odessa region can only hope for the tolerant conditions prevalent in Chernivtsi. Still, various Romanian national fronts and some deputies in the Romanian parliament have set out to save their compatriots in Ukraine. They seek solace in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact to support their pretensions to Ukrainian territory, ignoring subsequent international treaties. Some recent improvements in Ukrainian-Romanian relations are due to the visit of Adrian Nastase, the speaker of the Romanian parliament, to Ukraine and the Chernivtsi Oblast. However, politicians in Chernivtsi feel that even highly placed Romanian politicians question the present borders but, in distinction to the radical elements, are willing to wait for a more opportune time to strike. This supposition is supported by the recurring demands in the Romanian press for recovery of `historical lands' and allegations by the official Romanian press agency, Rompress, that Romanians are deprived of opportunities for professional education. More likely, having been soundly rejected in Moldova, the adherents of "Greater Romania" feel they have to seek new lands to conquer for their raison d'etre. Without a chronic struggle for some imaginary Romanian lands they run the risk of being relegated to the lunatic fringe even in Bucharest itself. In Bukovyna they miscalculated when the Ukrainian authorities simply let the law take its course.
