After Raidi, deputy head of the Tibetan delegation, declared the meeting open at 0900, the deputies freely spoke about what they wanted to speak. Commenting on the three major requirements -- reform, development, and stability -- Deputies Losang Gyaincun, Qiangba Pingcuo, Losang Namgyai, and Losang Toinzhub maintained that, because of Tibet's rather special situation, it must properly handle the relations between those three requirements in order to attain the targets set for 1994. This means that, in addition to making efforts to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote development, Tibet must also pay attention to maintaining a stable social, political, and economic environment and strive to promote reform and development in a stable environment and achieve a long-term social stability through reform and development. Deputy Losang Toinzhub said: None of the three requirements -- reform, development, and stability -- is dispensable. Tibet's socialist modernization drive certainly can move forward as long as we are able to properly handle the relations between the three requirements, maintain the standards of productive forces [sheng chan li biao jun], seize the opportunity, achieve breakthroughs in key points while promoting all projects as a whole, work in line with the national framework [yu quan guo zai kuang jia shang yi zhi] and structures, and, in light of Tibet's actual needs, take resolute actions, adopt flexible policies, and take steady and reliable steps. Comrade Hu Jintao listened attentively to the views of the speakers, occasionally nodded to express his approval and inquired about Tibet's framework for reform. After the deputies finished speaking, Raidi asked Minister Chi Haotian to say a few words. Chi Haotian said: I have come to learn from you. People in Tibet care very much for and support the armed forces, and they have contributed significantly to strengthen the border defense in southwest China. Under the new situation, we must continue to strengthen army-police-people unity [jun jing min tuan jie]. The armed forces and the people should share the same destiny, breathe the same breath, and link their hearts so that our border areas can be built into a steel great wall. Meanwhile, we must strengthen the joint army-people defense to ensure stability in border areas. As long as army and people are united as one, we can surmount any difficulty.
