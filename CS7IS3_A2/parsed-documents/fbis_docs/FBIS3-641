South Africa's Ambassador Tjaart van der Walt told SAPA he had spoken at about 6.30pm to President Mangope, who said he was going to his country residence at Motsepi. "I have not contacted him there yet," the Dr van der Walt. [sentence as received] In another development, the Freedom Alliance said on Thursday it was suspending negotiations with the South African Government and the African National Congress [ANC] to protest against the ANC's involvement in upheavals in Bophuthatswana. "The leaders of the Freedom Alliance have therefore decided that all negotiations, mediation, submission of (election) candidate lists and efforts by the Freedom Alliance to rejoin the process will be stopped forthwith until the ANC has stopped the action in Bophuthatswana," Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader General Constand Viljoen said in a statement. Waving ANC and SA Communist Party placards, thousands of people took to the streets of Mmabatho on Thursday, apparently spurred by a march by about 300 policemen to the SA Embassy to demand reincorporation of Bophuthatswna into South Africa. Later in the afternoon there were reports homeland police had gone on strike. Homeland soldiers fired teargas at thousands of protesters who stormed and looted the Megacity shopping complex in Mmabatho. The soldiers later surrounded the complex to keep the looters at bay. Also on Thursday evening protesters set fire to a general store in Mmabatho belonging to the homeland's police chief, General PJ Seleke. The store is near the University of Bophuthatswana where students have clashed with police in the past few days. "They opened the gas taps and threw a match into the store and it just went up," one of the people outside blazing building told SAPA.
