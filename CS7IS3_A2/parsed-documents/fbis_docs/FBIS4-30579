The evening newspaper reported from China's Jilin Province that border trade between Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and North Korea, mostly barter trade, came to only 80,440 U.S. dollars in January-May, nosediving 46.1 percent from the same period last year. The volume is only 15.5 percent of this year's goal, the paper quoted Kim Chong-su, chairman of the prefecture's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission, as saying. Yanbian's exports to North Korea amounted to 22.59 million dollars in the cited period, down 72.4 percent from the same months last year and reaching only 8.7 percent of this year's goal. The paper attributed the unprecedented decrease in border trade to global economic pressure on Pyongyang caused by the controversy over its nuclear program, North Korea's shortage of commodities and energy, poor crops and nonfulfillment of trade contacts. The paper said Beijing has been studying ways to prevent possible unease along the Chinese-North Korean border, noting that economic pressure by the international community could create problems.
