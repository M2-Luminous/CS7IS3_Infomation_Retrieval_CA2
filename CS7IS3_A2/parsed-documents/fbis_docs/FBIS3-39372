Scalfaro also met with Italian Republican Party [PRI] secretary [Giorgio] La Malfa. Berlusconi told journalists that while his movement was viable on its own, out of necessity it was obliged to enter into alliances with other parties: i.e. [Umberto] Bossi [Northern League], [Gianfranco] Fini [National Alliance-Italian Social Movement], and the former Christian Democrats of the Christian Democratic Center Party. [Begin Berlusconi recording] Obviously, certain alliances can result in lost votes. We hope that voters understand, and we hope to be able to explain to them that it was in the higher interest of the nation that we entered into these alliances, along with the need to add to certain lists [of candidates] the names of the leaders and protagonists of some movements with which we are allied. [sentence as heard]. [end recording]
