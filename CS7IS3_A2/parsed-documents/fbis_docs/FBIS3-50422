The prime minister dismissed Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec, about which Mr. Kawalec learned from the radio. The superior of the dismissed minister--Marek Borowski, finance minister and deputy prime minister--whose motion would be needed to bring about a dismissal like this, addressed a question to the prime minister on the reasons behind the dismissal. In reply, PAP received a communique issued by the Government's Press Office to the effect that Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec's dismissal is not linked to the privatization of Bank Slaski, whereas the real reasons were not given either to the press or to Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. All the prime minister's press secretary had to say is that there he has no comment on the issue. Politics require the courage to tell the truth directly, even when it is about decisions which were hard to make. The prime minister has asked the press to report honestly, but what he is doing now is condemning journalists for speculating and expressing views on what could be described as a weird style of governing, to put it mildly. So, faced with deficiencies in the government's information policies and with a lack of explanations which the public expects, one is entitled to draw different kinds of conclusions on, for instance, possible frictions within the coalition, a battle between the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance, mutual disloyalties among different cabinet members who talk to one another through journalists, who--as they often stress--they distrust, or about facing coalition partners with accomplished facts, which is not the first time this has happened.
