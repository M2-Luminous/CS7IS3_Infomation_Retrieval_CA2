Closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting, which has been in session in Havana since Tuesday, the topmost leader of the revolution recalled it was said in a great forum held in Havana in 1985 that this debt could not be collected and could not be paid off. He said: Our continent has lost the better part of this great battle. We are being charged in ever increasing amounts. He recalled that when the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959 Latin America's debt was very small, and now it amounts to $500 billion. He said our countries' basic products had a certain value in the world market at that time. The current great technologies have gradually displaced them. To illustrate, he said sugar has been substituted by substances like isoglucose [isoglucosa], extracted from corn and whose sweetening power is greater than that of beet and cane sugar. Castro spoke at the plenum in the presence of more than 1,000 delegates from 32 countries.
