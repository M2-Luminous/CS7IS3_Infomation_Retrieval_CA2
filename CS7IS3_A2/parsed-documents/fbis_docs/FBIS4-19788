In the letter, Andreatta recalled recent bilateral consultations in Budapest and underscored the urgent need to see to it that all the efforts of the entire international community converge so as to head off the humanitarian catastrophe that United Nations' bodies in Bosnia are warning of. The immediate goal to pursue, he said, was a cease-fire coupled with the withdrawal to a sufficient distance of Serbian troops from the city of Gorazde. Furthermore, maximum impetus must be given to efforts to get negotiations underway lest they lose both their credibility and effectiveness, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. The Serbian side, too, should be aware of this and "we count heavily on Russian influence to make this happen," Andreatta said in the message. At this point, the Italian minister reminded his Russian counterpart of Italy's commitment to the search of suitable formulas to charge up the process of international consultations, starting with the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "A process which should reflect substantial, decisive contributions," and to which the Russian Federation, "with its prestige and its political weight", could greatly contribute, he said.
