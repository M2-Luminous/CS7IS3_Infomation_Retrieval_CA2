The agency expects the group to help make unilateral military technology transfer between the two countries reciprocal, the officials said. The first meeting of the "technology management group" will be held in Washington in July. The group will be set up under the Japan-U.S. Systems and Technology Forum, the officials said. The group, expected to establish a "basic rule" for bilateral military technology exchange for the first time, will determine the types of general-purpose technology suitable for such exchange by the end of the year. The officials said both nations will protect intellectual rights when private interests are involved in military technology transfers, by paying attention to the laws of each nation and its independent policies, so that technology procurement will be made on a commercial basis. The United States has already shown interest in such Japanese technology as new materials and electronics, they said. In 1983, Japan decided to open the way for transferal of military technology to the U.S. as an exception to its principle of banning arms export.
