The paper began publishing in October 1993 with Haykazn Ghahriyan as editor-in-chief and Tadeos Khachatryan as editor. At first glance, that is from the standpoint of presentation, the paper owes much to artistic editor Artur Ghandilyan whose page layout makes the paper attractive. This point needs mentioning given that the Armenian press pays little attention to page layout which comes on the top of poor paper and ink quality which makes their output virtually unreadable. In addition, LRAGIR is one of the few Armenian papers that publishes material worth reading. Most papers carry articles that often echo anachronistic ideas in a multicolumn format which tires the reader. LRAGIR's articles and analyses indicate that an effort has been made to keep them brief, a quality that is much sought but rarely found in Armenia's papers. With serious and independent reporting added to these attributes, one gets a daily which has been missed by many for so long. Another factor that distinguishes LRAGIR is that it writes about the Diaspora more than any other paper in Armenia. Its recent issues in particular (late January and early February) carried several articles on the Diaspora. For example, the paper's 29 January issue carries an unsigned article entitled "The Armenian Diaspora: The Era of Parties is Fading." The article subjects the political life of the Armenian diaspora, with its organizations, factions and future outlook, to a detailed and accurate analysis. [passage omitted] LRAGIR continues its interest in the Diaspora with reports about Diaspora assistance to Armenia in its 1 and 2 February issues. The first article by Vahe Tondrakyan is entitled "Diaspora's Current Assistance to Armenia" and subtitled "Aid Declines Steadily." The second article by Hayk Mesropyan is entitled "Armenia an International Beggar" and subtitled "The Diaspora and Humanitarian Aid." Both article are shorter than the political analysis of the Diaspora. The first article briefly enumerates the assistance provided by the largest Diaspora organizations and says that this aid began with the earthquake [of 1988] and has been declining steadily. Tondrakyan writes that after creating branches and press organs in Armenia, Diaspora organizations thought their work was done. He describes assistance by political parties as a "supply of financial and technical means for information and press dissemination to their sister organizations." Although interesting, the views of the writer are difficult to debate in today's conditions. Those views are summarized in the following paragraph: "It is becoming steadily clear that the Diaspora's assistance to Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is only temporary and that in the future it is the latter that must help the Diaspora." Hayk Mesropyan's article contains even sharper points. After stating that "today Armenia has earned the reputation of being an international beggar," he continues with evident bitterness: "What is most painful is that our Diaspora brethren also have the same disrespectful attitude toward Armenia."
