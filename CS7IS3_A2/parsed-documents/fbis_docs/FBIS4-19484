Security Council, progress can be expected towards a Cyprus settlement. Receiving the credentials of the first ever South African ambassador to Cyprus, Paul K. Coetzee, the president referred in great detail to the developments of the Cyprus problem. "In our effort to break the deadlock caused by the Turkish side," he said, "we responded favourably to the initiative of the U.N. secretary general and held proximity talks on the confidence building measures (CBM's)." The president noted that the Turkish side tried, however, to exploit the procedure of the talks and to secure political advantages contrary to the guidelines set forth by the secretary general at the beginning of the process. "The Turkish side proved that it lacks the political will to reach an agreement even on the CBM's, let alone on the substance of the Cyprus problem. As was the case in the last 20 years, the Turkish side frustrated once again all efforts to reach an agreement," he said. President Kliridhis stressed "we believe that the time has come for the security council to consider alternative ways to promote the effective implementation of its numerous decisions on Cyprus." He continued: "It is my firm conviction that only through result-oriented approach by the Security Council we can expect to see progress towards a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem." Referring to the accreditation to Cyprus of the first South African diplomat and Cyprus' decision to establish a consulate general in Johannesburg, the president said these actions were "indicative of our common desire to promote and strengthen our bilateral relations." The presence in South Africa of a considerable number of South Africans of Cypriot origin, who actively and constructively participate in South Africa's national life, constituted an additional bond of friendship between the two peoples, he added. Presenting his credentials, Coetzee said that "South Africa supports the prospect for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the situation that your country is facing." Referring to the thriving Cypriot-South African community, the diplomat said that ``these expatriates from Cyprus have contributed their rich and refined cultural heritage together with an immense and active idealism to their new country and have become respected, prominent and successful citizens of my country. ``In many instances they, together with others, have through the years forged solid business and other ties between our countries. The establishment of bilateral relations between our two countries is bound, however, to expand these relations substantially,'' he added.
