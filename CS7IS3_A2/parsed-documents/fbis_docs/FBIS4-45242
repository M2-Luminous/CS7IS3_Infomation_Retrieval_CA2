Mcllroy: "Cocaine Haul Worth £250m Discovered in Tar Drums"] [Text] The biggest seizure of hard drugs in Britain with a street value of £250 million has been found in 47 drums of bitumen being shipped from South America to Poland. The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were discovered by customs officers who searched a tramp steamer calling at Birkenhead, Merseyside, three months ago. Customs in Britain and Poland did not announce the find until yesterday so that an undercover operation could track the drugs to their destination. Officers acting on intelligence reports boarded the Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which had berthed at Liverpool on Jan 24 en route from Venezuela to Poland to unload some legitimate cargo. They examined 48 barrels carrying bitumen, calling on Merseyside fire brigade to send crews with special cutting equipment to open the drums. Mr Douglas Tweedle, Customs chief investigator, said: "The first one was genuine, but that did not put us off. The other 47 had inner containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine, all insulated to protect the cocaine from the heat of the bitumen. "The cocaine was removed and identical drums were loaded on board Jurata which then sailed on schedule for the Polish port of Gdynia." Mr Tweedle said there had been no reason to suspect the captain and crew knew about the illegal cargo. The vessel was tracked to Gdynia in the hope of identifying the smugglers, who he said were believed to be members of the Polish Mafia. One man was being interviewed by Polish police after the drums were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw on Feb 3. But so far customs officers have not been able to identify the Western European figures behind the deal and there had been no arrests. Merseyside customs officers were acting on intelligence provided by the service's strategic branch in London, which said it was engaged in a constant war against "narco baron" traffickers. These traffickers were taking advantage of the collapse of the former Soviet Union to smuggle drugs from South America into Western Europe through the back door--through places like Poland and Russia "whose customs services are not particularly well developed."
