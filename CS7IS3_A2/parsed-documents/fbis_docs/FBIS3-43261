Johan Burger, chief of Negotiation Strategy in the South African Police Force's Community Relations Department, by Andriette Stofberg: "Col. Johan Burger Is Not Afraid To Speak His Mind: Police Force Must Be Demilitarized Soon"; place and date not given] [Text] "Today we bravely say things which would have been unthinkable a few years ago. I believe that it is to our advantage that this has become possible." Colonel Johan Burger does not seem like such a "liberal" police man. Sitting behind his desk in Pretoria, he looks just like any other very ordinary policeman. It is only that this chief of negotiation strategy within the Community Relations Department has quietly acquired a reputation within and outside the police force as someone who is not afraid to say things which used to be better left unsaid. When in 1971, as a very young policeman, he was hunting terrorists far away in the Caprivi strip, he did not have too much to say. He did not even ask questions. Besides, like so many other policemen there, he did not even know who or what SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] was. "We did not receive any political training. We were not politically aware. We were only taught that we were there to shoot terrorists. We did not know what they stood for. We only knew that they were in the process of causing some kind of drama or other." Then came the disturbances of 1976. The small seed, which would lead to his starting to ask questions, was sowed. He was a member of the riot squads. "I imagined myself in the shoes of the black men, and wondered how I would have felt if Afrikaans had been forced upon me." In 1982, when he was riding around in Owambo "with a Casspir and a gun," he started asking questions in earnest. About such things as why the police force had moved so far away from its traditional role of a doctrine of "search and take into custody," after having so successfully made the military "search and destroy" doctrine of a semimilitary organization its own. One of the results of these questions was a Master of Strategic Studies dissertation last year at UNISA [University of South Africa] about the role of the police in counterinsurgency in Namibia. He believes that it is necessary for the police force to become demilitarized as soon as possible and that it must once again become a civilian police force. The military character of the police force has developed over many years--first through participation in two world wars and then in the counterinsurgency war along the border. "I believe that we should have withdrawn sooner as the struggle became more military in character. Of course, the police force has a role to play in counterinsurgency actions. But there comes a point when the involvement of the military becomes so great that they should play the primary role. Then the police force must stand back." "What has happened in our country is that instead of the police force standing back, we joined. Sometimes we were more soldiers than the soldiers themselves." "This inherently created problems for us. Take a policeman who had returned from the border and had to come to police the townships, can you imagine what his approach was? After all, he had been conditioned like a soldier." "Now we must change our own approach to our own culture. And this is hard to accept for many policemen--given the pride we have in our history. However, the question remains: was it good for us to have become militarily involved to such an extent? Is this the right kind of background to have for normal policing work?" "We have been trained like a semimilitary organization. In addition to the fact that South Africa has never had a culture of human rights in its constitution or in any other laws, we did not have this in the police force either. We are the product of our own society." "Now that society is changing, we must recognize that we must do the same thing. We are already in the process of implementing major changes. An international team of experts is helping us to adjust our training, with a particular emphasis on the new community policing approach, and also because we need a better under standing of negotiating tactics to defuse situations--that the guys should not be so quick to turn to violence." Like any other people in the country, policemen must find their bearings within the changes which are taking place in the national and other arenas. As part of his job, Col. Burger has developed a consequence leap model which he uses in informational sessions to try to explain to policemen all over the country how the national negotiations affect the Police force. "It says to the guys on the other side of the negotiation process that there will stil be a South Africa, there will still be a police force, there will still be a structure, there will still be laws. Things will just look a little different. You have to make a psychological leap to that point from where you are now. Then things will not seem so confusing to you and you will large ly lose your fear of the future." "Of course, you will still be uncertain because nobody can see into the future. But you have to realize that it will be incredibly difficult for you, if not impossible, to be physically a policeman in the new South Africa if psychologically you have remained behind in the old South Africa." He talks about the major confidence crisis which exists between the police and primarily the black community. "Take such factors as the so-called apartheid heritage. Nobody argues about it anymore: apartheid had certain negative consequences and the police force was not untouched by them. We have had a certain power approach within the police force. I do not mean all policemen, but in many cases policemen did not have any interest in the community, especially not the black community." "We simply used the approach that this is what the law said, the law was rigidly enforced and we did not tolerate any opposition. Good relations were not important to us. What was important was to enforce the law as it stood." "Opposition to this also hardened the policemen's disposition. Later on, we no longer had any sympathy for the victims of cer tain laws--however unfair they may have been--because for us it was a question of doing a job that had to be done." The hardening of feelings on both sides between the community and the police force led to alienation. After February 1990, however, the police began to realize that they had to reach out to heal the alienation. "But this goes together with the legitimacy of the government. As long as we do not have a legitimate government, the police force cannot be legitimate." "Legitimacy is defined by the whole population of a nation. The police force is currently not legitimate because today's government, of which we are an extension, only represents part of the population. If the body is dead, there is no way an arm can be alive." "We are trying, through the community policing approach, to achieve a greater degree of acceptance. But this is only secondary. All these positive things will not mean a thing until the government itself, the primary source, has achieved legitimacy."
