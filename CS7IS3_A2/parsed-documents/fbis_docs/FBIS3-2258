The world's industrial nations are finding it hard to get people back to work. Employment, described by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a recent report as in a "global crisis" far more serious than the economic problem in the 1980s, has become a persistent headache in the West. "Unemployment, not inflation is the main threat." This is the message of the 23 union representatives which gathered at the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations] headquarters last week, urging for a "global new deal" to help the jobless. Any diagnosis to share? That's what the Clinton administration is talking about in preparing the much-taunted jobs summit of the group of seven nations, to be held a week from today in Detroit, Michigan. "These countries are different. We are aiming not so much for a communique or an agreed-upon set of actions," said Labor Secretary Robert Reich last week. "We wish to share different kind of solutions." "What's important to the United States is to get the rest of the industrialized world growing," said Alan Blinder, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers today, predicting the summit "a huge success." The G-7 jobs summit, proposed by President Clinton in July and originally scheduled for last autumn, gathers the labor, finance, social service ministers from the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, the latter five all posting double digit jobless rates. With America's jobless rate dipping from 7.7 percent a year ago to 6.5 percent in February, the White House is busy claiming credit for the two million jobs added to the nation's payroll in the last 13 months. U.S. officials, however, may find the American experience in job creation, coming along in the wake of stable economic recovery, good but irrelevant for the depressed labor market in Western Europe. "I would doubt that the Europeans are very enthusiastic about the jobs summit," said Peter Richards, a Geneva-based ILO economist, in an interview. "They see the problem very much on their own." Practically half of the 35 million unemployed in Western Europe have been off payrolls for a year or more, due to technological changes, widening economic competition and normal movement of economic cycle. Observers noted that in Western Europe, only the United Kingdom now appears a bit optimistic in the overall employment picture, while unemployment is regarded as the most difficult to solve in Germany and France. In the U.S., 8.5 million people are registered as out of work. 4.5 million work part-time and say they would like to have full-time jobs. Another half million Americans are too discouraged to look for work. "When it comes to jobs, we want to create two million more in 1994," President Clinton said over the weekend, pledging to boost the country's exports, one billion U.S. dollars of which will create 20,000 jobs. This week, the administration is scheduled to introduce the reemployment act of 1994, in order to bring the U.S. job training programs into the 21st Century and replace the entire existing unemployment system. The proposed one-stop shopping centers, officials said, will link job search with training. People can get job search help, data on the next possible jobs as well as the trainings to get the job in a single place. The U.S. and Europe, observers said, face two completely different problems in employment. Europe, with high jobless rate, witnesses steady rise in the income of its workers, while the U.S., despite its dropping jobless rate, suffers from declining wages. In Europe, it is the unions not the corporate mangers that have the final say in keeping a worker or not, and there is almost no or very little flexibility in the labor market there, especially in Germany. Americans are another case. Workers are increasingly worried since their bosses do not make layoff announcement until the last minute, making them ill prepared for the change or disappearance of jobs. "The responsibility of the G-7 must be to initiate a profound change in direction of international economic policy, to get rid of the free market approach and become pragmatic," said John Evans, general secretary of OECD's Trade Union Advisory Committee.
