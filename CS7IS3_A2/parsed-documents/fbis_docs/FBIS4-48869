FBIS4-48869 "drafr104_e_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Government on Reconciliation, Opposition Groups Government on Reconciliation, Opposition Groups AB2705201094 Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1800 GMT 27 May 94 AB2705201094 Lagos Radio Nigeria Network English BFN [Text] The Federal Government has advised critics of the administration not to take its posture of reconciliation as a sign of weakness. Briefing State House correspondents in Abuja, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya said government believed that the situation in the country required restraint by everyone. The chief of general staff also spoke on some other crucial issues including the interpretations the media gave to the statement he made on corruption. State House correspondent Haruna Idriss has the details. [Begin recording] [Idriss] The chief of general staff said the constitutional conference is an avenue for all Nigerians to come together and discuss the future of the nation. He said government does not intend to tamper with resolutions of the conference. [Diya] We are prepared to subject ourselves to the will of the people. The desire of the people must prevail because this is a military regime and a military regime cannot say that it is wiser than the body of men and women who will come and discuss the problems of this country. You see, the only way I can answer this question is to propose that the decision will be in the interest of the people of this country, help its unity and preserve the territorial integrity of this country. As long as they are along these lines, the decisions of the conference will be very, very much respected. [Idriss] On the various groups which have issued ultimata to government, Gen. Diya said government does not recognize such groups but tolerates them as individuals in the spirit of national reconciliation. Government, he said, is prepared to listen to reasonable demand but will deal with any group planning an insurrection against government. Gen. Diya also spoke on the issue of June 12 which he said was a national issue. [Diya] It's a national problem. It's a national issue. We feel it's a national problem, and I think it will be wrong for any individual with partisan interest or any group of people to say it is their problem. It's a national problem. In fact, the government itself is an offspring of June 12. If the election itself had not been nullified, the government would not have been in place. [Idriss] The briefing which was attended by principal officers of the general headquarters will now be a regular affair. [end recording]
