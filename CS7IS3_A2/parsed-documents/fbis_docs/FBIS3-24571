Shepilko; UDC 537.877.01] [Abstract] The numerous inhomogeneities which characterize real complex obstacles and distinguish them from circular cylinders and make it difficult to simulate them by a circular cylinder irradiated with an electromagnetic wave, i.e., a longitudinal recess or a sectorial cut, necessitated an analysis of the backscattering cross section on the basis of a strict solution of the problem of electromagnetic wave field scattering by a circular infinitely long cylinder with a sectorial cut and by a sectorial cylinder which may be used for simulating a bilocal polygon; it is assumed that the cylinder is a perfect conductor with an exp(-i_o_t) behavior. The problem is solved in a _r_, ï¿½, z cylindrical system of coordinates; the dependence of the sectorial cylinder's backscattering coefficient on the relative diameter and angular cut dimension for E and H-polarization is plotted. The findings are compared to a plane tape and circular cylinder, and it is shown that the effect of the cut depends on the wave polarization; this is manifested by the oscillating behavior of backscattering.
