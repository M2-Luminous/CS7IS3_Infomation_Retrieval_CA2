Russian Naval Captain Gennadiy Vorobyev, deputy head of the radiation and chemical security department, told ITAR-TASS on Monday that during the month-long expedition, Russian, Japanese and South Korean scientists took samples of sea water from their base onboard the research ship "Okean", which belongs to the Russian federal hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring service. The expedition's work was prompted by the worries of several countries in the region that the dumping of radioactive materials in the Sea of Japan by the Russian Pacific Fleet in October, 1993, might lead to higher radiation levels.
