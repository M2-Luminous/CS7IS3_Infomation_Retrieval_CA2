"If the CDA becomes the biggest party and can supply the prime minister, it is `certainly' not obvious that the present vice prime minister will become minister again." This was stated by Kok during a series of discussions on the commercial stations RTL4 [Luxembourg Radio and Television] and RTL5 between the leaders of the four major parties. He answered evasively to the question whether, in that case, he would become floor leader in the Lower House. Kok has already stated in the past that he and Brinkman are "not the most likely royal couple." [passage omitted] A poll conducted by Interview revealed that PvdA leader Kok is the interviewees' favorite prime minister. Kok is chosen by 34 percent, Van Mierlo by 20 percent, Brinkman scores 18 percent, while Bolkestein gets merely 12 percent. The interviewees have an increasing preference for a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA, the D66 [Democrats 66], and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Last time, a coalition of the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 still scored highest with 18.9 percent. The "purple" coalition gained 5 percent, and has now taken the lead with 21 percent. A cabinet comprising the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 has now become second choice.
