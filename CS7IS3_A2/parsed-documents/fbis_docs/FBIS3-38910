Denktas, evaluating EU's message to Greek Cypriots which said if the concerned sides reach an agreement, pre-studies will begin on Cyprus' membership to the EU, said the two sides living in Cyprus should hold separate referendums on the issue and should apply for the Union's membership. Denktas answering questions on the issue said accepting Greek Cypriots as the responsible "nation" was a mistake adding that the whole Cyprus cannot enter to EU before an agreement between the two sides.
