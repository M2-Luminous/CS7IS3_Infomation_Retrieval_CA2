Li Tieying, state councillor and member of the Political Bureau; and Kentaro Kiniwa, deputy director-general of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, cut ribbons and praised the project as a typical example of the successful cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese Governments, as well as between the two countries' entrepreneurial circles. First Project To Develop Whole Stretch of Land The Dalian Industrial Park is situated in the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is the first project in which Japanese enterprises are developing a whole stretch of land in China; in fact, it is the first project in which a whole stretch of land is being developed in Dalian and even in China. The Chinese side makes up the management committee overseeing the Dalian Development Zone, and the Japanese side forms the committee overseeing the projects in the Dalian Industrial Park (this committee is made up of 22 Japanese enterprises, including C. Itoh, Mitsubishi, Marubeni Corporation, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo). Both sides have established the joint-venture Dalian Industrial Park Management Company, which makes a total investment of $65 million, of which the Chinese side contributes 20 percent and the Japanese side 80 percent. The Chinese side's investment is in the form of the roads leading to the park, while the Japanese side has contributed hard currency. The operation period is 50 years, and the joint-venture company will buy 2.169 square km of land from the Dalian Development Zone Management Committee for its use; this land will primarily be transferred to the Japanese side. China and Japan Carefully Study Feasibility The concept of the project was first proposed by the Japan-China Association for the Development of the Northeast during its visit to Dalian in February 1988 with the idea of creating an overseas industrial park for Japan's medium-size and small enterprises who seek to invest. In 1989, Japan's C. Itoh Commercial Company, the Bank of Tokyo, and the Marubeni Corporation expressed their intent of cooperation to the Dalian Development Zone; in December of the same year, as a result of the coordination by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the five establishments of C. Itoh, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo formed a close union to establish the Committee Overseeing Projects in the Dalian Industrial Park and to join forces to promote the undertaking. Thereafter, the project was upgraded to an international investment project with active support from the Japanese Government. The committee inspected the investment environment in the Dalian Development Zone and carried out research on related matters, leading to a feasibility report on the joint development of the Dalian Industrial Park. Hence, the committee joined hands with 22 influential large companies, enterprises, and financial institutions in Japan to found Dalian Industrial Park Company Limited, and former Prime Minister Takeshita attended the founding ceremony. In early 1992, the draft of the agreement on developing a whole stretch of land in Dalian Industrial Park was signed in Tokyo. In 1992, at the State Council's 101st executive meeting, which was presided over by Premier Li Peng, the feasibility report on the Dalian Industrial Park project was discussed and passed. On 5 October the same year, the official agreement was signed in Beijing, and Vice Premier Tian Jiyun attended the signing ceremony. Substantive Progress in Canvassing Businesses and Funds Since 19 October 1992, projects involving 1.4 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed, 6.5 km of roads have been built, some pipes and cables have been laid, four power switching stations have been erected, two heat-suppling boiler rooms and one heat exchange station have been constructed, and all are of high quality. The work in canvassing businesses and funds has also made substantive progress. More than 300 enterprises specializing in machinery, electric appliances, chemical industry, and clothing have come to inspect the area and negotiate contracts, and a large number of well-known enterprises have come to inspect the projects in the industrial park, including Yamatake Honeywell Company Limited, Fuji Electric Company Limited, Toto Limited, and Konica, which are listed among the "world's 500 largest industrial enterprises" by "FORTUNE" magazine. Technologically advanced companies such as the (Namuko) Company and Takara Shuzo Company Limited, which are the pioneers in integrated circuit and genetic engineering, have also come on inspection visits. Reports have indicated that 27 enterprises have now received approval to enter the park, and their investments amount to $200 million. Seven of the enterprises have begun work, and it is estimated that the land allocated for enterprises this year will reach 60 percent of the total area. Finally, the park is expected to attract a total of 100 enterprises and over $600 million in investment.
