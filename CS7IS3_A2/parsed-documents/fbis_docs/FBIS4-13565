A senior Army element has said: It is evident even now that the training plan is not being carried out, and the crack infantry units' training has been "significantly impaired" by the operational activities in Hebron and elsewhere in the territories. In recent days, top IDF echelons have voiced great concern over the fact that dozens of elite infantry companies had been taken off the training schedule and dispatched to the territories, primarily to protect local Jews. The problem encompasses companies from the entire Infantry Corps. Many companies are busy safeguarding the existence of the closure on the "divide" between the territories and Israel. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who has been recently informed about damage to the training plan, said yesterday that "the work load of the regular troops in the territories is immense." He added that this year soldiers and reservists will again share the load. A senior military figure said yesterday: "We expected a significant decrease in the reserve units' work load, but we could not foresee the Hebron massacre and the ensuing wave of terror attacks which tied the regular army up in routine security tasks at the expense of training. We must ensure the regular troops' combat readiness, and therefore, we have to call up reservists." Last month, numerous reserve units replaced regular troops in the territories. Many of these units were called up on short notice on speedy call-up procedures. The senior military source added: "Even now I know our training plan will be seriously affected, and this must be averted despite the IDF's duty to continually take care of routine security." To ease the reserve troops' work load, the IDF plans to establish guard and security units, but this plan is unlikely to ease the infantry and armored units' work load at this stage. Thus they will again serve dozens of reserve duty days this year, and they will serve them in the territories.
