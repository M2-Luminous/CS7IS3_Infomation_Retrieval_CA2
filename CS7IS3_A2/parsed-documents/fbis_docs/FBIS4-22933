Today, due to the shortage of funds, this is impossible. However, the acute problem arises, under conditions of economic decline, of preserving the best part of the scientific and technical potential of Russia and at the same time adapting it to the requirements of a market economy. Accordingly, the priorities in the development of science and technology are clearly defined. First and foremost among these are production technologies and new materials, information science and communications, power engineering and transportation, biology, ecology, and space. We are seemingly implementing the priority policy at three levels. The first is state scientific and technical programs. Forty-one such programs have been drawn up and implemented, within whose framework 117 priority technologies and new types of production will be introduced. In addition, priorities have been defined among scientific institutions. These are what we today call state scientific centers. This is the second level. After the entire old (ministerial) control system had collapsed, the branch scientific research institutes found themselves in a most difficult situation, especially those in the defense sector. The danger appeared of their complete loss due to the fact that the ordinary sources of funding had disappeared. Today 33 state scientific centers are therefore being funded, these including 55 organizations and enterprises, which is making it possible to preserve key national scientific schools in the high technologies field. These include the group of aviation centers headed by the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute, five nuclear groups headed by the Kurchatov Institute, shipbuilding, electronics, chemical, and other groups. Finally, there are priorities at the level of small research bodies and laboratories, which, in academic science, for example, has been realized through the Fundamental Research Fund, already established in 1992. Reference is to the development of new organizational forms of innovative activity: business incubators, industrial parks, etc. For this purpose a special decree of the government has established a fund which is designated for support of small entrepreneurship in the scientific and technical field, also including the financial field. Most importantly--promising projects with a heavy scientific orientation have been initiated. However, the situation in the scientific and technical sphere is deteriorating. Science, as before, is being funded on the residual principal: during 1993 the funding of civilian scientific research and experimental-design work was only 72.9% of the planned annual amount; scientific organizations thus did not receive about 300 billion rubles. It is true that in the ``scientific budget'' proper there are some interesting ``internal'' peculiarities. To be sure, everyone has suffered. But they have lacked to an unequal degree. The academic-university sector received approximately 82% of the planned sums and the Russian Academy of Sciences a little more than 84% and its departments also received different percentages: Far Eastern--88%, Ural--81%. Incidentally, here there is some confusion which sometimes bursts onto the pages of newspapers: why does the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy not give the Academy of Sciences money? The fact is that the Russian Academy of Sciences (and also the Academies of Medical or Agricultural Sciences) has its own item in the federal budget and receives money independently. What is true is that the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy is funding only priority scientific and technical fields. The most important of these are state scientific and technical programs, international and regional projects. We also have a program for assistance to the innovative sphere: business incubators, commercial and industrial insurance policies, industrial parks, of which there already are about 30. This program today is being separated off into a separate program and we have succeeded in creating (as I have said, a government decree has already been issued) a special individual fund which will support this program, assist inventors and new structures to get on their feet and to turn projects into realities. However, our ministry has received only 59% of the planned funding. Who are the favorites? The space program: it has been allocated 148% of that planned by the budget. I do not regard such a situation to be entirely normal. Unfortunately, it is now not impossible that space also will soon experience the negative consequences of such a policy. Because if we no not develop electronics, chemistry, and new construction materials which are ``stagnating'' under other programs, after 3-5 years we will exhaust the substantial advances which today are working for the space program. Accordingly, corrections are unquestionably necessary here. Such disproportions cannot but be reflected in the fates of scientists and specialists. The trend of a continuous reduction in the scientific work force, beginning in 1991, also is persisting in 1993, and at rates outpacing the numbers in the economy. The prestige of scientific work has fallen. Including because of the low wages, which in November 1993 were 38% below the average for the economy. The percentage of university graduates linking their career to scientific work is declining. Thus, not only the personnel potential of Russian science is decreasing, but also the possibilities of its reproduction. The ``brain drain'' problem has grown appreciably worse. As indicated by the beginning of the year, the situation not only is not improving, but instead is worsening. And this is related to a considerable degree to energy prices. After they had ``retreated'' in the autumn, they rose sharply and by the end of the year many scientific centers had suffered seriously. For example, the High-Energy Physics Institute at Protvino, where the accelerator for just one session (and that for 2-3 weeks) requires so much power that the bill is in the billions. There are a great many other power-hungry enterprises, especially those in the chemical industry. In general, the situation is as follows: whereas earlier the expenditures for power were 7-10% of the budget, at a number of institutes they have now risen to 60% or more. Since no improvements are foreseen here, we have raised the question of a reduction of electric power rates for budgeted organizations. As well as on the indexing of expenditures on goods and materials. Because today the situation has taken on a near-catastrophic character: we pay little more than a meager wage, we light and heat facilities, and that's it. There is no money for carrying out scientific research (instruments, equipment, reagents, etc.). Meanwhile January-February showed: from the Ministry of Finance we received from 27 to 40% of the planned amount. The situation with funding, I repeat, not only has not stabilized, but also continues to deteriorate. However, despite the difficult situation in the country, the scientific and technical potential of Russia remains extremely strong. Many of our country's research and development projects are not simply competitive in the West, but sometimes are above and beyond the world level. Russia retains parity in such fields as power engineering, new materials, chemical technologies, genetics, and others. It is a shame that the existing achievements are being put to practical use slowly. For example, up to 30-40% of the development work of scientific organizations in the agricultural field are finding no application at all in production and the genetic potential of varieties and hybrids of agricultural crops and breeds of animals is being used no more than 60%. And what do we see as our principal goals in the immediate future? An individual item was introduced in the budget for a program for maintaining the largest national instruments--telescopes, experimental reactors, etc. This ``forces'' institutes to use this expensive equipment for its intended purpose. We intend to shift the emphasis from the macro- to the micro-level. Several funds have been established for broadening the possibilities of choosing funding sources for scientific institutions and scientific workers. Today we are convinced that the principal problem is the micro-level: it is necessary to decide what to do within a scientific institution under the prevailing conditions. One of the methods for implementing the priorities is a changeover to a contract hiring system. The principal obstacle is the archaic and conservative Labor Law Code. But meanwhile precisely a contract will make it possible to pay people for their work, not for the job which they fill. The second acute problem: what in general to do with the network of scientific institutions? Today there is a clear-cut answer: categorically refuse to support from the budget those scientific structures, those scientific organizations which are unneeded by the state. The state must support fundamental science, which, incidentally, is by no means the case in all countries. It developed in Russia, it is our national tradition, it must be preserved, and we are doing everything possible for this. We will be able to maintain activity in a number of fund-hungry fields only, as we say, in a ``monitoring mode.'' This is necessary in order to keep an eye on the world level, and if, speaking figuratively, a ``supernova'' flares up, if some promising research field takes form, we can immediately jump in on its development, there could be ``nuclei'' on the basis of which new creative teams could be organized. But we acknowledge that the maintenance of all fields at the state level is today unrealistic. We also will insist on such an aspect as keeping in contact with industry. We will develop a program for state scientific centers. Today, as I already mentioned, we are funding 33, and another 217 are standing ``in line.'' Some of them are entirely worthy of support, but we cannot include in this pool more than a score of new centers. We also will strive to establish a State Fund for Research in the Humanities.
