According to the Economics Association for Oil and Natural Gas Production (WEG), the structural disadvantages of domestic production are having a greater effect now in view of the decline of international prices for oil. In this sector, all companies are showing very high deficits, said Gerd Eichhorn, chairman of the WEG Board of Directors. In 1993, approximately 3.1 million tonnes of oil were produced from domestic reservoirs, which is 7.6 percent less than the year before. Among other things, this was due to the early closing of 15 fields and wells, which had become unprofitable. Meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the 2,940 usable production wells have been closed. This trend will continue this year with the planned closing of 12 oil fields. The situation is more favorable in natural gas production, which remained almost stable at 17.7 billion cubic meters. A total of 92 percent was produced in Lower Saxony and another 7 percent in Saxony-Anhalt. Domestic production contributes 22 percent to covering the domestic demand of natural gas. The most important suppliers are the CIS with a share of 32 percent, the Netherlands with 31 percent, and Norway with 14 percent. As in the case of oil (50.5 million tonnes, following 57 million tonnes), domestic natural gas reserves went down by 7.5 percent to 303 billion cubic meters. Eichhorn: "We are beginning to live off the substance." The need to reduce costs has not only lead to a further reduction of employees by approximately 1,000-8,000 on annual average. Expenditures for exploration and field development have also been reduced. One indication is the decline of drilling by 13 percent to a new record low of 70,600 meters. Utilization of drilling equipment is 62 percent. WEG harshly criticized the "completely insufficient" reduction of the production royalty on natural gas from 16 to 14 percent. It is certain that the revenues for natural gas will clearly shrink in 1994 in the course of adjustment to the prices for heating oil. This is one of the reasons why a "substantial reduction" of the production royalty (in 1993, 214 million marks) would have been useful to stimulate exploration. The liberalization of the European network of pipelines, which permits third parties to transfer gas through the country, is not acceptable either, it was said.
