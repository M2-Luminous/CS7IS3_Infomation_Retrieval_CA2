He said officials are doing their best in terms of suppression: [Begin recording] [Wimon] I would like to say this -- suppression alone cannot solve the problem of terrorism, regardless of the country. We must try to cut their external support, and we will only be able to cut external support by negotiating with those countries on a government-to-government basis. Meanwhile, local people and soldiers must cooperate in safeguarding public security and protecting natural resources along the border. [Unidentified correspondent] Was it an attempt to create confusion? [Wimon] There is no confirmation of that. I have only received a report on the incident. It is still too early to determine what group was responsible for this attempt. We have to wait for more information and more evidence. [end recording]
