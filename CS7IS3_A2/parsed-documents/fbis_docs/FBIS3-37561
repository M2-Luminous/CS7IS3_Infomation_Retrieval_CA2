Only yesterday the defense industry was the state's favorite, but today -- and this a highy intellectual industry as regards technology and specialists -- it is on the verge of collapse. Collapse is the very word, because in civilized countries a level of conversion of over 5-7 percent is already regarded as destructive. But in our country, in 1992 alone, it was almost 70 percent. This is despite the fact that 80 percent of the output of the military-industrial complex consists of civilian output and consumer goods. The workers in the defense sectors are on the brink of poverty and the enterprises themselves are on the brink of shutdown. The state owes the enterprises of the military-industrial complex some 2 trillion rubles. In the event of them shutting down the enterprises of many sectors will not receive unique materials. The defense industry will cease servicing military equipment in the forces and will stop the delivery of spare parts for military equipment abroad.
