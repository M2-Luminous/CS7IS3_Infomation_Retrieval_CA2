It also requested lines of credit "at preferential and promotional rates" for the Pymes [small- and medium-sized enterprises organization]. The industrialists indicated that these "medium- and long-term credit lines" are indispensable to guarantee the competitiveness of all sectors against third countries. During their meeting on 27 January at the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA) headquarters, the Mercosur Industrial Council -- which comprises the industrial organizations of the four Mercosur countries -- agreed to promote the preservation of the environment. The industrialists also evaluated the need for the government to ratify the sectorial agreements achieved so far and committed themselves to achieving a total consensus on this matter during the meeting to be held on 4 March in Montevideo, Uruguay. The businessmen lauded the task of the Mercosur Industrial Council, indicating that it is indispensable as a way to submit private policies to governments. "It legitimizes us as valid interlocutors," they stated, and asked the states to follow the example of the industrial sector. "No retooling is possible without an effort from the public sector," the industrialists stressed. They emphasized the need to grant loans to the Pymes, "which do not have access to long-term lines of credit." The second consensus pertains to the need to preserve the environment and agreement was reached on the need to "promote industrial production without endangering the environment, based on the principles of an economically sustained development." The last agreement foresees the creation of a work group to evaluate the Mercosur's negotiation guidelines with the other members of the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]. Within this framework, and regarding trade negotiations, the industrialists urged their governments to remain faithful to the objectives of the Treaty of Asuncion. During this second meeting of the Mercosur Industrial Council, the benefits and scope of Mercosur Resolution No. 13/93 -- which deals with the consolidation of Customs Union and transit within Mercosur -- were discussed. This measure "affirms the purpose of formalizing the Customs Union on 1 January 1995 as an essential step toward the organization of Mercosur." The measure was lauded by the industrialists, especially by UIA members who understood that the governments have acknowledged that the deadlines established at the beginning for integration were not appropriate. According to UIA spokespersons, the Customs Union "leaves the door open" to postpone the guarantee clauses that are in force until the end of the year and which establish a quota for exchange between member countries. When this quota is surpassed by a member country it pays tariffs as though it were a third country. The possibility of harmonizing industrial promotion programs and the search for parity in industrial costs were also discussed during the extensive meeting, in which industrialists Dagoberto Lima Godoy (Brazil), Hugo Barral (Paraguay), Maxi Munoz (Uruguay), and Luis Jose Vasallo (Argentina), among others, participated.
