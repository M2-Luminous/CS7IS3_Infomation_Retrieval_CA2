Careful to avoid any shows of triumph, they recently arrested two suspected sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation Front in Lille. At Place Beauvau, as in the 14th Antiterrorist Brigade of the Paris public prosecutor's office, the affair is considered to be "important." Chaib E., an Algerian national, and Ahmed S., a 27 year-old Frenchman, were imprisoned by Judge Bruguiere for "criminal involvement in terrorist action." In the course of a drugs investigation, police officers of the Lille regional Crime Squad seized over 1,000 blank Algerian administrative documents and a number of weapons. Drugs, the FIS, and false papers--this increasingly common cocktail sheds light on both the way in which the fundamentalist movement is set up in France and the way in which drugs have become a scourge of the Lille region in such a short period of time. Its closeness to Amsterdam is a principal reason. Heroin and Illegal Immigrants In the opinion of one judge, "the Lille metropolitan region is an ideal hub for drugs traffickers." Last December, investigators dismantled a major network of heroin dealers, implicating 47 people, most of them illegal immigrants. They had already been working for several weeks on a new heroin line when they were taken in for questioning on 21 and 22 March. Chaib and Ahmed were ringleaders of a flourishing network that offloaded at least 1 kg of heroin every 10 days and which has since led to the questioning of 25 people, most of whom have been placed under a committal order. This large-scale operation had several surprises in store. During the raid on Chaib's home, Crime Squad officers dicovered 500 blank Algerian identity cards and 600 blank attestations from the High Commission of Algerian national service. On the same day they arrested Ahmed, and in a raid on his home in Persan-en-Beaumont in Val-d'Oise [Paris region], they found an Israeli-made Galil assault rifle, handguns, primers and boxes of cartridges for 9-mm automatic weapons, stamps for manufacturing false documents, a batch of Algerian adminstrative documents, and documents written in Arabic. The latter are now being examined by Judge Bruguiere after having been passed on to the 6th Division of the Central Crime Squad by the Interior Ministry in Paris. These papers immediately attracted the attention of antiterrorist experts in the capital. They allegedly prove that the two traffickers are members of the FIS. A senior government official in Paris stated: "The FIS does not issue membership cards." Their fingers burnt for reasons that are only too-well known, the police prefer to ironically talk of suspected sympathizers. Chaib and Ahmed are, however, thought to belong to the French Algerian Fraternity [FAF], one of the FIS' subgroupings which was jointly led by Djaffar El Houari and Moussa Kraouche, who was also its spokesman. The Lille region appears to be a happy hunting-ground for the Islamic fundemntalists. As a judge remarked: "It opens directly onto Belgium and the Netherlands." Fundamentalism has developed considerably among the region's 60,000 Muslims, most of whom live in the Roubaix-Tourcoing zone. This area has a number of makeshift places of worship as well as eight real mosques, some of which regularly welcome over 1,000 worshippers. The Koran schools are overflowing, and the chador is increasingly worn by adolescents. Already on several occasions, police officials have swooped on this fertile FIS area. Eight people were taken in for questioning during the national haul of last November, while on 1 March, accused of the same "criminal involvement in terrorist action," eight more suspects appeared in Lille before an Investigation Commission led by Parisian Judge Roger Le Loire. All to no avail. `Afghans' Magistrates and the police now almost dare to hope that, with the arrest of Chaib and Ahmed, they will finally be able to unravel the threads of a web that seems to be getting more and more complex as the months go by. The Kraouche affair proved that there is very little evidence to catch supposed members of the FIS red-handed. A judge who knows these cases well said: "We cannot talk of a centralized organization. There are almost as many FIS and Armed Islamic Group [GIA] cells as there are regions, even if most fundamentalists are to be found in the Paris region, Orleans, and, now, Lille." Neither the FIS nor the GIA present a united front. Leading the way in terrorist action in Algeria, the GIA claimed responsibility for the murder of two French surveyors on 21 September in Sidi Bel Abbes, and the taking hostage of three other French citizens. Its most fanatical members--which inlcude the "Afghans," Algerian Islamic fundamentalists who fought in Afghanistan--cannot even be controlled by the fundamentalist leaders. These fanatics even planned the assassination of Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman exiled in Germany. Judge Bruguiere's investigation will attempt to find out whether Chaib and Ahmed played an active organizational role. An analysis of the weapons seized should reveal whether they were used in France in hold-ups or to settle scores, or even if they have been used in Algeria--unless, of course, the two suspects turn out to be mere pawns. A Parisian official in the antiterrorist squad told us: "Many people orbit the FIS, going about their own business, drugs or something else, but helping the fundamentalists out with gifts or false documents. Unlike the Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK], we cannot formally say that the FIS is financed by drugs in France, unless it is indirectly." Algerians Seeking Asylum In 1993, France recorded a rise in the number of asylum seekers from Algeria and Egypt, according to the latest figures from the Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA). According to the OFPRA, the rise in the number of requests by Algerian nationals (1,098 in 1993, as opposed to 144 in 1990) "is probably due to the arrival of people fleeing local instability and persecution by the FIS." However, "as is the case for Egyptian requests (up 249 percent)," the rise in requests could also be "linked to the reinstitution" of economic emigration channels.
