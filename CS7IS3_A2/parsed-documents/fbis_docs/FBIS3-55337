The three presidents are expected to meet on January 14. The sources also said that the reports on Clinton's visit to Ukraine were "groundless." Meanwhile, informed sources in Kiev told Interfax that the authorities there do not rule out the possibility of President Clinton's stopover in the Ukrainian capital. They say that a meeting of Kravchuk and Clinton could resolve all issues in the stationing of nuclear weapons in Ukraine that cause American concern. The same sources note that in this case Leonid Kravchuk's trip to Moscow would be "problematic" unless trilateral documents could be signed there.
