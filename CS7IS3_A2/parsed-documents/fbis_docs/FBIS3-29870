Pyongyang and Washington were reportedly negotiating details at the New York meeting that began early Wednesday (Korean Standard Time), specifically how and when the two Koreas will reopen dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States will announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. The U.S. State Department maintains that on the same day that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume. Simultaneously, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be announced. Pyongyang and Washington are said to exchange non-paper [word as received] on contents of their agreement at the end of the talks, expected to last until later in the afternoon.
