FR940511-2-00098 FR940511-2-00060 [Docket No. 93E&hyph;0268] Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Reality TM Female Condom AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for the Reality TM Female Condom and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension of a patent which claims that medical device. ADDRESSES: Written comments and petitions should be directed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian J. Malkin, Office of Health Affairs (HFY&hyph;20), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;1382. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive. A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For medical devices, the testing phase begins with a clinical investigation of the device and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the device and continues until permission to market the device is granted. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may award (half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a medical device will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(3)(B). FDA recently approved the Reality TM Female Condom for marketing. The Reality TM Female Condom is a medical device that is indicated for use to help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, during vaginal intercourse. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for the Reality TM Female Condom (U.S. Patent No. 4,976,273) from Chartex International Plc; the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated July 28, 1993, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this medical device had undergone a regulatory review period, and the approval of the Reality TM Female Condom represented the first commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that the FDA determine the product's regulatory review period. FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for the Reality TM Female Condom is 2,017 days. Of this time, 1,460 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 557 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates: 1. The date the first clinical trial on this device was begun : October 31, 1987. The clinical trial cited by the applicant was conducted outside the United States and was not subject to FDA's requirement for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) nor FDA's requirement for an institutional review board (IRB) approval under section 520(g)(3) of the act. Therefore, the testing phase begins on the date the device is first used with human subjects as part of a clinical investigation to be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the device (21 CFR 60.22(c)(1)(iii)). The applicant has stated that the date on which the device was first used with human subjects as part of a clinical investigation to be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the device was October 31, 1987. Because of the circumstances previously described for the clinical trial cited by the applicant, FDA has no record in which to review this date (21 CFR 60.20(c)(6). Although FDA cannot, therefore, confirm that testing began as stated by the applicant, FDA is using this date as the start of the testing phase. 2. The date an application was initially submitted with respect to the device under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act : October 29, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the premarket approval application (PMA) for the Reality TM Female Condom (PMA P910064) was initially submitted on October 29, 1991. 3. The date the application was approved : May 7, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PMA P910064 was approved on May 7, 1993. This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 717 days of patent term extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before July 11, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA, on or before November 7, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 29, 1994. Stuart L. Nightingale, Associate Commissioner for Health Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11439 Filed 5&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
