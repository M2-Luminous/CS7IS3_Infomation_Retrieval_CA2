This was stated by a leader of the KDNP in reply to a question from Hungarian radio. Tamas Isepy affirmed that he conducted election coordinating discussions yesterday with the SZDSZ's candidate for prime minister [Gabor Kuncze]. He also denied the NEPSZABADSAG report that Gabor Kuncze has rejected any local cooperation. Candidates from the KDNP are in second place, while SZDSZ candidates are third -- or the reverse is true -- in several constituencies. This is why both parties have an interest in possibly withdrawing in favor of the other in the second round of the elections, the Christian Democratic politician said.
