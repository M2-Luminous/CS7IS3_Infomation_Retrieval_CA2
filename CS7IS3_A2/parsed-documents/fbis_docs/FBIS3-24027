What is more, these formations can be classified according to the methodology adopted throughout the world with the traditional "leftist," "center," and "rightist" segments and separated by pure party political programs. In other words, Ukraine has seen the end of that "distorted mirror" of party life from the days of the struggle against the Communist Party monopoly when it, as the bearer of public regression and totalitarianism, was not "leftist," as everywhere else in the world, but "rightist." And the traditional "rightists" on the planet--the nationalists, national radicals, and so on--under our conditions were "leftists," because they fought against political tyranny and defended the right of peoples to state self-determination. Today, according to the studies of the Institute of Strategic Research (ISI), we have "leftists"--the socialist-communist orientation--and "rightists"--the nationalist and radical national formations, plus the two-part "center," which unites (and this is a unique feature of post-Soviet Ukraine) the national democrats and pragmatic centrists (see the schematic chart--author). In the opinion of the ISI, there are five criteria on which this division is based, specifically attitudes toward: (1) the idea of state independence; (2) the historical period when Ukraine was a part of Russia and the USSR; (3) present-day Russia and the CIS themselves; (4) the form of state order, organization of power, and political regime in Ukraine; (5) the purposes, forms, and methods of conducting market reforms. To the last point I would add that the associations of citizens are also divided into center, leftist and rightist extremes by their methods of achieving their goals (revolutionary or evolutionary). So, apologizing for the lengthy enumeration, I will try to present all those who, as in Noah's ark, exist in Ukraine today and will be struggling for deputy seats. The socialist-communist complex: the Socialist (SPU) and Communist (KPU) parties and the public organizations Union of Communists of Ukraine (SKU) and Front of Laborers of Ukraine (FTU). This also includes the many regional and republic associations such as Laboring Ukraine, the All-Ukrainian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, and others. These parties call for effective social guarantees and closer, all-encompassing integration into the CIS, oppose rapid market reforms, and so on. The centrist-pragmatists include the Party of Democratic Rebirth (PDVU), the People's Party (NPU), the Liberal Party (LPU), the Social Democratic Party (SPDU), the Peasant Party (KresPU), the Ukrainian Party of Beer Lovers (UPLP), the Party of Labor (PT), the Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS), the Party of Economic Rebirth of the Crimea (PEVK), the Constitutional Democratic Party (KDPU), the Civil Consent Centrist Party (PTsGS), the Party of National Salvation (PNSU), the Civil Congress (GKU), the All-Ukrainian Gromada [Community] Association [VOG], the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice (UPSSS), the Labor Congress (TKU), the Party of Slavic Unity (PSYeU), and the New Ukraine Association (NU). These formations put liberal or socially adjusted market reforms, private property, democracy, individual freedom and its priority over the state, and the like above everything else. They often arose as regional lobbies and associations based on the interests of particular groups of politicians or social strata. The national democrats, who defend the priority of democracy (but with a national slant) and more rapid establishment of Ukrainian statehood include: the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP), the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party (UKDP), the Democratic Party (DemPU), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPU), the Christian Democratic Party (KhDPU), the Greens Party (PZU), the People's Movement [Narodnyy Rukh--NRU), the Party of Free Peasants (PSKU), and these public organizations: the Congress of National Democratic Forces (KTsDS) and the All-Ukrainian Public Organization "All-People's Movement of Ukraine" ["Vsenarodnyy Rukh Ukrainy"--VNRU). The national radicals are represented by the Ukrainian Conservative Party (UKRP), the Ukrainian National Conservative Party (UNKP), the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), the All-Ukrainian Political Association "State Independence of Ukraine" (GSU), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in Ukraine (OUNiU), and the public associations: Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) and Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNS). They fight for building a Ukrainian state at any price, including at the price of democracy. The ISI believes that the stability and balance of the pragmatic centrists make them attractive in the eyes of the ordinary citizen and rank-and-file voter which, for one, makes a victory of the "center" entirely likely. For two, the pragmatists will take over the "center", either pushing the national democrats toward the "rightists" or making them more pragmatic in their political aspirations. In this situation a person cannot help but wonder if the pragmatists, who are likely to win the election, will be able to move from an attractive presentation of their moderate programs to an equally attractive and effective implementation of them in reality. And would it be for the general welfare, which we very much want.
