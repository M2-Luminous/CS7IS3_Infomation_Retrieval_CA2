ABC for the W/C GOA Is Proposed To Be 62,000 Metric Tons (MT). Biomass Distribution Is Based on 1993 Survey Data. TACs Are Equal to ABC. Inshore and Offshore Allocations of Pollock Are Not Shown. ABCs and TACs Are Rounded to the Nearest 10 MT. 1Statistical area 1Biomass percent 11995 ABC = TAC 1Quarterly allowance Shumagin (61) 49 30,380 7,595 Chirikof (62) 24.7 15,310 3,827 Kodiak (63) 26.3 16,310 4,078 n,s Total 100.0 62,000 15,500 5. Preliminary Apportionments of Pacific Cod TAC Regulations at ยง672.20(a)(2)(v)(B) require that the DAP apportionment of Pacific cod in all regulatory areas be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is equal to 90 percent of the Pacific cod TAC in each regulatory area. Inshore and offshore component allocations of the proposed 103,000 mt TAC for each regulatory area are shown in Table 4.
