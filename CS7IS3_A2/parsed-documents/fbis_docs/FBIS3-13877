Ghawshah pointed out that the PLO Executive Committee met under Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last night. The committee discussed the practical measures needed to implement UN Security Council 904 on the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The resolution, Ghawshah noted, calls for international protection for the Palestinian people. Ghawshah added that the committee also reviewed the outcome of 'Arafat's meeting yesterday with an Israeli delegation under Amnon Shahaq. The Israeli delegation brought no new proposals concerning the practical measures needed to implement the UN Security Council resolution, despite the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 'Arafat in a telephone conversation two days ago that the delegation would convey such proposals.
