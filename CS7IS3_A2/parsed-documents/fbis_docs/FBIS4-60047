He was received by the brother camp commander, officers, NCO's, and soldiers. The brother chairman, the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was briefed on the progress of training and preparation at the camp. Addressing the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers, the brother chairman praised the valiant Armed Forces' heroic role to support the people's will and defend the homeland and democracy against all threats and challenges that have been imposed by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] leadership which threw the homeland and the Armed Forces into the furnace of war and imposed it on our people in order to implement its secessionist plan and fragment the homeland. He stressed: Unity has existed to survive and to be entrenched in the state of affairs and life of the homeland. It is our people's destiny and fate, and they will never relinquish it. He noted that our people and their Armed Forces, who offered dear sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni revolutions of 26 September and 14 October, and for their triumph, are today making sacrifices for the sake of protecting and entrenching unity. He stressed that Yemen will have no future or stability without unity, and that secession and the attempts to go back to the pre-22 May 1990 era are impossible. He said that the people and their Armed Forces will not allow this and will confront the secessionists resolutely and strongly. The brother president pointed to what is being achieved by our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity, legitimacy, and democracy, in terms of success in accomplishing their tasks and national duties to deter the rebelling, secessionist forces, to abort their secessionist plan, and to force them to submit to the will of the people and to recognize constitutional legitimacy. He pointed out that this is taking place thanks to God and to our Yemeni people's support, who are rallying around their valiant Armed Forces throughout the Yemeni homeland in Shabwah, Abyan, Aden, Ta'izz, Hadhramaut, al-Mahrah, Sa'dah, Hajjah, al-Hudaydah, Sanaa, and Dhamar. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council called on the personnel who were misled by the rebelling, secessionist gang in the YSP leadership to join the ranks of their brothers and comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in order to prove their patriotism and faithfulness to the homeland by standing in the trench of unity, revolution, and democracy. He wondered whether these misled people want to fight and die for the sake of a handful of conspiratorial secessionists who led the homeland to this abyss for the sake of achieving personal interests and devastating selfish whims. He added: To those misled people we say, you are now facing a test, either you join the ranks of right or the ranks of falsehood. It is either you be with your people, homeland, and unity, or with a handful of conspirators who did not fear God in their actions against the homeland and people, and involved the sons of the one homeland and the comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in this bloody fighting which they did not want. However, this criminal gang has imposed it on our Yemeni people and the Armed Forces. He noted that our Yemeni people are proud of their sons in the Armed Forces, who are now waging the battle of honor and martyrdom in defense of unity and democracy, and to eliminate the threats and dangers posed by the rebelling, secessionist gang. The brother president urged the brother soldiers, NCO's, and officers to be alert, disciplined, and ready to perform the sacred national duty at all times and under all circumstances. The brother president, the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was accompanied by brother Staff Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy chief of staff for operations.
