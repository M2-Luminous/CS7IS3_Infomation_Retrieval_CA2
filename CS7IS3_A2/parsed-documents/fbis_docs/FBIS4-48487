FBIS4-48487 "drafr098_d_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 18 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola UNITA Accuses Government of Using Chemical Weapons UNITA Accuses Government of Using Chemical Weapons MB1905111994 London BBC World Service in Portuguese 2030 GMT 18 May 94 MB1905111994 London BBC World Service Portuguese BFN [From the "Last Minute" program] [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has requested the international community to exercise pressure on the government led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola in Luanda to end what it described as the massacre of civilians and the use of chemical weapons in Angola. A communique issued by Jonas Malheiro Savimbi's movement in Brussels has accused the government armed forces of using chemical weapons and South African mercenaries against the Angolan people and called on the United Nations, the European Union, the OAU, and South African President Nelson Mandela to intervene. This afternoon, Goncalves Carvalho contacted UNITA representative in Brussels Alcides Sakala to give more details on the communique. [Begin recording] [Sakala] We think the situation has deteriorated of late, following the systematic use of chemical weapons in air raids carried out by the Angolan Government against defenseless people in major urban centers, particularly in Ndalatando, Huambo, and other cities. That is why, we decided to alert the international community to this serious situation in Angola. [Goncalves] Is there any proof of the use of chemical weapons and acts of genocide. [Sakala] There is a lot. We have sufficient evidence that we shall present to the international community in due time. This behavior by the Angolan Government is not new. As you are aware, during the war fomented by Russians and Cubans in Angola, the Angolan Government systematically used these chemical weapons. It is now doing so again and in a massive way. [Goncalves] The government has at times made similar accusations against UNITA. [Sakala] We have no aircraft, as you are very much aware. The accusations are therefore not valid. [Goncalves] Well, but chemical weapons can also be used by artillery. [Sakala] UNITA does not use chemical weapons in its operations. We do not use chemical weapons, but we have clear evidence that the government has been systematically using them. [Goncalves] When will UNITA present this evidence? [Sakala] Soon, soon. As you are aware, Mr. Hendricks, a very experienced specialist is presently here in Brussels. He has visited our areas on various occasions, and he was the one who for the first time informed the world about the use of these weapons by the government. We are in contact with him here in Brussels, and we shall see how we can in due time expose this violation. [end recording]
