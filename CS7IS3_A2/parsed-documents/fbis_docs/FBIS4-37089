The conferees discussed several economic and trade issues, including the issuance of legislation punishing those who sell foreign currency outside the officially-licensed offices. These traders are regarded as thieves liable to the stipulations of Decree No. 59 issued by the Revolution Command Council on 4 June 1994. Also liable to punishment are farmers who deliberately fail to deliver grains to the marketing centers. This includes merchants who stockpile items listed in the ration cards with the aim of monopoly and tampering with prices in a departure from the fixed price. This also includes the profit margin, which should be reconsidered in order to encourage merchants to trade in these items, and to put prices within a reasonable framework for the citizen who purchases them in addition to his share provided by the state through the ration card. The conferees agreed that the profit margin for wholesalers and retail merchants be declared regarding these items. During the meeting, specific ideas were raised to give the state a positive role in stabilizing the Iraqi dinar's exchange rate against the dollar, and not accepting the common idea that the state's selling and purchasing ability is dependent upon the exchange rates of the dollar and dinar, which vary according to speculators and profiteers in the black market, who tamper with their exchange rates. The conferees agreed on the importance of pursuing violators after announcing the set restrictions based on the new legislations. They also agreed on implementing these legislations with due firmness because the blockade is a form of war, and will remain so until it ends in decisive victory, God willing, through the resolve of the dedicated Iraqis and the glorious Iraqi women after having relied on Almighty God. The conferees also agreed on the importance of deepening the discussions and highlighting what is agreed in a later expanded meeting in order to entrench it in the form of laws and specific regulations, so each concerned party precisely knows the limits of its rights and duties, and so all will work with determination to bring Iraq to safe shores, God willing, where the homeland will be cherished, lofty, and in good shape at a time when Iraq's people and victorious march, as well as all the good people, will enjoy inevitable pride which God will choose for them and which God will turn into a decisive victory and a steadfastness with an early end that promises both good and prosperity.
