Under consideration is participation by the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in a Canadian logistics battalion operating under the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, an area occupied by Israel since it seized the territory from Syria in 1967. The United Nations has informally requested Japan to shoulder some functions of the Canadian logistics battalion after Ottawa decided to cut down the scale of its peacekeeping operations due to financial difficulties, according to government officials. Tokyo is expected to start looking into the specifics of whether it can actually take part in the operations when a government mission returns from Canada in mid-June. The seven-member team is to study in Canada the details of the logistics activities under UNDOF. If Japan decides to join UNDOF, it will be its third participation in UN peacekeeping operations, following a mission to Cambodia in 1992 and one to Mozambique to end next February. "No decisions have been made yet," said a Foreign Ministry official. "The aim of dispatching the mission to Canada is simply to explore the possibilities of the participation (in UNDOF)." But according to some ministry officials, peacekeeping in the Golan Heights seems to top the list of candidates for the next destination for Japanese peacekeepers. The 1,036-strong UNDOF, comprising infantry corps from Austria and Poland and the 215-member logistical personnel from Canada, has been monitoring the cease-fire and disengagement between Israel and Syria since June 1974 after the Middle East War in 1973. The Canadian team engages in transportation, communications, fixing vehicles and supplying food. The ministry officials said UNDOF is one of a handful among 17 UN peacekeeping activities now operating worldwide that fits Japan's five conditions for joining such operations, including the requirement of a cease-fire among warring parties. Earlier this year, when Japan explored ways to step up contributions to the former Yugoslavia, the lack of a cease-fire agreement there prevented Japan from joining the Zagreb-based UN Protection Force. Among those meeting Japan's criteria are the UN operations in Cyprus, in the Kashmir region bordered by India and Pakistan and at the Iraq-Kuwait border. "We're not thinking of sending Japanese personnel to every one of the UN peacekeeping operations matching Japan's conditions," said a ministry official. ``We have to think whether Japan can win high evaluation from the international community by participating in that particular peacekeeping operation, whether it could gain the public's understanding while also considering the political meaning of taking part in it,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. Cambodia and Mozambique both fulfilled such conditions, he said. The mission to Cambodia, where SDF members were dispatched abroad for the first time, contributed to the peace and stability in Asia, while joining the Mozambique operation showed Japan's interest in problems worldwide, he said. The U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping mission to the Golan Heights also meets such conditions, the official said. Participation in UNDOF could prove Japan is not reluctant to join peacekeeping operations in other parts of the world besides Asia, he said. Tokyo could also make an international showing that it is eager to promote the peace process in the region, when new moves are beginning to emerge in the process, the official said. Also, because Israel and Syria are friendly with Japan and because peace and stability of the Middle East region are important globally, participation in such an operation could gain public understanding, he said. Another factor in favor of the dispatch to the Damascus-based UNDOF is a lesson learned from the 1991 Gulf war, the official said. Despite contributions totaling 13 billion dollars to the multilateral forces and frontline nations, Japan faced international criticism for not sending its own personnel and conducting ``cash diplomacy,'' he said.
