Miroslav Konvalina has been following its proceedings in the Atrium Hotel: [Konvalina] The opening speeches and early discussions indicate that deputies from East and West European countries, politicians, journalists, and other participants in the seminar are eager to get to know not only our positions on NATO and other European institutions, but also the changing policy of Russia, its self-confident actions on foreign and security issues and, in this context, ways of facing a possible change of Russian policy. In the opening address at the seminar, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys analyzed security risks in present-day Europe. He said Russia is a volcano, whose lava of instability could spill far beyond the borders. Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka noted that Russia has also received an offer to join the Partnership for Peace program and that, in the West, there is no country aspiring to threaten Russia. That is why our efforts aimed at gaining NATO membership are not motivated primarily by our fear of Russia, but by our endeavor to embody the values we have in common with West Europe in joint institutions.
