FR940621-0-00035 FR940621-0-00017 Integration of 406 Mhz ELT's Nineteen commenters recommend using the 406 Mhz ELT because it has significant technical improvements over the 121.5/243 Mhz ELT equipment system. Commenters also noted that 406 Mhz ELT's are compatible with the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System (COSPAS-SARSAT). Several commenters submitted data indicating that the COSPAS/SARSAT system has proven to be an effective tool in detecting and locating both maritime and aeronautical distress incidents. The data further show that this satellite system had been credited with saving more than 1,700 lives since it was commissioned in 1982. In many of these distress cases, the satellite system was the only means of detecting the distress signal. The commenters assert that improvements in ELT equipment, both on the 121.5 Mhz and 406 Mhz frequencies, will increase the accuracy of location, reduce the time required to provide information to the Rescue Coordination Centers, reduce the effects of interference, reduce the number of false alerts on 121.5 Mhz, and improve satellite coverage of all areas in the United States. Most commenters support use of an improved 121.5/2430 Mhz ELT or the improved ELT that includes 406 Mhz capability. The NTSB further advocates a fleet-wide mandatory conversion to the 406 Mhz standard. FAA Response: In October, 1992, the United States responded to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) letter requesting comments on ELT carriage requirements. The United States recommended the use of 406 Mhz ELT's. To accelerate the introduction of the 406 Mhz capability, and to provide an acceptable standard of certification for ELT's, the FAA issued TSO&hyph;C126 on December 23, 1992. The intended configuration of the 406 Mhz ELT can be accomplished by either of two approaches: (1) Installation of a stand-alone 406 Mhz ELT to augment an existing 121.5/243.0 Mhz ELT installation; or (2) Installation of an integrated 121.5/406 Mhz ELT, or an integrated 121.5/243.0/406 Mhz ELT of which the 121.5 or the 121.5/243.0 portion meets the requirements of TSO&hyph;C91a. TSO&hyph;C126 provides a standard for significant performance and information improvements for ELT's and these improvements are expected to permit more effective and timely SAR response after aircraft accidents. A 406 Mhz ELT would operate at much higher power levels than a 121.5/243.0 Mhz ELT. Lithium chemistry batteries appear to be the only likely power source. The FAA is concerned about the safety characteristics of these batteries and has placed some initial guidance material in TSO&hyph;C126 to aid approving lithium batteries. Currently, RTCA Special Committee 168 is developing a standard for the various kinds of lithium batteries that could be used in aircraft. The FAA plans to use the RTCA standard as a basis for a future TSO. The 121.5/243 Mhz ELT's approved under TSO&hyph;C91a are expected to be effective when used in conjunction with the U.S. National Airspace and SAR systems. Therefore, the FAA recommends, but does not require, carriage of 406 Mhz ELT's. Voluntary use of the 406 Mhz ELT's would provide a definite enhancement over the minimum requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations. There may be even more life-saving benefits derived from the 406 Mhz ELT for those operations conducted over water and in remote areas; therefore, the FAA encourages installation of the 406 Mhz ELT although the 121.5/243 Mhz will continue to be used. Costs of Automatic and Survival ELT's Five commenters express concern over the additional cost of automatic TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's required for new installations. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association indicates that the estimated $75 installation cost in Notice No. 90&hyph;11 is inappropriate. It claims that a realistic estimate for parts and labor is $750. With regard to survival ELT's, Dayton-Granger, Inc. and the DME Corporation currently estimate the cost of survival ELT's at approximately $900. Both companies plan to manufacture ELT's approved to the TSO&hyph;C91a standard. The Air Transport Association of America (ATA) states that its member airlines estimate the cost of the TSO&hyph;C91a survival ELT's to be $4,193 to $4,662 per aircraft. Additionally, it states that the new TSO standards are unnecessary because there are no problems with the current survival ELT's. FAA Response: The FAA based its cost estimates on estimates provided by manufacturers of authorized equipment. ARNAV Systems, Inc., whose automatic ELT is now marketed by Artex Aircraft Supplies, Inc., obtained TSO&hyph;C91a approval for the model ELS&hyph;10 in October 1986 and for a lower cost model, the ELT&hyph;100, in March 1988. These automatic ELT's sell for approximately $900 and $350 respectively, and have beneficial design enhancements, such as built-in test equipment. Narco Avionics, Inc., obtained approval for its automatic model ELT&hyph;910 in June 1989, and is marketing it for approximately $400. Since the issuance of Notice No. 90&hyph;11, ACK Technologies, Inc., received approval for its automatic Model E&hyph;01 ELT in May 1990; the list price for this ELT is $279. According to this manufacturer, a selling price of less than $200 may be possible, once full production is underway. Several other ELT manufacturers have expressed an interest in producing low-cost TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's.
