After expressing satisfaction with the government make-up, the prime minister said that the government was formed by the ruling Agrarian-Democratic Party which will be responsible for the situation in all spheres, including the economy. According to Sangheli, the Republic has all necessary material and natural resources, the technico-economic potential and adequate personnel for overcoming the crisis."It is just necessary to understand that market is not an ultimate goal, but the way to increase production and improve the well-being of the people," he pointed out. The prime minister said that by reducing the administrative staff and management structures of the government 30-40 percent saving will be reached. IF Note: The new government of Moldavia has three ministries and three departments less than the previous one. Now there are 17 and eight of them respectively. Until recently, the total number of administrative personnel was 6,000 people, and their maintenance cost 3.2 percent of the state budget. Sangheli will have four first deputies. There will also be the new post of the state minister for relations with the parliament. The heads of the power ministries retained their posts: General Pavel Kryange remained the defense minister, Konstantin Antoch -- the interior minister, Vasily Kolmoi -- the security minister. The present Moldovan ambassador to Belgium Mikhail Popov was appointed as the new foreign minister. The nationalist newspaper "Tsara" argues that this appointment was made at Moscow's initiative and promises the change of Moldavia's foreign policy from Europe to Moscow oriented. According to Sangheli, in about 40 days the government will submit to the parliament its program for the near future. The prime minister the priorities will be the following: -- Well-thought combination of state control and development of market structures. -- Intensive denationalization and reform of enterprises through distribution of shares and privatization. -- Agrarian reform with retaining state's influence in the agrarian sector and simultaneous development of peasants' farms. -- Reform of industries, support for efficient industries, the creation of conditions for investments. -- Anti-inflationary policy, the completion of tax reform, the reduction of budget deficit. "Despite the difficulties and bad shortage of funds, the government will pay special attention to the social support, the creation of state program for the use of labor force, support for low-income people, the preservation of the rights to free education and health care," Sangheli pointed out. In his opinion, the success of the new government should be guaranteed by professionals who have worked in state bodies before, including in the government, and in recent year were doing business in market and commercial structures. "They should ensure the implementation of the new government's strategy of reasonable combination of market mechanisms and state regulation," the prime minister said. Sangheli expressed confidence that relations between Moldavia and former Soviet Union republics, now the independent state of the Commonwealth, will rise on a qualitatively new level. He also does not doubt that in the near future the parliament will ratify all agreements signed by President Mircea Snegur within the framework of the CIS and the Economic Union which is now being created. That, in his opinion, would enable Moldavia to cooperate with traditional economic partners on an equal basis. Commenting on the proposal of the Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev about the creation of Euroasian Union, Sangheli said: "We have not received any concrete proposals. If we do receive them, the parliament and the government will give an adequate answer." Commenting on the repeated appointment of Sangheli as the prime minister, local observers point out that he enjoys respect of the population of the Left Bank and the south of the Republic, inhabited by Gagauzes, as well as is welcome in the Russian Government.
