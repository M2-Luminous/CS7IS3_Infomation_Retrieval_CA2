I believe that in this way we have made a significant step toward progress in the unity of the European continent. This agreement precisely and completely states the conditions for Russia's economic return to Europe. It also determines Russia's role as an equal partner. [Words indistinct] the conflict ended some years ago. Now we have a warm climate in international relations, one that guarantees pluralism. But the consequences of the Cold War still poison the atmosphere. I think we have all felt the threat of a new clash. In the former Soviet Union and Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] we have agreements that failed with regard to the smooth exchange of products. Now our businesses are trying to find new openings in the international market. Consequently there are new agreements regarding the exchange of goods, trade, and services. We all know that there are local clashes, local interests, and regional clashes. These are serious symptoms that show the possibility of a return to the Cold War, but one that is financial in nature this time. With this agreement today, we can truly say that this threat is lifted. The European Union will now have new relations with the Russian Federation. The EU and Russia have made a strategic choice regarding Russia's new position on the international scene. Today Russia becomes one of the most important partners for Europe and the wider international community. In this way we will continue our cooperation and upgrade our relations for the benefit of the whole world. I believe that on the eve of the 21st century this is indeed a historic event. We are moving toward tightening relations among people who have been artificially divided into two camps based on ideology. We are all witness to this new direction. We should recognize that there are many obstacles and that much effort and wisdom is needed by all sides--probably more than we thought at first. Under these conditions I believe that Europe is called upon to give an important lesson in real and authentic cooperation to the world in every sector, including the economy, ecological problems, the handling of conflicts, and cultural issues. Russia has vital interests when it comes to the West and Central and East Europe. We have every reason to support the institutions that deal with these problems. We know the problems in the former Yugoslavia. The EU, indeed every European country, can have faith in Russia regarding this issue. We hope for sharing within the CSCE framework, mainly to safeguard stability in the East of the European continent. Russia is interested in the EU's economic and political development. We support the process of European integration and the expansion of the EU's institutions. We believe that soon there will be additional results and we will do everything we can so that today's small Europe will become a big Europe. We are also interested in European integration within the framework of our participation in the CIS. We have seen various tragic events lately. Everyone is required to make efforts to realize a unified Europe so that the 21st century will be the first century of peace throughout Europe. This is the direction we should follow because it is to everyone's benefit. I consider that our common effort is already producing tangible results. The agreement we have just signed constitutes testimony and proof that we are following this direction and accepting the results. It is the first tangible step toward successfully realizing the goals. It took two years to conclude this agreement. There were many difficulties. Russia's economic and political reforms have not always been understandable; perhaps there were psychological difficulties on every side. But we reached an agreement, and I believe that this agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation [which was] signed today has taken the most appropriate form. It opens a new chapter in relations, improving their quality. We have a credible mechanism for a permanent political dialogue and have strong foundations to continue working in the scientific, economic, technical, and cultural sectors. Russian companies will no longer need to fight an unequal battle in Europe; I think that this agreement provides a more civilized mechanism allowing activities by both sides. There is a clear possibility of gradual progress. We hope that in this way we will have greater opportunities to enter the West European markets and conclude the free movement of goods and capital. An appropriate framework for businesses will also be established in Russia. Of course it will be difficult, beginning, as we should, simultaneously in many fields. Already the agreement is raising issues. We have seen the texts that make up the agreement; they indicate the depth and detail behind the agreement. We are here at the signing in Ayios Yeoryios Church. Do you know that the Orthodox call Ayios Yeoryios victorious? I hope this will be a happy coincidence. Let us consider Ayios Yeoryios as our patron. Opportunity has brought us here so let the last signs of mutual distrust disappear and let us begin a new, great project for our peoples. With this opportunity, I want to thank the heads of the EU member countries, especially the Greek Presidency and the EU Commission, for their great efforts and for the preparation of this agreement, which is very important and opens up new directions. The most important thing now is to implement this agreement. I should say that Russia will make every effort to achieve progress. We want this cooperation to proceed. I thank you.
