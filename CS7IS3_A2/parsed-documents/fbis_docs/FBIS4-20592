In Figure 1, the calculated DOS are compared with the measured P 3p DOS. It is found from Figure 1 that the experiment remarkably agrees with model (c), but does not agree with model (a) nor (b). Consequently one of the P sites is vacant and is not replaced by B. We conclude that the structure of B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/] is that shown in Figure 2. Figure 1.
