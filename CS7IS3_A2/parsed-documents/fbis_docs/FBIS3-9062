The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] continues to firmly maintain its leading position: Some 18 percent of the 937 citizens surveyed by the Szonda Ipsos Institute would vote for the MSZP if elections were held this Sunday. The support for the MSZP has remained practically unchanged over the last five months. The gradual loss of supporters of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has continued, with 10 percent of all the people surveyed supporting them; with this figure, it continues to be in second place. The proportion of supporters of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] dropped by 3 percent; in the case of this party, we are witnessing a break in the slightly upward trend of recent months. Although none of these changes taken separately is considerable, the 5-percent drop in the support of the two liberal parties taken together is considerable. The support for the other parliamentary parties has remained practically unchanged. Regarding the parties outside parliament, we can say that the extent of their support is far below the threshold needed to make it into Parliament. A new development in this area is that the Agricultural Federation has become a party with a measurable amount of support. The voters give the MSZP the biggest chance of winning the elections. According to 24 percent of all the people surveyed, the MSZP will receive most votes (compared with only 21 percent in February). Some 11 percent of the people thought that the SZDSZ would win the elections, 6 percent thought the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], and 6 percent thought the Fidesz. The most interesting development this month is that the proportion of citizens without a firm party preference reached 41 percent, a figure never achieved before. At the same time, readiness to participate in the elections remained at the high level measured last month (61 percent of the people surveyed are sure they will vote, and 16 percent will probably vote). It is a paradoxical effect of the official start of the election campaign that people who would like to vote have now become uncertain.
