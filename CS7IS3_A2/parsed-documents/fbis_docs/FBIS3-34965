He added that these changes comes in response to requests submitted by a number of ministers recently. They asked to be relieved of their ministerial responsibilities. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he pointed out that these requests have not been accepted because the country is going through a critical phase requiring complete cooperation among its members to return the situation to what it was before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He said that the picture has not yet become clear with regard to the ministers who are going to move to other posts inside the government. He stressed that the change will not include the Interior, Information, and Foreign Ministries. Dr. Hayati said that "some ministers have not kept pace with the aspirations of the government, the people, and the National Assembly, thus new faces are needed -- faces capable of making decisions to reinforce the Kuwaiti citizens' confidence in the government." However, Deputy Ahmad Baqir, secretary of the National Assembly, has denied recent media reports about a cabinet reshuffle. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that this is "absolutely baseless."
