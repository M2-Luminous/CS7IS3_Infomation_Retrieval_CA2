"The decisions adopted at the Ashgabat summit foster the hope for the development of integration processes in the commonwealth. The meeting confirmed the general understanding of the fact that coordinated activities will make it easier to resolve the protracted economic crisis. It is not incidental that all CIS countries announced their adherence to the economic union of the commonwealth," the letter said. The Kazakh prime minister suggested discussing a set of urgent matters at the upcoming meetings of the CIS heads of state and heads of government to be held in March, in order to resolve the current crisis as soon as possible. One of the major tasks is to step up work to establish a common customs zone and a free trade zone in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Tereshchenko believes it desirable to accelerate the establishment of an inter-state association of free trade. In order to overcome the payment crisis and normalise payment and credit relations between CIS states, it is necessary to adopt measures engaging the interstate bank which was set up over a year ago but has not begun operation yet, Tereshchenko said. He called for establishing a CIS payment centre within the bank and reorganising it later into a currency union with a common currency. Tereshchenko believes that for the CIS economic union to function normally, a coordinating body should be set up. He suggested Moscow as the seat of such a body. "The adoption of decisions on all these questions will enable (us) to begin practical realisation of the idea of the economic union and reach a new level of relations within the CIS," the Kazakh premier said. Tereshchenko stressed that the Coordinating and Consultative Committee of the commonwealth could work on these questions and prepare respective documents. He suggested postponing the meeting of the CIS heads of government until a later date or holding it simultaneously with the meeting of the CIS heads of state due to take place in Moscow on March 31, 1994.
