Now aged 82, he is still a leading expert in military strategy. He will stand in the European elections for a non-electable place on the voting list headed by [former Socialist Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement. In the wake of the government's White Paper on Defense presented last month, General Gallois is soon to publish his own version: ``Black Paper on Defense'' (Footnote) (Payot Essays, 85 French francs) Garraud: France is today the only Western European country actually increasing its military spending. Is this a worthy priority? Gallois: I would have preferred the spending to be devoted to improving and perfecting military technology for the essential task of keeping France out of war situations through a policy of intimidation. The White Paper proposed a ``long-distance interventions force'' taken from a stock of 130,000 men capable of intervening 7,000 km from France. Even with the assistance of our allies, that would require considerable resources. It is an excessive ambition, unless we accept to become the mercenary force of the Europe under construction, a role that I would not like at all. In the past 12 years, France has mounted or participated in 25 military expeditions. During this time, our European partners have invested in vocational training, scientific research, economic and industrial development, the environment, and improving living conditions. The question is whether we have the resources to continue in this way. Garraud: What, in your opinion, should France's military priorities be? Gallois: Today, public opinion will no longer tolerate military expeditions in which the country suffers losses, which would quickly be considered excessive. That is why the only policy I can envisage is one of intimidation. France should strive to develop long-distance weapons, which can be operated without endangering the lifes of the people who serve them. With so-called ``intelligent'' weapons, the combatant becomes more of a director than an actor. I do not think this change has been understood. Garraud: What implications should such a change have for the military programming law? Gallois: In absolute terms, all major programs designed for the Cold War should be downscaled so as to open up new avenues of research. For example, when you compare the Rafale with the American F117 bomber, it is clear that the latter is stealthy, whereas the former is not. The airplane should now be viewed more as a way of getting weapons airborne than as an actual combat machine in its own right. It is the intelligent missile that should do all the long-distance destruction, the plane having turned tail for home a long time before. To date, we have not taken this view. We invest money in the plane rather than the missile. That is a conceptional error. The Leclerc tank is a traditional land army tank, but it is not suited to the current circumstances. What good is a maneuver force today? We have to take new directions. Garraud: Your priority remains the nuclear deterrent. How do you see this evolving? Gallois: We have to keep the strategic oceanic force, which is almost invulnerable. I would add several submarines with much more accurate, very-low-power ballistic missiles. In this way, we could intervene at great distances from France without having to massively deploy conventional forces, as the United States did for the Gulf war. Another component, although not absolutely essential, is a mobile weapons system based in France and consisting of double-capacity ballistic missiles, such as the Pershing 2's. These would be accurate and could take nuclear or conventional warheads. In this way, we could confine the belt of instability which is taking shape from Japan, across North Africa, to Argentina and Brazil. Many of the countries in this belt have ballistic missiles and we must have the means of deterring anyone from using the slightest element of blackmail against us. These countries must say to themselves: ``If we use these weapons, we run the risk being replied to in kind.'' Garraud: To modernize the deterrent, do we still need to carry out nuclear tests? Gallois: Nuclear testing should be restarted. If we decide to stop testing definitively, as the president of the Republic has said, we will be taking a tremendous risk. The American experts themselves say that these tests must be continued, if only to check the quality of weapons as they get older. This cannot be done by simulation. A limited amount of testing will always be needed. Garraud: You also recommend that we acquire an extremely expensive antimissile defense system. How can we do this in the current context of budget constraint? Gallois: I would put it in a collective European context. Certain things that ensure our security and reinforce our scientific capabilities can be done at the national level, but there are technologies that we cannot acquire because they are out of range of our resources. Similarly, if the Europeans decide on long-distance interventions, clearly the corresponding fleets of cargo and transport planes can only be put together collectively. This should be included as a conditional section in the military programming law. What I do not like about the White Paper is that it assumes that other countries will agree with our scenarios.
