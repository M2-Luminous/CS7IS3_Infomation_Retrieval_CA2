The statement emphasizes, in particular, that "the disintegration of Ukrainian statehood is possible and attempts are being made to make the Republic of Crimea responsible for that process, and penalize it harshly because of this. It is not difficult, with the aid of provocations, to create an unstable situation in the Republic and capitalize on this to introduce a state of emergency, thus pushing relations between Russia and Ukraine to the brink of war." In the view of the statement's authors, "urgent steps are needed to prevent a threat of the emergence of a new Yugoslavia." Mykola Mykhalchenko said: "These people are in fact outsiders. Yuriy Meshkov is losing prestige on the Crimean peninsula. There are rumors that Eduard Baltin cannot resign for the same reason, i.e., because of his unpopularity among the sailors [sentence as received]. It is clear that Viktor Semenov needs to score points ahead of the election of Sevastopol's mayor."
