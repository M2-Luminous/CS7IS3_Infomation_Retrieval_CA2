According to a document sent to this newspaper entitled "Disloyalty, Immorality, and Corruption Do Not Exist in the Peruvian Army," the military said the institution is being presented "as a systematic violator of human rights, in collusion with drug trafficking gangs, and as an institution with internal problems." The military also says 1994 "will be a very difficult year from a social and political point of view because it is a pre-electoral year. We cannot rule out the possibility that the propaganda campaign to smear the Army will intensify even more starting in the second half of 1994," the document says. The latest issue of the weekly magazine SI that hit the stands today denounces that the political military command in Northern Huallaga Valley in 1992 "ordered an operation to cover up the activities of drug traffickers that resulted in the death of eight civilians and a complicated trial in military courts." The publication says that on 29 October 1992 a military patrol intercepted eight individuals, two of them Colombians, transporting 150 kg of cocaine paste. According to SI, the drug traffickers offered $30,000 to pass. However, the next day the eight individuals appeared dead while the drugs disappeared. The magazine says the case was later presented as an anti-subversive operation or a settling of accounts between drug traffickers and terrorists. Military justice is looking into the matter.
