He's gone into hiding since he declared himself a rightful president at the weekend, in defiance of General Sani Abacha's military government. He is now a wanted man with a price on his head, and there are reports that he is also in bed, suffering from a heavy cold. But according to the National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which is backing Abiola's campaign, Moshood Abiola could soon be sticking his neck out again. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] There are strong indications that Chief Moshood Abiola will come out of hiding soon to announce his next political action and, consequently, give himself up to the police. The National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which has been actively promoting his cause, said in a statement in Lagos today that Chief Abiola was, quote, now hail and hearty, unquote. Nadeco said in the statement, which was signed by its general secretary, Mr. (Ayo Kpadokun), that Chief Abiola was currently holding meetings and consultations, and that he would come out to announce his government and the arrangements for his sovereign national conference. The statement addressed Chief Abiola as president, and it called on the international community to accord him and his government recognition. Chief Abiola was declared a wanted person last weekend. The police promised a reward of 50,000 naira, which is about 1,500 pounds sterling, to anyone who can give information on his whereabouts. The fugitive political leader is believed to be in Lagos, but the security forces have still not got a clue to his trail. Political sources hint today that Chief Abiola may make his public appearance at a rally late next week. The venue and timing are being kept secret. The closest clue I was offered was that it would be somewhere in western Nigeria. Chief Abiola is from Abeokuta in Ogun State, which is next door to Lagos State. Speculations are that he would like to make his arrest a public drama, and probably maximize its political benefit to himself. [end recording]
