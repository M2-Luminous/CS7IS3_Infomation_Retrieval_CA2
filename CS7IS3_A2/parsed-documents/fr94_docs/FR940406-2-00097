FR940406-2-00097 FR940406-2-00049 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of the Secretary National Wild and Scenic Rivers System: Big and Little Darby Creeks, OH AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Interior. ACTION: Notice of approval. SUMMARY: The Secretary of the Interior hereby announces approval of an application by the Governor of Ohio to include segments of the Big and Little Darby Creeks, Ohio, as State-administered components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Angie Tornes, Rivers, Trails and Conservation Program, National Park Service, Midwest Region, 1709 Jackson Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68102&hyph;2571, 402&hyph;221&hyph;3481, or Bern Collins, Rivers, Trails and Conservation Program, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7127, 202&hyph;343&hyph;3765. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub. L. 90&hyph;542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273, et seq.) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Ohio, 85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks are hereby designated as State-administered components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. On October 1, 1990, the Governor of Ohio petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add 85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks to the National System. On January 24, 1992, the Governor of Ohio reaffirmed the same request which was followed by a revised application dated February 3, 1992. This river had been designated a State scenic river on June 22, 1984, pursuant to the Ohio Scenic Rivers Act. In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary conducted a complete review of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that review, the Secretary has determined that 85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The State of Ohio has fulfilled the requirements of the act by designating these segments as a ``State Scenic River'' and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the creek from adverse State actions. The National Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the Big and Little Darby Creeks meet the criteria for scenic classification under the act. Accordingly, the following river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the act to be administered by State and local government: Upper Darby Creek: Scenic_From the Champaign-Union County line (River Mile (RM) 71.8) downstream to the Conrail railroad trestle (RM 39.7), which is 0.9 mile upstream of US 40 (32.1 miles). Lower Darby Creek: Scenic_From the confluence with Little Darby Creek (RM 34.1) near Georgesville to the Scioto River (34.1 miles). Little Darby Creek: Scenic_From Lafayette-Plain City Road Bridge (RM 20.5) to 0.8 mile upstream from the confluence with Big Darby Creek (RM 0.8) (19.7 miles). This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy and Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as required by section 4(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A 45-day period for public comment on the State's application and river management plan and on the environmental assessment of the proposed national designation was provided from July 14, 1993, to August 30, 1993. All comments received have been carefully considered. Notice is hereby given that effective upon this date, the above-described river segments are approved for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the State of Ohio. Dated: March 10, 1994. Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8224 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;M
