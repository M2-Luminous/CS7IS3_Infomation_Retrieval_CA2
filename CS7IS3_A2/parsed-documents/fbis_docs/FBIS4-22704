Just a month ago in discussing the concept and strategy of Siberia's development in Moscow, MASS announced that the economic reforms had not resulted in "stabilization of the economic situation in Siberia," but, on the contrary, "a number of base complexes are on the verge of complete disorganization and collapse." Naturally, the association decided to take on the "creation of constructive mechanisms for the positive reform of the economy." The development of "constructive mechanisms" was above all focused on changing relations between the federal and territorial budgets and on making adjustments in tax policy. Lamenting Moscow's subjectiveness in calculating the income and expenditures of Siberia's krays and oblasts, MASS proposed a typical solution--increase the region's state budget financing. But in fact, in order to remove Siberians' suspicions of one another on the subject of "whom the Ministry of Finance favored more," the leadership of the oblasts should have published the local budgets. On this basis, the question could have been posed of redistributing within the region amounts already pledged to the federal budget. But the "Siberian Accord" instead proposed that the government increase the proportion of value-added tax (VAT) left to the territories. Seeming to forget that this proportion had already been raised starting this year, MASS is prepared to act as the disrupter of the entire budget design. It proposes to revise the rates of the personal profit tax, VAT, and income tax. To decrease them, naturally, but only that part which goes for republic-wide needs. Apart from demanding that state injections of capital be increased, the Association gave the recommendation "to form a special reserve fund for financial support of regions in the federal budget." But MASS did not indicate, as is customary in such cases, the source of the fund's formation. The appeal to the Council of Ministers to revise its decree No 1233 "On Reappraisal of Working Capital" is no less surprising. MASS explains its concern by saying that reappraisal of the value of enterprises leads to a jump in prices of their output, and after that comes another sequence of nonpayments, lower profits, and reduced tax revenue to the budget. It is remarkable that it was precisely enterprises and territorial authorities which bombarded the Cabinet of Ministers all of last year, demanding that working capital be reappraised, saying that otherwise it would be impossible to increase depreciation deductions and capital investments for developing production. But now MASS announces: "An alternative to this variant is an increase in monetary capital in circulation equal to the rise in prices." In this way, MASS is essentially advising the government to add the inflation of demand (the rise in prices through the increase in the amount of money the consumer has) to the supposedly inevitable inflation of the seller's costs. But, perhaps, another recommendation of Siberians is out of competition, to abolish Point 8 of the State Tax Committee instructions which defines the procedure for enterprises and organizations to pay tax on profit to the budget. Commodity producers complain about this instruction because supposedly it prevents them from lowering prices for goods and output. In answering such claims made at one of the conferences of directors, First Vice-President Oleg Soskovets said: "Consider there to be no such instruction." But the tax organs have repeatedly caught enterprises for artificially reducing prices of output (for the purpose of formally reducing profit and thereby taxes). Frequently Russian enterprises trade at real prices and list "reduced" prices in the transport invoices. And as a rule this is not accompanied by any resolution of nonpayments or any freeing of warehouse space. On the whole, MASS's approaches to regulating foreign economic activity, pretentions to price and rate controls on energy and railroad shipments, desire to revise relations of ownership between the federal and territorial levels, and readiness to adjust budget and tax policy confirm that the "Siberian Accord" is attempting to revive the economic organization of the 1950s, the sovnarkhoz [regional economic council].
