FR940318-0-00147 FR940318-0-00023 (d) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers using CFC&hyph;12. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (e) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers using CFC&hyph;12. See the discussion on desiccant cooling under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (f) Stirling cycle. Stirling Cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers using CFC&hyph;12. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (9) CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B. R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. Two of the constituents in these blends are HCFCs and contribute to ozone depletion, and production of these compounds will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule. While the GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 is somewhat high, refrigerant leak regulations should reduce its contribution to global warming. The GWPs of the other components are low. Although these blends do contain one flammable constituent, HFC&hyph;152a, the blends themselves are not flammable. In addition, each blend is a near azeotrope, and it does not fractionate in normal operation. Finally, leak testing of each blend demonstrated that while the vapor and liquid compositions changed, neither phase became flammable. Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. (d) R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B. R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, propane, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion, and will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule. Although these blends contain one flammable constituent, propane, the blends themselves are not flammable. In addition, the blends are near azeotropes, meaning they do not change composition between the vapor and the liquid phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that the blends would fractionate during normal operation, resulting in an enrichment of the flammable component. Finally, while testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable. Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. (e) R&hyph;404A. R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a have very high GWPs. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC&hyph;143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is an azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. (f) R&hyph;507. R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC&hyph;134a is somewhat high. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC&hyph;143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is a near azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. (g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (h) Propane. Propane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration equipment. Propane does not contribute to ozone depletion and it exhibits a negligible GWP. Propane is flammable, and as such EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities which manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety standards required for managing flammable chemicals.
