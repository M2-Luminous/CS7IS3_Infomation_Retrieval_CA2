The UN sanctions against Libya have been in effect since December 1, 1993. The Security Council approved them on November 11, as Tripoli did not meet its demand to hand over two Libyan citizens accused of participation in the explosion of a U.S. aircraft over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 people lost their lives.
