[video shows close-up of a seated Chen Yun shaking hands with Shanghai CPC Secretary Wu Bangguo and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju.] Comrade Chen Yun happily received the comrades in Shanghai and had cordial conversations with them. Comrade Wu Bangguo briefed Comrade Chen Yun on what Shanghai did in 1993 in launching reforms, opening up to the outside world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability; as well as on what Shanghai will do this year. Comrade Chen Yun was very satisfied with the information. He said: The work Shanghai has accomplished is very good -- not just good, but very good. [video shows medium close-ups of a seated Chen Yun having talks with seated Wu, Huang, and other Shanghai officials in what appears to be a guest room. Chen Yun, dressed in a light gray Mao suit, looks frail but alert and reasonably healthy with fair complexion. He occasionally gesticulates with his right hand to emphasize a point and his head moves about freely and naturally]. Comrade Chen Yun added: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economic development has been very fast, and the people's living standards have improved significantly. This is a fact everybody can see. Of course, there are still many difficulties and problems. To deal with these difficulties and problems, we must, first of all, safeguard and strengthen [wei hu he jia qiang] the authority [quan wei] of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. If the Central Committee does not have the authority, nothing significant can be accomplished, and social stability cannot be maintained. Comrade Chen Yun said: The Central Committee has decided to implement the revenue-sharing system this year so that central authorities can gradually pool the financial resources they need. Shanghai and other localities have supported this idea. This shows that you have taken the interests of the whole into consideration. I am very pleased about this. Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the country shows that today's economic work should pay special attention to one issue, namely the size of our construction projects must be compatible with the national strength. Moreover, there should be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile, we must focus our attention on achieving higher economic returns. [video continues to show medium close-ups and close-ups of Chen Yun speaking and Wu Bangguo nodding his head and smiling in apparent agreement. While Chen speaks he gesticulates with one hand, then the other, switching what appears to be a rubber ball when changing the gesticulating hand. Chen's head moves quite naturally both laterally and horizontally] In conclusion, Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current central leading group is a strong and capable one. Its performance is good. People throughout the country must work with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and fully implement the series of policies and measures which the party Central Committee and the State Council have adopted for exercising macroscopic regulation and control. When we do this, China is very likely to boost its economic development, and socialist China will have a bright future. Other Shanghai party and government leaders who wished Comrade Chen Yun a happy Spring Festival today were Chen Zhili, Wang Liping, and Chen Liangyu, as well veteran comrades Chen Guodong, Hu Lijiao, and Wang Daohan.
