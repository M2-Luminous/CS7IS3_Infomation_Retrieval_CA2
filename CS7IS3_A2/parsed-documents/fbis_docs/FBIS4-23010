To this end, Ps. putida, Ps. alcaligenes, B. subtilis strains from the collection of the Voodoobrabotka Research center are used. The microorganisms were grown a salt medium. The study demonstrates that the strains capable of utilizing surface active substances contain plasmid DNA yet with respect to urea, this property does not correlate with the presence of plasmids. It is speculated that it is coded by chromosomal genes. The findings open the possibility of developing vector molecules for B. subtilis on the basis of the pMA9 and pMA10 plasmid genomes. A comparison to published data makes it possible to note that plasmids DNA participating in the biodegradation of ampholytic surfactants are detected in a number of Ps. putida strains. The importance of separating the direct genes which determine biodegradation of syntanol is stressed. Figures 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.
