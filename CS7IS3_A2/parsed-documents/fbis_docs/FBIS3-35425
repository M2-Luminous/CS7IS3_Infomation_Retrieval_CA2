This offer made by American companies to India reflects a shift in American policy on South Asia and the contradictions of the U.S. leadership. By the end of last year, the Clinton administration had warned India to desist from making indigenous production of military equipment that may flare up a war frenzy. Hence, in consonance with this policy, the United States has refused to provide super computers to India and has also prevented Russia from providing the latter with rocket engines, which may be used in the manufacture of long-range missiles. To discourage India from producing sophisticated weapons indigenously, the U.S. Government also threatened India that if it manufactures such equipment at home, the United States would sell materials for the manufacture of AWACS planes to Pakistan. After this warning, India obviously halted work on the AWACS system at home and began talks with the United States for the purchase of latest equipment for its air force. However, after the offer of the American companies, besides manufacturing latest equipment, India will be able to achieve indigenous production of AWACS. This way, the Indian Air Force will have superiority in the region. The Indian Air Force is already more powerful than its counterparts in Pakistan and other countries of the region. This state of affairs is greatly regrettable. This is the reality and every Pakistani with any common sense is fully aware of the fact that the Americans are totally insincere people, and when their is purpose served, they become indifferent. During the Afghan war, the United States needed Pakistan. Despite great risks, Pakistan decided to confront Russia. At that time, the United States did not have any objection to Pakistan's nuclear program. Now strong pressure is being exerted on Pakistan to roll back this nuclear program, because now the United States does not need Pakistan to forestall Russian influence. On the contrary, after the downfall of Russia as the superpower, the American policy makers are not only ignoring Pakistan but also are encouraging India on several issues, which is a cause for concern to the political circles and the people of Pakistan. The offer of sophisticated military equipment to India by the American firms is a cause of anxiety to our policy makers. They should make a careful study of the offer and review the motivations and inspiration behind it. Pakistan is not Nepal, Sri Lanka, or the Maldives. It cannot accept the hegemony of India. However, by joining hands with other regional countries, Pakistan can prepare programs that will be beneficial to all the countries of South Asia. With the help of our neighbors, we can make this region a zone of peace, which ensures the independence, security, and the effective protection of the territorial boundaries of the countries in it. We hope that other regional countries are also not ready to accept the hegemony of India and that they will join hands and cooperate with Pakistan to make the region a zone of peace. We will request that the Government of Pakistan lodge a strong protest against the offer of sophisticated defense equipment to India by the American firms. Pakistan should launch an effective diplomatic campaign to assure the American leadership that Pakistan cannot tolerate Indian hegemony and its policing. It is also imperative to inform the American leadership that the Indian leadership is making threats of dire consequences to Pakistan because of its moral and political support to the freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan does not have any militaristic or expansionist designs. We would also request that the Indian Government review the situation at home in the global context with a cool head and in a relaxed way and adopt a policy to coexist with other countries of the region, including Pakistan, on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. We would also suggest that the Indian leadership fulfill its pledges made to the United Nations, grant the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir, and concentrate on eradicating the poverty of its own people instead of browbeating and making threats of dire consequences to Pakistan.
