He emphasized that what is taking place in the Republic of Yemen is an internal affair that does not call for deliberations at international forums. He said what is taking place in Yemen is a movement carried out by elements from the Socialist Party against constitutional legitimacy and the elections from which legitimate establishments were set up. He said these elements want to Yemen to return to the way it was before May 1990 when the country was united. He said his tour seeks to discuss with the friends and brothers how to deal with the Republic of Yemen in accordance with the principles of international law, which call for respecting sovereignty of states and noninterference in internal affairs. The Yemeni minister [title as heard] emphasized that the legitimate Yemeni forces are in control of the battlefields on which the separatist forces are fighting. In his visit to Jordan and his trip to New York, 'Abd-al-Ghani is accompanied by Yemeni Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ahamd Ghanim. The two Yemeni ministers were received upon arrival in Amman by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador in Amman. [passage omitted]
