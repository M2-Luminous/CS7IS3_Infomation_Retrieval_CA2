This phenomenon should be dealt with firmly and decisively by the security agencies. The reason for this is that any person who takes revenge for what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque by stabbing a foreign tourist is harming an innocent human being and rendering a service to Israel and Zionist gangs. If those who carry out such attacks knew the extent of sympathy the Hebron massacre has evoked in the United States, and even Japan, they would definitely feel guilty and come to the conclusion that they have unwittingly rendered a service to our enemies. When an ordinary citizen in Europe and the United States hears that a foreign tourist was stabbed in an Amman street, or in any other Arab country, he will be more responsive to Zionist propaganda portraying us as killers and terrorists. It is not true that every Westerner is our enemy and Israel's friend. World public opinion has shifted greatly in favor of our cause. The intifadah in the occupied territory has opened the eyes of Westerners to the reality of matters in our region. European and U.S. citizens are now aware that Zionist propaganda is misleading and that Israel is a racist, suppressive state. It is totally unacceptable that foreigners and tourists in our country should be targets for spontaneous, emotional reactions whenever Israel commits a massacre in Palestine. We should launch a media campaign using television, radio, and the press to warn against these odious actions that harm our cause and substantiate Zionist propaganda against us in Western nations. Those who regard an attack on an innocent tourist -- whose true feelings and sympathies are known only to God -- as a heroic act should follow the example of the occupied territory. No foreign tourist has ever been attacked in the West Bank and Gaza, even when clashes and confrontations are raging, save what happens by mistake. This is why the presence of foreign journalists and tourists has been utilized in the interest of the struggling Palestinian people and against Israel and the Israeli troops. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has elicited sorrow and sadness not just from those who attacked foreign tourists and others they thought were foreign tourists; all our people were deeply moved and were in tears over this massacre. However, they expressed their sadness and sorrow by staging demonstrations, making donations, or praying for the mercy of the martyrs. They did not resort to unacceptable reactions, as did those who attacked our foreign guests.
