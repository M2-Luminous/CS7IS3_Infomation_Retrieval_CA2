Why?"] [Text]Information concerning this was transmitted by information agencies. One reason was indicated: A complicated socioeconomic situation in the regions. We asked our correspondents to report to the readers whether this were really the case. This is what they report. Yekaterinburg Report by Vladimir Stakheyev: "The Reasons for the Delay Are Purely Technical" "The postponement of the date of the elections to the oblast duma and local self-government organs of the Urals is by no means explained by the socioeconomic situation," our correspondent was told by Natalya Ponomareva, the press secretary of the head of administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast. As is known, E. Rossel, the former head of administration, was dismissed from the position by an edict of the president of Russia of 9 November 1993. The very same edict temporarily entrusted his duties to V. Trushnikov, the chairman of the oblast government. It is natural that out of ethical and other quite understandable reasons, the acting head of administration did not begin to sign such an important document as a statute (albeit a provisional one) concerning the oblast duma and organs of self-government, and also concerning elections to these organs of authority. With the appointment of A. Strakhov as head of administration, the documents were signed and already published in January. Elections in the Middle Urals, according to the provisional statute, will be held within 72 days after the publication of these documents; that is, on 10 April 1994. So the postponement of the date of the elections in the kray to a later date is not associated with any other reasons. Samara Report by V. Mikhaylov: "Ready for Elections on the Volga" Did the administration of Samara Oblast appeal to the president of the Russian Federation for a delay in the time of conducting elections to local representative organs of authority? I asked this question of many officials of the oblast administration, and all of them, as if they had come to an agreement, answered "No." After breaking through a consultative palisade, I got into contact with Vladimir Mokryy, the deputy head of the oblast administration and manager of the staff. "It never even crossed our minds," he said. "Really, in the oblast, as on the whole in the country, the socioeconomic situation is rather complicated. Plants are working on a short week, many plants have not issued pay for a month and more, prices are increasing.... But, in our opinion, this is not the reason for the postponement of the elections to the oblast duma and to city and rayon representative organs. Work in this direction is moving at the prescribed pace: Electoral districts have been formed, and candidates for deputy are being nominated. The elections will be held at the end of March. We are confident that there will be no interruptions." "Is it possible that the leadership of the city of Samara would like to delay the elections?" "No," I was assured by Aleksandr Simonov, business manager of the city administration. "We will hold the elections on the scheduled dates. We have no objective reasons for doubting this. Samara Oblast is ready for elections to local organs." Krasnodar Report by Aleksandr Bulygin, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent: "Common Sense Is Dictating" Sergey Danilenko, deputy chairman of the electoral commission of Krasnodar Kray, explained that, guided specifically by this principle, the Kuban authorities decided to postpone the dates of the simultaneous elections of deputies to kray, rayon, and city dumas to 12 June. Rejecting suspicions of some kind of intent, Sergey Andreyevich does not decline answers to tricky questions: "How ready you journalists are with assessments. But the central electoral commission responded to our letter that `it does not detect legal obstacles for the conduct of simultaneous elections to the kray legislative assembly and local self-government organs in May-June of this year.' And President of Russia Boris Yeltsin has looked into the situation developing in the regions, and has advised not `to capture' the electoral commissions in the localities with tough provisional limits. The kray administration has no aspiration to gain time, or to receive any kind of additional advantages. There is only a desire to cut expenditures at a minimum to 6 billion rubles [R]. That is what the cost of the elections would be just to the kray duma, and even more for the city and rayon elections. It would not be difficult to predict the opinion of the taxpayers concerning such generosity." "But, after all, the administration has scheduled elections for 3 April?..." "Yes, such a decision was made when there was no clarity concerning the elections of deputies to local self-government organs. But what would happen if we did not make corrections? Posters of candidates and party blocs who ran for election to the Federation Council and the State Duma have not been washed off everywhere yet, and it would already be necessary to start in the kray, followed by the city and rayon parliaments. Will there be many who will want to vote within two or three months? And also, work in gardens and kitchen gardens will be in full swing. By June, incidentally, the period of strenuous effort of the dacha crowd will subside, and the season of mass leaves will not be under way yet." "What do you expect from the next preelection marathon?" "I do not think it will be easy. Rather the opposite, and it will be complicated not only by extraneous campaign features, but also by an increase in the number of aspirants for one seat. We must take into account the statute on elections and other documents. The city and rayon electoral commissions have plenty of troubles. They also heaved a sigh of relief when they learned about the postponed voting dates. After all, the kray center alone will have to break more than half of the precincts into smaller units, to find and ready premises, to collate and revise voter lists, and to bring all documentation into conformity with the new statute on elections. In a word, we are up to our ears in work."
