FR941031-2-00041 FR941031-2-00037 [Docket No. RP90&hyph;137&hyph;018] Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co.; Notice of Filing Revised Tariff Sheets October 25, 1994. Take notice that on October 19, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered for filing certain revised tariff sheets to Second Revised Volume No. 1 and Original Volume No. 2 of its current FERC Gas Tariff and Original Volume No. 1&hyph;A of its obsolete FERC Gas Tariff. The proposed effective date for these tariff sheets is November 1, 1994. Williston Basin states that the revised tariff sheets are being filed, under protest, pursuant to the Commission's September 19, 1994, Order in the above referenced dockets to adjust the currently effective Take-or-Pay Throughput Surcharges to make itself whole for the refund of certain throughput surcharge amounts previously collected from Western through the transportation rates charged for the gas placed in storage in accordance with a Rate Schedule S&hyph;2 Service Agreement between Williston Basin and Western. Williston Basin further states that the revised tariff sheets reflect the elimination of the valumetric surcharge from such service under Rate Schedule S&hyph;2. The instant filing reflects a revised total throughput surcharge of 20.231 cents per dkt on all applicable transportation volumes. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before November 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D.
