As a result, there is a delay in preparing a plan to implement the military aspect of the "Pledge and Accord Document," which was supposed to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for endorsement at its meeting in Sanaa today under the chairmanship of First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Hasan Makki. Sources familiar with the military committee's work have said that the failure to reach an agreement is attributable to the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] insistence that the military units belonging to it be withdrawn from northern governorates and that the northern units present in southern governorates be moved to the north; there are five southern brigades in the northern governorates. [passage omitted] The sources added that the proposal to return the forces to the governorates to which they belong is one of the clauses in the Egyptian mediation initiative between the YSP and the General People's Congress [GPC]. This is in addition to the proposal to withdraw forces from the former partition border which the military committee agreed to implement in yesterday's meeting. It has also drawn up a plan to implement it. The military committee's failure to withdraw northern forces from the south and southern forces from the north could result in delaying the anticipated meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC, and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP, in Cairo at the end of the month or the beginning of next month, because the Egyptian initiative focuses on defusing seats of military tension first.
