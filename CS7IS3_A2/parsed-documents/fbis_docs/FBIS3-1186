This is the sad result of a weekend of clashes between Tutsis and Hutus in the capital, Bujumbura. Burundi has not come out of the infernal cycle of violence and reprisals, and people are living in fear. Jean-Michel Mostaert reports: [Mostaert] Everything started on Saturday [19 March] morning with a grenade attack on a bus in the district of Rusaka, east of Bujumbura. Four passengers were killed. All were members of the Tutsi community. Immediately, the Tutsis wanted revenge; they attacked members of the Hutu community, while Tutsis were victims of reprisals in the areas with a Hutu majority. These fresh interethnic clashes are reported to have led to scores of deaths, maybe 100. They reveal the tense atmosphere which is continuing in Burundi almost five months after the abortive military coup of October, when almost 100,000 people were killed in interethnic violence. Since then, the authorities have not managed to restore a minimum of trust between the two communities. On the contrary; in the capital, Bujumbura, Tutsis and Hutus now live entrenched in their districts. Many are armed and the slightest incident leads to bloody reprisals. The government seems to be powerless. It is divided on whether to disarm people or not. A UN mission is to arrive in Burundi tomorrow. It will investigate the situation in the country. It will only be able to see the drift of Burundi, which is sinking deeper and deeper into chaos.
