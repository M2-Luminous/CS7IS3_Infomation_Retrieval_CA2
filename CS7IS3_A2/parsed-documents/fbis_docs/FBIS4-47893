There has been uproar in the country since it was found that land compulsorily acquired from white farmers for distribution to landless peasants was being assigned on license to government ministers and ruling party faithfuls. President Mugabe himself said that an investigation into the issue would be held. Now the agriculture minister, Kumbirai Kangai, has canceled the deals and taken some of the blame, as Fariah Mungazi reports from Harare: The cancellation of the land agreement follows criticism of the Tenant Resettlement Scheme, under which farms earmarked for resettlement were leased to individuals, some of them top government officials. Lands, Agriculture and Water Development Minister Kumbirai Kangai told parliament in a ministerial statement that he shouldered responsibility for what he called the apparent misunderstanding that arose over the scheme. He said in our pursuance of that objective and in our enthusiasm to carry out the task we may have attracted criticism. However, he denied that the exercise was a scandal, saying the scheme was an appropriate tool for indigenization of the economy. He said, in line with government policy of indeginizing the economy, the ministry found it prudent to use the scheme to promote the advancement of emergent black commercial farmers. He described the scheme as a stop gap measure taken by his ministry in a bid to use the land productively, conserve natural resources, and prevent what he called vandalism of permanent improvements and assets on farms. The minister said some of the farms whose leases had been canceled were being handed over to the Ministry of Local Government for immediate resettlement. Those farms, whose resettlement plans were not yet in place, would be advertised for temporary leasing to members of the public.
