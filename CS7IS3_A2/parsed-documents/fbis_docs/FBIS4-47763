FBIS4-47763 "drafr085_cs94020" FBIS-AFR-94-085-S Daily Report 2 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NP Candidate Criticizes Transkei Counting Procedures NP Candidate Criticizes Transkei Counting Procedures MB0205221794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2156 GMT 2 May 94 MB0205221794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] East London May 2 SAPA -- Ballot papers had been stacked by hand in some ballot boxes in the Ciskei, a National Party [NP] spokesman said on Monday [2 May]. Regional candidate Mr Billy Nel said in a statement that the seals of the boxes could not have been there at the time of voting, or else were removed afterwards for this to be done. "This practice was found to be done at ballot boxes at counting stations at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital and Manpower Centre." He said the sealing of boxes was "totally unacceptable". Mdantsane counting stations were a total fiasco. Plastic cable ties were used, or plastic tape, instead of the official seals from the presiding officer and the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The counting procedures were rushed and the result had been seen as more important that the system or security. There was no security at the counting stations and people could come and go at leisure. United Nations observers had been absent from the majority of polling stations in the Transkei. "The NP is extremely unhappy with the execution of voting procedures from the Transkei and Ciskei and also the intimidation that took place during the election. The result produced in these areas were anticipated by the National Party. But the margin of error is totally unacceptable to us." The NP hoped it would not be forced to accept all the results without a proper investigation, or a heavy-handed attitude towards these problems from the ANC.
