[Begin Colosio recording] Many of you have asked me for my reaction to today's public statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, so I have written a communique that I want to read to you. I will begin by saying that Camacho Solis' public statement confirms his absolute devotion to the tasks of conciliation and pacification with which the president entrusted him, thus confirming that our government has undertaken in earnest the construction of a lasting peace in Chiapas. It also recalls that the path to creating the conditions necessary to uproot the problem is still a complex one. The problem has caused so much suffering for Mexicans that handling it allows no room for distractions, as the commendable work by Camacho demonstrates. In my opinion, unity among Mexicans must prevail to successfully face the Chiapas problem. Everyone must act in solidarity with those who are striving to achieve that purpose. As I have said on other occasions and as I reiterate today, Camacho Solis is the best man to build a just peace in Chiapas because of his convictions, sensitivity, and negotiating ability. Camacho Solis is a man of great ability and political commitment who has performed outstanding services for the country and will continue to do so. I am certain that all Mexicans will widely commend the successful conclusion of the negotiations in Chiapas, as we regard national unity and peace as the nation's path to progress. As for us, we will continue onward with our proposal for unity, the future, renewal, and the hope of a freer and more just Mexico. The options are clear: Ours consists of a proposal for a broad center, for the future, for democracy, and for greater justice for all regions of our country, in all its diversity and pluralism, so we can advance in the change the people truly want. The other proposals belong to the past: a past of statism, bureaucracy, inefficiency, irresponsibility, populism, pessimism, acrimony, and resentment. Other proposals represent an even more remote past, a past of privilege. They only manage to offer government by the few for the few. Because Mexico has changed and continues to change, we will lead the country to the future it deserves by recognizing the state's new role: the power of reform, strengthening federalism and the balance of power with stability, and, most of all, with the priority objective of bringing more justice and welfare to the nation. In view of the above, I am today calling on all Mexicans who support my proposal to join the campaign. I call on you to join with conviction and enthusiasm. I am particularly calling on those who hold a strong conviction for democratic change and wish to promote a new consensus to transform the country. I call on you to unite and join this program I have proposed for the nation. There is room for you in this campaign for the future. There will be room, opportunities, and tasks to help reinforce the nation for you in the government that we will win democratically. The new organizations of society, the citizen who is now seeking to contribute to the actions of a new constructive and tolerant policy, should know that you will find in me the firmest support now and in the years of toil we have ahead to make Mexico great. Thank you. [end recording]
