There were plans in the USSR Government to create the country's largest polymetallic combine here. Zhayrem was a directive construction site of the last Soviet five-year plans and the main theme of numerous decrees at the highest level. Sovereign Kazakhstan organized a free economic zone here, and these places were visited repeatedly by foreign firms with intentions to invest their capital. But everything ended up with the fact that, unexpectedly for the collective of the joint-stock company Sary-Arkhapolimetall, 51 percent of the shares were sold at a coupon auction. This caused a shock in Zhayrem. Fazylzhan Sadvakasov, the president of the joint-stock company, made an urgent flight to Almaty, where he tried to have a talk with Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of State Property] regarding the "hasty" privatization of the enterprise without wide publicity and an individual project. An appeal to parliament and the president was approved at a stockholders' meeting concerning a restoration of violated laws and decrees of the government and the provisions of the state committee itself. After all, there was no mention of the Zhayrem ore-dressing combine in any of the published lists submitted at the auction of products. Nor was the cost of the charter fund evaluated, which was determined according to the status of April of last year and amounted to a total of 16 million tenge, while the real current price is tens of millions of dollars. This haste could have been explained if the combine were chronically unprofitable and a completely hopeless enterprise. But this is not the case at all. For example, last year the production of polymetallic ores was halted because of shipment distances and the unprofitableness of its processing. But a demand for manganese emerged, and the production was reprofiled. At that time, 84,000 tonnes were produced, and this year it is planned to extract seven times more from the earth. But the main thing is that ore consumers were found in Kazakhstan. It was requested by the Karmetkombinat, the Yermakovkiy ferro-alloys plant, and the Zhambylskiy chemical industry, which gave the practically stalled extraction a second wind. Also for the first time in recent years, the Sary-Arka Polymetall joint-stock company will acquire a solid profit. But in order to cover fully the growing demand of the republic for manganese and to come out on the foreign market, it is necessary to build a factory at a cost of $50 million. And if three times more is added to this to erect this kind of a factory for the processing of polymetallic ores, then it will be possible to restore the main production and make it profitable. Who will invest these sums, when 46 percent of the shares were acquired by Kazpotrebsoyuz? If Zhayrem proved to be not affordable for the former powerful Ministry of Nonferrous Metals, the present Ministry of Industry, and the Aksunkar holding company, then where will the resources and forces be gotten for the consumer cooperative? Its privatization funds bought shares of Zhayrem, as Sadvakasov told me, after submitting applications the night before the auction, without even becoming familiar with the large economic activity ahead of time. However, this is their right, and I have nothing against Kazpotrebsoyuz. There is concern only that one of the most important enterprises in the republic, which started to come out of the crisis independently, will become an object of discord, will not get a reliable manager, and, consequently, that no one will cut its knot of problems.
