Last year, Jiangsu's servce sector accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's gross domestic prouct. For a long time, the service industry had trailed the more developed manufacturing industry. Since the 1990's the local authorities have given priority to boost the province's service sector. Of the newly lanched industrial and commercial enterprises over the past two years, more than half were in the service sector. They range from commodity circulation and catering to real estate and entertainment. Most privtely-run busiesses are in the service industries. More than 300 private establishments are engaged in consultancy in science and technology. Investment in fixed assets of the service industry doubled last year, as it also did the previous year. Infrastructure such as transport and posts and telecommunications made remarkable achievements. In 1993, the province built additional electric generating capacity of two million kw and installed telephone exchanges with a capacity of 1.132 million lines. Construction is in full swing for highways connecting the provincial capital with Shanghai and other cities, ports and airports. As a major commodities transfer center in the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River, Jiangsu has set up close to the marketplace, more than 300 capital goods markets and over 130 financial markets. Overseas funds also poured into the developmet of tourism, retail business, property and infrastructure. Experts believe the flourishing service industry in Jiangsu helps optimize its overall industrial setup and improve the investment environment. A service industry with a core diversified pattern is shaping up in major cities along the Chang Jiang river as they try to bring themselves up to internationl standards.
