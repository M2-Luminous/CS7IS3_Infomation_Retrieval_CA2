FR940104-2-00017 FR940104-2-00012 Partial Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA On December 15, 1993, the Air Force signed the Partial ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions included in this partial ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB, filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 4, 1993. Norton AFB will formally close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (BRAC) (Public Law 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. Pending closure of Norton AFB, this ROD documents the decisions made by the Air Force on the division of parcels, the method parcels are to be conveyed or transferred, and the mitigation measures to be adopted. The primary decision in this ROD is to dispose of the aviation-related portion of Norton AFB in a manner that will enable the development of a regional airport with the capacity for expanding commercial and industrial development. The portion of the base covered by this ROD has been divided into ten (10) parcels. The airport parcel, including four (4) non aviation revenue producing parcels, will be conveyed at no-cost via public benefit conveyance for airport purposes. Three (3) parcels are to be offered for negotiated sale, and two (2) parcels will be reserved for transfer to another Federal Agency. The Air Force decided to defer decisions on roads, utilities, and portions of Norton AFB not covered by this ROD pending further analysis and review. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has jurisdiction by law regarding reuse of the runways and associated facilities as a civilian airport. A decision, if any, by the FAA to approve an airport layout plan (ALP) will be announced by a separate ROD issued by the FAA based on the analysis in the FEIS and any additional FAA analysis that may be required. The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations. All reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment. Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E. B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534. Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2802. Patsy J. Conner, Air Force Federal Register Liaison Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;82 Filed 1&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3910&hyph;01&hyph;M
