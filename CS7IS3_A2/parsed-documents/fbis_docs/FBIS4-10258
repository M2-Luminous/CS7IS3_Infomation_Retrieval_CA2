They will replace officials of the Budget and Finance Secretariat who have been on strike for the last 36 days. "The country will not go without a budget," the president said, as he announced that he had stopped payments to the strikers. "They will not be paid for the days that they are on strike," he stressed. [passage omitted] Legal expert Celso Bastos has said that Franco could be impeached [preceding word in English] for not having submitted to Congress the necessary documentation for the approval of this year's budget. The legal basis for an eventual request of impeachment is foreseen in Article No. 85, Paragraph VI of the Constitution. This says a crime has been committed if the president's actions abuse the budget law. Bastos said the fact that the country does not have an approved budget shows that Franco has violated the constitutional norm twice: For not having given Congress the documentation to approve the budget law, and for not permitting it to be approved.
