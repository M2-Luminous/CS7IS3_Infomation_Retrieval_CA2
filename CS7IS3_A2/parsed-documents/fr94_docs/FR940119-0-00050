FR940119-0-00050 FR940119-0-00014 In §650.24, paragraph (f)(6) was modified to add the phrase ``if the vessel has on board an authorizing letter from the Regional Director''. In §650.25, paragraph (b) was modified to cross reference correctly the call-in procedures described in §650.26(b). In §650.26, paragraph (a) was modified to correctly cross reference the small dredge program in §650.21(e). In §650.26, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) were modified to indicate that the Regional Director is to be notified ``through the VTS''. In §650.26, paragraph (a)(3) was modified to add the phrase ``or not functional''. In §650.26, paragraph (b) was modified to add language that is more specific regarding the call-in notification requirements of the vessel owner or authorized representative. In §650.26, paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4), the requirement that vessel owners or their authorized representative call-in 2 hours prior to leaving port and within 1 hour of returning to port was replaced with the provision that the DAS will begin and end upon receipt of the call. The Regional Director has determined that this less restrictive requirement is supportable by current technology without compromising the enforceability of this measure. In §650.40, paragraph (c), the phrase ``After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any other time,'' was added in order to clarify the Council's procedures when it is considering changes in management measures. In §650.40, paragraph (e)(3), the sentence ``The Council may reconsider its prior action and recommend a new action under paragraph (d) of this section.'' was deleted because it is considered to be unnecessary. Classification The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) determined that the FMP amendment that this rule would implement is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making that determination, has taken into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period. The Council prepared a final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) for Amendment 4, which was filed by the Environmental Protection Agency with the Office of the Federal Register. The Environmental Protection Agency has recommended that the National Marine Fisheries Service conduct studies in the near future to monitor the effect of scallop dredges on bottom habitat. The AA has determined that the preferred alternative of Amendment 4 versus the status quo is environmentally preferable upon review of the FSEIS and public comments. The FSEIS demonstrates that the preferred alternative contains management measures to rebuild the stock of Atlantic sea scallops, provides positive economic and social benefits to the fishing industry in the long term, and provides balance in the ecosystem in terms of the sea scallop resource. NMFS certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule may have significant effects on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. For the purposes of the RFA, the RIR is retitled as a RIR/regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). According to the RIR/RFA prepared by the Council, the management measures will have some negative impact on small entities. There are approximately 400&hyph;600 vessels that rely on scallops for a portion of their revenue. All are considered small entities. Of these, more than 150 vessels would not qualify for the vessel moratorium and may have to redirect effort into other fisheries. Approximately 63 percent of the 150 vessels, however, depend on sea scallops for 15 percent or less of their total revenue and may be able to compensate by participating in the general scallop fishery (no moratorium, landings up to 400 pounds (181.44 kg) per trip). For those vessels qualifying for the limited access fishery, there are significant short-term losses in revenue that are offset by long-term gains. The rule contains eight new collection-of-information requirements and also revises four existing requirements previously approved by OMB under Control Numbers 0648&hyph;0202 and 0648&hyph;0229 and 0648&hyph;0018. These collection-of-information requirements have been approved by OMB. Nevertheless, public comments are invited on the burden-hour estimates for the collection of information requirements as listed below. The new reporting requirements are: (1) Dealer permits (§650.6_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (5 minutes/response); (2) Operator permits (§650.5_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (1 hour/response); (3) Notice requirements for observer deployment (§650.28_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (2 minutes/response); (4) Proof of installation of vessel tracking system, (§650.25_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (2 minutes/response); (5) Automated vessel tracking system (§650.25_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (0 minutes/response); (6) Vessel call-in requirement (§650.25_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (2 minutes/response); (7) Days-at-sea exemption program (§650.27_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (2 minutes/response); (8) Vessel logbooks (§650.7_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0212) (5 minutes/response). Revisions to existing requirements are: (1) Limited access scallop permit appeals_appeal of denied permits will require written submission (§650.24_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (3 hours/response); (2) Days-at-sea appeals_appeal of the days-at-sea allocation will require written submission (§650.24_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0202) (5 hours/response); (3) Dealer purchase reports (§650.7_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0229) (2 minutes/response); (4) Annual processed products reports (§650.7_OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0018) (2 minutes/response).
