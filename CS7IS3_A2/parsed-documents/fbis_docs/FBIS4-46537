Housing for the Army. Status, Problems, and Ways of Finding Solutions." It seems unnecessary to spell out to our readers, servicemen, and military pensioners the reasons for which parliamentarians are turning their attention to this theme. I will just mention two aspects. First, the Russian Federation Government sent to the State Duma for examination a draft law stipulating the removal from existing legislation of a whole series of benefits for servicemen and their families. Second, the hearings were a last-ditch attempt somehow to exert influence primarily on the Russian Federation Government on the eve of the repeat discussion in the Duma of the draft law on the 1994 Federal Budget, in which, as we know, defense spending was cut by at least 18 trillion rubles [R]. And without the required sum of R55 trillion, how can we talk about the social protection of servicemen? First to outline their stances during the hearings were the Defense Ministry (Deputy Minister Colonel General Valeriy Mironov), and the Ministry of Finance (Sergey Kondrashov, deputy leader of Finance Ministry Department for the Defense Complex). Defense Ministry: Over 75 Percent of Officers' Families Have Incomes Below the Minimum Living Wage It has to be recognized that in recent years the country's leadership has demonstrated on several occasions its good intentions in respect of servicemen. Over 40 edicts, decrees, laws, and other legal acts have been issued which in one way or another protect the military and their nearest and dearest. There have also been state programs for housing construction, and for resettling and catering for troops withdrawn from abroad. And, finally, there are the basic guidelines for the Russian Federation Government activity on social policy for 1994, where, again in black and white, there is mention of the need to implement all (legislation-backed!) servicemen's rights. So what has the Army got as a result? I will cite Col. Gen. Valeriy Mironov (but, rest assured, hot on the heels of the deputy minister these words will be repeated to us at any Russian barracks): "There is a lack of decisions by the Russian Federation Government on implementing a number of paragraphs in the Russian Federation Law `On the Status of Servicemen,' the level of pay is extremely low, the number of homeless is rising, and psychological and physical overload owing to a shortage of manpower is on the increase." The quick-fire retort -- it's all been proclaimed, but it is not being implemented in practice: Namely, the right to a place of residence in any populated area of the country following discharge, the procedure for offering servicemen and their families accommodations following discharge, state insurance for servicemen, free shipment of a serviceman's personal property when transferring to a new service location.... A brief word on pay. Frankly, everything that needs to be said was said in the subhead -- just one in four families keeps its head above the poverty line. Is it really necessary to paint a vivid picture of officer life, the domestic existence of officer families, in order to depict precisely what this means? So much has been said about this already! To all appearances, in a country where the majority of the population only just makes ends meet, people are no longer shocked by the notion of a poverty-stricken officer. By way of an example, Col. Gen. Mironov cited the case of a worker with the most lowly qualifications at the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant [VAZ] who earns R1.5 million. It emerges that a first category military pilot would be better off nowadays resigning and going off to sweep up metal filings in a VAZ workshop. And, indeed, this is what they are doing. Most of them are men under 30, and generally the most promising, energetic, and intelligent officers. Accommodations are altogether a sore point. But particularly for those discharged into the reserves. For the latter, the program for providing accommodations in 1993 was only fulfilled to a level of 15 percent. For those still in service, somewhere in the region of 80 percent of what was planned was constructed. This figure altogether knocks you off your feet. But the thrust is one and the same: The volume of housing construction is declining. The deputy defense minister said simply: Today, the ministry has no opportunity to implement the government's decrees "On Granting Russian Federation Citizens in Need of Improved Accommodations Nonreturnable Subsidies To Construct or Acquire Housing," and "On Measures for the Social Protection of the Population Living in Closed Territorial-Administrative Formations." And there is no mention at all of implementing state programs -- at best, this aspect will hold its ground at last year's level. But you can go on analyzing the situation until you are blue in the face, and you can go on recounting disaster after disaster, but it all boils down to one thing: What is needed is money. And there is none. Ministry of Finance: The State's Economy Will Not Stretch to a Defense Budget of R55 Trillion However, in the opinion of Finance Ministry spokesman Sergey Kondrashov, the problem is one of how to "stretch" a defense budget albeit of just R37 trillion. As of today, the defense budget in the first five months of 1994 was financed to a level of just 77.1 percent. Let's think about this: While we argue over the missing R18 trillion, while statesmen strike sparks in heated debates, and we, here below, keep an eye on the battle of the titans in the hope that they do not deal the final blow to the Army -- all this time, the Armed Forces have been living for almost six months with this same financial noose, some R37 trillion in length, around its neck. Yet even this measly 37 trillion is not forthcoming, which is why the noose around the Army's neck is growing even tighter. It turns out that the whole debate surrounding the defense budget is purely theoretical: For economists from various schools, it is an opportunity to make a brilliant display of their erudition; for the deputies, it is a chance to perfect their debating skills; and for the politicians, it is a chance to score points in the eyes of gullible "soldier boys".... So what is going on -- is it all villainy on the part of the Ministry of Finance? For those who prefer independent analysis, I will cite the following information for perusal: First, according to the law presented by the government and adopted by the Duma, in the second quarter of 1994 finance will be issued at a speed "commensurate with the actual receipt into the Federal Budget of taxes and payments"; second, in the first five months of this year, 15 (yes, fifteen!) percent of the total taxes planned for in the draft annual budget were received into the budget. This figure was cited at the hearings by Sergey Kondrashov. You can argue the details as much as you like, accuse one another of bungling and abuses, and allocate billions and trillions on paper, but if the state is unable to collect the taxes, and if even at this early stage it is slashing the size of projected revenue, then what is the value of any state program? What is the value of laws which are not backed by a single kopeck? The unfortunate Finance Ministry representative first expressed doubts that it might be possible to cram the provision of all the Army's social needs into a sum as small (he agrees with this) as R37 trillion, and then he expressed doubts over the possibility of actually succeeding in scraping together even these R37 trillion. The forecast for budget receipts is forcing the Finance Ministry to resolve one specific task every month: namely, whom to underpay, and by how much. As a result, the debt to the military department has already hit 5.7 trillion. And so it is that the debt-ridden state in the form of the government is beginning to devise ways of offsetting this debt. If the trillions in taxation cannot be obtained from the commercial structures, then perhaps the pockets of the disciplined military can be fleeced? So it is that a law has been written which abolishes declared benefits. Pay has been frozen. And instead of a suitable food allowance, all they have received is compensation equal to one minimum wage. Indeed, the government has accumulated quite a lot of these fruitful ideas, the main one of which, it emerged, is not only to set a defense budget below even the lowest level, but also to underfinance even this miserliness. Any increase in pay can only be a pipe dream, as all that remains is to beseech the gods that, come Judgment Day, the cashier's grills might open. Meanwhile, in June the Army will be underpaid by an even greater margin than in May. This is what Kondrashov said, and he knows what he is talking about. It was also noted that, according to official calculations by the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of the Economy, the "light at the end of the tunnel" will only start glimmering at best at the end of 1995. But life has taught us that the wisest thing is to prepare for the worst nevertheless. A Few Words About `Ways of Resolving...'? The Defense Ministry has drawn up a whole package of draft laws for state programs aimed at returning our Armed Forces to the worthy place in society befitting their status. Some of them have been handed over to the Main Legal Administration under the Russian Federation president, and some are already with the Russian Federation Government. There are also specific proposals from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Economy. When it sits on Thursday the Duma Defense Committee will probably sum up the results of the hearings and compile its program of measures with due account of the sides' proposals. All proposals, of course, warrant a more detailed discussion on the pages of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, but it is simply that newspaper space is limited. But then it is better to talk about intentions once they begin to acquire the form of completed documents, ready for specific discussion. I will merely point out that the second part of the hearings progressed with the participation of representatives of commercial structures who had arrived with businesslike proposals on how to get moving on the "accursed" problem of housing in the Army. This is a separate topic for discussion. But as far as we can we will enlighten our readers about certain programs. The idea that the might of the Russian Army will "blossom" through national business structures is emerging altogether somewhat surreptitiously. The idea is preposterous, of course. But then it is painfully disagreeable to think that our Army should have to vegetate in the outer darkness without money for another two years at least, and maybe even more. Who, then, will emerge out of this "limbo" into God's world, and with what? A section with a 45-mm gun and one missile? Just as in the famous book which reminds us to this day of the glory which we have inherited, the wealth of experience of defeat and victory. But, as Kondrashov said, the Army will only be able to extract itself from this impasse in conjunction with the entire national economy. And without harboring illusions.
