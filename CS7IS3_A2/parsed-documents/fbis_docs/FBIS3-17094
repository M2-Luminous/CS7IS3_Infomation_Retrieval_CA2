"We view them as a substantial link in the general chain of international efforts aimed at untying the Bosnian knot," he said. Nevertheless, the diplomat said, there are still several unclear questions, above all concerning the possible status of the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and territorial limits. "Considering that relations between the Serbs and the Croats are of key importance in the endeavors to resolve the entire Yugoslav crisis, Russian diplomacy is building up its efforts in this direction along the Belgrade-Zagreb and the Zagreb-Knin line," he said. "We expect that it will become possible to reach an agreement on ceasing fire and halting military actions on Tuesday [22 March] as a result of talks to be held in the Russian embassy in Zagreb between the Croat leaders and local Serbs," he said.
