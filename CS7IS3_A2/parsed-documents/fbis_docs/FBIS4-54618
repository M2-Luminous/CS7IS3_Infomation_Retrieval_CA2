"The inventory fully exposed the two countries' different views on the problems complicating mutual relations. Differences in opinion are already appearing in their approach towards a fundamental agreement which, according to Bratislava, would guarantee the inviolability of the border defined by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon," the paper says. It notes that Moravcik believes that the rapid conclusion of a fundamental treaty between the two countries with a clause on the border would help resolve other issues. However, Boross favors the opposite approach; the gradual elimination of problems, starting with minor ones and ending up with the most serious ones, which would result in the signing of the basic document. SME says that both approaches are logical and that Hungary's attitude need not necessarily be malicious, but only a different viewing of priorities. Slovakia considers the issue of its territorial integrity of primary importance, whilst Hungary considers the minority issue of key importance. "The two issues, of course, are closely linked but unfortunately they have blocked each other so far," the paper writes. "The Komarno inventory showed that the mutual trust deficit is not so high.... The fact that a week before parliamentary elections the Hungarian Premier considered it necessary to catch up with Hungarian opposition leaders as regards contacts with Slovakia is a signal that the Hungarian voter wants relations with his neighbor to improve. This can be considered a basis (for development of bilateral relation) irrespective of who wins the elections in Hungary," the paper says in conclusion.
