Monetary indicators in the report by the Information Center--which is overseen by Dr. Hisham al-Sharif, an advisor to the administrative development minister--point to a stable average interest rate for deposits in Egyptian pounds since last July. That rate remains at 12.5 percent. However, in actuality, public-sector banks with accumulated liquidity are paying 11 percent to 11.5 percent for three-month deposits; the longer the deposit term is, the lower these rates are. Small banks are paying the lowest rates, due to their more difficult circumstances and relatively high risks. Between April 1993 and April 1994, the interest rate for short-term U.S. dollar deposits remained stable at around 3.04 percent. The average interest rate for treasury notes has continued to drop gradually, reaching 13.4 percent during the first week of April 1994, compared to 14 percent at the start of 1994. Experts believe that the drop is a sign of the market's health, because the notes are devoid of risks, and it is senseless for their interest rates to be higher than bank deposit rates. Also, the continued drop in the treasury note rate will compel some who save in treasury notes to go to the capital market in search of higher returns. Special Rates Given by Large Banks The average discount rate, which is the rate the central bank charges for loans to banks, continued to drop, reaching 16.06 percent in March 1994 and 16 percent in the first week of April 1994. However, in practice, the banks are lending to enterprises at an interest rate 2.5 percent higher than the discount rate. Thus, loans for some industrial activities have rates of 18 percent, while loans for commerce have slightly lower rates. At the same time, some large banks are lending to some of their clients at 13 percent, because these banks need to invest their liquidity surpluses to offset the cost of deposits. On the other hand, the index number of the loan and discount balance at the end of 1993 is the same as that of March 1992, which is connected to the current slump. The lending rate for U.S dollars was 5.04 percent during the first week of April 1994, which is the same rate as that of March 1993. Exchange rates for the main foreign currencies rose in general during the first months of 1994. Between January and March, the U.S. dollar rose from 337.24 piasters to 337.94 piasters; the European Currency Unit [ECU], from 367.68 piasters to 375.09 piasters; the pound sterling, from 493.99 piasters to 494.85 piasters; the German mark, from 192.96 piasters to 197.6 piasters; the French franc, from 56.78 piasters to 58.06 piasters; and the Japanese yen, from 299.8 piasters to 328.07 piasters per 100 yen. During the first week of April 1994, the rates for the German mark, French franc, and ECU fell slightly, while those for the other currencies rose. Explanation for Drop in Inflation The monthly inflation rate--i.e., the rate at which consumer prices increase--increased by 0.5 percent in January 1994 and by 1.2 percent in February. Thus, the annual basis for inflation rates, which indicates the rate of change in a month relative to the same month of the previous year, reached 7.4 percent during January and 7.3 percent during February 1994. The annual average inflation rate, which better reflects inflation, reached 11.8 percent during January and dropped to 11.4 percent during February. We asked Dr. Mukhtar Khattab, the chief of the decisionmaking support section in the Information Center of the Cabinet, how inflation can drop while the prices of some commodities, including rice and sugar, have risen in previous months. He said that the consumer price index is one of the best practical methods for measuring inflation. However, it does have several shortcomings: It is based on a single consumer basket, whereas in reality different groups in society have different consumer baskets, depending on their social level. The Egyptian index prepared by the Statistics Agency contains 402 goods and services. The annual base of inflation during February was 7.3 percent. But the rate of inflation for the prices of some goods and services included in the indicator was higher than 7.3 percent during that month: Fish prices rose by 14.7 percent, housing and fuel prices rose by 10.4 percent, prices for pharmaceutical and medical instruments rose by 16.8 percent, meat and poultry prices rose by 10.3 percent, prices for cereals and starchy foodstuffs rose by 11 percent, ready-made clothing prices rose by 9.7 percent, and the price of sugar rose by 11 percent. However, the indicator measures the average price of goods and services according to their relative weight in the consumer commodities basket. Thus, a 10-percent rise in fuel prices does not mean a 10-percent rise in inflation, because the weight of fuel in the consumer's budget may be 5 percent. Thus, the effect of such an increase on inflation in 1971, for example, was canceled out. On the other hand, a drop in the prices of some commodities may cancel out increases in the prices of other commodities, so that the consumer price index drops. Last February, the indicator of dry legumes dropped by 0.5 percent, while prices for dairy products and cheese rose by only 0.4 percent, restaurant and hotel prices remained unchanged, beverage and cigarette prices remained unchanged, and prices for furniture, carpets, and household effects rose by 3.6 percent.
