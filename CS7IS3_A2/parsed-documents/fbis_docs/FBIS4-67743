FBIS4-67743 "jptnd003__l94012" JPRS-TND-94-003-L JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 29 March 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA General Denies Biological Weapons Report General Denies Biological Weapons Report LD2903213394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1609 GMT 29 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD2903213394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Deputy head of Russian troops for chemical and biological defenses General Valentin Yevstigneyev [name as received] has described as groundless any suspicion about Moscow's violation of the international ban on the development, production or storage of biological weapons. He was commenting on a Sunday Times publication which alleged, referring to intelligence sources and three Russian "defectors," that the Russian Defence Ministry was engaged in the development of biological weapons behind Yeltsin's back. Yevstigneyev does not consider the paper's report unusual given the background of continued Western accusations against Russia concerning the developing of such weapons. He said that in the past, such campaigns were timed to coincide with major international talks on banning biological or chemical weapons in an effort to divert attention from the West's own programs which were in violation of the 1972 convention. The general said the Sunday Times publication had emerged in the run up to a session by a preparatory committee intended to clear the ground for a special conference for measures to verify the compliance with the 1972 convention. Moscow is expected to continue work on possible verification measures at that session, Yevstigneyev said.
