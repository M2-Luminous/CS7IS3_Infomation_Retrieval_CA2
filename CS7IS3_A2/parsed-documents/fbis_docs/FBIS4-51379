The project consists of 358 drinking water works funded with the Japanese Government loans. In the past, half of the farmers of Guizhou, a province situated on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, faced difficulties in drawing potable water from underground water sources. In April 1991, the Chinese and Japanese Governments signed an agreement on using 1.5 billion yen to open up underground water reserves in Guizhou Province. Zhang Yuqin, deputy governor of Guizhou Province, said that by the end of March this year, the projects were all completed. She said that the Japanese-funded drinking water project has also prompted Guizhou to improve the quality of drinking water supplies and now more than 12.3 million farmers have access to clean water. She said that this year, about 1.1 million additional farmers will have piped-in tap water.
