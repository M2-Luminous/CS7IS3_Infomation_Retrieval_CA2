FR940912-2-00020 FR940912-2-00017 Financial Assistance Award; Florida Department of Community Affairs AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(ii)(A&hyph;F), The U.S. Department of Energy Region IV Support Office, through the Golden Field Office, intends to award a grant to the Florida Department of Energy Affairs/State Energy Office to analyze and develop an approach to using solar power in emergency management and disaster relief and compile the results in a ``How to Do'' manual that will benefit government agencies, emergency management organizations and relief workers. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Florida State Energy Office conducted several exercises, in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, to test the feasibility of using solar power as an alternative electricity source in disaster relief. Photovoltaic cells were used to power communication devices, refrigerators for cooling vaccines, security lights, etc. The Florida Energy Office, having already performed such exercises, is aptly qualified to implement the proposed study. Programmatic evaluation has shown that such exercises are highly feasible with a high probability for success. The Department of Energy has interest in further developments and studies relating to the use of solar energy in disaster relief. The published results, which will be an available resource to a variety of organizations and agencies, will support the use of solar energy as a renewable energy resource. The proposed award meets the criteria for noncompetitive financial assistance specified in paragraph 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B). Department of Energy support of this activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and the Department knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.
