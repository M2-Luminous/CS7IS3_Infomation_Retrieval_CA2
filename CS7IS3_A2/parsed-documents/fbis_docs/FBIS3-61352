He Saw Kravchuk. He Won"] [Text] On Wednesday night, young followers of Michurin from Rukh and the USS [Ukrainian Student Union] met a high-ranking visitor at the Borispol airport, where several flights, including one to France, were delayed in honor of Bill Clinton's visit. The imagination of Michurin's followers cross-bred a bizarre hybrid on their signs--"Clinton + Kravchuk = Zhirinovskiy." However, the presidents did not know this, because the picketers who, according to them, had gotten the blessing for this action from Vyacheslav Chornovil, together with their modest militia escort, remained at the opposite entrance to the airport. At precisely the time when they were tirelessly chanting "Kravchuk, retire," Clinton was joking that, if Kravchuk did not hold his high position, he would offer him the job of the press secretary of the White House. Today, on Friday, the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States are supposed to sign a trilateral agreement according to which Ukraine will give up all of its strategic nuclear weapons, receiving in exchange nuclear fuel for nuclear power stations (for the highly enriched uranium that is placed in nuclear weapons) and monetary compensation, the amount of which has not been ultimately determined but, according to preliminary projections, will not exceed $1.5 billion. The U.S. President promised that Ukraine will receive some compensation for tactical nuclear weapons removed by Russia--actually from the United States, greater financial support than in 1993 ($155 million) and lobbying on behalf of Ukraine in the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The U.S. President announced the establishment of the Enterprise Fund, the monies of which will be addressed to Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova in order to assist small enterprises and privatization. This is precisely how, very cheaply, Ukraine was persuaded to surrender virtually all nuclear arsenals which until recently were the main "emergency store" of Ukraine, saved for the rainiest day of the national economy. Most likely, today Leonid Kravchuk will affix his signature to a trilateral compact. However, no matter what form it assumes (an agreement, a treaty that the parliament must mandatorily ratify, or a communique, a statement that becomes legally valid after being signed by the head of state), an overwhelming majority of the Supreme Council will not approve the presidential decision. It could be assumed that, having exceeded his authority, Kravchuk is ignoring the parliament and heading for authoritarian power, if it were not for the land under the president's chair shaking in an increasingly perceptible earthquake of a lack of confidence on the part of both the lower strata and the supreme echelons of power. Leonid Kravchuk has always left one move to retreat. It appears that lately he has been playing without writing down his moves, and his intuition has failed him. As he expressed his expectation that the Supreme Council would support his decision because "the parliament grows wiser together with life," Leonid Makarovych may have already imagined the forthcoming battle in the parliament. After all, as they are struggling for seats in the post-March parliament, the people's deputies will arm themselves with the thesis about the betrayal of the national interests of Ukraine by the president. The chances of Ivan Plyushch to secure the presidency are growing automatically (of course, if Kravchuk keeps his word and does not freeze the date of the presidential election). Did it make sense to surrender the missiles with lightning speed, at ridiculous prices, when our eastern neighbor, with its very unpredictable future and in the accent of Zhirinovskiy, is putting pressure on all sensitive points of Ukraine ever more perceptibly?! Did it make sense to bid farewell to the weapons without having obtained full-fledged security guarantees? After all, the American initiative Partnership for Peace which was approved by NATO and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--the ones that Clinton guaranteed in Kiev--do not provide full-fledged guarantees. As the U.S President assured us, we will receive a "considerable amount of funds" in keeping with the Nunn-Lugar law (a program for assistance to Ukraine by the United States); these funds may be used, in particular, for defense and conversion. This may be the most dramatic aspect at present--given a lack of large-scale, specific reform programs, there are reasons to doubt that American aid will not be dispersed in economic chaos.
