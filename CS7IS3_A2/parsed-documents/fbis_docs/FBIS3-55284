Three weeks later Democratic Party of Russia headquarters is receiving telephone calls again. People are now asking: Are the Travkinites preparing to work in the State Duma? It is said that people from government blocs are already sharing out the positions.... What is the party doing? PRAVDA asked Vyacheslav Smirnov, secretary of the Democratic Party of Russia's ruling body, to talk about this. [Smirnov] Our deputies did not take [New Year] leave, and on 1 January party leader Nikolay Ilich Travkin relinquished his powers as head of the administration of Moscow Oblast's Shakhovskiy Rayon and set about preparing for serious work in the Duma. Our faction, although for the time being this is a conditional name, is not very big. That is why consultations with deputies from other blocs are now going on. There have been meetings with the Agrarians, the Communists, the Women, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, "Yabloko," and even the Liberal Democratic Party's "second echelon." The main topic is how to stop the Duma turning into a farce. There are fears that people will immediately try to discredit it. [Nikiforova] Have Democratic Party of Russia deputies agreed to do only ordinary work or do they aspire to leading posts in the Duma and in committees? [Smirnov] Our deputies have no particular aspirations. But there have been enticing offers. For instance, to S. Glazyev and O. Bogomolov. The party's ruling body has advised them not to refuse. [Nikiforova] What is S. Govorukhin doing? [Smirnov] The party has given Stanislav Sergeyevich the task of completing the film "The Great Criminal Revolution." If deputies are able to watch it at the beginning of the Duma's proceedings I am sure that work will proceed more productively.
