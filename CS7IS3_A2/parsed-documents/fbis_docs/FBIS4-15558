He explained that instead of the words "military installation," which can be understood as a technical facility, a term "military base" has crept in, which radically changes the meaning of the document. Sergey Kravchenko said that "a special commission for investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case will be set up in the next few days." In his view, it can be set up "by the president himself or the head of his administration." The deputy head of the Russian president's administration did not rule out the possibility of "this being not just a technical mistake but a political action aimed at disrupting the meeting between the Russian and Latvian heads of state."
