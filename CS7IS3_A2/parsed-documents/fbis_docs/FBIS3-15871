"PRES leader Sergey Shakhray had received an invitation, but since he is now away on a business trip, other PRES representatives were not invited, Sergey Stankevich told the newspaper's correspondent. "Mr. Stankevich said the meeting had been organised in principle to reconcile the ultra wings of the political spectrum, although it is difficult to agree that the communists, agrarians and sectoral trade unions, on the one hand, and Russia's Choice and independent trade unions, on the other, can be viewed as such. "Grigoriy Yavlinsky was not invited, maybe, because he does not represent any of the ultra forces. Mr. Yavlinsky treated this calmly, remarking that it was somehow strange to summon people to reach some accord on the next day after the president's meeting with the U.S. ex-president was cancelled because the latter permitted himself to meet with opposition figures". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Aleksey Vasilyev, director of the Institute of African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who believes that "Islamic Fundamentalism" does not pose real danger to Russia. There are other dangers, though, namely, that of extremism if the crisis, both the socio-economic and inter-ethnic one, continues to intensify, the danger of a rise in the threshold of non-receptivity of information and of the loss of ability for a dialogue." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey. He said in particualr as follows: "In Russia, there are many people discontented with the break-up of the Soviet Union, dissatisfied with the fact that the republics of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus and eastern European countries are no longer within Russia's sphere of influence. "They believe that a new Russia should be created within the borders of the former Soviet Union. It is only natural that this is the subject of concern for many countries, not only Turkey. If Russia is going to become an imperialist state, it would shake others' confidence in itself. "If this happens, that would be undoubtedly a blow to many countries which would view Russia as a threat... If we maintain peace and cooperation, that would be of benefit to both Russia and other countries". ROSSIISKIE VESTI on food quality in Russia: "Over the past three years, the food quality situation has become particularly exacerbated. In Russia as a whole, bacteriological inspections revealed that from 12 to 15 per cent of dairy products, fish and fish products, and from 7 to 10 per cent of meat products did not meet standard requirements. "In some regions, the percentage is twice as high. Even with such an acute situation, legislative and legal standards fail to promote food safety. A number of essential laws have not been adopted up to now and some standards have not been even drawn up". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the radioactive contamination issue: "Last year, about 237,000 people, who live in the areas of radioactive contamination (as a result of the breakdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power station -- note by ITAR-TASS) were examined. Fifty-eight per cent of adults and 72 per cent of children from among those examined turned out to be seriously ill". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the cost of services: "Since the beginning of the year, the cost of every-day services for the population of Russia has almost doubled. Housing rent rose by 84 per cent, hot water supply by 58 per cent, the cost of some types of medical services by 18-28 per cent and consumer services by 12-26 per cent". TRUD carries an interview with Sergey Samoilov, deputy chief of the Territorial Development Department of the administration of the Russian president. Samoilov stated: "One is put on one's guard by a high activity of opposition political forces that seek at all costs to take a dominant position in power bodies, using the election campaign (in the regions -- note by ITAR-TASS) to discredit the presidential policy of reforms. "Most regions have a rather tense socio-political situation, which is sure to tell on voters' turnout, questioning the possibility of holding elections in a number of regions within the time-limit stipulated by decrees, or will affect the quality of the elections. This applies to areas in the far north and Magadan region". ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the German Lufthansa air company broadens the sphere of its influence in the Russian air transportation sector. Lufthansa now runs flights from St Petersburg to Hamburg and Frankfurt-am-Main, and will soon introduce regular flights from Pulkovo to Munich every Saturday. The cheapest round-trip ticket costs 565 U.S. dollars.
