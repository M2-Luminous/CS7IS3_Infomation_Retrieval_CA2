In an article today, the newspaper said that the U.S. President and the Congress are fully aware that all the reports of the UN Special Commission have emphasized that Iraq has met all of the requirements in the Security Council resolutions. The paper added: This Iraqi commitment should urge the Security Council to adhere to its own commitments regarding the lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. It said: Ignoring this fact exposes the evil intentions aimed at infringing on Iraq's legitimate right and the determination to perpetuate the unjust siege against Iraq without regard to the suffering of the Iraqi people. The newspaper said that further criminal behavior in the service of Zionism and backwardness clearly shows the extent of the hatred towards Iraq, which is due only to Iraq's defense of its freedom and independent decisionmaking. The newspaper emphasized that the successive pretexts the evil ones present with the aim of maintaining the siege will soon be refuted and exposed to the world, and even to many permanent Security Council members. The newspaper said faithful and patient Iraq will never accept this evil U.S. behavior, and will not bow to the continuation of injustice it faces. BABIL concluded by recalling that Iraq has fulfilled the commitments imposed on it according to the Security Council resolutions, and the council should, in turn, fulfill its commitments in accordance with the same resolutions. The Security Council should not bow to the U.S. terrorism that has gone beyond all reasonable limits and become a sword threatening free peoples everywhere and even the big powers.
