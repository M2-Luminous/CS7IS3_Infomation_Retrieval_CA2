Former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu, and Masatoshi Ito, one of the SDPJ upper house members who voted against the government-proposed political reform bills on 21 January, join in the debate via remote hookup in the latter part of the program which is moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama. After a lengthy introduction of the guests, moderator Kuroiwa at 2238 GMT begins the discussion by noting the reform bills were rejected unexpectedly by the upper house, and asks Mori of the LDP how he feels about it. Mori, though speaking on behalf of the opposition camp, says it was "very regrettable" and adds: "While the Diet is a forum for the representatives of the people, it was unable to understand the bills." The LDP general secretary says, "Another point to note -- aside from the question of the substance of the bills -- is that this body -- the House of Councillors -- is independent, and is separate from the House of Representatives. This fact has been more or less ignored by many, particularly by those of the ruling parties, and the members of the House of Councillors have been angered by it." Asked how he feels about the voting results, the SDPJ's Nosaka also says it was "very regrettable" that the bills were rejected. Nosaka says: "The party must, once again, do all it can do to have the bills passed during the current session of the Diet." After some introductory remarks by the newscasters and a review of the political scene by guest political commentators, full-fledged debate starts at 2338 GMT. Moderator Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment on reports that the LDP wants the bill dealing with political corruption to be taken up first, ahead of other bills. Mori explains the history of why the efforts for political reform started, recalling, "The people became disappointed with close ties between politics and money, as well as by scandals involving politicians, and they started to distance themselves from politics. Political reform started about six years ago from the desire to do something about this situation." Asked whether Mori believes the bill on political corruption should be acted on ahead of other bills during the one-week remaining of the current Diet session, he says there are some who think that way, but he declines to give his own view. Kuroiwa asks Mori if the LDP would agree to pass the bills if the coalition accepts amendments to the bills proposed by the LDP before the bills are put to the vote. Mori responds: "The bills were in fact scrapped, and rejected. Now that this has happened, the various organizations within the party have to agree on a policy to deal with the matter. I think that will be done on Monday (24 January) or Tuesday." At 2256 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe is asked to give his view. Watanabe notes that the LDP leadership made a proposal to his party on changes in the government bills last week. Watanabe says his party is willing to make daring concessions in accepting the terms of the LDP in the forthcoming negotiations. The moderator recalls that the terms demanded by the LDP include one on accepting political fund contributions by business organizations, and asks Nosaka of the SDPJ if his party can accept such a condition. Nosaka says his party cannot accept everything in the LDP terms, but adds his party is willing to negotiate as much as possible and make a final decision after the negotiations are completed. At 2304 GMT, the SDPJ's Ito, one of the rebels who voted against the political reform bills in the upper house session, is asked to comment via the remote hookup. Ito insists that what the people of the nation really want in political reform is to prevent political corruption and that, as such, what is needed is a bill dealing with corruption. He says the election system has nothing to do with political corruption. At 2305 GMT, moderator Matsuyama asks Akamatsu if the SDPJ upper house members who voted against the bills will be expelled from the party. Akamatsu says: "I asked Chairman Murayama and Secretary-General Kubo to deal strictly with or expel from the party the rebels who ignored the party resolution and voted against the bills at a critical time for the SDPJ. Mr. Murayama and Mr. Kubota, needless to say, said they would deal strictly with the rebels because the situation this time was completely different from the time when some SDPJ lower house members voted against the bills." Asked what he thinks of Akamatsu's comment, Ito says the SDPJ mainstream was to pass the bill on prevention of political corruption first. Akamatsu immediately refutes this, saying: "The party convention, held on 11 and 12 January, unanimously agreed to resolutely promote political reform." He adds that "those who cannot abide by the party resolution have no right to remain in the party." Nosaka agrees with Akamatsu and says: "We will have a meeting with local representatives at 1500 (0600 GMT) on 26 January to hear what they have to say. We will also listen to the opinions of the party's upper house executives. After that, we will deal strictly with the rebels." At 2309 GMT, Kobayashi points out that public disclosure of their internal problems will be a big blow to the SDPJ, and that it may be better to split the party into two because the so-called rebels have different beliefs from other SDPJ members. Nosaka responds to Kobayashi, saying that although there are many different opinions, the party has been very democratic in determining party resolutions or in finding "the greatest common denominator." Going back to the issue of political reform, Kuroiwa asks Watanabe what the coalition parties are going to do about the bills during the remaining period of the current Diet session. Watanabe says: "Of course, we will call for a joint conference of the two houses. This is our constitutional right." He also explains the need to hold a top-level meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono to settle the political reform issue. Asked what he thinks of the proposal to hold such a meeting, Mori says: "As I briefly explained earlier, I think it is a good idea. However, the important thing is whether Mr. Hosokawa has discretionary power." Mori then criticizes Prime Minister Hosokawa for lack of leadership and failing to have the political reform bills approved. As for the possibility of dissolving the lower house, and thereby forcing a general election, Watanabe and Mori agree that the time is not right because the government has many "important and imminent tasks," including the Japan-U.S. summit and budget compilation. The live relay ends at 2330 GMT.
