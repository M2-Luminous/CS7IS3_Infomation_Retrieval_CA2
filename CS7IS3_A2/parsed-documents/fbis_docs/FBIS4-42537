The international financial community pledged to deliver the aid over the next 12 months but the funding might even be increased in the next few months, sources said at the Paris office of the World Bank. The announcement came as Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev signed the Paris Charter of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on the third and final day of a visit here. Kyrgyzstan's donors include France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States, as well as a dozen international organizations. The donors meeting in the French capital welcomed application in the small republic of 4.5 million people of a program of the International Monetary Fund in the wake of the collapse of the Kyrgyz economy following the breakup of the Soviet Bloc. But they insisted on the need for speeding up industrial restructuring efforts and for strengthening the social security system. Kyrgyzstan is also trying to attract foreign investors, and Akayev told some French business leaders on Friday that his republic would be "a good bridgehead for an effort to conquer Central Asian markets." Mitterrand hailed the country for making "a real effort" to move "toward a democratic status" after Akayev signed the Charter at the Elysee Palace, a document which the French president described as "the act by which the Cold War ended." Akayev said he hoped the European Union would help his country remain "the Central Asian Switzerland." [passage omitted].
