Its goal is to intimidate the world with the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. However, concealed behind the pathos and demagoguery of the authors of the appeal is blatant deception meant for dilettantes. It is stressed in the appeal that the danger lies in the ``absence of systematic technological servicing,'' ``failure to replace components in time,'' and ``conducting repairs not provided for by the specifications.'' However, it is... Russian specialists, who are supposed to watch and fulfill all of this together with our specialists. Yes, yes, precisely Russian. In accordance with the interstate agreement on scheduled and repair servicing of intercontinental ballistic missiles located on the Ukrainian territory. As Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister V. Shmarov pointed out at a recent news conference dealing with the ratification of START-1 by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, this agreement is presently being fulfilled, and there is no reason to be concerned about the state of the intercontinental ballistic missiles. Nor are the Russian scientists sincere when the write the following in their appeal: ``Those politicians who maintain that nuclear munitions may be dismantled in Ukraine are not telling the truth.'' Not a single politician made any such statements anywhere. On the contrary, that same Valeriy Shmarov said at that same news conference that the nuclear warheads may only be dismantled at manufacturer plants, more specifically, in Russia. Therefore, the appeal by Russian designers and scientists confuses the vile and the holy. Striving to obtain, as soon as possible, our intercontinental ballistic missiles, in addition to the already obtained operational and tactical nuclear weapons, to start selling nuclear weapons components in the West, and to earn further billions of dollars, the authors of the appeal, on the directive from the Kremlin, are trying to obscure the issue.
