The impression is created that it is being influenced by the old Soviet compass whose arrow always deviated toward abstract globalism and a view of foreign policy as a kind of chess game in which the moves and the maneuvers themselves were more important than the end result. In any case, it is impossible not to see that the magnetic lines of force of the past continue to hold us in the field of an artificial world view that has a rather weak association with the realities of our situation. Russia is an absolutely new country even in its physical parameters: in the size and composition of the population, territorial configuration, and resources and capabilities. It is in another geopolitical position, and it has new neighbors virtually along the entire land perimeter. There has also been a fundamental change in the architectural outline of the rest of the world. Structures of force do not protrude as much, and are increasingly being pushed into the background by a complex economic framework. It is precisely for this reason that it seems that the very first task of foreign policy is to realize the changes that have occurred and are occurring, and to understand their significance and consequences for the national interests of Russia. In turn, these national interests must be deduced not mainly from the past but from the future of the new Russia, in which it should occupy a worthy place in the higher league of world powers. There can be only one path to this objective--utmost realism in foreign policy. In the meantime, unfortunately, we have not yet set foot on this path. The politicians are saying, to the point and not to the point, that Russia is a great power. The importunate invocations on this subject reflect not only a certain inferiority complex--which, however, is fully explained by the current unhappy state of affairs in the country--but, what is worse, this slogan is used to cover loss of face in the international arena, uncertainty of action, and lack of consistency, not to mention integrity of policy. Moreover, I am more than convinced that the problems in foreign policy are associated first and foremost not so much with the situation in the economy of Russia as with the still unrepaired mechanism for making decisions in the state, the obvious muddle in the higher echelons of authority, and the lack of normal cooperation between departments. Russian diplomats are compelled to work in a mode of reducing damage to the country's interests. From this stems the desire to stand on the stilts of "great Russia." Although it is perfectly obvious that there is no sense to this. Russia does not need anything in recognition of its status as a world power. It has had such during the course of centuries. No one is refuting this now either. But whether it will be retained in the future is a question whose answer depends on us alone. But our current behavior bewilders me, and at times arouses a sense of shame. It vacillates, as it did in the old Soviet times, between two poles--threats and ingratiation. Previously we were intimidated with nuclear war, now--with the collapse of Russia, a result that will be bad for everyone. Yesterday we were prepared to pay dearly for "class enemies" to receive our "general secretary" on a visit and show him first-class honor, today we are seeking membership in the G-7. Why? Probably in order that they show respect. Is it necessary to think about this now? In my opinion, it is far more important for Russia to transform the CIS into a likeness of the Western G-7, to arrange real cooperation with the leaders of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and other Commonwealth states. It is with this that we should be occupied most of all, and not soliciting special status in the "Partnership for Peace" program. Unquestionably, we should join this program and set ourselves up there in such a way that Russia will be considered and its interests taken into account. One is struck by the insensitivity of professional diplomats toward the falsity of the formula of conducting affairs with the United States "on equal terms." But, for example, relations with Lithuania or Burundi will not be built on "equal terms?" There is the generally recognized principle of reciprocity, which lies at the basis of normal interstate relations, and our inferiority complex is evident here. After all, we are not talking about reaching agreement with the Americans on a "treaty in which no one wins." Such things simply do not happen in international relations. It is enough to look at how affairs are conducted in the West. What a sharp dispute arose quite recently between the European Union and the United States, especially between Paris and Washington about trade in agricultural products. The United States is not averse to establishing quotas on the import of Japanese automobiles and literally breaking into the communications equipment market in Japan with force. But we frequently see political discrimination where generally a normal fierce struggle is going on for markets. And it must be understood that no one will just simply yield their share of sales to Russia, especially in the arms market. Whining and complaining will not produce anything in this regard. What we must persistently try to achieve is that the field on which the competition is being played is even for everyone and that the rules of the game for Russia are the same as for others. This, incidentally, will also show the true interest of the West in the success of our reforms and democratic reorganization. Symbolic charitable assistance not only does not produce anything, it casts a shadow on the purity of the intentions of our "benefactors," and, I fear, can even cloud mutual relations. If by virtue of objective reasons we are not now prepared to compete with the West in some markets, then it is at least necessary for us not to give markets in CIS countries to others and also to fight for markets of the states of Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries. This is not a question of economics. It is only part of the main task of Russian foreign policy--the construction of a new system of mutual relations of states on the territory of the former Union. Herein lies the really vitally important national interest of Russia. The priority of this specific direction is recognized by everyone, but unfortunately nothing of substance has been done, or is being done. Modern history does not know of cases in which any state would end up in a situation where there was a complete lack of regulation of its relations with a dozen contiguous countries, each of which was connected with it by a thousand threads--historical, political, economic, and purely human. The broken-up family was left to live in the same home, dividing it with plywood walls into separate apartments. But what about sewers and gas, electricity, and a common television antenna? Well, just as in normal life--sit down and come to an agreement: Who is responsible for this, how much, and who has to be paid... The initial confusion can still be explained somehow. None of us were psychologically prepared for the new realities. Russian diplomats discovered that they knew New Zealand better than Ukraine or Armenia. Another psychological barrier arose: How to conduct affairs--according to kinship, or as with everyone else. In principle, we now find ourselves in this position of diplomatic imponderability, although embassies have already appeared and relations have been somewhat formalized. Of course, they are far from the classical diplomatic forms. But it is already clear now that Russia will only be able to regulate affairs with its new neighbors within the scope of political negotiations in accordance with established world practice and on the basis of international law. If all the unresolved problems with all the "old" countries are placed on one scale, and on the other, for example, only Russian-Ukrainian problems, the latter will turn out to be much heavier than the former. It is necessary to start here not just from zero but with big negative quantities. Only resentfulness, suspicion, and distrust remain from living in the Union community. Extreme nationalism, ethnic intolerance, mutual vindictiveness, and open hostility have come to the surface. This does not happen by itself. It is necessary to oppose the process of estrangement with a calm and patient search for normal cooperation on those questions that constitute mutual interest and provide a benefit to both sides. They lie almost completely in the sphere of economics. It must be said clearly that there can be no question of returning to anything similar to the old "communal life." The objective is the same: cooperation in the sphere of economics, without which neither Russia nor other states will pull themselves out of the crisis condition quickly. We are all linked to what was created as a monolithic economy. For the present, none of us have any other, and none other will appear soon. It is necessary to show common sense here and come to an agreement on the principles and specific variants of cooperation in both the sphere of production and in the sale of products. There can be only one basis for such cooperation--mutual interest. However, if one is to be a realist, it is necessary to recognize also that Russia will have to be a donor in relations with at least some of its partners for some time. To what extent this is possible and expedient is another question. It is not a question of charity: Russia, possibly more than anyone else, is interested in the restoration of economic ties, in the creation of markets for its products, and in arranging broad trade with its immediate neighbors. It must also take the initiative in formulating questions of economic cooperation. Perhaps there is no more important task today. Therefore, one can only be amazed when we lack not only our own initiative but we also do not have time to respond to the initiative of others. During his visit to Moscow, Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed the idea of creating a Euro-Asiatic union, an idea that is undoubtedly interesting and moves in the direction of developing the integration process. Of course, quite a few aspects arise here that require elucidation and further study. But to react to this important initiative with complete official silence--this is not simply incomprehensible, it is also ignorant. This kind of approach will cause us enormous damage, and casts a shadow on the readiness and desire of Russian diplomacy to conduct affairs with our most important partner respectfully and properly. There is a need here, I would say, for significantly more tact and attention than in the mutual relations with traditional participants in diplomatic exchanges. Relations with the rest of the world can today be entrusted to the "autopilot" in significant measure--nothing will happen with them. Russia has a reliable treaty basis for the conduct of affairs with Europe, the United States, Japan, and other traditional partners, especially in the political sphere. There is experience, tradition, and professional personnel. Almost everything here is predictable, and it is most unlikely that there will be any big surprises. Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and this means that important international problems cannot be decided without it. Of course, it does not follow from this that activity must be lessened in the Western direction. Not in the least. Russia cannot help but participate in the most active way in worldwide problems: It cannot fail to work on disarmament problems, the settlement of regional conflicts, etc. Although here as well it is impossible to forget our own national interest--concerning integration into the world economic system. The CIS countries are another matter. Here it is necessary to roll our sleeves up and display the maximum tact and attention to our new neighbors and partners. To be engaged in general, as is customary for us, but personally at all levels--from the president of the country to the most humble official in every department that has a bearing on these problems. It is fitting to talk here about cooperation on equal terms, demonstrating as much patience, understanding, correctness, and respect as possible. Experience says that even small problems in international relations are not resolved immediately, and that time and persistent negotiations are required. But how difficult it is to build relationships essentially in a blank space. I admit that I am intimidated by a package of documents that are being signed on the results of two-three meetings of experts and hour-long negotiations at a higher level. It is most likely that they will not produce results, and we already have been witnesses as to how documents that are formally prepared and hastily signed are quickly forgotten. It is clear that Russian diplomats should defend Russia's interests firmly, but it is necessary to understand that their partners will act in the same way. An agreement can be born only as a compromise, as a balance of interests that are acceptable to each side. This cannot be done in an offhand way. It is important now to begin negotiations on a whole spectrum of bilateral relations with each of our neighbors. To select competent negotiating teams and supply them with initial directives and instructions--and this will require competent interdepartmental consultations and agreements--to establish a procedure for interaction with the Federal Assembly, and to assign, naturally, the people and resources for all of this. Organized in this way, the negotiations will soon create their own inertia of movement, and will begin to produce results. Time will decide the question about how, in the final analysis, we will begin to live further. But if Russia does not set an example and does not propose a settlement with its new neighbors according to international standards, then the centrifugal forces of history and the inertia of chaos will scatter us all in such a way that it will become simply impossible to maintain normal relations and communicate in a human way. I do not want to talk about worse and more frightening variants, but it is necessary to think about them, otherwise it is they that will come to pass. I am very troubled by the leisurely manner and certain aloofness with which our politicians relate to what could determine the fate of Russia--to finding a safe, mutually beneficial, and humane method of life under new realities. It is necessary to remember that Russia's greatness is in its mission of reconciling the East and the West. The success of this mission will depend on the capability of Russia to play a constructive role in arranging new equal partnership relations in the Eurasian space.
