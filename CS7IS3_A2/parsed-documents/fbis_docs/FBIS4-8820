After the conclusion of the meeting, Virgil Magureanu granted a brief interview to Gheorghe Verman, director of the Information, Journalism, and Sports Department of Radio Romania, in which Magureanu assessed that it had been a useful conversation during which everyone was able to very openly state their opinions. There were also some slightly biased accents, but, on the whole, the expressed opinions were objective and not acrimonious, Magureanu stated. Answering a question as to whether openness and the security of the state are compatible, the head of the SRI assessed that within certain limits they are compatible, adding that openness should refer primarily to the already final results of actions designed to protect national security. It would also be necessary, Magureanu said, for the illegal monopoly of one or the other party -- that is, the SRI or the media -- over national security information to be dissolved so that cases can be solved more rapidly through correct cooperation. Asked to comment on cooperation so far, especially on the current cooperation between the SRI and the "Romania Actualitati" [Current Events] program, Prof. Magureanu appreciated, above all, our radio's optimal objectivity with respect to the image of the institution he leads. That image is sometimes good, sometimes bad, changing with time, Magureanu added. At the end of the interview Magureanu stated that he is quite optimistic on relations between the SRI and the press and that he believes that the institution he is leading has a great deal of things to do before it obtains the necessary trust of those who should be its partners. He concluded by saying that such relations are not necessarily identical to those among equal partners.
