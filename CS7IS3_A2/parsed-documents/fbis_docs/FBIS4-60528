FBIS4-60528 "drnes102_c_94009" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Egypt Lawyer's Link to Islamic Group Explained Lawyer's Link to Islamic Group Explained NC2505200694 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1515 GMT 25 May 94 NC2505200694 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- New facts have surfaced regarding the death of Egyptian lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani on 25 April and his role in the outlawed terrorist organization, the Islamic Group, in Isna, Qina Governorate. This led to his arrest. He then suffered an asthma attack, and after 24 hours at the al-Manyal Hospital the doctors failed to save his life. AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi' has published a full report on the true circumstances surrounding the death of the lawyer, who was in charge of financing the terrorist organization. The report also includes what occurred at the Lawyers Association with members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which controls that association. Nafi' notes that the story began when security men captured terrorist elements after several successive and highly planned operations to strike at the dens of terrorism. Some important organizational documents were seized along with these terrorists, who gave detailed confessions. Several facts, obtained from full confessions, surfaced in connection with these cases, particularly State Security Case 235/94, which is related to the so-called military wing of the Islamic Group and to the terrorist acts committed by members of this group. Nafi' added that the confessions revealed the following: 1. 'Abd-al-Harith Madani acted as the direct link to Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam, the organization's leader who died on 25 April in a shoot out with security men sent to capture him. 2. Upon instructions from the organization's leader, Madani acted as a liaison officer, conveying the orders of the organization's leaders outside prison to leaders inside prison. 3. Madani was in charge of financing the organization by distributing money received from abroad for Tal'at Hammam, the leader of the organization. According to the defendants' confessions, Madani received seven payments from Hammam amounting to 45,000 Egyptian pounds as well as $3,000, which he spent on the organization's activities on the instructions of its leader. Nafi' adds: Those were the actual facts that emerged from the confessions made by the recently captured terrorist elements. Had some of the leaders of instigation been fair, they would have reflected on these facts as they really are without any bias. What is certain from the investigations is that Madani was a terrorist affiliated with the Islamic Group in Isna, Qina Governorate. He had been previously charged in several cases, including Case 7 in the year 1990, when he, along with other members of the organization, prevented people from visiting graveyards, claiming it was sinful to do so. He was also charged in another case in Isna for distributing leaflets. Nafi' adds: Here we have a prominent member of a terrorist organization that kills and assassinates innocent citizens, in violation of law and public order. Here is a member of an organization that permits the killing of people and the plundering of their property, in violation of the provisions and ethics of religion. What is more serious is that he used his job as an attorney defending law, freedom, and stability as a cover to undermine the law and shake the stability. Observers point out that the events that took place at the Lawyers Association last week, which had been instigated by the banned Muslim Brotherhood, reveal extremely serious matters, including: 1. Some of the people who have led the acts of instigation and agitation belong to a dissolved political group that seeks to use the death of the aforementioned lawyer and its leadership of the association as an opportunity to promote its political goals, which run counter to the regime and to legitimacy, and to gain popularity among lawyers so that they may back its candidates in future elections. 2. The deceased lawyer was a member of a terrorist organization, the Islamic Group, who had been charged before in several cases. The attempt to take advantage of his death reveals the relationship between the dissolved group and other terrorist groups. 3. These outlawed terrorist groups are trying to use the professional associations as an arena for their unlawful partisan activity. 4. Other extremist and irresponsible elements have attempted to incite lawyers to carry arms against the legitimacy and its representatives. 5. The special relation between members of the terrorist groups and the outlawed and dissolved Muslim Brotherhood group has been confirmed by a statement issued by one of the groups that falsely calls itself Islamic, in which it incited strikes, demonstrations, and sabotage. Nafi' says that this trend is serious and dangerous. It tries to exploit and undermine democracy and to cause a relapse in the splendid democratic development process which is relentlessly and wisely led by President Mubarak. Nafi' maintains that the security commands in Egypt are committed to safeguarding legitimacy, law, and the basis of democracy which have been established by the president. These commands have accomplished tremendous achievements by all standards. They penetrated the secrecy of these organizations through scientific planning and through proficiency and the ability to move quickly. He adds that security commands managed to descend on some terrorist leaders and seize a map detailing the locations, duties, and responsibilities of various terrorist elements as well as their codes and planning for future operations. It was a huge blow to the organization which made the terrorists and their sympathizers go out of their minds. Nafi' says that 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and others were among the many elements who were captured through justice. They thought for a while that they could exploit one of the most honorable and ancient professions -- the practice of law -- as their slogan behind which they hide under false pretenses. Some elements of the dissolved group are trying to play with fire, destabilize the situation, and go against legitimacy in an attempt to deprive the country of the atmosphere of development, stability, and democratic process. In his capacity as the doyen of the Egyptian Journalists Association, Ibrahim Nafi' underlined the role of associations in defending the rights of its members as follows: Any association is entitled, or rather duty bound, to defend the legitimate rights of its members. The association must support the member who is confronted with ordeals and crises. It is also a legitimate right to defend every member who is not under suspicion. This stance is part of the association law and is the member's rights and duties. It is also a right dictated by law and tradition, let alone if the case is linked to the application of the Bar Association and if the members are men of law and the protectors of the law. On the other hand, there is an important fact that should not be ignored, namely that association members must not use their membership as a screen to hide illegal actions that violate the provisions of law and undermine the country's law and national security. Nobody can claim that membership can be used as immunity to violate the law or defend the violating member. Nafi' says: I can understand that it is the right of the association to ascertain the authenticity of charges against the accused member, especially if the defendant is a member of an organization that is overtly practicing terrorism, killing innocent people, and carrying out assassinations and declaring this in its statements. I also can understand that it is the right of the association, particularly the Bar Association, to use all legal methods to defend the rights of its members and their families. Ibrahim Nafi' adds: But what I can not understand and even reject is the adoption of illegal and illegitimate moves on the pretext of defending the right of an association member. This, I believe, would turn the association into a jungle and make the association membership a tool to support violation of law and infringement on legitimacy. This action is carried out by some elements which belong to illegitimate groups seeking to impose their hegemony and objectives by force and to foment trouble within and outside the association. Nafi' voices his regret that some people have exploited the death of a terrorist organization member, who belonged to a vocational association, to instigate and incite trouble by issuing inflammatory statements against the law and the legitimate rule. Nafi' concludes his article by saying that all aim to exploit the democratic climate, political tolerance, and the broad freedoms of expression. President Mubarak is committed to this democratic atmosphere regardless of the excessive and provocative acts by those who are trying to exploit legitimacy and the tolerance of the political leadership to sow discord and to drive a wedge.
