Li Zemin said: Starting last year, particularly after the second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, Zhejiang has been active in launching the anticorruption drive and building the party work style and clean government in accordance with the central commission's arrangements and demands. With importance being attached by party committees and governments at various levels, with large amount of arduous work being carried out by discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs; with active participation from the vast number of cadres and the masses, and with common efforts by all concerned, we have been able to achieve certain results in our threefold anticorruption mission. Honesty and self-discipline awareness among leading cadres has been enhanced through self-screening against the "five stipulations." New headway was made in probing important cases following the stepping up of case investigations, marked results were achieved by the special units in rectifying unhealthy practices, and certain negative corrupt phenomena bitterly hated by the masses were checked to varying degrees. However, we must be sober enough to note that the anticorruption struggle has not been developing in a well- balanced manner and that the results achieved thus far have yet to be consolidated. Due to social, historical, economic, and ideological backgrounds, eliminating soils and conditions that breed negatives and decadence will not be possible within a substantially long period, particularly at the present time when the old systems are being replaced with the new ones amid inadequate laws and regulations. Because the anticorruption struggle is a long-term mission in the process of reform and opening up, it must be carried on unremittingly. Li Zemin pointed out: The success of this year's anticorruption tasks will depend in a crucial way on their actual implementation by party committees, governments, and leading cadres at various levels with enhanced understanding and greater determination. Strengthening the anticorruption struggle is not only an internal demand in line with the party's basic line and in implementing the entire party work set by the central authorities this year, an important political guarantee in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development, but it is also an important condition in maintaining political, social, and economic stability. Leaders at various levels must enhance their understanding of the anticorruption struggle, correctly master the dialectical relations of "fostering both material progress and cultural and ideological progress," and strengthen the sense of responsibility and urgency by overcoming such sentiments as slackness, fear of difficulty, weariness, and the anxiety about lagging behind when a comparison is made. The fight against corruption should be conducted in an in-depth, sustained, and solid manner. Tasks that were not completed last year as scheduled should be followed up while unsatisfactorily completed items need further remedial action. The "five new stipulations" put forward by the central authorities this year must be firmly implemented one by one in consideration of Zhejiang's reality. Besides, all localities and departments should seriously rectify relatively prominent negative corrupt phenomena commonly noted by the masses. We should intensify investigations to thoroughly find out what is actually going on, conscientiously study the limits of various policies before offering concrete opinions, and form special units to solve problems one after another. Both permanent solutions and temporary relief measures are required in fighting corruption. While curbing unhealthy tendencies and tightening up discipline, we should strengthen members' and cadres' immunity against decadent thinking by giving them more education on ideals and objectives and by enhancing their concept of party spirit. We should identify the key aspects and weak links of a system which are corruption prone and have them perfected and well managed. Organizations, the masses, public opinion, and democratic parties should intensify their supervisory roles, help improve laws and regulations, and thus gradually bring about a sound supervisory system. Li Zemin stressed: Party committees at all levels must regard it as their bounden duty to effectively strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle; they must never regard it as a job of the discipline inspection and supervisory organs. First, they should make the anticorruption struggle an important item on their agenda, frequently analyze the state of the struggle, make suggestions and arrangements for anticorruption work for a period of time, and promptly study major problems in this work. The principal party and government leaders should personally attend to major cases in order to eliminate interference. They should insist on a thorough investigation and never be indulgent toward wrongdoing. Second, it is necessary to strengthen supervision, study the situation, promptly discover and solve problems, and sum up and spread experiences so as to use them to guide the anticorruption drive as a whole. Third, efforts should be made to improve the responsibility system by which leading cadres are responsible for promoting party work style and honesty. Leading organs of a higher level should oversee the work of those of a lower level, and leading organs of a lower level should be responsible to those of a higher level. The fight against corruption, the improvement of party work style, and the building of a clean government should be made important criteria for evaluating the performance of a locality and cadres. These criteria should also be integrated with the training, education, and appointment of cadres. Fourth, we should continue to uphold the system of holding joint anticorruption meetings and support law-enforcement departments, such as discipline inspection, supervisory, and procuratorial organs, to exercise their functions. These organs should improve their effectiveness through coordination. Fifth, we should show concern for the training of discipline inspection and supervisory personnel. We should create good conditions for the allocation, exchange, and training of cadres. We should protect discipline inspection and supervisory cadres who uphold principles and carry out their functions boldly. Whenever cases of retaliation against discipline inspection and supervisory cadres are discovered, they must be investigated and handled strictly. We should do our best to help discipline inspection and supervisory cadres solve problems relating to work and living conditions. Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of Zhejiang, also spoke at the meeting. He said: Governments at all levels should keep the overall situation of this year's work in mind, adhere to the principle of "grasping two links," make overall plans and take all factors into consideration, and integrate the anticorruption struggle with deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, expanding development, and maintaining stability. First, leading cadres should set an example in being honest and in doing their jobs industriously. They should be honest and discipline themselves according to the two "five-point regulations." At the same time, they should pay attention to the anticorruption struggle in their localities and departments. The principal leaders should assume personal command over the struggle and personally solve major problems. In the future, when leading cadres are evaluated, they will be checked to see whether they perform their duties industriously and whether the units under their leadership are honest and clean. Second, we should solid work. We should attend to economic work and opening to the outside world in a down-to-earth banner. Likewise, we should do solid work when we strive to build a clean government and combat corruption. Third, we should support discipline inspection and supervisory organs to carry out their functions in order to concentrate strength in combating corruption. The leading cadres of governments and departments at all levels must attach importance to and show concern for discipline inspection and supervisory cadres, trust them politically, support them in their work, and help them with their living conditions. In this way, discipline inspection and supervisory cadres will work without worries and will be devoted to their duties. Wan Xueyuan stressed: Economic and administrative departments need the support of discipline inspection and supervisory departments, and the discipline inspection and supervisory departments also need the support of economic and administrative departments. Therefore, they should support one another and closely coordinate with one another to make greater contributions to the efforts of deepening reform, opening Zhejiang wider to the outside world, bringing about the sustained, rapid, and sound development of its economy, and promoting a good party work style and honesty. The second plenary session (enlarged) of the provincial discipline inspection commission ended on 1 April. At the session, 18 units introduced their experiences in combating corruption and promoting the improvement of party work style and honesty. The session examined and adopted the work report given by Wang Qichao on behalf of the provincial discipline inspection commission's standing committee.
