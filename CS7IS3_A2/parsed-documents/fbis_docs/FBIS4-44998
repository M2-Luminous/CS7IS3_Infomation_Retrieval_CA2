FBIS4-44998 "jpnea030___94003" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 25 March 1994 NEAR EAST PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS Report on Palestine Investment Company Report on Palestine Investment Company 94AF0190B Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic 25 Mar 94 p 17 94AF0190B Jerusalem AL-NAHAR Arabic CSO [Article by Khalid al-Zubaydi] [Text] The first and biggest Palestinian holding company, with a capital of 200 million dinars [currency as published], has emerged at the Amman Chamber of Industry with the participation of Palestinian, Jordanian, and Arab banks, companies, and investment figures. The company, considered a distinguished private sector effort, seeks to establish investment projects in the Palestinian-Arab territories. Participants in the constituent meeting viewed the launching of the Palestine Development and Investment Company as a part of Palestine's modern history and as an important step in the direction of a market economy, which is embraced by the Palestinian leadership as a path, according to Ahmad Quray' (Abu-al-'Ala'). Sources of the [company's] constituent committee have estimated the volume of investments expected to be contributed by the Palestine Company at $1 billion. Raja'i al-Misri, the company spokesman, has asserted that the constituent assembly has developed initial ideas for a long list of projects. He has also estimated the company's investments in the first year at nearly $200 million. In response to a question by AL-RA'Y, al-Misri pointed out that the company's Executive Board is inclined to invite [public] subscription for 49 percent of the capital of the Palestine Pioneers Establishment as a first practical step on the company's part. Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Jordan's information minister and minister of state for cabinet affairs, expressed hope that the company will accomplish its tasks of developing Palestine; creating work opportunities for those who seek them; and expanding the spheres of fruitful investment. He also asserted Jordan's support for development and reconstruction efforts in the occupied territories. Dr. al-'Anani also noted that economic relations between Jordan and the occupied territories have continued to exist by virtue of fundamental factors, asserting that these relations must continue so they will remain a firm barrier in the face of Israel's schemes to maintain the status quo of the Palestinian economy. He reminded us of the comprehensive economic agreement concluded between Jordan and the PLO and said, "Creation of the Palestine Company embodies the form of relations toward which we aspire and creates a harmonious reality which Israel cannot infiltrate." Al-'Anani noted that Jordan's and Palestine's private sectors are capable of being pioneers and foresighted initiative-makers that play a role in building the Palestinian economy and in turning it into a bridge for greater Arab unity. More Important Event Abu-al-'Ala', who delivered an address on behalf of Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, considered the foundation of the Palestine Company as the most important event since conclusion of the Declaration of Principles in Washington. He said that this private sector initiative will have a great impact on economic and social development activities in the Palestinian homeland. It will also have the greatest impact in preparing and revitalizing the Palestinian private sector at home and abroad to play a role in and to contribute to the development activities. Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that this good initiative will receive full support and backing from the Palestinian authority and its institutions and from the Palestinian people's institutions inside and outside the occupied homeland. He added that the size of the challenges facing Palestinians in the coming phase is only matched by the size of the hopes and expectations. He said that these challenges are the challenges to build institutions of civilization on the ground according to the most modern principles and to create a system that embraces democracy and plurality as its path and joint economic development and growth as its course. Moreover, these challenges are also challenges of the ability to ensure stability and security. Abu-'Ala' summed up the goals and priorities of development in Palestine, saying that they must be designed to befit the conditions of a people who have experienced and who continue to experience great hardship as a result of the hateful occupation. They must also be designed to befit a totally new political entity that is in the phase of creation. These goals seek to: - Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the occupation and of its actions. - Expand and improve the infrastructure. - Create work opportunities to absorb the unemployed. - Encourage export and foreign currency generating sectors. - Work to meet the Palestinian people's basic needs. - Gain and resettle an effective technological capability, considering that education, teaching, and training are three meshed priorities. - Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to participate in all branches of construction and development and to contribute promptly to the construction of 185,000 housing units in order to meet the shortage in the housing area and to absorb repatriates. - Seek equality and balance between men and women and between the various districts and social and economic groups. Regarding the development strategies for Palestine, Abu-'Ala' said that they must achieve balance between agriculture and industry, exports and imports. They must also make maximum use of land and water; must strengthen bonds and interaction between the various sectors; must select the appropriate technology for all branches of the economy; and must set up the institutions, centers, and frameworks that support economic activity. The strategies must, moreover, mobilize the resources and capabilities of the diaspora Palestinians; must attract financial, investment, and technological, educational, and administrative aid; must strengthen self-reliance within the framework of collective (i.e., Arab) reliance, without retreating into a shell; and must benefit from Arab and international aid. Abu-'Ala' estimated the total investments needed for the Palestinian development program at $11.6 billion, plus 12 percent to face inflation and 10 percent added to the total as reserves. All of this raises the total amount needed, at 1994 prices, to $13.4 billion, of which the private sector contributions will constitute nearly 60 percent. Market Economy Is Our Option Before a crowd of more than 200 businessmen and investors, Abu-'Ala' declared, "We aspire for an economic system that epitomizes the greatest and most successful experiments; achieves justice, prosperity, and constant growth; and releases individual initiative--a system that is founded on frankness, explicitness, openness, and accountability; that benefits from our people's competence and capability; and that always works to develop them. Abu-al-'Ala' noted that other people's experiences have proved that the rules and laws of the market economy are the best motivators of people's economies and capabilities and are the most successful in economic growth and development processes. Concluding, Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that the Palestine Investment Company [Palestine Development and Investment Company] initiative will have an important role in the construction and development activities and in motivating the Palestinian, Arab, and international private sector to invest in Palestine. Through interaction with the Palestinian national authority, the company will play an important role that benefits this authority. Correction of Historical Flaw Munib al-Misri, a major shareholder and a constituent committee member, said that the idea of founding the Palestinie Investment Company with a capital of 200 million dinars [currency as published] was developed nearly a year ago with brothers from Palestine. He asserted that the company will participate in Arab-Palestinian firms that will be founded in the Palestinian lands to play an effective role with the private sector in implementing the economic plan. This plan is capable of correcting the flaw that has afflicted the economic structure in recent decades and of reviving the Palestinian economy through the implementation of a large number of economic projects, expected to exceed $1 billion in value and to have a cumulative effect on the society and the economy. The company will also support the industries that currently exist in Palestine--especially small industries--financially, administratively, and technically. Munib al-Misri added that the company will encourage the private sector to play its role of supporting and complementing the public sector so as to contribute to building the independent state and to fulfilling our Palestinian people's social and economic development aspirations. The company will also work to improve the investment climate so as to attract Palestinian, Arab, and international capital. A number of factors have been taken into account in designing the company's structure and the structure of the domestic joint-stock subsidiaries emanating from it. These include expanding the participation base to open it to everybody, provided that no one individual investor is allowed to participate with more than 1 percent of the company capital. Foundation of the Palestine Company for Development and Investment and of subsidiaries emanating from it is tantamount to providing practical encouragement to the extensive expertise, capabilities, and economic presence of Palestinian investors in the diaspora and to their Arab brothers, as well as to the brothers inside Palestine. Munib al-Misri noted that, with the election of the executive board, detailed studies will be completed on a number of important economic projects. The company has conducted preliminary studies on the feasibility of these projects from several aspects. The projects include the construction of housing complexes outside urban areas, each consisting of 1,000 housing units and containing all the necessary utilities. The company has also conducted studies to make a determination on basic industrial projects. To be feasible, these projects have to be generally beneficial to a large number of citizens and free of market risks because they are basic projects. Concluding, al-Misri noted that the citizen is the true wealth. He praised the Palestinian people's capabilities and sacrifices, saying that if high capabilities are utilized well in the construction and production process they will provide bright opportunities and economic future. He asserted that the private sector can accomplish this goal, considering that this sector has proved under the most difficult circumstances that it is the forerunner in taking the initiative and that it is creative and innovative. Entrenchment of Jerusalem's Arabism Faysal al-Husayni, head of the steering committee of the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, delivered Jerusalem's address. He asserted: "We are convinced that it is possible to get Gaza with or without negotiations. The West Bank can be gotten with negotiations. As for Jerusalem, it will not be available with negotiations alone but rather with negotiations and with a fait accompli." He added: "To win the Jerusalem battle, we are required to establish in our conscience and in the consciences of the Israelis and the world that Jerusalem is Arab and the capital of the State of Palestine. It will be won with a religious fait accompli or with a political and economic fait accompli." Al-Husayni warned of the swift steps being taken by the Israelis in an attempt to isolate Jerusalem, saying, "Despite our difficult circumstances and weakness, we were able in 1967 to impose certain important things, such as administration of al-Aqsa Mosque, religious courts, and religious trusts. All are managed by an Arab, not Israeli, presence. [passage unintelligible]. Al-Husayni renewed the call to Palestinian businessmen and investors to revive the plan for an international investment conference in Jerusalem so as to bolster the Arab-Palestinian reality in Jerusalem and to implant in the mind of the world and of the Israelis that this Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine and so as not to leave to the Israelis the task of organizing international meetings and symposiums on Jerusalem's soil. Company Is Tantamount to Accepting Challenge In his capacity as a founder, Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman of the Amman Chamber of Industry, said before businessmen and the constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for Development and Investment: "It is our duty in this homeland to take the initiative and to roll up our sleeves so we will be the vanguard in rebuilding the wounded Palestine." He added: "You are the elite, not just with your economic expertise but also with your noble character, your firm patriotism, and your true zeal to employ your capabilities in order to set up an Arab organization that is prepared and eligible to build and to develop on firm and solid bases." Abu-Hassan further added, "After considering the goals, means, and methods carefully, we decided to establish the Palestine Company for Development and Investment as a holding company so it will form an effective factor that turns the wheel of development and accepts the challenge of rebuilding the Palestinian economy and of mending the wide fissure that has developed in the Palestinian economic structure as a result of occupation throughout recent decades. This occupation has destroyed the production installations, structure, and utilities, and whatever pertains to them." He also said, "By coming forth to establish this company, we direct our attention at the sacred goal of reviving constructive life in the Palestinian citizen on the Palestinian soil. Through this company, we seek to create an investment climate in the areas of industry, tourism, food production, and of other projects that produce and create work opportunities; that meet the citizen's needs; and that enhance his standard of living." Uniting Goal and Interest Kamal Hassunah, general director of the Palestinian Pioneers Establishment and a constituent assembly member, presented a quick review of the Palestinian investment horizons. He said that the 1990s have experienced fundamental developments that are still affecting the entire world, including collapse of the Soviet Union, unification of the two Germanies, the Gulf war, the Middle East peace plans, and economic developments toward bloc formation, such as the American NAFTA, the European Common Market, the Asian Tigers, and others. Hassunah said that these immense and unprecedented developments "have imposed enormous challenges also. To confront this new reality, where do we stand vis-a-vis these developments and changes? Does the Arab environment promote change and development?" He stressed that many things depend on this review, most significantly the increased chances for success of big companies and the exposure of small and medium companies to losses or risks of losses if they fail to unite in the next five or 10 years in order to adapt to the international economic developments. Hassunah said that if normal circumstances are made available to Palestinians, then "we are capable of succeeding in the development process through fruitful cooperation between the interior and the diaspora, by uniting in common goal and interest after a long absence of more than 40 years in the diaspora, and by bolstering the confidence and inspired spirit of the Palestinians at home." The constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for Development and Investment elected a 16-member executive board. This board held its first meeting and elected Dr. Kamal al-Sha'ir as chairman, Munib al-Misri as deputy chairman, and Nabil al-Sarraf as secretary. The executive board has been formed of the following: A member representing the Arab Bank; a member representing the Cairo-Amman Bank; a member representing the Housing Bank; a representative of the Engineering House Company, namely Dr. Kamal al-Sha'ir; a member representing al-Masirah Investment Company; a member representing al-Sa'id Company; Husayn al-Sharqawi; Khaldun Abu-Hassan; Riyadh Sadiq; Ramzi Dalul; Zahi Khuri; 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi; Munib al-Misri; Nabil al-Sarraf; Nabil al-Shawwa; and Nidhal Sakhiyan.
