FR940825-1-00059 FR940825-1-00008 (iii) The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), as described in 24 CFR part 91 and if applicable to the covered program, indicates that the local jurisdiction's housing market lacks sufficient affordable housing opportunities for households having a size and income similar to the family seeking the deferral. (3) Time limit on deferral period. If temporary deferral of termination of assistance is granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period not to exceed six months. The initial period may be renewed for additional periods of six months, but the aggregate deferral period shall not exceed a period of three years. (4) Notification requirements for beginning of each deferral period. At the beginning of each deferral period, the project owner must inform the family of its ineligibility for financial assistance and offer the family information concerning, and referrals to assist in finding, other affordable housing. (5) Determination of availability of affordable housing at end of each deferral period. Before the end of each deferral period, the project owner must: (i) Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on the vacancy rate for affordable housing of appropriate size in the housing market for the area in which the project is located, the CHAS (if applicable), the owner's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant family's efforts to locate such housing. (Affordable housing will be determined to be available if the vacancy rate is five percent or greater, or if the CHAS (if applicable), the owner's knowledge and the tenant's evidence indicate that other affordable housing is available) and (ii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed three years), and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available; or (iii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination of financial assistance will not be deferred because either granting another deferral will result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed three years, or a determination has been made that other affordable housing is available. (d) Notification of decision on family preservation assistance. A project owner shall notify the family of its decision concerning the family's qualification for assistance under this section. If the family is ineligible for assistance under this section, the notification shall state the reasons, which must be based on relevant factors. For tenant families, the notice also shall inform the family of any applicable appeal rights. ยง200.188 Proration of assistance. (a) Applicability. This section applies to a mixed family other than a family receiving continued assistance under ยง200.187(b), or other than a family for which termination of assistance is temporarily deferred under ยง200.187(c). (b) Method for prorating assistance. For each of the three types of assistance covered by this subpart, the project owner shall prorate the family's assistance as follows: (1) Proration under Rent Supplement Program. If the household participates in the Rent Supplement Program, the rent supplement paid on the household's behalf shall be the rent supplement the household would otherwise be entitled to, multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of eligible persons in the household. (2) Proration under Section 235 Program. If the household participates in the Section 235 Program, the interest reduction payments paid on the household's behalf shall be the payments the household would otherwise be entitled to, multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of eligible persons in the household; (3) Proration under Section 236 Program without the benefit of additional assistance. If the household participates in the Section 236 Program without the benefit of any additional assistance, the household's rent shall be increased above the rent the household would otherwise pay by an amount equal to the difference between the market rate rent for the unit and the rent the household would otherwise pay multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household; (4) Proration under Section 236 Program with the benefit of additional assistance. If the household participates in the Section 236 Program with the benefit of additional assistance under the rent supplement, rental assistance payment or Section 8 programs, the household's rent shall be increased above the rent the household would otherwise pay by: (i) An amount equal to the difference between the market rate rent for the unit and the basic rent for the unit multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household, and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household, plus; (ii) An amount equal to the rent supplement, housing assistance payment or rental assistance payment the household would otherwise be entitled to multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household.
