He praised the Congress for approving his proposals for reducing the budgetary deficit, adopting legislation relating to the ownership of guns, and approving the NAFTA trade accord. President Clinton took these measures after assuming office. But the question remains as to how successful has he been in implementing his election promises, which included ensuring the welfare of the people, increasing health care facilities, creating new job opportunities, and developing the economy. In this regard there is mixed opinion. The opponents of President Clinton say that he has not be able to achieve any remarkable success in fulfilling his election promises. On the other hand, his party and supporters are more or less satisfied with his actions and and successes. The Clinton administration has been successful to some extent in increasing employment opportunities. The President has stated that the rise in employment opportunities during his term of office was much more in comparison with the past four years. The health reform measures taken by President Clinton have been criticized by members of both parties. People are not very optimistic about the success of his moves to improve social welfare services and develop the economy. In his speech, President Clinton gave special emphasis to issues relating to the improvement of health care facilities, reforming social welfare services, reducing crime, and developing the economy. He acknowledged that a lot more has to be done for the welfare of the people. The President said that the employment level is still unsatisfactory, a lot of violence took place during this period, and there is a lack of optimism in many areas. He further said that social welfare measures will be reformed to reduce the dependence of people on government allowances and to find jobs for them. The President reiterated his pledge to guarantee health care. He also pledged to formulate stringent laws to curb crime and added that more police will be deployed. Life imprisonment will be sentenced for persons involved in more than one crime. He also reiterated his pledge to boost the economy and said that he will present a tough budget next year. Dwelling on foreign policy, President Clinton emphasized the need to further strengthen ties with the allies of the United States. He further stated that support for the new democratic states and the economic reforms in Russia will continue. The U.S. citizens voted for Bill Clinton with great expectations for changes for a better life. Such large-scale changes cannot be expected within the short span of one year. It is not difficult to initiate the process of change. At this moment, it is not possible to ascertain how much successl Clinton has had in changing the fortunes of the American people during his one year in office. This much can be said: Clinton is making efforts to abide by his pledges. He has successes and failures. During this period, the United States faced disaster and crisis on various fronts. Repeated natural disasters have become a cause of concern. In these natural calamities, property worth several thousand dollars has been destroyed. This will have an adverse effect on the economy. The setbacks suffered by President Clinton in foreign policy cannot be overlooked. U.S. policy failed in various countries, including Bosnia, Somalia, North Korea, Pakistan, and China. It is natural that the effects of these failures will be reflected on the domestic front. If all factors are taken into consideration, it could be said that the United States will face harder days ahead. Hence, President Clinton, the U.S. Administration, and the people should display more patience, tolerance, farsightedness, and judiciousness.
