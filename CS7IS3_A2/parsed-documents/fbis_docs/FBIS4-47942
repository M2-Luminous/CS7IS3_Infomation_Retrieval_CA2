The cards were issued by 1,500 teams of the Temporary Voter's Card Task Force established by SAFE and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], assisted by the Department of Home Affairs and the management consulting firm Xcel. "The Department of Home Affairs had maintained that most potential voters already had their identity documents and that only approximately 500,000 people would need to obtain temporary voter's cards prior to the election," the SAFE statement said. "Representatives from SAFE, however, after investigations in several regions, urged the IEC to focus on this issue and predicted that millions of South Africans would be shut out of the elections if an extraordinary effort to issue temporary voter's cards was not made." SAFE, a US-based organisation, said it had provided personnel, 700 cameras and 20,000 rolls of film to the task force. It had raised R30 million [rand] for the elections and supported 52 voter education programmes.
