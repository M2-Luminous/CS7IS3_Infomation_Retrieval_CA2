Except for a few extreme nationalist Romanian language newspapers, the Romanian political press has stayed away from the conflict until now, primarily because they felt that autonomous governing bodies of the church, not the press, were supposed to resolve conflicts within the church, and because disputed issues did not require unsolicited--and, additionally, incompetent--advocates. As we already reported briefly, the practice followed by newspapers unexpectedly changed last week, when an anonymous article appeared in the opposition weekly TINERAMA. Its title: "Laszlo Tokes Is Not a Real Bishop." From a practical standpoint, the article summarizes all of several years of accusations leveled by the "interested parties" against Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church District Bishop Laszlo Tokes, which have become known to the greater public, one way or another. The TINERAMA article is based on a letter addressed to Presidential Counselor Victor Opaschi--with a facsimile of the letter printed and signed by Lugos [Lugoj] parochial Minister Istvan Higyed, Chief Trustee Balint B. Kiss, and Trustee Istvan Csaszar. The alleged intent of the letter is "to clarify things that happened in the Reformed Church in 1989." The letter contains a request to Opaschi "to forward to the signatories a copy of the document in which Mr. Ion Iliescu appointed Mr. Laszlo Tokes to the Temesvar [Timisoara] Reformed Church District--showing the date of the appointment and the capacity of the appointee," "because disagreements have surfaced within the Reformed Church in this regard; moreover, certain documents questioning Mr. Tokes's capacity as a high priest have been submitted to the highest legislative forum of the Reformed Church (the Synod)." Using this letter as his starting point, the anonymous author of the TINERAMA article states that the December 1989 appointment of Laszlo Tokes was based only on a public statement by Ion Iliescu; this, in turn, confronted the Reformed Church of Romania with the accomplished fact (because the legitimate procedure had been circumvented) of having a bishop as its leader, who had never been nominated by the Synod for that post. Moreover, the author also suggests that presently the Palace of Cotroceni is seeking a solution to overcome this difficulty by giving legal force to the appointment, because "it does not want to let the bishop act on his own, a bishop, who, incidentally, is also attempting to unify the two Reformed Church bishoprics presently in Romania, under his own leadership, of course." What motivates the Office of the President to support Laszlo Tokes in this regard, the weekly newspaper asks. "In order to provide an appropriate answer to this question, we must, above all, keep in mind the `catalyzing' role Laszlo Tokes had played in the revolution (whose first beneficiary was President Iliescu), as well as the fact that Virgil Magureanu was Tokes's neighbor during his brief exile (17-22 December 1989) to the Zilah [Zalau] area!", the newspaper explains. "And we must not forget," the author argues, "that whenever the Power `emanating' from December 1989 experienced problems, Laszlo Tokes always made some forceful anti-Romanian statements (some of these aiming for the dissection of the country), thus diverting public attention from the real problems, providing a pretext for extreme nationalist groups to endlessly recount the watchword `Hungarian threat.' And indeed, one or two parties--the Romanian National Unity Party [RNEP in Hungarian; PUNR] and the Greater Romania (Romania Mare) Party [NRP in Hungarian; PRM]--were formed, whose existence is based exclusively on the `Hungarian threat,' and which, by no coincidence, support the Power. In this context, certain assumptions certainly acquire a different meaning: assumptions, according to which Laszlo Tokes's peculiar car accident in Hungary was, in reality, a warning to Tokes by the Hungarian secret service, an organization that had figured out the real game played by Tokes, in support of the Iliescu regime. No doubt, in the opinion of the Bucharest regime, Tokes has fully deserved the bishop's shoulder trimming, even if those may be regarded as illegal," the 13-19 May issue of TINERAMA concludes. Let us disregard the absurd insinuations made, and conclusions drawn by TINERAMA, the obvious attempt to hammer a wedge between Tokes and the opposition, and Tokes and the revolution, because the answer to these matters is already attached [as published], as provided to this newspaper by the Office of the Bishop, Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church District. On the other hand, we must not remain silent regarding our concern about the fact that disputes that disrupt unity, and which, by all means, damage the Reformed Church of Romania, have transcended their normal boundaries; once outside the limits of the church and its forums, the disputes have become uncontrollable, and could produce unpredictable consequences. Once the greater public becomes aware of these disputes, the mutual accusations may rekindle some passions, may become divisive, and therefore may perpetuate the conflict, instead of producing a fortunate ending. We state in advance that for this reason we would not like to become a "forum" for this dispute, and that we are not inclined to publish possible and probable replies, denials, and explanations. But since journalistic practice obligates us to do so, we obviously will publish these things anyway. But only under two conditions. First, we will be strict about publishing the replies of only those personally and directly affected by this issue. Second, replies and denials must not exceed acceptable limitations on length. After all, it would be more fortunate for the already opposed parties to exclude the public which, in essence, has nothing to do with this matter, and to make Christian peace through negotiations. We convey our best wishes for accomplishing this!
