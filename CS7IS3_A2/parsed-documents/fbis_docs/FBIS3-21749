Doris Wunsch, 37, was reportedly caught trying to board a ship to Japan from Tianjin on 19 July 1993 with 4.84 kg of marijuana concealed in a double-bottomed suitcase. At the time of her arrest, Wunsch had, according to Chinese press reports, admitted being met in Beijing by an Austrian man who handed her the double-bottomed suitcase, telling her it contained contraband. The man, later found to be Australian, asked her to carry the suitcase to Japan and gave her an address for a second rendezvous upon arrival. The Australian reportedly left Beijing on 18 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English 0457 GMT 28 Feb 94) The Guangdong Department of Public Security broke up a large drug-trafficking ring composed of criminals from Hong Kong, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi through arrests over the last two months of 1993. Police arrested a total of 26 suspects, including three from Hong Kong, and seized 17.4 kg of heroin and 1.2 million yuan in cash. Police in Zhaoqing ran an undercover operation on 2 November and arrested drug traffickers from Hong Kong, as well as a local drug-dealer. The police recovered 16.2 kg of heroin and 620,000 yuan in cash. Later the same day, two accomplices were arrested in Shenzhen and two hideouts in Zhaoqing were smashed. Further raids were carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Luoding in Guangdong, capturing the ringleader. The drug ring was wiped out with the elimination of the drug route by which the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong Kong drug dealers.
