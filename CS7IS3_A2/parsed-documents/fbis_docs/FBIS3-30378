We interviewed Endre Juhasz on this occasion on the significance of the agreement and the chances of the Hungarian economy to catch up with and integrate into Europe. [Bossanyi] What do we have to know about today: What will change compared to the already known export allowances? [Juhasz] The trade section of the association agreement came into force in March 1992, therefore, the paragraphs of the agreement that are valid from today do not affect the already functioning trade system. In fact, in 1993 in Copenhagen, a decision was made on accelerating and extending this. For Hungary, and the European Union [EU], the 1 February date rather has a significance of principle. From today, the regulations that deal with the other three market economy freedom rights -- in addition to the trade agreement -- will begin to operate. These apply to the movement of labor, capital, and services. Through this, rights and obligations that are very important for Hungary come into force, and at the same time, the implementation of the cooperation program can also begin. The preparation of the legal harmonization program belongs here, and the planning of projects affecting industry, agriculture, investment development, and education and training, which we have not been able to start yet. The cooperation also extends to various areas of transport and traffic, environmental protection, and culture. [Bossanyi] Let us look at the already existing section of the Association Agreement, namely the trade section. In your experience, is the agreement entirely advantageous for the country or are there any areas where we are now in a disadvantageous position for various reasons? [Juhasz] In 1992, the agreement had a clearly dynamic effect because Hungarian exports to the European Community increased much faster than exports to other areas that have similar market economies -- for example the countries of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] or the United States. This no longer applied in 1993, mainly due to the western recession. The decline of our exports to the EU was more marked than to other regions. [Bossanyi] Does this mean that the Association Agreement did not give us concrete advantages in the deepening recession? [Juhasz] On the contrary. Without the agreement, our exports would probably have fallen even more. Even then, we managed to use our preferential quotas, except in some areas of agriculture. However, the lack of competitive Hungarian products was the main reason for the latter. [Bossanyi] Did we also fill our textile quota? [Juhasz] We had the opportunity to do so, exports were not hindered by the quotas. In this area, the decrease of labor applied to imported materials with the purpose of reexport was a disadvantage for us. Quotas no longer exist in other industrial areas. However, there are so-called customs ceilings and customs quotas. If we exceeded these, then in theory, the EU could reinstate the customs but this did not happen last year. All in all, we can say that the Association Agreement gave greater scope to Hungarian goods in spite of the recession. [Bossanyi] When the Association Agreement was signed, many interest groups -- and mainly the domestic agrarian lobby -- argued that the Hungarian government had given concessions in the hope of achieving association relatively quickly, and it does not adequately protect, for example, agricultural exports from the EC's protectionism. Now they probably feel that their worries were justified. [Juhasz] I do not think so because the fact that we did not make full use of the agricultural quotas mainly has domestic economic reasons. Naturally, it can always be said that the doors could have been opened wider in the area of technical conditions. However, it is our experience that we usually have problems filling the quotas. [Bossanyi] The EU very firmly protects and supports its agricultural producers, while in Hungary, the opposite of this is happening. The producers of the countries that became associate members earlier -- Greece, Turkey, and Spain -- also suffered the same way. Will we also support the agricultural interests that they represent? [Juhasz] In the current phase, we have a conflict of interests with the EU's agricultural lobby because we would also like to expand our marketing possibilities in the future. The EU's agricultural producers and their interest groups are our competitors. Naturally, we are trying to learn from the experience of other countries but this does not mean that we do not compete with each other. [Bossanyi] Are you holding talks on further extending the quotas? [Juhasz] In the light of the GATT Uruguay round, the quotas will presumably have to be renegotiated. The conceptual system of the association agreement will have to be amended because a decision was arrived at within the framework of the 1993 GATT agreement that measures other than customs have to be eradicated. One of these, for example, is the skimming system. Our concept was in accordance with a former system, therefore, this can now be changed. In my view, we will probably have talks on adjusting the customs and we are hoping to use this to expand our advantages. [Bossanyi] These will not only apply to agricultural products, will they? [Juhasz] They will. In the case of industrial products, in the spirit of the Copenhagen program, all limitations will be lifted within a foreseeable time. From 31 December 1994, all customs duties will cease to exist in the so-called sensitive product groups. There are almost 100 of these. Customs duties will cease to exist on steel products by the end of 1995 and on textiles by the end of 1996. This affects almost all industrial products, therefore, we consider that the possibilities of Hungarian products getting to Union markets are good. In addition to this, we are also making progress in standardization and in coordinating the quality requirements, but this is a continuous task, it is not determined by deadlines. [Bossanyi] What changes can be expected in the assertion of the other three economic rights of freedom that are now becoming a possibility for us? [Juhasz] The current step of the Association Agreement opens the markets for Hungary in areas other than trade. However, these deadlines are relatively long, some are five or 10 years away, but some areas come into force now. For example, in purchases by authorities, we can participate in the EU's contract awarding procedures according to national treatment from 1 February. This means that, in bids, the Hungarian suppliers will be treated the same way as the other enterprises of the Union. At the same time, we will only give them this right in 10 years' time. This is also part of the process of catching up. [Bossanyi] Will our employment chances increase? [Juhasz] It is well known that very little progress has been made in this area. However, it is not negligible that Hungarian workers will have to be treated without discrimination in the area of the EU as regards their working conditions and pay. [Bossanyi] Is the associate membership a forerunner to full membership? [Juhasz] The government declared that it wants to achieve full membership by the end of the century. The associate membership makes it possible for us to deal with this in an institutional form. Talks on Hungarian membership will begin when the EFTA talks are completed. This will probably be in 1994. In addition to this, the Union will convene an inter-governmental conference in 1996 which is meant to reexamine the institutional system. This conference should ensure that the Union remains able to function in spite of the larger membership. It will be decided after this when we can begin talks on our membership. Based on our current information, we think that this will be in 1997. This is the planned scenario. However, a separate government decision is needed before the application for membership can be submitted.
