This is why we are printing an investigation report on the loss of state assets written by Comrade Wang Zhiyuan of the scientific research office of the State Administration of State Properties. This report is a clear description of the channels and ways through which state assets are lost in Sino-foreign joint ventures and transformed shareholding enterprises, when administrative units set up the three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-funded enterprises, and when collective enterprises modify property rights. It is a good piece of reference material and should be read carefully. [end editors note] Loss of State Assets in Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures and Contractual Joint Ventures Because of China's growing international reputation and the liberalization of the investment climate at home, foreign investment in China has been booming and the number of Sino-foreign joint ventures has increased sharply. This has been a great boost to economic development in China across the board and has helped raise the standards of production technology and management. However, state assets are being lost and their legitimate rights and interests are encroached upon severely by the way some localities go about setting up joint ventures with foreign firms. Assets of Chinese Partners Not Appraised To set up a Sino-foreign joint venture, the first thing that should be done is to have the assets of both parties appraised. Only then can one clarify their responsibilities, rights, and interests. There should have been no question about this. Nevertheless, owing to a variety of reasons -- the lack of comprehensive laws in this field, government intervention, and assets appraisal poorly done, sloppy appraisal -- the failure to performam an assets appraisal has been a widespread phenomenon in Sino-foreign joint ventures for many years. According to incomplete data, about 90 percent of Chinese assets in Sino-foreign joint ventures each year should be but are not appraised. In 1992, of all Sino-foreign joint ventures approved by foreign economic relations and trade agencies, about 10,000 involved state enterprises on the Chinese side, And of these 10,000, 2,900 had their assets appraised. On average, appraised value is 75 percent higher than net book value. Thus over 6,000 state enterprises entered into a joint venture with a foreign company without having their assets appraised. Their combined investment in the joint ventures was 86.264 billion yuan. With a value increase rate of 75 percent, we figure out that the absence of assets appraisal caused a loss of state assets to the tune of 64.698 billion yuan. Assets of Two Parties Not Priced Fairly It is a common practice among the Chinese entering into joint ventures with foreign businessmen to undervalue their assets. For example, a steel pipe factory proposed using state assets with a book value of 50 million yuan to set up a joint venture with a foreign investor. Notified of this situation and acting in accordance with the pertinent regulations, the local state properties bureau proceeded to re-appraise the state assets of the steel pipe factory based on current prices. The assets were re-appraised at 210,000,000 yuan. The leaders of the enterprise argued that the assets were over-valued and refused to accept the figure. After intervention by the local leader, the state assets bureau did another appraisal which lowered the value to 185,000,000 yuan, a number still considered too high by both the local and the enterprise leaders. In the end, an administrative decision was imposed under which the enterprise was to enter into the joint venture with the state assets valued at 50 million yuan. Investment by both Chinese and foreign partners in joint ventures typically takes the form of goods and materials, and overvalued ones at that. There is a chemical industrial firm in Xiangtan Shi, a Sino-foreign joint venture. The foreign partner claimed a value of $1.2 million for its equipment, while the actual value was just $900,000, thus overvaluing it by $300,000. It also claimed that its software was valued at $300,000, while the real worth was only $30,000. The practices among Chinese partners of undervaluing Chinese state assets and accepting the inflated values of the foreign partners' equipment and technology seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of the state. Under the "Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law," net profit shall be distributed among the partners in accordance with their respective shares of registered capital. Undervaluing the Chinese partner's state assets thus inevitably lowers its share of the total capital and hence its claim to the return on state assets as well as other rights. Through "Transfer Pricing," Foreign Companies Encroach Upon China's State Assets, Evade Paying Taxes to Chinese Government "Transfer prices refer to the prices multinationals charge for goods and services sold inside China. They are also called allocated prices. These prices are not subject to the usual supply-demand relations on the market and represent a means through which multinationals can maximize their profits." "Transfer pricing" is an artificial pricing method intended to shift an enterprise's profits. On the one hand, the enterprise achieves its purpose of tax evasion. On the other hand, this pricing method encroaches upon the Chinese partner's state assets in a big way. The upshot is an anomaly: an enterprise may suffer a loss on paper but is really raking in a profit. Popularly dubbed "zero profit," this is actually a ruse resorted to by foreign companies to turn a real profit into a sham loss. Many of the foreign investors in China are multinational corporations or their subsidiaries. They use a whole bunch of imaginative "transfer pricing" tactics, most of them in the following areas: Buying and Selling of Goods A foreign investor may move profits around by "importing high and exporting low." (This is how it works. It imports raw materials from overseas, paying a relatively low world market price, and then sells the raw materials to the joint venture at a higher price. When it comes to selling the output, it obtains the goods from the joint venture at a fairly low price and sells them on the international market at a higher price.) Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures and wholly foreign-funded enterprises, where foreign businessmen exercise managerial power, work hand in hand with affiliated companies overseas to buy and sell raw materials and products based on internal prices, creating a "sham loss" or "a tiny profit" and achieving their objectives of encroaching upon the profits and eliminating or minimizing their tax liabilities. Take, for instance, the case of a Japanese electrical machinery company in Shenzhen, a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise which sells the bulk of its output to its affiliated company in Hong Kong. For 2 years after it opened for business, which coincided with its income tax exemption period, it made a small fit. Beginning in 1986, it has been losing money year after year on its exports, with losses exceeding 15 million yuan in all, close to 10 percent. An investigation revealed that there were two different sets of sale prices for the enterprise's products. The prices it charged its non-affiliated enterprises were 20 to 46 percent higher than those it charged its affiliated company. Foreign companies which have set up Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures mostly make money through their control over the sales channels as a buyer of raw materials and agent for the sale of products. Charging Fees for Services Within the Group A foreign businessman may jack up the enterprise's costs and corner its profits by overpaying its affiliated company overseas for services the latter has rendered or undercharging the latter for services the former has performed. Take, for instance, a foreign-funded enterprise whose main business was petroleum gas. For 10 years after it opened for business, it reported a loss each year. Yet it never charged its Hong Kong affiliate for storage and transhipment services it had rendered. In 1990 the tax department ruled that it should charge for services at the rate of 10 percent, the going rate, and proceeded to look into its losses and profits. In the 1988-1989 period alone it should have collected $2.28 million [Hong Kong dollars] in service charges. Based on these figures, the company actually earned a $478,000 profit instead of losing money. Its retroactive income tax liability: HK$71,000. Lending When the foreign partner makes a loan to a joint venture, it raises interest rates and thus siphons off the profit. One example involves a Sino-foreign joint venture. In 1985 it was strapped for working capital, so the foreign partner secured a loan from a foreign bank. Between 1985 and 1988 it took out loans totalling 37.96 million yuan and paid 5.14 million yuan in interest at interest rates ranging from a high of 21.25 percent to a low of 15.25 percent, 50 percent to 100 percent higher than what banks charge their borrowers on the international market. Transfer of Invisible Assets The foreign partner influences the margin of profit of an enterprise by manipulating the values of invisible assets. There was a Sino-foreign joint venture. The Chinese partner invested $8 million in it; the foreign partner, a mere $1.5 million. The foreign partner's parent company was put in charge of importing patented equipment and technology transfer, for which it charged $6 million. Informed sources put the foreign partner's margin of profit between 30 to 40 percent. Assuming that it was 35 percent, the foreign company's profit already topped its registered capital. That way the investor made a fortune by inflating transfer prices even before the joint venture opened its door for business and sowed the seeds of future losses for the company. Through transfer pricing, foreign investors achieve their goal of shifting profits overseas while condemning th enterprises to a prolonged state of unprofitability and red ink and causing colossal losses for China. The Loss Of State Assets as a Result of Transformation of Enterprises Into Shareholding Enterprises Or Companies In the course of converting enterprises into shareholding enterprises or companies, the failure to appraise state assets, the undervaluing of state shares, the failure to match state shares with other shares, the failure to issue dividends to state shares, the issue of a minimal amount of dividends to state shares, the conversion of state shares into legal-person shares and personal shares, so on and so forth, have all resulted in the loss of state assets. These are the principal ways in which enterprise transformation via the shareholding route may cause the loss of state assets: As part of its experiment with the shareholding system, an enterprise creates "enterprise shares." Some enterprises create "internal employee shares" which employees may acquire gratuitously or at a reduced price. In the five shareholding enterprises set up in Jilin after 1985, for instance, "enterprise shares" accounted for 45.5 percent of the total value of all shares issued. In addition, 20 percent of the "enterprise shares" were set aside and turned into 2,843 shares at 200 yuan each. They were distributed among the employees based on the number of employees each enterprise had and their seniority. Employees were also allowed to collect dividends. In the Course of Converting an Enterprise Into a Shareholding Enterprise, State Assets Are Not Converted Into Shares Based on Replacement Costs But At Low Prices. Regulations require the conversion of state assets into shares based on net asset replacement value. In reality, state assets have been converted into shares according to original book value in the vast majority of cases. There were six enterprises in Shanghai whose assets had a combined original book value of 827 million yuan. An appraisal put their net assets replacement value at 1.688 billion yuan. In the end, the assets were converted into shares based on the original book value of 827 million yuan. In Chengdu, an appraisal raised the value of the assets of state enterprises adopting the shareholding system by 29 percent, significantly lower than the rate at which assets in that city had been appreciating (70 percent) as well as the national average. (Between 1989 and 1992, the average assets appreciation rate nationwide was 54 percent.) When It Comes to the Distribution of Dividends, State Shares and Personal Shares Are Treated Differently. The problem of jacking up dividends on personal shares and holding down dividends on state shares is widespread among most of the enterprises in Chengdu in Sichuan Province and Wuhan. This is how dividends were divided up each year by a shareholding limited-liability company in Wuhan between 1988 and 1992: For state shares, the dividend rate was 11.5 to 13.7 percent; social personal shares, between 17 and 17.5 percent; and employee personal shares, 20 percent. A shareholding enterprise in Sichuan followed an even more inequitable practice. In calculating the dividend for personal shares, it added the income tax payable to the profit to be distributed and divided up the amount among the number of personal shareholders. In contrast, the after-tax profit was used in figuring out the state share dividend. In effect, the income tax liability was borne solely by the state, not all shareholders. In 1992 the enterprise gave out personal share dividends at the rate of 29 percent while the rate for state shares was a little over 3 percent. Enterprises Price Shares Differently, Encroaching Upon the Profits of the State-Enterprise Legal Person. When it first started issuing shares, a building in Chengdu priced personal shares and legal personal shares at 1.15 yuan and 3.5 yuan each, respectively. The problem has now been ratified. Some State Assets Not Being Converted Into Shares According to regulations, when a state enterprise is converted into a shareholding enterprise, all its original assets should be put into production. In pilot projects now under way, the original assets, particularly non-operational assets, have not been put into production in a large number of enterprises that had adopted the shareholding system on an experimental basis. One company in Tianjin, for instance, failed to include 176 million yuan in state assets. Most commonly, land use rights and other invisible assets are excluded. According to a study on shareholding enterprises in Nanning and Wuzhou in Guangxi Province, all 11 directional fund-raising shareholding companies in the two cities failed to convert land into shares, instead allowing the land to be used free of charge. Enterprise Mismanagement Causes Loss of State Assets State enterprises losing money. This is the biggest problem facing China's state economy. Xiangtan Shi is one of the industrially advanced areas in Hunan. The city's 79 state enterprises within the budget had 3.434 billion yuan in combined assets and 2.720 billion yuan in liabilities, which amounted to 79.5 percent of the former. Mismanagement-related losses represent a particularly serious problem in former military enterprises now converted to civilian production. These enterprises have little funds at their own disposal and meager self-development capability. As a result, much of their fixed assets sit idle while they suffer extensive management-related losses. A munitions factory in Hubei, for instance, had 7.16 million yuan in losses at the end of 1992. Collective Enterprises Losing State Assets It is a common phenomenon for collective enterprises to use state assets gratuitously, even selling them off without authorization. Hence the massive losses of state assets in collective enterprises. Collective enterprises lose state assets mainly in these ways: Selling Off Equipment Without Permission Some enterprises take up and use the state assets of enterprises owned by the whole people without paying for them. Because of mismanagement, they turn out high-priced but poor-quality products and suffer extensive losses. To ease their financial plight, these enterprises take it upon themselves to sell off without authorization the machinery and equipment they have been using. Regulations require them to use the income derived from such sales to modernize and transform fixed assets. Instead, many enterprises have used the income to cover losses in their current account or give it out as wages, thus covertly divvying up state assets. Enterprises do a poor job in taking care of state assets. What exists on the books and what they actually have in hand may be two different things. Both cause state assets to be lost in large quantities. The way some collective enterprises manage the fixed state assets in their use, including their changes, installation, use, and upkeep and maintenance is utterly chaotic. Equipment is discarded or lost but the books are not updated, so there is no consistency between the two. This is a serious and widespread problem. Fixed Assests Under Compensated When a collective enterprise uses state fixed assets, it should take depreciation on them. In fact, many enterprises fail to do so and the amount involved is huge. Fixed assets are woefully underpaid. Moreover, the depreciation taken, instead of being used to pay for the modernization of fixed assets, is spent as benefits payments or bonuses. Thus state assets are not compensated minimally, making even simple reproduction unsustainable. Using State Assets Without Compensation Some enterprises owned by the whole people nominally lease out their fixed assets to their collective enterprises for use by the latter. In reality, however, no lease agreement was signed by a representative of the lessor and the collective enterprise, and certainly no leasing fee was collected. In effect state assets are used gratuitously, an infringement upon the rights and interests of the owner, the state. Plants and Equipment Allowed To Sit Idle Due to mismanagement and the poor quality of their products, a number of collective enterprises have been losing money year after year. Some of them have even suspended production, idling many plants and much equipment. They neither report such idling to the authorities above nor maintain and upkeep the equipment. Thus the assets affected are not put to the proper use. Administrative and Institutional Units Losing State Assets Administrative and institutional units use state assets without paying for them to "raise revenue." The loss of state assets mainly occurs when the revenue thus earned goes into "mini treasuries," when nonoperational assets are turned into operational assets, when money-making units fail to take depreciation or do so minimally, and when the costs and expenses of such units are not calculated accurately; that is, expenses that should be paid for by the units are still taken care of by the state treasury. An investigation in late 1993 by the Guangxi regional properties bureau into the loss of state assets by several administrative and institutional units uncovers the following problems: Lack of effective methods to manage the state assets used in revenue-raising activities and the profits derived therefrom. Revenue-raising activities by administrative and institutional units these days take a variety of forms, but for the most part they involve leasing out state land or renting out stadiums, buildings, houses, and equipment built or paid for by state funds or using such land and facilities in joint business ventures and contracting schemes. Borrowing public funds to set up economic entities without going through the regular borrowing procedures. To support their newly established economic entities, most units make loans to them from the extra-budget funds as seed money. However, a large number of units fail to make out the proper loan agreements. Instead, the loans are entered under the "temporary payment" category on the books. Should the loan be used to pay investment dividends or interest on loans? That is not clearly stated. Also left undefined are the two parties' rights, responsibilities, and interests. Even the loan's maturation period is unclear. In the course of time it becomes difficult to track down where funds have gone, determine whether they have been lost, or find out who should be held liable. Buildings, stadiums, and houses are rented out for excessively long periods without going through the standard evaluation and bidding procedures. In pursuit of profits, administrative and institutional units lease out the buildings, stadiums, and land for overly long periods of time. The land is not appraised prior to the lease and there is no bidding before a building is rented out. When land and buildings are leased out at bargain rates for excessively long periods of time, the interests of the state suffer directly. Loss of State Assets in Assets Disposal Land is being sold off at low prices. Some units allocated land have made a fortune in real estate speculation. Public housing is being sold at medium or low prices. Hengyang Shi in Hunan Province is one city experimenting with housing reform. By late June 1993, 3 million square kilometers of public housing had been sold at prices averaging no more than 120 yuan per square kilometer, while it cost between 950 and 980 yuan to build one square kilometer of comparable housing in the city and commercial housing was being sold at 1,200 yuan per square kilometer. In other words, public housing was sold at one-eighth the cost and one-tenth the market price.
