SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Kansas Department of Transportation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, Cass County, and Johnson County will prepare an EIS for a proposed highway project known as the 21st Century Transportation Corridor. If constructed, the project would be primarily on new location and developed initially as a two-lane road (ultimately as a four-lane roadway). The study corridor begins at the existing K&hyph;7/Shawnee Mission Parkway interchange, passes to the east side of DeSoto, extends southerly along the west side of the Cedar Creek development and the Johnson County Industrial Airport, extends southeasterly to U.S. 169 north of Spring Hill, and then extends easterly across the southern part of Johnson County passing south of Stilwell and intersecting the State Line in the vicinity of 195th Street. The corridor will then enter Cass County, Missouri, and connect with Highway 71 south of Belton; a distance of approximately 74 kilometers (46 miles). The project is intended to provide relief for projected traffic demands in western and southern Johnson County, Kansas, northern Cass County, Missouri, and southern Jackson County, Missouri. Several alternatives will be considered including the no build. Also incorporated into the study will be various alignments within the corridor. One public information and two Citizen's Group meetings have been held to keep the local citizens informed of the study. These meetings have provided early coordination with appropriate Federal, State, local agencies, and private organizations who have expressed interest in this proposed project. Public hearing(s) will be held during the development of the EIS. Public notice will be given for the time and place of the hearing(s) and the location of where the Draft EIS will be available for review and comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA, Johnson County, or the Kansas Department of Transportation at the addresses provided. Issued on: January 4, 1994. Johnny R. Dahl, Operations Engineer, Kansas Division, Federal Highway Administration, Topeka, Kansas.
