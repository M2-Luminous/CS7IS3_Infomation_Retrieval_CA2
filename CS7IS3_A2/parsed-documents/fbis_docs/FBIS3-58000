You will recall that the Presidency does not "lead" the Community, as public opinion often has it. It is a "public service" to the Community and cannot nor should be "nationalized." It is, for six months, a question of organising the work of the Council of Ministers, that is to say the Institution, which, in the current system, takes the decisions (but on proposals by the Commission and in agreement with the European Parliament). Greece inherits a presidency, that of Belgium, which no doubt was exemplary and which had to manage at least two dossiers of capital importance. The first was the completion of the ratification process and thus the entry into force of the Treaty on the Union; all was done for the transition to take place smoothly and, in the fields of competency of the three "pillars," for the Institutions to play their roles. The second dossier concerns the follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit and notably the presentation of the White Paper (growth, competitiveness, employment) and organising its passage to its operational stage. The Greek presidency has let it clearly be known, through Mr. Pangalos that it was assuming this inheritance in perfect awareness of the effort that will be required to advance without hesitation along the path set out, and to reach tangible results. It is important to know that Greece's commitment is total, without mental reservations or "opt outs" and with a very clear vision of the "political" scope of the role it has to play. Which, moreover, is in accordance with its belonging to a culture which brought an exceptional contribution to the civilization in which we live. This is why Mr. Pangalos' declaration on the need to begin already in preparing the 1996 institutional reforms, and to move towards the creation of a "European Constitution," and more precisely a "federal" constitution, deserves to be stressed. We can of course discuss the modalities and procedures, but it is important to open the debate quickly (which should already have been done at the extraordinary Summit of 29 October). The suggestion of rapidly setting up an "Ad Hoc Group" with the participation, as observers, of the countries candidates for accession, shows the will to succeed as Twelve Member States first: which shocks the partisans of "dilution," and obliges them to come out into the open. This leads us to recall that Mr. Papandreou, who for the first time chaired the European Council in December 1983, in a letter to his colleagues at the time, wrote: "We must know what kind of Europe we want to move towards." What is more topical than this question? Well, the Athens Summit ended in total failure and Mr. Papandreou's merit was not to have tried to disguise this. Despite pressures from his entourage, he blankly refused to make public the traditional "Conclusions" which should have spoken of totally nonexistent progress. At the time, in the face of a Commission manifestly weakened by national egotisms over-excited by the demands of Mrs. Thatcher, the Community was almost paralysed by the demand to assure its long-term funding, to develop new policies in future fields, to end the interminable negotiations over accession by Spain and Portugal. But nobody dared assume the responsibility of a crisis, and preferred navigating with land in sight. The logic of despair (as Jacques Delors called it at the time) risked prevailing. It took the shock, provoked some months later, of the massive vote by the European Parliament in favour of the Spinelli project for European Union, to provoke a chain-reaction ending in the relaunch based on the Single Act. The task of the Greek presidency will not be easy at all. So be it! The line chosen and based on the very substantial work load it has presented, will no doubt be supported by the founders of the European Community who -- geographically situated in the North and South of the Continent -- share in the inspiration.
