Cuba's Armed Forces and courts severely sanction anyone, Cuban or foreign, who tries to traffic in drugs in Cuba. The radio notes: We know that our society is not perfect; a number of drug-related incidents has been detected. However, guilty parties have had to bear the full brunt of our laws. The following case illustrates the effective action of our police agents in the systematic fight against drugs. When the Special Crimes Department of the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit learned that "a certain amount of" cocaine was "going to be sold and bought" at a home in La Lisa Municipality, they set up an operation in which the Investigations Technical Unit [Unidad Tecnica Investigativa] and the provincial DTI [Department of Technical Research] participated. Four citizens were arrested and cocaine seized. Captain Angel Perez Ramos of the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit was in charge of the investigation that revealed that Giraldo Arzola Valdez, Aurelio Alfonso Bolanos, and Alberto Machado Gutierrez--all with terrible social conduct records and criminal records--were illegally buying and selling drugs. It was determined that the drugs came from one of the eastern provinces, where they had washed up on shore. Capt. Perez noted, moreover, that although the citizenry knows that trafficking in and using drugs is forbidden in Cuba, "there are unscrupulous individuals who devote themselves to buying and selling drugs, which is severely punished by our society." Despite this, Perez added, the 17 people charged in this case had engaged in the illegal activity without regard for the consequences. Capt. Perez said that the accused in this case were tried at the end of 1993 and that the public prosecutor has asked for stiff prison sentences for them. Radio Progreso concludes: "Soon we will announce the sentences given the accused by the judges in accordance with the degree of criminal involvement of each."
