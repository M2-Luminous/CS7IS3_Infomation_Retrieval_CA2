Li Shengrong, the top official in charge of the code-named 4071 Project, said the project will involve the building of reservoirs, pump stations and wells, which will expand irrigated farmlands by 3,700 ha. The project will also sponsor the building of 10,000 ha of terraced farms, 77 km of roads and water supply works to quench the wide thirst felt both by humans and stock, Li said. Li said the project will teach 31,900 to read and write, reducing the local adult illiteracy rate from 36 percent to 18 percent. About 64,000 farmers, 28,000 of them women, will be trained in various farming skills. The project will be aimed at setting up a network of extension stations for the promotion of new stock and crop breeds and better farming skills and machines. Massive afforestation efforts under the project will improve the local environment and alleviate the shortage of animal feeds and fuels, Li said. The three counties involved in the project, namely Guyuan, Pengyang and Longde, account for 59 percent of the autonomous region's area, where poor resources, infertile farms and frequent natural disasters have made the area one of the poorest places in China. According to the authority, the three counties now have 639,000 people living under the official poverty line. Project 4071 will cost 150 million yuan, of which half will be funded by 80,500 tons of grain donated by the United Nations World Food Program, Li said. The first batch of 14,500 tons of grain are expected to arrive by September. In five years when the project is completed, the authority hopes that the local grain production will be double its current figure, and the average income of local farmers will rise above the poverty line. To ensure the work quality of the project, Li said the project authority has invited experts and senior management staff to provide technological supervision and consultancy services.
