The note says, in particular, that the hydrographic navigation equipment based on the territory of Ukraine remains Ukraine's property until the division of the Black Sea Fleet. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regards the acts of the Russian side as unlawful and emphasizes that they are a violation of international law. Ukraine demands that Russia return the equipment and discipline the people involved in the action. "It can be qualified as overt terrorism," commented Yuriy Serheyev. Today's Ukrainian-Russian relations are complicated also by the fact that, according to some media reports, Russia intends to deploy military bases in former USSR republics. "Such a mechanism of deploying military bases on foreign territory is indeed used around the world, but only given the willingness of the country where the bases would be deployed," Yuriy Serheyev stressed.
