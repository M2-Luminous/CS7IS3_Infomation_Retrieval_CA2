Karolos Papoulias said he did not want a confrontation, but this was the only way to let Skopje and the world know how strongly Greece felt about the matter. Athens would lift the embargo, imposed this month, only if the Skopje government changed its flag and dropped articles in its constitution that implied territorial claims on Greece. Speaking on the eve of talks here with Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, who will warn the Greek government today that its European Union partners condemn the closure of Salonika, Mr. Papoulias also called for a new pan-Balkan conference after a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resolve lingering tensions in the region. Mr. Papoulias said there had been an explosion of popular anger in Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's "insult." The government had to do something to force a confrontation as one by one other countries were establishing diplomatic relations with Skopje. The Salonika decision had been hastened by the recent American decision to establish relations. Asked whether the move was illegal under European Union law, Mr Papoulias said there was a long history of illegal moves in the EU, citing the actions of fishermen and farmers who had forced a change of policy. Greece had given its legal justification to Brussels, but the move was essentially political. "The government was forced to act by the threats in the constitution of that state. Greeks feel threatened by the propaganda from Skopje," he said. Hans van den Broek, the EU External Affairs Commissioner, spent two days last week in fruitless shuttles between Athens and Skopje to mediate. The Commission is threatening to take the Greek government to the European Court of Justice, a move officials here acknowledge is now likely.
