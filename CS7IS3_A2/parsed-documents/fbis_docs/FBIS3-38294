[Kohl] So far it is hard to understand where that would make sense, because such actions would immediately affect the civilian population and entail the obvious consequences. I do not think that there are concrete plans that go beyond very general ideas. [Sonne] But no military intervention, chancellor. [Kohl] No military intervention, but still action that is based on the strength -- the economic strength -- of the countries that are dealing with this issue. [Sonne] The way I interpret is: economic aid -- yes, military intervention -- no. [Kohl] I would put it even more bluntly. Economic aid has to be absolutely ruled out -- at least as far as I am concerned, and from Germany's view -- if borders are changed there through the use of force. At the 1991 CSCE summit conference we pledged together that we would never again accept that borders be changed through the use of force. If we start putting up with it again anywhere in Europe, others will not hesitate to take that as an example. Therefore, it is essential to nip things in the bud.
