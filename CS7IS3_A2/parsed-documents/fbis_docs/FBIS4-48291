Labor Minister Tito Mboweni said that the historical importance of the days had been generally accepted, and they had accordingly been declared public holidays. He said that he trusted any misunderstanding in this regard would be cleared up in the interests of national peace and development. COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] said earlier that it had learned that some employers had not paid their workers for the holidays and it called for the matter to be rectified.
