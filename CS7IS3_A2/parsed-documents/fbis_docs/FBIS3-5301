The industry is now in serious recession as a result of reduced demand from the automobile and steel industries and the yen's appreciation. When a certain industry is designated as a specific slump-hit enterprise, businesses in the industry will be given subsidies, to help them take steps to prevent unemployment and help workers laid off find new employment.
