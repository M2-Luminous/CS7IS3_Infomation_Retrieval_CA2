President Kim also explained the background of his upcoming visit to Russia, said Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik. Kim told Clinton that the international community's efforts to resolve the nuclear row peacefully face a grave challenge from North Korea's refueling operation at its 5-megawatt reactor. Once again, Kim stressed the need for closer consultations between South Korea and the United States on the nuclear issue, Chu said. The phone call, which lasted for about 20 minutes from 8:35 AM (KST), was made as Clinton was preparing to leave Washington for Europe to attend commemorative events marking the 50th anniversary of D-day. The two leaders agreed that the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program has reached a very dangerous point and that their countries need closer consultations and resolute cooperation to cope with the situation, Chu said. Clinton told Kim that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are preparing to adopt a council presidential statement on the issue. The statement would demand that North Korea immediately stop changing nuclear fuel rods at the reactor and guarantee inspections by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Clinton explained. Although the statement would make no mention of possible sanctions against North Korea, Clinton said it would carry an important point urging Pyongyang to fulfill its obligations to settle the nuclear row through dialogue, according to Chu. President Kim expressed his total agreement with the Security Council's initial attempt to resolve the issue through dialogue, Chu said. But Kim also stressed to Clinton that there may be no other choice but to proceed with sanctions, the spokesman said. Clinton said that if the firm cooperative system between Washington and Seoul was maintained and Japan's and China's support secured, no problem would arise that could not be resolved, according to Chu. President Kim's visit to Russia carries import if he can secure Russian support on the issue, Clinton said. Since China initiated the adoption of the Security Council president's statement on North Korea last time, it would feel obliged to go along with the United States, Japan and South Korea, Kim told Clinton. America's recent renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status would also help resolve the nuclear row, Kim added. Since both presidents are about to embark on overseas trips, they have agreed to remain in touch through the phone anywhere and at any time, Chu said. Kim and Clinton shared the opinion that they may have to discuss sanctions against North Korea during their trips, Chu said. Asked about the significance of further and apparently urgent consultations by Kim and Clinton during their trips, Chu said the United Nations will have to proceed to sanctions if there is no sign of resolution following the first warning.
