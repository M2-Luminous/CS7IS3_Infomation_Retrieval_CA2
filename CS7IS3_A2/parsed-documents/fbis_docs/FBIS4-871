[Begin Sadepa recording] The four local leaders of the National Movement of the Development Society [MNSD-Nassara], including a deputy, were arrested this morning at Maine-soroa, the birthplace of MNSD-Nassara chairman, Tandja Mamadou. They are accused of inciting violence and ethnic hatred, for they had planned to attack the subprefecture and kidnap the subprefect. They therefore armed their activists with arrows, sticks, and knives. According to the prefect of the department, they were demanding the release of their party chairman, Tandja Mamadou. When the regional authorities were informed, they preempted the attack by arresting the four leaders. This morning, the activists, who were not yet informed of the arrest of their leaders, went to the meeting place but the organizers were absent. They took hostage two activists of the Alliance of Forces of Change: the secretary general of the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism and the president of the Democratic and Social Convention Delegation of Maine-Soroa. According to the department's prefect, the opposition activists intend to proceed with their hostage-taking operation, kidnapping supervisory officers and officials appointed by decree. That is why the prefect, Mr. Ayi Frem, told participants that the law will be rigorously applied. If there is bloodletting, we shall all weep, Ayi Frem stated, adding that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The prefect reiterated the worst-case scenario must be avoided. He told his audience that any civil servant who would heed the call for civil disobedience and yet fold his arms in front of his body would be punished in accordance with the law. Finally, it must be noted that in order to preserve social peace, all public gatherings and demonstrations are strictly forbidden in the department until further notice. [end recording]
