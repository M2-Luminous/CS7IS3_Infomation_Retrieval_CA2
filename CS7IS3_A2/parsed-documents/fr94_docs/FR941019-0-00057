FR941019-0-00057 FR941019-0-00008 I. Discussion On December 16, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to the proxy rules applicable to funds under the 1940 Act. 1 The proposed amendments were intended to update the proxy rules to reflect current matters on which fund shareholders are typically asked to vote and changes in the fund industry since the proxy rules were adopted in 1960. The amendments also were designed to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders in fund proxy statements by placing greater emphasis on information that is directly relevant to specific matters submitted to a shareholder vote and by eliminating disclosure that may not be pertinent to the matters being voted upon and which is, in most cases, available in other disclosure documents. The Commission received twelve comment letters in response to the proposed amendments. 2 Commenters generally expressed strong support for the proposed amendments. The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments with some modifications to reflect the comments received. 1 Investment Company Act Rel. No. 19957 (Dec. 16, 1993) [58 FR 67729 (Dec. 22, 1993)] (``Proposing Release''). 2 The comment letters, as well as a comment summary prepared by the Commission's staff, are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's public reference room in File No. S7&hyph;33&hyph;93. A. Item 22 of Schedule 14A: Reorganization of Disclosure Rules The Commission is consolidating into a new item 22 to Schedule 14A disclosure requirements set forth in rules 20a-2 and 20a-3. 3 Previously, funds preparing proxy statements had to refer to rules under both the 1934 Act and the 1940 Act including Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, Regulation S-K, 4 and rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 under the 1940 Act. Commenters strongly supported the consolidation of proxy disclosure requirements in item 22. 3 These rules are rescinded. Rule 20a-4, which requires a financial data schedule to accompany a proxy filed in connection with certain transactions if the proxy is filed electronically, is also rescinded and incorporated in subparagraph (a)(4) of Item 22. The other items in Schedule 14A continue to be applicable, as appropriate, to fund proxy statements. Schedule 14A includes provisions governing the form and content of all proxy statements. It requires, among other things, information concerning: (i) the date, time, and place of the meeting of shareholders (item 1); (ii) proposals to amend an issuer's charter, by-laws or other corporate documents (item 19); and (iii) voting tabulation procedures (item 21). 4 17 CFR Part 229. Regulation S-K includes the generally applicable disclosure items for filings under, among other things, the 1934 Act. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission has deleted or revised certain provisions currently in rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 and added new requirements, including, among other things, a table showing compensation paid to all directors. 5 In addition, item 22 specifies information required in fund proxy statements when a fund seeks approval of a distribution plan under rule 12b-1 (``Rule 12b-1 Plan''). 6 5 The disclosure requirements in item 22 also are applicable to information statements prepared in accordance with Regulation 14C and Schedule 14C [17 CFR 240.14c-101]. 6 The Commission has adopted minor technical amendments to rule 20a-1 [17 CFR 270.20a-1], the rule that implements the Commission's authority with respect to proxies under section 20(a) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-20(a)], to delete references to rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 and to add references to, among other things, Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A. In addition, the filing fee requirement in rule 20a-1(c) [17 CFR 270.20a-1(c)] has been moved to subparagraph (a)(2) of item 22. B. General Provisions: Item 22(a) 1. Proxy Statement Format; Summary Table Item 22, as proposed, included a new requirement concerning the format for disclosure when one proxy statement solicits shareholder votes for more than one fund or multiple portfolios of series investment companies (``series funds''). 7 This manner of solicitation, while more efficient and less costly, may be confusing to shareholders. Therefore, to assist shareholders in identifying proposals applicable to their fund or portfolio, the Commission proposed to require a fund to include a table at the beginning of the proxy statement that summarizes each proposal and indicates which fund or series shareholders are being requested to approve each proposal. 7 A series fund is a fund comprised of two or more portfolios, each of which has a distinct investment objective with assets specifically allocated to that portfolio; investors' interests in such a fund are limited to those portfolios in which they invest. Each portfolio operates for many purposes like a separate fund, although the portfolios are all part of the same business entity with one board of directors. Series funds are specifically permitted under section 18(f)(2) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(2)].
