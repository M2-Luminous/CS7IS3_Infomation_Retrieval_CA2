While expressing profound confidence in the struggle against Tibetan separatists, Gyaincain Norbu emphatically pointed out the necessity of maintaining vigilance amid the atmosphere of optimism. He said: "The struggle between separatists and antiseparatists in the region is a protracted, acute, and complicated one." The regional government leader went on to explain: "With the support of the international anti-Chinese forces, the Dalai clique took advantage of some social hot spots in the hinterland, such as the problems of commodity prices and taxation, to try its utmost to disrupt unity and stability and obstruct reform and development in Tibet." He added: "Certainly, we maintain a high degree of vigilance. Whether the separatists, particularly the plotters behind the scenes, take advantage of the hot spots in society or directly flaunt the banner of `Tibet independence,' we will adopt resolute and decisive measures to deal with them according to the law." Recently, when interviewed by this reporter on another occasion, Tudeng, head of the Public Health Department of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that the period between 1997 and 2000 will see a baby boom in Tibet, so it is anticipated that the population of Tibet will exceed 2.5 million by the year 2000. The birth rate in Tibet last year was 23.4 per thousand, and allowing for the number of deaths, the natural growth rate was 15.6 per thousand, while the natural growth rate across the country during the same period was approximately 11 per thousand. By the end of last year, there were some 2.2 million people in the entire region, a net increase of 36,000 people over 1992, and more than double as compared with the population in the 1950's.
