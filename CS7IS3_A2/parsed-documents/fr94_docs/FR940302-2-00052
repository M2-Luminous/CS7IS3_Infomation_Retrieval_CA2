FR940302-2-00052 FR940302-2-00035 Public Information Collection Approved by Office of Management and Budget The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has received Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for the following public information collections pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511. For further information contact Shoko B. Hair, Federal Communications Commmission, (202) 632&hyph;6934. Federal Communications Commission OMB Control No.: 3060&hyph;0590. Title: In the Matter of Transport Rate Structure and Pricing, CC Docket No. 91&hyph;213, Second Report and Order, released January 31, 1994. Expiration Date: 04/30/94. Estimated Annual Burden: 110 total hours; 2 hours per response. Description: In the Second Report and Order in CC Docket No. 91&hyph;213 (released 1/31/94), the Commission modified certain features of the price cap regulatory system applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) to accommodate the recent restructure of the LECs local transport rates. Transport services, including all the transmission-related elements, the tandem switching charge, and the interconnection charge, were moved out of the price cap basket for traffic sensitive services and placed into a combined ``trunking'' basket containing transport and special access services. The Commission realigned the service categories and subcategories within the trunking basket to reflect the similarities between certain special access and flat-rated transport services, and to accommodate the new density zone pricing system that were adopted for both special access and transport. The pricing bands applicable to the service categories and subcategories were also adapted. All LECs subject to the price cap rules are required to file a supplemental tariff review plan to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decision in the Order. The recalculated indexes should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that changes rates of services in the trucking or traffic sensitive baskets subsequent to the effective date of the initial restructured transport tariffs. Subsequent tariff filings must be made pursuant to the modified rules. The information will be used to aid in the review of the LECs transport service restructure by the Commission and interested parties. OMB Control No.: 3060&hyph;0484. Title: Amendment of part 63 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for the Notification of Common Carriers of Service Disruptions_R&O, ยง63.100. Expiration Date: 06/30/96. Estimated Annual Burden: 239 total hours; 2.3 hours per response. Description: In the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in CC Docket No. 91&hyph;273, released December 1, 1993, the Commission amended 47 CFR 63.100 to include competitive access providers among those required to report outages lasting 30 or more minutes and potentially affecting 50,000 or more of their customers. This action is necessary to ensure the Commission's ability to monitor outages and determine what steps may be necessary to ensure network reliability. The amendment will provide the Commission with the additional information it needs to perform this task. OMB approval also includes the Commission's proposal to amend ยง63.100 to require that local exchange and interexchange common carriers that operate either transmission or switching facilities report outages affecting 30,000 or more customers or special facilities. OMB Control No.: 3060&hyph;0583. Title: Amendment of part 32 and 64 of the Commission's rules to Account for Transactions Between Carriers and Their Nonregulated Affiliates_CC Docket No. 93&hyph;251 (Proposed Rules). Expiration Date: 10/31/96. Estimated Annual Burden: 320,020 total hours; 4980 total hours per response. Description: OMB approved the proposed requirements contained in the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking (notice) in CC Docket No. 93&hyph;453, released October 20, 1993. The notice sought comments to amend the Commission's affiliate transaction rules and on the specific procedures telephone companies would use in implementing the proposed rules. The FCC proposed these measures to enhance its ability to keep telephone companies from imposing the costs of nonregulated activities on interstate ratepayers, and to keep ratepayers from being harmed by the telephone companies imprudence. The Notice proposed new and modified information requirements to help ensure that carriers adhere to the proposed affiliate transactions rule amendments. Federal Communications Commission. William F.
