These policy officials later met Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura at the prime minister's official residence, and requested that the government respect these basic guidelines in the process of drafting the budget. With regard to the focal issue of income tax cuts, the guidelines deleted the wording in the orginal version that this should be done "basically without issuing special government bonds," and settled with the more abstract expression that "in order to bring about an early economic recovery, positive measures should be taken while paying attention to maintaining sound fiscal policies." A final decision on this issue will be left to the meeting of the ruling parties' representatives or of the economic affairs committee. The basic guidelines reflect the political values of the coalition government, which puts forth the slogan of "responsible change," in its first effort to compile a budget. Concrete policy measures cited as the main points of the draft budget include: 1) new agricultural policy in light of the agreement concluded at the GATT multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round); 2) the development of new sources of energy; and 3) fiscal and administrative reform measures, including the consolidation and rationalization of various subsidies, and relaxation of regulations.
