On the Progress of the Implementation of the State Program for the Employment of the Population in 1993"] [Text] The Ukrainian Ministry of Labor has released information on the progress of the implementation of the State Program for the Employment of the Population in the nine months [as published] of 1993 which has been received from ministries and departments, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, oblast state administrations, and the Kiev and Sevastopol city administrations. The employment program envisioned the introduction of 114,300 new jobs in the current year. Actually, 70,700 units, or 61.8 percent, were actually introduced during the nine months of this year. The program of job creation at enterprises of the private form of ownership was 154.3 percent fulfilled, of the mixed ownership form--115.1 percent fulfilled, of collective ownership--57.8 percent fulfilled, and of the state form of ownership--34.7 percent fulfilled. Some 17,626.7 million karbovantsy has been allocated to create additional jobs from the state fund for facilitating the employment of the populace, and 53.8 million karbovantsy from the State Off-Budget Privatization Fund. The measures taken made it possible to place 150,700 people in jobs from among the nonemployed population during the reporting period, or 33 percent, compared to 27.5 percent during the corresponding period of last year. Considerable attention was paid to the job placement of citizens who are not capable of competing in the labor market on an equal footing and for whom 317,100 jobs were reserved this year within the 5-percent quota. The sphere of labor use expanded in the reporting period owing to the organization of paid public works. Three times as many citizens as in the corresponding period of last year (11,200) took part in these works. More than 42 percent of the citizens who engaged in such works were unemployed. A total of 306,700 man-days were put in at public works of all types, which exceeds this indicator for the period between January and September of last year by a factor of 2.4. The invigoration of joint efforts by the Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Education, and the State Employment Center and the taking of organizational measures by them made it possible to increase considerably the volume of vocational training and retraining of laid-off employees and the nonemployed population. The Employment Service has signed cooperation agreements with more than 800 educational establishments. Between January and September of this year, 23,300 nonemployed citizens received instruction or underwent retraining. Efforts are being made to ensure vocational retraining and to facilitate the adaptation of women and young people to the conditions of the new economic situation. In particular, the training of women has been organized at the school of entrepreneurs in the sector of small- and medium-size businesses at the Cadre Training Administration of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine and the Institute for Skill Improvement of the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry. Seminar training for women in fundamentals of business is being offered in Rovno, Kherson, Kharkov, and other oblasts. A total of more than 16,100 women have been referred for vocational instruction since the beginning of the year. Certain efforts have been made this year to organize the training of servicemen discharged from the military service in conjunction with strength or authorized complement reductions and not entitled to retirement pay. Some 1,594.6 million karbovantsy has been spent for vocational training from the State Fund for Facilitating the Employment of the Population, of which 507.2 million karbovantsy was for the payment of scholarships. Nonetheless there are still many shortcomings and unresolved issues in the area of vocational training and retraining. The main directions for further work on carrying out the State Program for the Employment of the Populace in this matter were set forth at a meeting of the collegium, which was held on 24 November, of the Ukrainian Ministry of Education with the participation of representatives of the State Employment Center. In particular, it is envisioned to develop the Concept of Vocational Training and Retraining of the Nonemployed Adult Population, to establish an interdepartmental commission for the issues of vocational training and retraining, and to submit, for consideration by the leadership of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labor, proposals for the establishment and organization of the work of model centers of professional training and retraining in the regions. The scope of carrying out program measures over these nine months has been in line with the current condition of the labor market. In Ukraine as a whole, the unemployment rate comes to 0.28 percent of the able-bodied population of the working age. As of 1 October of this year, a total of 78,700 unemployed were registered, which is 1.3 times more than on the same date last year. More than 75 percent of them are women. The unemployment situation is the most acute in the western region of Ukraine, where 50.2 percent of all unemployed are concentrated. Hidden unemployment persists on a considerable scale, just as it did in the first half of this year. In July through September of this year, 759,400 people, or 16.8 percent of the average number on the payroll, were on unpaid leaves of various duration (from two weeks to one month or more) at 5,988 enterprises surveyed by the employment service. Reviewing the issue of the progress implementing the State Program for the Employment of the Population for 1993 at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine made it possible to bring the development of the material-technical facilities of the state employment service to the attention of the state administration.
