The Serbs have already halted a convoy organised by AICF in Sarajevo and bound for Gorazde, the aid agency said. "Only UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] military convoys are authorized by the Bosnian Serbs to travel from Sarajevo to Gorazde," according to Beatrice d'Ervau, spokeswoman for the humanitarian group. The group's convoy in Sarajevo was originally to have been escorted by UNPROFOR, but the Serbs refused to allow UN involvement. They demanded that the convoy be protected by Serb militias, which was unacceptable to the organisers. On Wednesday, an International Committee of the Red Cross convoy arrived in the eastern Bosnian enclave after being held up for several days in Pale, the Bosnian Serb self-proclaimed capital. A NATO ultimatum which eventually sparked the Bosnian Serb withdrawal from around Gorazde included a demand that aid convoys be allowed unimpeded access to the enclave, which was under Serb assault for three weeks.
