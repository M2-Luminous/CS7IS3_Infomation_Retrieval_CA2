Priit Ennet attended a news conference he gave at the airport. [Ennet] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup intends to sign an Estonian-Danish defense cooperation agreement tomorrow. Denmark has already concluded similar agreements with Latvia and Lithuania. They envisage the holding of consultations in order to resolve defense and security issues and dialogue on strategic planning. Hans Haekkerup said on arrival at Tallinn airport that state defense greements with all Baltic states on state defense cooperation are basically very similar. [Begin Haekkerup recording, in English fading to Estonian translation] It is important to us that the Baltic states should not be set to trail behind other central and eastern European countries. We wish to ensure that the Baltic states are part of Europe and have access to our security structures, with the help of bilateral and multipartite cooperation. We are much interested in cooperation with the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. The Nordic countries, in conjunction with other countries, have been aiming to draft a program of assistance to the Baltic battalion. We aim to help to design the battalion's structure and cooperate in training. I hope we will be able to supply some of the equipment. [passage omitted] [end recording]
