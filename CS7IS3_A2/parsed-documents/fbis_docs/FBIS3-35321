FBIS3-35321 "drnes036_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 JORDAN Abu-Nidal `Terrorists' Charged in Diplomat's Murder `Plots,' Iranian Link Revealed JN2202211794 Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic 23 Feb 94 p 4 JN2202211794 Amman AL-BILAD Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Ra'id Salihah] [Text] Swiftly, and without any prior notice, the security agencies arrested every member of Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna] Fatah-the Revolutionary Council group in Jordan in an operation that lasted no more than 48 hours. The operation started Saturday [19 February] morning and ended Sunday evening. Despite the fact that the security agencies are keeping a tight lid on this swift operation, preliminary information leaked to AL-BILAD by well-informed sources reveals that the operation was only a warning message and a precautionary measure. At the same time, these sources confirmed that Syrian and Lebanese security agencies have separately obtained confessions from the individuals accused in the assassination of martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah [Jordanian diplomat assassinated in Beirut on 29 January] to the effect that they had organizational links with Abu-Nidal's group. These sources also believe that members of the Abu-Nidal group in Jordan were deceived by their leadership, which convinced them that it had no connection whatsoever to al-Ma'ayitah's assassination. AL-BILAD obtained a highly-classified file, supported by documents and information. The file shows, beyond any doubt, that some members of Abu-Nidal group intended to carry out bloody operations in Jordan. This was revealed in a secret leaflet, circulated on a very limited basis inside the group, which shows that the group is furious with the security agencies despite clear attempts by the group leaders in Jordan to label relations between the Revolutionary Council and Jordan as very calm. The latest Revolutionary Council statement to reveal this hostile attitude appeared on 29 November 1993. The communique, stamped by the movement's official seal, cites a statement issued by the Central Committee of the Palestine National Liberation Movement-General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces-The Revolutionary Council. The statement says "...we urge every Arab citizen living on the land of our nation to realize the threats of the Judaization campaign. This campaign threatens destructive civil wars, which have started in Palestine today and are expected to explode on the Jordanian arena in the next few months. It is regrettable that in Jordan an agency, which has no work or mission but to pursue our movement's members and mujahidin, continues to exist." The same statement also notes that operations will be carried out this year without specifying where. The statement says "... we also stress to the concerned factions, which claim responsibility for operations we had the honor to carry out, that we cannot keep silent after 1 January 1994." The statement vehemently attacks Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. The same attack was reaffirmed in another statement issued by the Revolutionary Council on 1 January 1994 on the 29th anniversary of the movement [Fatah-the Revolutionary Council celebrates the same founding anniversary as that of the 'Arafat-led, PLO mainstream Fatah Movement]. However, it is worth noting that this statement did not mention Jordan at all. This information seems bland when compared to the information leaked to AL-BILAD about the abortion of an operation to smuggle missiles from Lebanon to the group in Jordan in order to carry out two serious operations in the Jordanian arena. One of these operations was aimed at blowing up a very sensitive target in Amman while the other was aimed at assassinating an important Palestinian figure in Amman. The planned date for carrying out these two operations was not clear. However, the information indicated that the operations were to be carried out on a single day during an occasion described as an important Palestinian occasion. In another development, elements of the Abu-Nidal group have leaked information that an agreement on clear constants has been reached with Jordan. The most prominent of these constants is that, as a group in Jordan, they are not responsible for any publication the group sends from outside Jordan and that they are not committed to presenting any information on this issue. Moreover, the group stopped issuing the their weekly publication, which is of limited distribution, due to emergency circumstances. According to AL-BILAD's information, pressure was also brought to bear by delaying the arrival in the Jordanian market, or banning altogether, the magazine FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH, the mouthpiece of the group. AL-BILAD's investigations also revealed another plot by the Abu-Nidal group in Jordan, aimed at opening relations with Fatah-'Arafat cadres that have connections inside the occupied Arab territories, especially in terms of military action. As part of this, the Abu-Nidal group's activities focused on Fatah cadres that oppose Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's actions, that have reservations about the peace agreement with Israel, or that have military groups or political activities in the occupied territories. Part of this plan was an unsuccessful attempt by head the of the group in Jordan ('A.Q.) [initials as published] at contacts with 'Abbas Zaki, member of Fatah Central Council. Zaki was visited by this man, who came out with the impression that he could not cooperate or coordinate with Zaki. The bases for cooperation outlined by Abu-Nidal elements are formed on a concentration on issues inside the occupied territories, on building an armed structure, and on preparedness for financing and facilitating the purchase of weapons. Our investigations also revealed another secret plot by the Abu-Nidal group aimed at pursuing the pro-'Arafat elements and obtaining the greatest amount of information on their lives. The implementation of this major plan began a few months ago with noticeable briskness. According to AL-BILAD information, the required information concentrated on the following: 1. Details about these people's houses and their addresses. Is it rented or personal property? What is the rent or how much does the house cost? 2. Their financial situation; their personal property, bank accounts, cars, real estate, ranches, shops. 3. Names of sons, daughters; their schools, behavior, friends, how much money they spend. From which supermarket the family shops. 4. Social relations; what level; restaurants frequented by the them. 5. Female relations: following up these relations and documenting them. Arab security sources told AL-BILAD that the Abu-Nidal group elements had claimed that the group did not want to do any harm to the pro-'Arafat' men, in accordance with a gentleman's agreement with Jordan. They said that all this information had been collected for future consideration and that their dossiers would be reopened in occupied Palestine later when the opportunity arose so that the Palestinian people would know the bloodsuckers who wasted their resources. Then the people would sentence them to death and confiscate all their possessions. Security reports available to us also reveal another plot being implemented in complete secrecy. It reveals in detail how the new Abu-Nidal elements used to be dispatched to Iran and returned back to Jordan. The amazing details show that youths coming from the occupied territories carrying permits allowing them a long time for study or tourism in Russia were later sent to Azerbaijan. Form there they would go to Iran by land through channels well-known to Iranian authorities. Their passports would not be stamped at their entry to Iran. Reports say that the new elements would be grouped and trained by special and advanced courses. They would then be returned to Jordan in the same way. Those residing in the occupied territories, would leave Jordan for these territories. Dozens of Arab and Palestinian students studying in Russia would be recruited and sent to Iran for training during their university holidays.
