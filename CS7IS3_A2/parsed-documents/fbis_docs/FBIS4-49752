In order to safeguard the legitimate interests of production and export enterprises in our country, maintain our country's export markets, and accomplish the work of responding to overseas lawsuits on antidumping cases involving our exports, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has specially drawn up these stipulations. Article 2. When antidumping charges are brought against Chinese exports, respondents to lawsuits should be: 1. Enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade and with exported goods (including transshipment) during the period of investigation to countries or regions which bring charges against the goods, and 2. Enterprises producing export goods referred to by section one. Article 3. All import and export chambers of commerce or foreign-invested enterprise associations (chambers of commerce or associations) are responsible for organizing and coordinating the work of responding to lawsuits on antidumping cases and should appoint personnel with professional skills to be in charge. When only a minority of enterprises produce or export products accused of being dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or associations can appoint one unit to be responsible for organizing and coordinating overseas lawsuits. However, chambers of commerce or the associations should constantly have a grip on the progress of the work and open the necessary files. Article 4. When a certain product is accused of being dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or associations should promptly issue notices in GUOJI SHANGBAO, and those who are going to respond to the charges should immediately inform departments, commissions, and bureaus of foreign economic relations and trade (local foreign economic relations and trade commissions) and chambers of commerce or associations concerned in their provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, or cities specially listed in the state plan. Article 5. Respondents to lawsuits should, in accordance with the requirements of the questionnaire, provide data and information on the products concerned during the period of investigation, such as prices, production quantities, exports, and production costs, and should appoint special personnel to be in charge of the work of responding to lawsuits, checks, and re-examinations. Article 6. During the response period, respondents should be subordinate to coordinated arrangements made by the local foreign economic relations and trade commissions and the chambers of commerce or associations. Article 7. Chambers of commerce or associations should promptly report respondents' names, phone numbers, addresses, fax numbers, and list of contacts to MOFTEC. Article 8. Respondents should pay lawyers' fees and other relevant charges on time in accordance with the percentage of export goods under investigation during the period of investigation. Article 9. Entrusted by respondents, chambers of commerce or associations are in charge of organizing the work of responding to overseas lawsuits, and they can also retain foreign lawyers who understand China's situation and have strong professional abilities to respond to the lawsuits. Article 10. The chambers of commerce or associations can retain domestic lawyers with expertise in handling antidumping cases to take part in responding to the lawsuits, such as filling question lists and preparing relevant legal documents and proofs. Article 11. If necessary, chambers of commerce or associations can organize respondents to take part in hearings or concrete negotiations abroad, but they must solicit opinions from MOFTEC's antidumping work departments in advance. Article 12. Respondents can negotiate and sign "price guarantees" or "suspension agreements" and should conscientiously implement them. Respondents should constantly or regularly report the situation of agreement implementation to chambers of commerce or associations. Chambers of commerce or associations should supervise and examine agreement implementation situations. Article 13. Chambers of commerce or associations should promptly report to MOFTEC the situation concerning responses to antidumping suits and existing problems. Article 14. Chambers of commerce or associations and respondents should open files on antidumping cases and keep complete sets of information. They should also keep a watch for changes in the export situation of every product which has been investigated. Chamber of commerce or associations should summarize the situation and report to MOFTEC every six months. Article 15. Regarding export goods against which, as shown by evidence, antidumping measures will be implemented, or goods which have been punished by antidumping practices but can still be exported, chambers of commerce or associations should, to prevent any further implementation of antidumping measures, promptly put forward MOFTEC suggestions to improve export administration methods, including setting up export quotas or issuing permits. Chambers of commerce or associations will submit to MOFTEC a list of enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade which have a good grip on export prices and take the initiative in responding to lawsuits, and MOFTEC will give priority to them when distributing quotas and issuing permits. Article 16. Chambers of commerce or associations should perfect market research work and take necessary measures to strive to prevent any occurrence of antidumping lawsuits abroad. Article 17. When chambers of commerce or associations are entrusted with the task of responding to overseas lawsuits, all local foreign economic relations and trade commissions should be responsible for coordinating, in cooperation with the chambers of commerce or associations, the work of responding to antidumping lawsuits in their localities, including urging local respondents to respond to the lawsuits concerned and pay fees on time. Under given conditions, all local foreign economic relations and trade commissions can also be in charge of organizing responses to antidumping lawsuits. They should also investigate and grasp the situation in their localities which leads to the occurrence of antidumping cases, analyze their impact on export trade, and take appropriate measures. Article 18. All trade organs accredited to foreign countries should investigate and grasp antidumping laws and regulations in the countries where they are staying, as well as the investigation and adjudication situation in antidumping cases involving China. Moreover, they should promptly report to MOFTEC the above-mentioned situations, existing problems, and opinions for improving trade administration and the work of responding to lawsuits. Regarding antidumping cases which may arise or have just arisen, it is necessary to promptly report them to MOFTEC and the chambers of commerce or associations concerned. Trade organs accredited to foreign countries can make suggestions on retaining lawyers and supervising their pleas. Groups going abroad to respond to lawsuits or take part in hearings should be guided by trade organs accredited to foreign countries and should promptly report the work situation to the latter. Article 19. MOFTEC is responsible for guiding the work of responding to antidumping lawsuits, laying down and revising methods for administering the work of responding to antidumping lawsuits, and holding consultations with the governments of importing countries on handling relevant cases so that Chinese exports are treated fairly. Article 20. For those companies or enterprises who know perfectly well that products manufactured by their own companies or enterprises are facing antidumping charges but choose not to respond to relevant lawsuits or pay lawyers' fees and other relevant charges and not to cooperate with the authorities in lawsuits, chambers of commerce or associations should promptly report these cases to MOFTEC, and they are empowered to condemn or issue critical circulars of this practice. Article 21. For authorized foreign trade companies or enterprises who do not promptly respond to lawsuits, do not pay lawyers' fees or other relevant charges, and do not cooperate with the authorities in antidumping investigations, we may circulate notes of criticism against them or abolish all or part of their rights to apply for export quotas and permits. For those companies or enterprises which commit serious cases, all or part of their rights to engage in foreign trade can be abolished and they can be fined. Article 22. Relevant articles in these stipulations also apply to cases of investigation started by foreign governments in accordance with "anti-subsidy" laws and laws against "market disruption" and "protectionist measures." Article 23. MOFTEC assigns its Treaty and Law Department to be in charge of antidumping work. Article 24. These regulations are effective from the day of promulgation.
