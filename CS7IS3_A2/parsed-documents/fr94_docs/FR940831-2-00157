FR940831-2-00157 FR940831-2-00106 In the 1992/1993 surveys, Runzheimer recommended, and OPM agreed, that the observations be ranked from low to high on the basis of the cost per square foot and that the top and bottom 20 percent of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e., eliminated) from the sample before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were fewer than five observations.) These procedures reduce the influence of home sales anomalies and make survey results more stable from one year to the next. 4.4.1.2␣Special Considerations The new procedures also involved analyzing data in a more thorough and integrated manner. The procedures required analyzing the current housing survey data, analyzing the trends observed when these data were compared with the previous survey's data, and comparing these trends with the views obtained from real estate professionals in the area. How and which data were used depended on the quality and quantity of data collected and how the trends observed agreed among income levels and with the views of local real estate professionals. These procedures are discussed below. Runzheimer sought to gather all of the appropriate comparable sales data available in each area. As a minimum, Runzheimer sought to obtain 10 realtor sales per community per income level or 20 per income level per area. In many areas, the sales data exceeded the minimum. If the minimum number could not be obtained or if highly divergent trend data were observed among income levels in the area or as compared with the views of local real estate professionals, additional analyses were performed. These analyses were: 1. If the current data were significantly better than the previous data (e.g., greater in quantity or more consistent), the current data were used to the extent practical. 2. If at least three observations at each income level were available, and the previous data were better than the current data or the previous and current data were of equivalent quality, the change (i.e., trend) in the average price was used to update the previous data. This was done using one of the following procedures, depending on the situation: a. If data problems occurred at one income level only, the average rate of change at the other two income levels was used to adjust the previous prices for the affected income level. b. If data problems occurred in two income levels, the rate of change observed at the non-problem income level was used to adjust the previous prices for the two affected income levels. c. If data problems occurred at all income levels, the average rate of change observed at all three income levels was used to adjust the previous prices at all income levels. 3. If fewer than three observations were available at any income level and/or the data quality was questionable at all levels, all three levels of current and previous survey data were merged. These data were then analyzed by applying the procedures described in section 4.4.1 above to each set of merged data, and the average cost per square foot was computed for each set of data and compared to estimate the overall change in the area. This overall change was applied to the previous average costs by income level to determine the current costs at each income level for the area. The areas for which these procedures were applied and the calculations used are found in Appendix 9A. 4.4.2␣Rental Data Analysis Runzheimer assigned each rental quote data point to a single income level, based on these criteria: •Assign one bedroom apartments to the lower income level. •Assign two bedroom apartments to the middle income level. •Assign townhouses and detached houses with a minimum of two bedrooms to the upper income level. 4.4.2.1␣Data Trimming and Special Analyses In the analysis of rental data, Runzheimer applied the same procedures used to trim the home sales data (see section 4.4.1.1) except that data were ranked on the basis of monthly rental rates, not cost per square foot. Also, as with home sales analyses, special analyses were applied to rental data when the data were sparse or highly divergent trends were observed among income levels. These analyses were the same as those applied to home sales data (see section 4.4.1.2) except that if data were merged, overall estimates were based on monthly rental rates, not the cost per square foot. (See Appendix 9B for these analyses.)
