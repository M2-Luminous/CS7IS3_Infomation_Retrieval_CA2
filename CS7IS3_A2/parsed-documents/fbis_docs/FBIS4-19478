It is true. However, there is a positive aspect to this. In previous years, it was military regimes that imposed such heavy measures. This time, a civilian government is trying to correct a bankrupt policy it took over from other civilian politicians. [passage omitted] Another thing our country can be pleased about is that the citizens no longer trust politicians who lie. The citizens are more able to grasp the truth now. They will no longer vote for any politician promising everyone "two keys" [for a house and a car, as promised by Demirel when he was True Path Party leader]. Tansu Ciller said: "I will definitely defeat terrorism in the economy. I am preparing a bitter medicine for you." And she won the elections. We believe that this is a good sign and a guarantee for the future of democracy in Turkey as well. Our democracy seems to have matured to a point where the civilians clean up the mess made by other civilians. We must not forget that another mature element is the Social Democratic Populist Party. Displaying maturity, the party set aside social policies and bowed before economic rules. However, we still want to remind our readers to beware of lying politicians. They might influence innocent citizens. Their remarks might be effective given the fact that the livelihood of many will be disturbed. We want the government to be just, however. The Turkish people are extremely sensitive about this. The sacrifices must be distributed evenly. The package is a good opportunity to correct the salary injustices that have been going on for years. For example, while the package foresees that many workers will be laid off, Central Bank employees receive double salaries every two months. That is not fair. If the government implements them justly and vigorously, there is no reason why the measures should not succeed.
