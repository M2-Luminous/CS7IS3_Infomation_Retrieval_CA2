The investigation's goal is to uncover the weaknesses in the organization of work and ensuring its secrecy in the light of the arrest of former-CIA official Aldrich Ames, who is now accused of working for Moscow for nine years. Woolsey mentioned that, to head the commission, he would like to recruit former National Security Adviser under Bush's administration Brent Scowcroft, former secretary of defence under President Jimmy Carter Harold Brown, and the former head of the counter-espionage department in the FBI, Douglas Gow. The commission will also include current CIA officials. Besides, Woolsey delclared, the CIA would also conduct an "independent and energetic" investigation into the Ames affair. This will be headed by Fred Hitz, the inspector general of the intelligence department. Woolsey noted that the parallel investigations will be carried on without applying pressure on the on-going judicial investigation into the activity of Ames and his wife, who is also accused of espionage.
