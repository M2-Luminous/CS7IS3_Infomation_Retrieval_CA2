The moment chosen for the latter event was rather significant. It coincided with the anniversary of the late President Boudiaf's return to Algeria. The tenor of the defense minister's words was reminiscent of the assassinated president and seemed to connect up with the latter's vision of the path, which the country needs to take to end the crisis. His speech, broadcast in prime time, offered a highly critical assessment--one such as Boudiaf himself never hesitated to give--of the country's plight and the behavior of the political class (the parties and the political authorities). Observers noted that no one was spared, not even the de facto regime, starting with the HCE [Higher State Council]. His analysis did not lead into the issues of security and reestablishment of order and thus implied the answer to the country's problems must be sought elsewhere. According to Mr. Zeroual, the solution lies in "establishment of a new national system that enshrines real democracy, guarantees all individual and social freedoms, and puts a definitive end to political, economic, cultural, and ideological monopolies." Implantation of this new system will entail "a real break with the practices and administrative methods of the past at every political, economic, and social level," the defense minister said. "The break that we believe so essential and we hope to realize," he continued, "must bring about radical change in the machinery of the state, and its components must respect new parameters." Nor should the human factor be ignored, according to the defense minister, because "this new system will permit the emergence of new people capable of making changes and taking concrete steps to realize the nation's aspirations toward peace, progress, brotherhood, and Algeria's rehabilitation as a member of the family of nations." Mr. Zeroual laid out a veritable political program, enumerating the diverse aspects of the crisis and advocating the remedial measures needed for a return to political, economic, and social stability. The interview published on 24 October 1993 offers further clues to the thinking of the man who just became the country's top leader. He asserts, for example, that "the ANP [People's National Army] is a republican army that believes in democratic institutions, political alternation, multiparty pluralism, and a state of law." The army's current political involvement: "is solely for the purpose of preserving national unity, reestablishing civil peace, and opening up new prospects for our country, thanks to which resort to violence as a means of political expression--and all forms of political, ideological, and economic monopolies--will be abolished forever." But it must be understood, Mr. Zeroual cautions, "and no one should lose sight of the fact, that the ANP cannot remain indifferent toward anything that might be of critical importance for the country's future." He thus condemns, unequivocally and categorically, the religious extremism shown by fundamentalists who have opted for armed and destructive action. "We cannot think of an example anywhere else in the world," he said, "where an extremist movement, whatever its credo, has made such vicious attacks on the people's property, their factories, their schools, and even sought the physical elimination of cadres and ordinary citizens." Freedom of the press "is a fundamental right and an essential condition in a society that aspires for transparency," Mr. Zeroual said in October 1993, adding that he would "certainly expect to be available to the media and improve relations with the press." "We support the people's right to truly informative and edifying news about doings and events. But we are against slanted `revelations' in the media," he said.
