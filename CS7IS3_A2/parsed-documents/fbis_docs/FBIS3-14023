He emphasized that not only the JKLF leadership but also a majority of members from other parties are in favor of the "third option." He added that he has been supporting this ideology for three decades. So far as his statement that he has been propagating the ideology for the full sovereignty of Kashmir for three decades is concerned, it is imperative to note that the "third option" rubbish is both illogical and unjustifiable. This is due not only to the fact that it is against Pakistan's security, the formula for the partition of the Indian subcontinent, and UN resolutions, it is also against the spirit of the Kashmiri people witnessed in the form of a freedom movement since the time of the Dogra rulers. The Kashmiri people have also been shown this spirit in the hoisting of the Pakistani flag in occupied Kashmir on Pakistan's national day, ignoring the rain of bullets and curfew restrictions. Until today, the Kashmiri people have raised only one voice, that is, annexation with Pakistan through a plebiscite. Amanullah Khan, who is raising his voice for a sovereign Kashmir against this "popular will" of the Kashmiri people, is actively clamoring for it at a time when the United States is also exerting pressure for some solution. And the American attempt is apparently aimed at imposing India over China's head through a sovereign Kashmir [sentence as published]. Even if we accept that Amanullah Khan has been recommending the third option for three decades, he cannot be justified in propagating this idea. Which democracy permits the domination of a baseless ideology of any so-called leader against the wishes of the people and the interest of the nation? The reality is that the people of Kashmir are opting to join Pakistan. Of course, if any leader wants the third option, it is entirely a different matter which has nothing to do with the spirit of the Kashmiri people. The sole objective of having a sovereign Kashmir state is to make this region a base for American conspiracies against Pakistan and China. The people of Kashmir also have faith in the ideology of the father of the nation, the great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah, that Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan. In addition to the parties taking part in the freedom movement, every Kashmiri wants to seek help from Pakistan alone at this delicate moment. The reason is that every Kashmiri considers himself a Pakistani and the basic element of their freedom movement is exercising the right to self-determination and making Kashmir a part of Pakistan. In the craze for building his own sandcastle, Amanullah Khan cannot mutilate the history of the freedom movement of Kashmir, nor can the so-called ideology he has recommended get the approval of the people of Kashmir. The JKLF itself in the occupied valley does not support a sovereign Kashmir. The viewpoint of the Kashmiris is quite clear. *
