The Chechen Foreign Ministry told Interfax that "only the Chechen republic's obligations to confront terrorism as an international phenomenon prevented it from taking tougher measures against the violators of the air space." The Chechen State Security Department told Interfax that the Chechen anti-aircraft forces had forced the Russian helicopter following the helicopter with the terrorists on board land at Groznyy airport after they crossed the Chechen border. "The detention and neutralization of the terrorists was carried out by Chechen special purpose units," a spokesman for the department said. The terrorists had captured a bus with civilians near Mineralniye Vody and flew for Chechnya having been given a ransom of several million dollars. At the moment, the terrorists, including two Chechen nationals and one Kumyk (one of the peoples populating Dagestan -- IF note) are in a custody in Groznyy under investigation. Negotiations are held to extradite the terrorists to Russia. At the same time, a high-ranking official of the Chechen presidential staff told Interfax that Groznyy would insist on Russia's notifying it of emergencies. He described the fact that the Russian side had failed to take part in the detention of the terrorists near the Chechen town of Gudermes as a blunder by the Russian special services.
