According to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, 1993 saw the greatest number of government department-run economic entities; all the licenses kept in stock had been given away by July. In Shanxi alone, provincial-level government departments set up 1,098 companies on a trial basis last year, and a total of 3,000 cadres went into business. Of this total, however, 50 percent have returned to their original posts. Seven department- and bureau-level cadres went into business last year, but all have gone back to their old profession. Of the 120 county- and section-level cadres who went into business last year, half have returned to government departments. Of the 667 subsection-level cadres who went into business last year, 427 have returned to their original posts. A survey shows the main reason why cadres have been jumping off the bandwagon like a swarm of bees is that it is difficult to make money. Most government department-run economic entities have failed to turn a profit. In Anhui, various companies run by government departments suffered 7 million yuan in economic losses in one year. These economic entities will face even greater difficulties after their ties with government cadres have been completely severed.
