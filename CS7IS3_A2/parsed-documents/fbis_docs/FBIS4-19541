FBIS4-19541 "drweu076_i_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 FRANCE Interior Minister on Algerian Refugees, Corsica Interior Minister on Algerian Refugees, Corsica BR1804140994 Paris LE FIGARO in French 18 Apr 94 p 11 BR1804140994 Paris LE FIGARO French BFN [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Jacques Fleury, Thierry Oberle, and Ivan Rioufol; place and date not given] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] Algerians are starting to flee their country and come to France. Does this worry you? [Pasqua] So far, the exodus you mention has not occurred. We have gone from 104 applications for asylum in 1992 to a little more than 1,000 last year. It is obvious that if the situation in Algeria were to worsen, we would probably receive more requests. [LE FIGARO] If the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] comes to power in Algeria, there will be many people requesting asylum in France. Are you prepared to accept them? [Pasqua] There is no reason why the FIS should gain power in Algeria. France wants Algeria to find the economic and political means of solving its problems. This depends on discussions between the government and its existing opponents. It is out of the question for us to accept a flood of people coming from Algeria. We would not be in a position to accept several tens of thousands of people. [LE FIGARO] But will these exiles not be able to take advantage of the right of asylum? [Pasqua] The right of asylum is an individual right, whereas you refer to an exodus of a population. We would obviously accept those who have French nationality. Those with dual nationality will have to justify their claim. Aside from these exiles, we have no obligations, or else we will have to accept half the world! Moreover, if this problem was raised, it should be examined not in the framework of our own country, but in that of the Mediterranean countries and at the level of the European Union. Italy, Spain, and France would face the same problem. We cannot be the natural receptacle for all the oppressed, all the persecuted, all oppositionists. [LE FIGARO] Do you take seriously an Islamic fundamentalist threat in France? [Pasqua] The government's role is to take seriously any possible threats. Moreover, it is in this spirit that we launched a preventive operation against FIS supporters in Paris and in central France, which has resulted in the destabilization of that organization. We have carried out the same operation with regard to the Kurds. We will do it with regard to others if necessary. All groups which might carry out violent or unlawful actions in our country are obviously kept under surveillance. But, for the time being, there is no Islamic fundamentalist threat in France. [LE FIGARO] How do you interpret the recent arrest in Lille of two alleged FIS supporters? [Pasqua] I take these arrests very seriously. We will now try to unravel the question, which is the natural role of the legal system and the police. [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] In Corsica, is the dialogue with the nationalists not a failure, since the terrorist campaign continues? [Pasqua] Do you have a better policy? The aim is not to have dialogue with the nationalists, but primarily to give Corsica the necessary means for its economic development. Corsica is the first region of France to sign the state-region reorganization law. We are now preparing the revenue bill, which will be presented to Parliament sometime in May. I think that there is a very broad agreement in Corsica on this legislation and on the development measures, including circles close to the nationalists. The arrest of the Sperone commando was a serious blow to the nationalists, but it will not lead to their disappearance. This kind of actions will be halted through a series of measures, the weariness of the population, and, finally, a new awareness by all the nationalists, or at least by the most responsible ones. But all attacks must not be lumped together. There is a good proportion of crime and racketeering. I have given the police instructions and resources, and we are beginning to have results.
