On the eve of his departure for China, he enthusiastically agreed to give an exclusive interview to this XINHUA reporter at the Duma building in the center of Moscow. Rybkin entered the State Duma as a representative of the Agrarian Party in last December's Russian parliamentary election and was later elected speaker of the State Duma. When entering his large and bright office, people will immediately notice a large map of Russia. His furniture is plain and simple. A three-color Russian national flag stands beside a large desk. Rybkin is 47 years old, wore a black suit, and appeared to be prudent, competent, and experienced. Naturally, Sino-Russian relations are the major topic of our interview. Rybkin pointed out that Russia and China are two great neighboring countries. The two countries should get along harmoniously and amicably, develop extensive cooperation, and deepen mutual understanding. Development in this regard suits the interests of the two countries' peoples. He maintained that currently, Russian-Chinese relations are normal. However, to further develop Russian-Chinese relations and to achieve better results in bilateral cooperation, both sides still have a lot of work to do, and they should make joint efforts to resolve some existing issues. Rybkin resolutely pointed out, "The successive visits to China by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and myself fully demonstrate that Russia truly wishes to deepen the friendship between the peoples of Russia and China and to develop mutually beneficial Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields." Commenting on the purposes of his first visit to China, Rybkin indicated that he is very eager to establish and develop friendly relations between Russia's new parliament and China's National People's Congress, and to enhance exchanges and cooperation between various parliamentary committees of the two countries. "I want to see for myself how China's legislative and executive organs cooperate with one another." The Russian State Duma speaker has been very interested in the experiences and accomplishments of China's economic reform, especially rural reform. He said, "I have studied China's reform carefully and have found that its experiences are very significant to Russia because there are many similarities between Russia's and China's economic structures." "Why has China's reform been able to accomplish remarkable results? Why has China been able to maintain political stability while carrying out reform? Why has China been able to attract so many investors?..." Rybkin hopes to learn the answers to these questions during his short visit of a few days. When commenting on Russia's domestic situation, Rybkin stared at the large map of Russia on the wall and said pensively, "Russia has a vast territory and abundant resources. Russia will be able to extricate itself from crises as long as every Russian makes efforts to increase harmony in an all-round manner, to realize true stability, and to pursue pragmatic and feasible economic reform policies." Brought up in rural areas by Volgograd, Rybkin still cherishes rural life. He insists on planting some potatoes every year when he has free time. He likes to play chess and is good at repairing cars. He has a happy family. His wife is a schoolteacher, his first daughter attends college, and his second daughter is a high school student. The whole family's valuable treasure is their home library, which has lots of books. The common temperament, interests, and hobbies that he shares with this wife have brought warmth and harmony to the whole family. Rybkin regrets that after he became the Russian State Duma speaker, he was forced to give up his hobbies. At the end of the interview, Rybkin expressed once again his hope that his trip to China will further enhance the understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
