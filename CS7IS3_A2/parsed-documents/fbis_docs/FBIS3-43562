FBIS3-43562 "drafr006_c_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Right Wing Preparing Defenses at Radio Pretoria MB0801130594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1206 GMT 08 Jan 94 MB0801130594 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pretoria Jan 8 SAPA -- White mineworkers set up military-type fortifications around Radio Pretoria on Saturday to repel possible moves by government forces to close down the transmitter. Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] spokesman Stephen Maninger said about 300 members of the rightwing mineworkers union assisted in digging trenches and vehicle traps and piling up bullet-proof sandbags around the station at Donkerhoek, east of Pretoria. Cmdt Piet le Roux, of the Pretoria Boer Commando Group, who is in charge of security at the site, said on Saturday if all peaceful measures had been exhausted, "when it comes to the push, we will fight". Cmdt Willem Ratte, sought by the police for his part in the Schanskop Fort Siege, on Saturday reportedly assisted in training Boer Commando members to repel any attack by police or defence force members on the station. The training session took place near the Radio Pretoria caravan site, but reporters were barred from the area. The chairman of the broadcaster's management committee, Dominee Mossie van den Berg, also arrived to express his appreciation to the miners. He said he would meet Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte on Monday to discuss the further extension of the station's temporary broadcasting licence, although the authority to issue such licences will soon be vested in the independent broadcasting authority. Meanwhile, station personnel said repeater stations extending the station's FM signal to other parts of the Transvaal were being planned. At Brits, the first repeater transmitter was due to come on line on Saturday. Local communities would assume responsibility for the repeater towers and transmitters, carrying Radio Pretoria's service to more listeners around the province. Cmdt Le Roux said any efforts to shut down the station would initially be opposed on legal grounds. Thereafter, tens of thousands of unarmed civilians would be called on to form a human wall around the station and protect it by means of passive resistance. "Because of the freedom of speech principle, we hope there will be an international outcry if they try to snuff us out. But passive resistance has its limitations, and if the government tries to take advantage of this, we will fight." An unidentified symphasizer bought four armoured watchtower units from Escom, and donated them to the station. They will be erected on the corners of the station's razor-wire-protected premises. Cmdt Le Roux conceded the station could not repel any conventional military onslaught in the long run. There would be a battle between thousands of soldiers and "bloodshed on a big scale", he said. But if the rightwing lost this battle, a new phase of guerrilla warfare and sabotage may dawn on the country, observers say. Cmdt Le Roux estimated the assets at the station at about R[rand]2-million. On Saturday morning, broadcaster Jahannes van der Walt, a former SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] newsreader, was on duty in the mobile studio, parked on a hot, dusty koppie at Donkerhoek. An endless stream of visitors arrived at the studio, some bringing refreshments and old Afrikaans records to add to the station's collection. Some camped at the caravan site for R10 a day, but they asked a guard not allow television crews into the area for the sake of their peace and privacy.
