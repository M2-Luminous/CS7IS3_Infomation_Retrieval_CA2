FR941005-2-00097 FR941005-2-00065 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;361] Certain Portable On-Car Disc Brake Lathes and Components Thereof; Notice of Commission Determinations to Review and Remand to the Presiding Administrative Law Judge Certain Portions of an Initial Determination Terminating the Investigation on the Basis of a Finding of No Violation of Section 337, and to Designate the Investigation More Complicated AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review certain portions of the initial determination (ID) issued on August 12, 1994, in the above-captioned investigation, and to remand the investigation to the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) for further proceedings. The Commission has further determined to designate this investigation ``more complicated'' and to direct that the ALJ's ID on remand be issued by November 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shara L. Aranoff, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3090. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 24, 1993, the Commission instituted an investigation of a complaint filed by Pro-Cut International, Inc. (``Pro-Cut'') under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The complaint alleged that two respondents imported, sold for importation, or sold in the United States after importation certain portable on-car disc brake lathes and components thereof that infringed the sole claim of U.S. Letters Patent 4,226,146 (``the '146 patent''). The Commission's notice of investigation named as respondents Hunter Engineering Company (``Hunter'') and Ludwig Hunger Maschinenfabrik GmbH (``Hunger''), each of which was alleged to have committed one or more unfair acts in the importation or sale of portable on-car disc brake lathes that infringe the asserted patent claim. The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on May 2&hyph;4, 1994, and issued his final ID on August 12, 1994. He found that: (1) Respondents' imported product does not infringe the asserted patent claim; (2) complainant satisfied the economic requirements for existence of a domestic industry; but that (3) there is no domestic industry because complainant is not practicing the '146 patent. Based upon his findings no infringement and no domestic industry, the ALJ concluded that there was no violation of section 337. Respondents have not challenged the validity of the '146 patent in this investigation. Complainant Pro-Cut filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on both infringement and the domestic industry's failure to practice the patent. Respondents filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on the economic requirements for a domestic industry. Complainant, respondents, and the Commission investigative attorneys filed responses to the petitions for review. No agency comments were received. On September 28, 1994, the Commission determined, by a vote of four to two, to review the subject ID and to remand it to the ALJ for further explanation on two narrow issues. Specifically, the Commission was unable to discern from the ID the ALJ's reasoning underlying his findings of no infringement and no domestic industry under the doctrine of equivalents. Accordingly, the ALJ was instructed to address the following questions on remand: 1. Whether the accused device performs substantially the same function as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? 2. Whether the accused device operates in substantially the same way as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? 3. Whether the accused device achieves substantially the same result as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? 4. To what scope of equivalents is the '146 patent entitled? 5. Whether, in light of questions 1&hyph;4 raised above, the domestic industry is practicing the '146 patent under the doctrine of equivalents? The ALJ was further instructed to make specific factual findings with respect to each remanded question, to indicate what record evidence supports those findings, and to provide an analysis of his ultimate determination on each issue. The Commission determined to adopt the ID in all other respects. On September 28, 1994, the Commission also determined to declare this investigation ``more complicated'' in order to provide the parties, the presiding ALJ, and the Commission with adequate time to address the remanded issues and complete the investigation. The 18-month statutory deadline for completion of this investigation was therefore extended to June 1, 1995. However, the Commission expects to complete the investigation prior to the statutory deadline. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), and §§210.53, 210.56, and 210.59 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53, 210.56, and 210.59). Copies of the Commission's order, the non-confidential version of the ID, and all other non-confidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. By order of the Commission. Issued: September 29, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24639 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
