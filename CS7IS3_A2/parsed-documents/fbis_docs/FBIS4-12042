In a telephone interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Rabi' said the Jordanian military committee is now awaiting further missions. This, however, is a political, rather than a military, decision. Dr. al-Rabi' denied reports that the members of the Jordanian side in the joint Jordanian-Omani military committee supervising the implementation of the accord document in Yemen have returned to their country following the completion of their mission. The members of the Jordanian military committee are still in Yemen. Only certain officers returned to Amman, having spent the 'Id al-Fitr holiday in Yemen, while the officers who spent their holiday in Jordan returned to Yemen. The members of the Omani Army returned to their country and no final decision has been made on their return or reassignment to other missions in Yemen. He said contacts are continuing between the three parties -- Yemen, Jordan, and Oman -- on the future missions of the military committee. [passage omitted]
