The present National Frelimo Cadres Meeting is taking place during a crucial moment in the life of our people, particularly in the life of our party. We say crucial because of the immense and urgent tasks that we face today. With peace, we have gained renewed hope to reconstruct Mozambique, to normalize the life of each citizen, and to follow the steady path of development, democracy, and progress for all our people, firm and united as always. We say crucial because the wishes and aspirations of our people, affirmed in our political ideals, will only be realized if there is a strong and competent government after the October elections, if the elected Assembly of the Republic is truly representative of our people's political and cultural diversity, and if the president -- to be elected by the people -- represents and intends to realize these political ideals. It is crucial, therefore, that our party emerge convincingly victorious in the coming general multiparty elections. It is clear to us that Frelimo's victory in the coming elections is a national necessity, a patriotic cause which goes far beyond political party limits and interests. What we are going to do here, esteemed comrades, is to prepare and organize our victory. We are going to prepare and organize a better future for our people. Our mission and pledge before all of our countrymen: to provide a better future for each and every Mozambican, with more hospitals, more schools, more workplaces, more houses, and better working conditions in factories and farms. This path that we have to thread is already reflected in the immense work we have carried out since we gained peace for our people with wisdom and patience: hundreds of kilometers of roads have been opened or repaired; dozens of bridges have been rebuilt; hundreds of hospitals and schools have been rebuilt and new schools and health posts built; factories and other production centers have resumed production; more than 800,000 Mozambicans who lived as refugees in neighboring countries have returned to the fatherland and about three million people who lived as displaced people inside the country have normalized their lives. All these things reinforce our conviction that we are on the right path and that the hope that our people have today is strengthening their desire to participate in the reconstruction of Mozambique. We have to know how to use all this potential knowledge, experience, and love for the fatherland of which our people are the rightful custodians. Dear comrades: The National Frelimo Cadres Meeting will specifically center its discussions on the electoral manifesto, the government program after elections, and the party tasks in preparation for the coming elections. These are the principal components of our electoral strategy. Our proposals and recommendations will be channeled to the Special Session of the Frelimo Central Committee scheduled to take place after this meeting. The session will also center its discussions on the above issues. Today there is a lot of talk about democratization, as if this was the most important issue for our people. It is true though that the consolidation of democracy constitutes a necessity in our present moment, our party's goal. Democracy has no meaning, however, if people have no food; if everyone does not have access to health care and education; if everyone cannot enjoy freedom of movement throughout the national territory. We always have to bear in mind what our people's priorities are. To better realize these priorities, we have to increasingly create better conditions for the participation of citizens and all social forces in decision-making at all levels of our country's life. The example of democracy begins in our midst, with our militants, in our party organs. This meeting expresses the consolidation of the democratic exercise in our party. We have to constantly improve our working methods to reveal our individual and local initiatives, with a view to heightening the intervention of our party organs and militants in society. The cohesion and unity among party members, sympathizers, and all citizens who support Frelimo's cause must be reinforced, particularly if we take into consideration the wave of violent and defamatory criticism leveled against us by some political forces. We must always be present in society so that these defamations do not make the Mozambican people forget what the principal reason was for the present situation of misery experienced by most of our People. The principal reason for this misery was the war of destabilization mounted from abroad, where Mozambicans were used to destroy their own country, villages, schools, and hospitals which were useful to their countrymen and their families; factories, farms, shops, roads, and bridges, which produced, traded, and helped to distribute products which we all need. Mozambicans used to serve the interests of revengeful settlers, Rhodesian racists, and "apartheid" bosses, ended up becoming victims of this criminal process. Now that they are part of the national political chess game, they need houses, schools, hospitals, shops, and factories which they themselves destroyed. Today they want voters and these voters are among those who lost their loved ones, among those who suffered the most inhuman physical mutilations carried out on orders of anti- Mozambican forces abroad. The atmosphere of national reconciliation, peace, and the need to reunify the Mozambican family cannot make us indifferent to attempts to manipulate the awareness of our people and falsify history. The darkest pages have been registered in the life of our people in our country's history, but the most beautiful pages have also been registered. These beautiful pages of freedom, independence, fraternity, and national unity, peace and reconciliation of which we are so proud to champion, constitute our constant source of inspiration, the constant foundation of our convictions to face the great challenges of today and tomorrow. Dear comrades: On 25 June this year, Frelimo will celebrate 32 years of existence and Mozambique 19 as an independent country. During all these years, we accumulated abundant political and technical experience. Our party has always had the capacity to adjust course following the country's reality in each historical moment, as well as the courage to identify inadequate policies and mistakes in order to find solutions. These are some of the reasons which make our party an esteemed organization. We are proud to note that most of the participants of this meeting are cadres who were trained academically and/or professionally after national independence, as is the case with dozens of thousands of others found in every corner of this beautiful Mozambique. It was these cadres, alongside all other militants and the people, who enabled Frelimo to draw up objectives and realize a vast plan of actions for the benefit of the people, despite the adverse conditions created by acts of aggression carried out by the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa. Between 1975 and 1977, the Frelimo government overcame the crisis in the operation of public administration, following a massive exodus of qualified technicians. Until 1982 access to education increased. The number of primary school pupils doubled, while the number of secondary school students quadrupled. More than 5,000 higher institute technicians have been formed since national independence. We reduced the rate of illiteracy by 20 percent. We established another 358 health posts and centers; while laboratory network quadrupled. More than 400,000 people began to have clean water, particularly from wells; important projects were carried out through the dams of Pequenos Libombos, Corumana, Cuamba, and Lichinga; we realized our development strategy in telecommunications and rehabilitated railroads on the Nacala, Beira, Limpopo Corridors, as well as textile factories in the north of the country. I have just cited a few examples of what was accomplished. A lot of what we built was destroyed by the enemies of Mozambique. Since our mission is to serve the people, however, even during the war, our party cadres have always carried out the best of their work for the country. Today, with renewed hope and conviction, once again our cadres demonstrate their political maturity, their technical and professional abilities, and their immense love for the people. On behalf of the Frelimo Central Committee, I would like to salute with great affection all our cadres, men and women, who throughout the country gave and continue to give great lessons of patriotism, self-denial, and commitment to our project to make Mozambicans a truly happy and prosperous people. Cadres are pillars of the party. That is why we must continue to do the best we can so that together we can consolidate peace, justice, and democracy, promote our country's development and progress, so that each of us can develop and realize his or her talents as a citizen. Dear comrades: We have favorable conditions for obtaining victory in the coming general elections. We have a people who continue to respect and admire Frelimo, because our party has always been known to embody their most noble ideals and aspirations. Proof of this are the visits that I recently made to the Provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Tete, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado. The affection accorded to the president of the Republic and other government officials demonstrate the deep esteem for Frelimo. We need to respect and guarantee the development of this attitude. We have a party which has more than 900,000 members. We have the best cadres in the country. We have youth and women on our side. What we need is just to work hard, with great tenacity, since no victory is obtained without efforts and sacrifice. I repeat: Victory has to be prepared, victory has to be organized. Let us therefore devote ourselves, with all our knowledge and energy to work after we have prepared and organized ourselves here for victory. Comrades: As from 1 June, the voter registration process will begin throughout the country. This is an important pointer for us to view with optimism the peace process in Mozambique. This is an important step forward so that in October this year Mozambicans aged 18 and over can exercise their right and civic duty to vote in the first multiparty elections the president of the Republic and deputies of the Assembly, those whom they feel are the best representatives of their aspirations, those whom they feel have the ability and experience to remove our country from the present state of poverty and decisively move toward economic and social development. What we want today is what we have always wanted, but the mentors of war against Mozambique never allowed us to realize this. We want happiness, prosperity, and progress, in brief, wellbeing for all our people. It is true that we have been experiencing some delays in the implementation of the General Peace Accord. These delays do not, however, jeopardize the implementation of all phases of the process as provided for in the accord. The Mozambican Government will continue to carry out all efforts to guarantee that the multiparty elections take place on 27 and 28 October this year. There are other positive aspects that need mentioning. Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] officials, particularly its leader Afonso Dhlakama, have repeatedly reiterated before the national and international communities their commitment to never again resume war, even in case of defeat in the coming elections. Renamo has been presenting lists of areas under its control to be integrated into state administration. This process, however, must on one hand be carried out speedily, so that these areas can be opened to all political parties and allow businessmen to carry out their activities there. On the other hand, the process must be carried out with all seriousness, common sense, and good faith, to avoid pretexts that could lead to new delays in the implementation of the General Peace Accord. We are still concerned about the lack of freedom of movement of citizens in areas under Renamo control; the movement of armed elements belonging to this organization; and the policy of violence and torture against citizens who do not obey their orders or who simply do not show sympathy toward Renamo. The beating of local officials in Xai-Xai, on the Renamo leader's orders, are a serious human rights violation and a gross violation of the law and the General Peace Accord itself. This issue does not stop being a political issue, even if this is a criminal offense which must be examined and resolved in accordance with the law in force. In other words, there are still Renamo elements who have not abandoned the tendency to commit crime, which has always characterized them during various years of the war. This is neither the first nor the most serious violation of human rights and breach of the law by Renamo. Frelimo and the government have been exposing such actions carried out by Renamo men. The national and international communities, as well as the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], must not minimize these incidents. We would like to call on the Renamo leadership to behave in a civilized manner in the political game and order its men to strictly adhere to the General Peace Accord, as well as to respect the law and the legally installed authorities. Dear comrades: The present political atmosphere being experienced in southern Africa encourages us to view our future with promise. In South Africa, the African National Congress' victory, and the election of our friend and comrade, Nelson Mandela, as the first South African President chosen by the people marks the end of "apartheid" and the birth of a new South Africa where citizens of all races and ethnical groups are equal before the law; where repression and oppression ceased to be the policy of the state; a new South Africa which replaces the policy of destabilization of neighboring countries, including Mozambique; a South Africa which stands for cooperation and good neighborliness. In South Africa, the people have chosen the party that has always defended them from massacres and acts of aggression, the people chose the party that better embodied their interests and aspirations. The end of "apartheid" in South Africa and the establishment of a democratic government represents a great victory for all of mankind, particularly for the peoples of southern Africa. The peoples of our region were targets of the policy of destabilization of the "apartheid" regime. Mozambicans today still bear the scars of the policy of aggression of the racist regime. Now that South Africa has reemerged with a new political stance in the region, this reinforces our hope for a better future for the region and Mozambique in particular. We all anxiously await South Africa's admittance as the 11th member of the Southern African Development Community. In Malawi, a new President, Bakili Muluzi, was democratically elected, ending a regime that had ceased to have the support of the people long ago. Armed men who took part in massacring Mozambican populations and destroying economic and social infrastructures transited through or from Malawi. We give major importance to the visit that President Bakili Muluzi has just made to Mozambique. This is the first time that a head of state or the Government of Malawi made an official visit to our independent country. Mozambique is also the first country that the Malawian head of state visited. These facts reflect the new political situation in that country. All conditions have now been created so that relations of friendship and cooperation between Mozambique and Malawi can reach the high levels that we have always desired. Beginning now, our relations with Malawi are based on mutual respect, on noninterference in the internal affairs of each country and on a mutually advantageous cooperation. We continue to view with optimism the conclusion of the present peace talks between the Angolan Government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Although there is still concern about eventual impasses which could be artificially introduced in the process by the mentors of war in Angola, the news that the parties are moving toward a negotiated solution of the conflict is a positive step forward. We would like to encourage the government led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola to continue with efforts aimed at establishing peace in Angola, and we would like to urge UNITA to finally respond with seriousness to the appeals of the Angolan people and the entire world to silence arms in that fraternal country. We would like to reiterate our solidarity with the Angolan people, and it is our hope that they will finally have peace and tranquility and thus contribute to their national development. Dear comrades: As we begin the National Frelimo Cadres Meeting, we would like once again to stress that we came here to hear your views, welcome your views and opinions, in order to build the solid foundations of our victory in elections. Let us improve our image with better political and professional engagement, as well as by assuming a public and moral posture which corresponds with our principles and our people's desire. We expect the best participation from all of you. Let us move toward victory, toward a better future. For peace, unity, justice, and progress, the struggle continues!
