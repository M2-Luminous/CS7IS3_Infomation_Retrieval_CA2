FBIS4-34923 "drlat123_c_94016" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 MEXICO Belgian Expelled for Political Activities Belgian Expelled for Political Activities PA2706034094 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0424 GMT 24 Jun 94 PA2706034094 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the government announced the expulsion of Belgian citizen Frederik Vandersteene for participating in Mexican political activities, thus violating national laws. The Immigration Services Sub-Secretariat of the Interior Secretariat reported that the expulsion took place 16 days ago after authorities demonstrated that Vandersteene participated in political activities in Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico. The sub-secretariat added that the Belgian citizen admitted to active participation in Mexican internal political affairs, thus violating the law, and recognized that "as a foreigner, I am forbidden from participating in the country's political affairs. The Immigration Sub-Secretariat issued a communique explaining that Vandersteene was in possession of a tactical maneuvers manual which included instructions on how to act before authorities to go undetected in case of an armed attack. Vandersteene arrived in the country on 15 March 1993 as a one-year visitor to work for the Suitable Technology for Agricultural Development and Services Civic Association. On 1 June, he asked immigration authorities in San Cristobal de las Casas, southeastern Chiapas State, for a permit to leave the country permanently because he lacked immigration documents and because it suited his plans. The communique states that the permit was granted on 7 June, but then Vandersteene said he wanted to visit Cancun, in eastern Quintana Roo State, despite his request to leave the country permanently. When asked to show the documents granting him permanent residence in the country, Vandersteene, who had a round-trip Cancun-Amsterdam-Cancun ticket, showed a briefcase full of papers detailing his political activities in Mexico. The sub-secretariat said that the tactical maneuvers manual and the papers demonstrating that he was in Chiapas carrying out political activities forbidden to foreigners were among the documents inside his briefcase. The Belgian citizen said the manual was "a souvenir" he wanted to take to Belgium and admitted he participated in internal political affairs. In view of these circumstances, the Immigration Sub-Secretariat turned Vandersteene over to the Quintana Roo Attorney General's Office. The local court ruled there was insufficient evidence to presume he had committed any crime. The communique goes on to explain that immigration authorities then proceeded to expel the Belgian citizen on 7 June.
