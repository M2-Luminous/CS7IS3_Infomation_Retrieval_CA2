Dzerzhinskiy, and is a doctor of technical sciences, professor and academician at the International Engineering Academy in the field of information sciences. Sergey Konstantinovich Lopukhov completed the VAGSh of the VAF [Military Academy imeni Frunze], and is a specialist in the field of information sciences and management, a candidate of military sciences and chief of an institute. The dissemination of information technology in the armed forces is the process of the creation, broad-scale incorporation and application in various fields of activity of the armed forces, under any conditions, of methods, system and means of obtaining, gathering, processing, storing and using information. A certain base of information technology has taken shape in the armed forces, including automated systems of command-and-control of troops (ASUV) and the computer centers of staffs, as well as the computer capacity of the NIIs [scientific-research institutes], VVUZs [higher military educational institutions] and institutions of the armed forces. The facilities, elements and command posts of the troops whose officers have an affect to a certain extent on the combat capabilities of the armed forces have been equipped with automated systems first and foremost. The level of information technology is considerably lower in the lower echelons of command and control, supporting structures and in the social realm. The dissemination of information technology in the armed forces as a whole is higher than average for the national economy, since means of artificial intelligence have been adopted more actively in the armed forces. An analysis of the state of information technology in the armed forces shows, at the same time, that its level does not conform in full to contemporary methods and means of waging battle and the requirements arising therefrom. The principal shortcomings in information technology in the armed forces of the Russian Federation are: a sharp lag in information technology of lower levels of command and control and, as a consequence, the absence of a real information base; the adoption of various hardware and software that are not compatible; the insufficient level of the capabilities and characteristics of the computer technology being used, and the low degree of saturation of subunits and services with modern computer hardware; the insufficient utilization in the armed forces of contemporary achievements in the field of new information technologies, methods of mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence. The topicality of information technology for the armed forces is explained by the growing role of information and the necessity of reducing the time for the making of well-founded decisions for their command and control under the new military and political conditions, which envisage cutbacks in conventional and strategic offensive weapons. The necessity of information technology for the armed forces is conditioned by the marked increase in the flows of information in the command-and-control elements of the armed forces and the value of the information, the increased significance of the level of awareness of officers and the well-foundedness of the decisions they make. The dissemination of information technology in the armed forces defines new views of the development of arms and military hardware (VVT) and their robotization and intellectualization, as well as improvements in the system of the command-and-control of troops (forces) and weapons, and envisages the creation and application of new information technologies and means of information technology, the formation of an information infrastructure for the armed forces, and the creation of specialized information facilities for the efficient utilization of information in all spheres of their activity. More than 50 percent of the time of the command-and-control cycle in the armed forces of the United States, according to the estimates of foreign specialists, is spent on the gathering, summary and analysis of various information, while the making of decisions is accomplished based on the use of only a small percentage of the available information. The principal directions and aims of the dissemination of information technology in the armed forces are: --in the field of military construction, the fuller utilization of information resources for the scientific substantiation of armed forces structures, their necessary size, sophistication, development prospects and support, through the broad-scale incorporation of modern means of information technology for the accelerated use of the achievements of science and technology in the interests of the armed forces, predicting the military-political situation and performing measures for the preparation of the armed forces and the country as a whole to repel aggression, based on the development of multifunctional information-management systems; --in the field of armed combat, increasing the effectiveness of the development of plans for the employment of the armed forces, reducing the times and raising the quality of decision-making in preparing for operations, and providing a flexible response to changes in the military-political situation; --in the field of command-and-control of the armed forces, increasing the operativeness, reliability and concealment of the command-and-control of troops (forces) through the adoption of improved means of automation; --in the field of supporting the troops, raising the qualities, completeness and operativeness of all types of support for the troops, under any conditions, through the widespread and comprehensive incorporation of means of information technology and new information technologies, and the creation of favorable conditions with the aim of supporting the everyday activity of units and subunits in peacetime for the organized and timely conduct of operations under conditions of the combat environment; --in military-scientific activity, raising the effectiveness of the fulfillment of scientific-research work on the basis of equipping the subunits (units) for military scientific information with the latest means of information technology, uniting them into information networks, priority research of problems in the preparation and waging of modern operations and combat activity connected with the increasing influence of information technologies, intensification of the creation of new means of armed combat and command-and-control of troops (forces) on the basis of qualitatively higher information support, substantiation of efficient forms and methods of combat preparation of the troops, and optimization of the ways of achieving the required characteristics of arms and military hardware; --in the field of military education, military training and indoctrination, a radical rise in the quality of training of military specialists on the basis of efficient information support for the tasks of training personnel, creating an information-technological base for the restructuring of military education through a deepening of scientific research, the intensification and individualization of training, and adaptation to the abilities of the trainees and the activation of their creative potential; --in the field of routine activities, raising the quality of decision-making in the process of everyday activity of the subunits, units and institutions of the armed forces, the performance of garrison and guard duty, the escort of military freight, the observance of regulation order and the reinforcement of military discipline; --in the military-legal and social realm, the information technology of the armed forces pursue the aim of a substantial rise in the quality of information-legal support for the everyday activity of the troops, improvements in lawmaking activity, and assurance of a greater level of awareness on questions of social protections for servicemen and their families. The dissemination of information technology, along with the development and improvement of traditional information technologies, presupposes the adoption into the active practice of the armed forces new information technologies that support the automated resolution of poorly formalized tasks in various fields of activity of the armed forces, including by a user who does not have special training in the field of computers. The new information technologies are the foundation for resolving applied tasks in the command-and-control of troops, the creation of robotized weapons systems, and the support of the everyday activity of the troops, services, and the training of personnel. The work on the dissemination of information technology in the armed forces of the Russian Federation is being held back for a number of objective reasons--the uncertainty of the paths and stages of the reformation and development of the armed forces and the incomplete nature of the development of the State Program of Information Sciences for Russia, on the one hand, and the fact that the principles and sources of financing of the Program of Information Sciences for the armed forces has not been resolved, on the other. Analysis shows that the substantial development of means of computer technology and information technology (SVTI), a reduction of several times over in mass, dimensions and power consumption and an increase in reliability by one or two orders of magnitude will be required under the new conditions. Domestic technologies for the development of SVTI still do not ensure the rapid attainment of the indicated characteristics. One reason for this situation is the technical policy that was pursued in our country in the recent past--a preference for copying foreign models. The creation of new computers in the Unified Series (YeS computers), the System of Small Computers (SM computers) and personal computers (PEVM) has proceeded and is proceeding along that path. Primarily foreign-made computer hardware is being used as a result to equip the staffs, command-and-control elements (posts) and institutions of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the development and adoption of new automated information systems, which is forcing significant expenditures from the state budget. And until market-competitive computer hardware is produced in the Russian Federation, those expenses will increase owing to the necessity of replacing functionally and physically obsolete series-produced models of the YeS and SM computers. The directions for the dissemination of information technology in the armed forces also encompass priority problems, within the framework of which the following tasks should be resolved in the near future: the gradual creation of a telecommunications environment for the armed forces and its link-up with nationwide communications and data-transmission systems, and the further development of communications equipment; the development and incorporation of base problem-oriented systems, software and hardware for the structuring of local and global information and computer networks; the fastest possible equipping of armed forces staffs and organizations with base means of information technology and personal computers, advanced communications and telecommunications gear and improved organizational techniques as the foundation for the adoption of "paperless" information technologies; the improvement of methods and tools for the development of software and the use of CASE technologies, without which progress in the creation and adoption of subsequent generations of automated systems and ASUVs is impossible; assurance of the technical, information, linguistic and program compatibility of the means of information technology; improvement of the system of training, retraining and skills enhancement of military specialists in the realm of information technology; the creation of standardized, advanced means of information technology with a regard for the requirements of ensuring the security of the information. The strategy of information technology for the armed forces and plans for the performance of the priority operations should be defined in the Conceptual Framework for the Dissemination of Information Technology in the armed forces and the Program of Information Technology for the armed forces. Its realization will occur under conditions of grave economic crisis in the national economy as a whole, with all of the consequences arising therefrom. The information technology policy for the armed forces should inevitably be considered within the context of the socio-economic policy of the state, reflecting the specific features of the transition of the country to new methods and mechanisms for the management of the national economy under conditions of the emergence of a market economy. The aspect of the management of this process from within should exist alongside the state aspect of managing information technology in the armed forces. Those areas of financing, in other words, that will have the maximum impact under the concrete conditions of the realization of the Program should be defined within the framework of the amounts of financing allocated by the state and the restrictions defined by law. The specific nature of the armed forces does not permit the Program to be fundamentally open for the participation of the plans of various organizations on a competitive basis. Considering that competitive selection is the most effective means of formulating programs, and allowing that the involvement of the civilian sector will make it possible to reduce expenses to a substantial extent, however, the analysis and ranking of all draft Programs by the degree of their openness is being proposed, orienting most of them toward realization in both the military and the civilian spheres, thereby ensuring the partial or full recouping of the initial expenditures. The possibility appears therein of preserving the strong scientific collectives of military organizations through the credit financing of additional projects in armed forces information technology. The enterprises and organizations that are the consumers of SVTI are not only not upgrading their computer capacity, but are trying to get rid of existing capacity so as to reduce overhead; that is, a policy of gains for the moment is being pursued. The paramount development of the priority areas stipulated in the Program of Information Technology for the armed forces of the Russian Federation is required in particular in this regard, providing a sharp rise in the quality of the computer hardware being produced, out of the whole range of which only a few directions merit consideration at the given moment (some materials-intensive parts--the housings, boards, power sources etc.) that could easily be reproduced under foreign technologies. The backwardness of our microelectronics technology is well known. The situation is aggravated by the breakup of economic ties among the former union republics. About 50 percent of the enterprises in this field have remained on the territory of Russia, and just 25 percent of the capacity of the former USSR went to the republics. This need not necessarily lead to a stoppage of production, but the output of modern and complex computer hardware can be set up only after a certain time interval and, most likely, only with the aid of foreign partners. The unification of the fragmented information-management systems of the branches of the armed forces into a unified system for the Ministry of Defense, provision for its interaction with the information systems of the bodies of state administration and, in particular, with the information systems of the apparatus of the President and the Security Council, is an urgent task for the armed forces of the Russian Federation under prevailing military-political conditions. The material, scientific and technical basis for this work should be improved computer hardware and software support. The following basic principles should be taken into account when structuring the conceptual model for the unified information-management system (YeIUS): minimization of the material and financial expenditures for the creation of the YeIUS; the maximum utilization of available systems of command-and-control, computers, communications and data-transmission systems and scientific and technical developments; centralization of access to information contained in the information and computer centers of the branches of the armed forces and other command-and-control points; coordination of information flows in the YeIUS being created and the systems integrated with it according to uniform requirements; the creation of support points for the gathering, study, depiction and analysis of data; assurance of the basic principle of the command-and-control of troops--the centralization of command-and-control at all levels. The information system being created within the apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the armed forces could be used as the foundation for creating this YeIUS. The principal requirement toward the YeIUS is providing information to all elements of command-and-control and administrative leadership of the Ministry of Defense. The accomplishment of the tasks enumerated above is impossible without the creation of scientific, technical, organizational and financial foundations of the command-and-control system and the coordination of operations in the realm of armed forces information technology. The following measures would be expedient to pursue in these areas, in our opinion: 1. A staff coordinating element--a Committee on Information Technology for the armed forces--should be created under the General Staff, answering directly for the resolution of issues in the dissemination of information technology in the armed forces. Two independent elements could be formed under the Committee for Information Technology of the armed forces: an Expert Council and a Council of Chief Designers. The Expert Council should be composed, as a rule, of leading specialists in the field of information technology from the scientific-research organizations of the Ministry of defense, while the Council of Chief Designers should include representatives of the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, organizations in the defense sectors of industry and the scientific-research organizations of the Russian Academy of Sciences associated with the development of information technologies and systems for military purposes. 2. It is essential to determine the General Customer and the sources, principles and procedure for financing the work under the program of Information Technology for the armed forces. 3. The creation of centers for the certification and funding of software are also best created in order to provide quality expert analysis of plans in the field of information technology for the armed forces, assessments of the quality level of information technologies being developed and systems and individual pieces of equipment in information technology, for the purpose of ensuring the compatibility of the means of information technology being employed in the armed forces, and on that basis the efficient making of financial expenditures for the development and acquisition of the means of information technology, as well as arms and military hardware that uses information technologies. The problem of the dissemination of information technology in the armed forces is thus becoming a priority one today, determining both the look of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the principles for its combat application. The economic expenditures for the realization of the Program of Information Sciences will be recouped over a short time through the marked increase in the efficiency of the performance of defensive tasks by the armed forces of the Russian Federation.
