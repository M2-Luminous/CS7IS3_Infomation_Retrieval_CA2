Pupkov and Major S. Timofeyev under the rubric "Military Reform: Problems of IAS": "Where to Get Technicians?-- (Two Letters on One Topic)"] [Text] Break the Stereotypes Much is being said and written today on the lack of social and professional protections for aviators of all categories, but I think that the officers of the IAS [aviation engineering service] with secondary education are in the most difficult position. Judge for yourself: a lieutenant who is a graduate of a VATU [military aviation technical school] comes to a line unit in the post of aircraft technician, servicing group technician (standard procedures) or a specialist of a technical crew. And that is effectively his service ceiling. The higher positions, after all, are engineering ones. It happens in real life that an officer technician who has not received higher education (very often owing to circumstances beyond his control) is named the chief of a flight or detachment TECh [technical maintenance unit], a servicing group or technical team, or even the chief of a group for standard servicing operations for the TECh of a regiment. But this is, after all, a breach of standard positional discipline. The positions correspond to the ranks of senior lieutenant or captain. I knew quite a few good aviation specialists, conscientious and disciplined officer technicians, who served for 25 years or more at an airfield and were discharged into the reserves at those ranks. Many of them strove to keep learning at one time, but were not able to attain their dream owing to retraining on new aviation hardware, a shortage of people, combat duty etc.--they were not able to become engineers, although I repeat that many of them possessed profound knowledge and unparalleled organizational abilities. Graduates of the higher aviation engineering schools, as a rule, are first assigned to technical positions. After two or three years of service they are transferred to engineering positions as chief of a flight or detachment TECh, a servicing group (standard operations) or a technical team. And they serve an average of three to five years in this, their first supervisory position. They forget a great deal over this time, and the information they received at the higher educational institution becomes partially outdated. When some of them "grow up" to be a commander at the regimental level, they thus have to learn all over again. I consider correct the decision to institute a term of study at the VVIA [Air Forces Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy in which an officer technician receives higher military education rather than higher special education (as before), i.e. primary training for engineers and training for supervisory engineering personnel are combined. This would give the graduate broad prospects in the service. I am deeply convinced that the posts of chief of a flight or detachment TECh, chief of a servicing and standard operations group, assistant chiefs of IAS for an air squadron (in the training air regiments), deputy commander of an air squadron for IAS and positions close to them are not engineering positions in the full sense of the word in the new standard organizational structure of IAS. They could full well be held by officer technicians with the appropriate additional training. Engineering positions are the regimental engineers by fields, the chief of the TECh and the deputy commander of the regiment for IAS--that is, those that require the profound engineering analysis of the good working order and combat readiness of aviation hardware on the scale of a regiment, along with the ability to supervise large collectives. I have become convinced through personal experience that competent officer technicians could successfully perform duties up to deputy commander of an air squadron for IAS (commander of ATO [airfield technical support]) inclusive. A powerful incentive in the service would then appear for them--the prospect of official advancement and promotion. Technical positions for such categories as engineers by fields and chief of regimental TECh could also be instituted in the training air regiments of flight schools equipped with training aircraft of relatively simple design. I propose somewhat of a re-organization of IAS as a whole as follows (I think that these measures could be carried out in stages over several years). First, the positions of aircraft technician, servicing and standard operations group technician and positions equal to them could be made senior warrant officer rather than officer positions. The air training regiments have such experience, where servicemen in these categories are successfully handling the duties of technicians and supporting a considerably greater yearly flying time for aircraft in high-quality fashion than in the line units. The screening of candidates for the positions of technicians could be conducted among warrant officer mechanics, NCOs on extended duty and conscript servicemen, as well as among civilian youth. Their training should be conducted at warrant officer schools, according to a special curriculum and with a regard for the level of professional knowledge of the trainees. The cadets should study profoundly the design and operation of the type of airframe that they will be servicing in the units during these training sessions. The future technicians should acquire skills in organizational work with subordinates. The level of sophistication of the warrant officer schools must be raised and brought closer to the level of the military aviation- technical schools. They should train specialists as warrant officer mechanics for a term of 1.5--2 months, and senior warrant officer technicians for 5--6 months. The military rank of senior warrant officer is conferred on the graduating technician with the successful passage of exams and the receipt of certification of completion of the school. He completes graded evaluations according to specialty for the engineers of the regiment, and begins independent work under the monitoring of officer technicians in the unit. Second, the graduates of the VATU should be assigned to officer positions in the IAS, starting with chief of a flight or detachment TECh, chief of a servicing group or their equivalent. These positions should be defined as technical rather than engineering. Some changes in the program of training cadets at the VATUs need to be made for the high-quality training of such specialists. The profound study of the design and operation of specific types of aircraft, the acquisition of durable skills in decoding the materials of on-board recording gear, the practicing of algorithms for finding and eliminating flaws in aviation hardware, making use of experience in servicing it, and the training of future officers in organizational work with the military collectives of the IAS up to squadron inclusive should all be envisaged in them. Third, a permanently operating system of training specialists for higher positions should be created in the Air Forces. The training of candidates in special courses at technical or engineering higher educational institutions or at the staffs of large units and formations would be expedient for IAS. The program of courses should be composed with a regard for the knowledge, skills and abilities that could be needed by the trainees in the corresponding categories when working with personnel and on aviation hardware. Classes on the design and operation of aviation hardware could be conducted by the instructors of higher educational institutions, and on the organization of IAS operations and increasing combat readiness and flight safety by the engineers of the larger units and formations. Such courses should be one-and-a-half to two months long, but saturated with information. Fourth, each officer--regardless of his education--should have real prospects for service advancement. The main criterion for his assignment to a higher post should be his attitude toward the service and the fulfillment of his official duties. Major V. Pupkov (Krasnodar VOLTU) Trust the Warrant Officers It is no secret that the aviation engineering service of our Air Forces is experiencing difficulties. One of them is a chronic shortage of technicians. An attitude has taken shape toward this profession as a minor one for some reason. Who is to blame for that? First of all, it seems, those who are obligated to train and cultivate the IAS specialists and provide professional and social protections for them. The attempts that have been made at short-term courses to train technicians at the military aviation-technical schools have unfortunately sunk into oblivion. There are no open opponents to the ideas of the authors. But it is a paradox--matters never move further than talk. I will try and confirm this with statistical data. I make no claim to absolute completeness of the data in my possession, but it testifies eloquently to the unenviable position of the IAS. I was able to visit four aviation units where aircraft of various types are being operated. They are stationed under relatively favorable conditions. The people are more or less well provided for. The shortcomings that are able to be revealed would thus be average ones for all of the Air Forces, as it were. What was I able to find out? The units are staffed with officer technicians and engineers in such a way that they are, at a minimum one, out of six specialists short. The question of where the graduates of the Air Forces technical schools are is a natural one. Some 354 young specialists have come here over the last ten years. Sixty nine of them were "lost" virtually irretrievably to the IAS over that time--34 transferred to other service, and 35 were discharged into the reserves. One out of five VATU graduates, in short, lost touch with the IAS over the ten years. It turns out that each school trained two full classes for... the national economy and filling vacancies in support units. There is another fact of no small importance as well. Forty one of those remaining advanced in the service, and 17 went for training at military higher educational institutions in their fields. Isn't that where the "floating" level of education of IAS officers comes from? The problem of technical personnel staffing levels for the IAS cannot be solved by calling up reserve officers for two years of service after their completion of civilian higher educational institutions, since these people are by and large in the army temporarily. According to the data, only 53 of the 237 people who came to the aviation units from civilian life over the last decade remain in the ranks of the Ministry of Defense. The large understaffing of the IAS with technical personnel is thus obvious. Is there a way out of this situation? I think there is. This problem can moreover be resolved at the local level in most cases. The aviation units have able specialists (the discussion here concerns warrant officers) who want to perform the duties of technicians and senior technicians. Just give them the opportunity to study up in special courses, and they are ready technicians, chiefs of servicing groups and the TEChs of detachments and flights... I am confident that a warrant officer who becomes an officer will serve until discharge into the reserves for age reasons or based on total time served. Why not make use of that? The sad statistics would change immediately, it seems, if we were to do that. In favor of the IAS. Major S. Timofeyev (Achinsk VATU) COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
