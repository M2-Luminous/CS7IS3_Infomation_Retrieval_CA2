FBIS4-33589 "drlat110_p_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Ecuador Indians Block Roads To Protest Agrarian Reform Indians Block Roads To Protest Agrarian Reform PA0706183694 Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 Jun 94 PA0706183694 Quito Voz de los Andes Spanish BFN [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] [Text] Members of the Indian Communities set up barricades today on the main northern roads to protest an initiative to reform the law on agrarian regulations. The barricades halted traffic on the northern stretch of the Pan-American Highway blocking one of the main roads at the height of [name indistinct] and Cotopaxi, 100 km from Quito. The bill approved on Friday by Congress proposes modifying the agrarian reforms to increase production in the nation's farming fields. Now, only President Sixto Duran-Ballen's approval is required for the bill to become law. The Indian Communities, however, have threatened to block roads and isolate Quito if the president approves the draft bill. We are not willing to accept this aggression, said an Indian leader. We have not been taken into account. They think they can do as they please behind our backs; we will show them how the people react, he said. A leader of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [Conaie] told REUTER NEWS AGENCY, that the blocking of the roads today is only a first step of a series of measures to be taken, if the president of the Republic ratifies the draft bill. In our noon newscast we had reported the position of several Indian organizations, particularly those of Imbabura, Pichincha, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, and Chimborazo. A government spokesman indicated that Duran-Ballen could make a decision on the issue in a few hours. The bill is very similar to another reform bill presented by the government that was recently rejected by the Congress, after a series of protests by Indians associations that considered it detrimental to their interests. The Social Christian Party drafted the current bill, indicating it is fairer than the previous bill but also seeks to encourage better use of land to increase farming production. Nevertheless, the bill has been questioned by every sector, arguing it is a copy of the previous one with some changes that are merely cosmetic, with no real changes. The draft bill presented by Conaie to the Congress, has not been discussed. According to several Indian groups, the reform draft bill wipes out the Agrarian Reform's gains and authorizes the government to confiscate lands currently in Indian hands and to turn them over to rich land owners. Vicente Chato, Indian leader of Tungurahua, indicated that Conaie and other Indian associations will meet tomorrow to decide on the measure to be taken. They seek to pressure the government to put aside its intention of eliminating the Agrarian Reform. Traditionally, the Indian protests in our nation have been characterized by the closing of highways and occasional confrontations with the police without reaching excessive levels of violence. This weekend in Chimborazo Province it was reported that some Indians groups had met somewhat secretly to decide on measures on the agrarian bill approved last week.
