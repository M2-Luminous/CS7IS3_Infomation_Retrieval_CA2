May God make your evening a good one. I would like first of all to thank you for providing a second chance to meet in Misratah. I am very grateful to you for your invitation, which I received when I was in Sirte the other day. [passage omitted] We are now in a new confrontation. Confrontations are the same, but the means and weapons may vary. Today, as we were in the recent past, we are confronting the same enemy. We have the same people, the same nation, and the same religion confronting the same enemies, which are the West, Christianity, imperialism, colonialism, whether it was in 1912, 1911, 1915, or now. We are in a new confrontation. It is beneficial to browse through our history and pause before the sacrifices made by our forefathers and our families. [passage omitted]. Brothers, it is very important to stop before these lessons, the lessons of our past history and the heroism of our forefathers and their sacrifices, because they represent our provision to face up to the new confrontation. It is very important. Important in the Libyan information approach, important in the Libyan educational curriculum and important even in family discourse and the club chatter and everywhere we are. [passage omitted] Until now [al-Qadhdhafi pauses, interrupted by crowd chanting] ...look at the Americans and the West. Their calculations now are based on that the Libyan people have been spoiled and their demands have increased; luxury goods have become necessities. The Libyans have become accustomed to things they did not know before. They have become used to canned food and fashion and European and Western things. Now when oil exports become less and imported things decrease, the Libyans will comply with our [the West] orders and accept the new world order, what they term as international legitimacy, which is the legitimacy of force: the West is strong and the others should comply. This is impossible. [passage omitted] Before the battle, the enemy carries out preliminary actions to weaken his adversary. When there are two armies fighting against each other and two countries fighting against each other, before the firing of machine-guns and the use of aircraft (?which may be easy for the braves) begin the battle, there is another action which is the dangerous action -- an action that paves the way for victory in the military battle. It is a psychological, propagandist, economic and political action. This is a dangerous action, because you have to gain spies from the enemy; you have to recruit them. You have to infiltrate the enemy's front. You have to weaken the morale of the enemy. You have to run bad propaganda which the enemy may believe; your agents have to spread that. This is very dangerous. You have to be aware that you are facing this weapon. Now we are not facing aircraft or missiles, etc. This may be easy; it could possibly be easy. No matter how many missiles may be launched, an aircraft carrier cannot enter our desert; it will stop when the water ends. Missiles constitute a terrorist action which has never forced a people to leave their land; it never put an end to a nation. The important thing is that we should understand this. I know that your morale is high, and that you are ready; this is great. But the important thing is that we should understand at this meeting some of the important things. You are not facing aircraft carriers, or missiles, or guns. What I want to say is that a battle could be better. A military battle must come to an end; it does not last long. They cannot land on our territory. No matter how long the battle may go on, we have the fate of our land in our hands. In the end we will evict them. But the battle which is being fought now and the weapon which you are now facing -- the weapon which the enemy has begun to use -- is neither the machine gun nor the rifle. It is silent weapon. It is a weapon which targets morale. I will tell you what these weapons are. [2-minute break in audio reception]. Heresy is another weapon, like recruitment and treason. Now we hear about the Takfir and Hijrah group, the Da'wah, the Jihad, and al-Fatah -- and so on and on. Everything invented in religion is heresy, and every heresy is a deceit, and those who adopt deceit will rest in hell. [passage omitted] This is a dangerous weapon; this is a dangerous stratagem to destroy the Arabs and Islam -- these Islamic parties. The plan was hatched in India, Afghanistan, and Iran. They taught people and recruited them and established schools. They called one Da'wah, another was called The Jihad, another they called The Takfir and the Hijrah, another they called The Tahrir, The Brothers, etc. They told them to enter the Arab countries and cause the Muslims to blaspheme and fight each other. [passage omitted] Heresy is a weapon useful to America, the Israelis and Europe. They are all hoping that the Arab nation will be fragmented and that the Arabs will fight each other using heresy -- Muslim brothers, the Atonement and Flight, the Islamic Call and the Muslim Vanguards -- exactly as you have been witnessing in Egypt and Algeria. Some three thousand have died in Algeria. Every day somebody dies exactly like it used to be during the war of liberation, when the Algerians were fighting the French. Even the policeman who used to protect you in the street can no longer do so. Someone might just come up to him screaming: There is no God but Allah; God is great, before knifing him. How can anyone say such and do such a thing to a soldier who is a Muslim. But if you ask, however, why did he have to do it, he will say this is what he was taught. And if you ask him who taught you this? He will say: I was taught by a Muslim who came from Sudan or from Jordan. But when they arrest the teacher, who is from Sudan or from Jordan, and ask him how did you learn this? He will say I was taught by an Afghan, an Iranian, or an Indian Muslim. Therefore, this must be a conspiracy and a foreign invasion. Heresy is something hard to comprehend. You should, O brothers, warn your children against it. And in this you must not show any compassion, because it is a very serious matter indeed if the number of those people gets bigger. They might then arm themselves with knives, swords, and weapons and begin to slaughter anyone who happens to be in their way. One of them has killed his uncle, the brother of his father who was taking care of him. They told him: In order to prove that you are with us you must kill your uncle because he is an unbeliever and a police officer. You must kill him to prove to us that you are one of us. They gave him a hunting rifle; he waited in darkness for his uncle and shot him dead. Is this Islam? No, this would be madness if everyone has to kill his father, brother, and neighbor. But such a thing is taking place in Egypt and Algeria every day. People are killing their brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbors and sons. We must be vigilant to this Zandaqa [Islamic movements -- the current fundamentalism]. This is a dangerous weapon. The Americans said that the Arabs would be fragmented from inside. [passage omitted] They have tried it, and in Algeria people are killing one another, and in Egypt people are killing one another, while the West and the Jews laugh at this Islam, this kind of Islam that has succeeded in dividing people. They have succeeded in mobilizing an Islam and are using it to fragment the Arab nation and destroy the real Islam. You must be aware of this. You must be conscious of this conspiracy. This is yet another weapon. When they recruit somebody to the Zandaqah movement, they have recruited a spy. What is amazing is that they do not come to you and say: We want you to fragment the Arab nation, to be against pan-Arabism, to fragment Islam. They do not say to you: We are recruiting you; Afghanistan is behind the Zandaqah movement, and America and Israel are also behind it. No. They come to you and use Islam, in the mosque and say: There is no God but God and Muhammad is his prophet. They say to you: This is wrong, little by little, until they bring you under their control and make you capable of killing your own uncle. Thus the battle now begins at home as I have already said. You must be vigilant, starting at home. Everyone must watch his children. Their teacher could be a Zindiq [an Islamic fundamentalist] who has come from abroad; a doctor, if he has come from abroad. You know he has treated your child, your neighbor, your kinfolk. Perhaps while treating them he gave them information little by little. Search and examine any books brought home by your child or somebody else, see whether they are very old books on Zandaqah or not. [passage omitted]. When faced with a Zindiq, have no pity or mercy toward him. He must be finished, really. The Zandaqah is an extremely serious sickness, and he who carries this disease must be finished. For he who likes Islam, Islam is clear: Read the Koran, give us a lesson from the Koran, a lesson in religion, in morals; lead us in prayers, call for prayers, teach us and you are welcome. But if you set up a party among us, in secret, and you say: Kill each other, and others are infidels, then never. [passage omitted] From now on, everyone must be vigilant to their families, their children. Islam is clear. If somebody wants to observe religious rules, he is free to do so. But the movements I have mentioned to you, they have knives, guns, pistols, bombs and America is behind them. All the leaders of the Zandaqah movement are to be found in Germany, America, Britain, and France. All the movements you are hearing about in Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Tunisia, and those who were members of the Libyan Islamic Brotherhood movement, you have seen them, they are all in America, Britain, France, and Germany. Western intelligence is funding them. What kind of Islam is an Islam funded by Christianity, the Christians, and the West? Is this Islam? Is this reasonable Islam, funded by the West, funded and encouraged by their intelligence services? Is this Islam? We do not want an Islam whose paymaster is America. We do not want this sort of Islam. Another weapon is drugs. Orders were given by America and the Western states to the Israelis to plant hashish in occupied Palestine, export it secretly to the Arab countries, dump it on the shores of the Arab countries from Egypt to Morocco in return for billions of dollars paid by America and the Western states as a compensation to the Israelis for planting hashish. America is however fighting hashish everywhere in the world, and is prepared to go to war against any state planting hashish, except the Israelis. Why? Because the hashish in occupied Palestine is meant for the Arab youths, for the Arab countries, to lull the Arab nation. You must be vigilant to this. Brothers, this is not a matter for the law or the police. It is a matter for the family, a matter of education. You are all shepherds and every shepherd is responsible for his community. Every one must look after his children and family. [passage omitted] As I have said, if tomorrow something wrong appears in Misratah, it will affect the morale of us all, it will affect the morale of Libya and the Arab nation. They will say here is an important city, a Mujahid city upon which we rely that has come out in angry demonstrations about the sewage, for example, or angry about housing or angry about petrol, or heresy appeared in it. You must be conscious of these things. I have spoken to the people in Tripoli, al-Zawiyah, Misratah, Benghazi and Darnah. There are some cities that should be jealous about the reputation of Libya. Be aware and do not let the enemy gloat over our misfortune. Persevere. If the electricity supply is interrupted for a time or public utilities or transportation are disrupted in a city such as Misratah, you must persevere and do not complain, because this will be very important to Libya's reputation before the West. [passage omitted] People in places and cities other than those I have mentioned can be cross. If something is in shortage, they have the right to be cross. However, we in the cities I have mentioned have obligations to avert the enemy's gloating over our misfortune and because of our past history and our reputation we have to endure. However, first of all nothing wrong will happen, God willing. I am telling you this only to remind you. May nothing wrong happen at all and may everything move forward and progress. However, these are probabilities. When something happens in Misratah, we should not be cross. All the things I have mentioned come and go. Take poverty, rain, money, houses, pavements, streets, homes and animals, they all come and go. These are things that can be good at times and bad at another. We must not let our future rely on them nor distort our history. [passage omitted] Brothers, you should be aware of these issues. This is the confrontation: high morale, mobilization, anger and popular revolution. These should be translated into a material action on Libyan land which proves the will of confrontation and convinces the enemy that these people are determined to live and to live free. This is what will make them retreat. This is what made the enemies retreat. But if we only talk and then put our hand to them and beg them for a dollar, or trade in currencies, or smuggle medicine, smuggle food products, smuggle Libyan products, trade in the Libyan dinar, ask them to give us their canned foods, or ask them to give us their cigarettes or their drugs, they will laugh at us. They will say: These people only talk, but in the end they put out their hands to us and beg. We should reject this. [passage omitted] The last subject is concerned with the family of Ja'akah. First of all, you are aware that there is someone with the name of Ja'akah; however, I do not know his first name. We heard the Americans say that they would give 1 million American dollars, 300 Libyan dinars [as heard], to anyone who would give them information about who brought down the Pan Am plane over Lockerbie. Ja'akah used to work in Malta; he went over to the Americans and told them give me the 1 million dollars, I have information for you. They told him: All right, just give us the information. They kept him as a prisoner at the American intelligence; they did not, of course, give him the $1 million or anything else. He is still under arrest at the American intelligence. They asked him: What information have you got? He told them: That plane was brought down by such and such person who used such and such thing. He concocted a story; the story they are now repeating. They are saying that they have confirmed information, but they have only Ja'akah as a witness. If they have a trial abroad, they will bring him to face [the accused] to whom he will say: Yes, you did bring it down; you put the case aboard and this and that. You did so because you wanted revenge. The Libyans wanted to avenge the raid of 1986; they wanted to take their revenge on Britain and America who killed their children. He will say now they have killed your children with such a bombing. They wanted to hit two birds with one stone; they dealt a blow to America and Britain at the same by bombing one plane which they brought down over Lockerbie, a British town, he will add. He said the Libyans did so to avenge the raid. The Americans and the British have believed his story; they are trying to convince the world with such a story by using Ja'akah. Ja'akah is now with the American intelligence; he will lose his life... [pauses] his liberty forever. He will always remain under their control; they will never release him. We started to ask who was Ja'akah? We were told Ja'akah was someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah, and suddenly everybody started crying this is very bad news for Suk al-Jumu'ah. Why is the latter involved in such a scandal? Why did that someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah put Libya in the mouth of a cannon? Why did that someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah create such problems for Libya? Was he a spy? As soon as Suk al-Jumu'ah heard such a news they were angry. They said: We must destroy whoever tries to embarrass us; this one is a spy and we must set fire to his house and farm; we must destroy the houses of his family. They had a meeting, then I went to see them in Saradiq. I told them, O brothers, before you start destroying and setting fire to things, let us hear their story. Let them come and explain. So they came and said: We are the family of Ja'akah. We asked them does this one belong to you? They said yes, he is our son. His father came and made a speech which you have all heard. He said that anyone could take his [son's] life; anyone could kill him and that he will kill him, if he finds him. He added: We, his family, his father and close family, will kill him if we find him, because he is an agent who has harmed us. However, his uncle read to us a report that Ja'akah was in an institution for mental illnesses. His testimony will, therefore, not be valid in a court of law. Had he been a sane person, he would not have been a spy against his country nor would he have harmed it like this for $1 million. He must be insane. That is how his uncle construed it. I remember that people went after them and tried to take them apart. Had it not been for the guards, they would have been killed. We told the people: Please do not touch them; they have washed their hands of him. However, they told me that this family was not from Suk al-Jumu'ah; it came from Zawiyah al-Mahjub. Once the people at Zawiyah al-Mahjub heard the story they said: If there is any treason in Zawiyah al-Mahjub, we will have to do what Suk al- Jumu'ah would have done. We must find this family in order to destroy it and burn it. And you were told about the feelings of the people over there some time ago by that Haj [someone in the tent]. Now, as soon as they heard the story, they went over to Suk al-Jumu'ah and contacted the family of Ja'akah who told them that there was no relation with between them. They told them that the spy came from, in fact, the Ja'akah family in Suk al-Jumu'ah. The Ja'akah here has nothing to do with that Ja'akah. The only thing they shared was the name. Ja'akah was a first name here and not a family name like in Zawiyah al-Mahjub. That is it, things are now clear. The day before yesterday the population of Gmatah sent an emissary to me and said: We heard that the people of Zawiyat al-Mahjub said that this Ja'akah family is from Gmatah, but the family in Zawiyat al-Mahjub has the surname of al-Jurushi. Al-Ja'akah is a name, but the surname is al-Jurushi. Now the al-Jurshi family has had martyrs and mujahidin. And indeed as the emissary showed us, this family is a family of mujahidin and martyrs, and surely it would not do anything wrong. Now the population of Gmatah is angry and they said: If we find that the family of this spy Ja'akah is in Gmatah we will burn and destroy it. Naturally, this is in one way disturbing, but this is also very useful. The Libyan people have now laid down a rule, neither a written law nor a decision, all the Libyan people have laid down a rule which says: Treason will be hunted down, besieged and destroyed. They have reached the point where they might have to burn families to death, destroy homes. This is a frightening matter which we may be able to prohibit, but in fact no one can prevent it. They said to me: Even if you install guards around a treasonous family, we will consider the guards as traitor themselves and we will burn them. If thousands of people storm a house, who can stop them. Neither Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, nor police nor anyone can do so. If people attack treason, by God I will not be able to touch them, even if they burn down a house or burn a family to death. Now, thanks be to God, treason is indeed besieged. [passage omitted]
