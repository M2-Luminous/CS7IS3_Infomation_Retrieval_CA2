The Mexican Army successfully repelled this attack, and immediately reinforced military operations in the municipality. Meanwhile, the Army has recovered the municipalities of Ocosingo and Las Margaritas, although clashes continue in the surrounding areas. According to military sources, so far there have been 86 deaths in these clashes. Altamirano municipality remains under the control of the armed group that has begun to demolish the municipal palace. Commenting on the situation in Chiapas, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said there is no time or place in Mexico for divergence that cannot be solved according to the law. He admits there are certain shortages and inequalities in that state, but he warns that violence will delay a true solution of the problems. The Government Secretariat assured that the groups active in Chiapas represent a mixture of interests by local and foreign persons who are linked to violent groups operating in Central America. Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz admitted that the Mexican Government learned several months ago about the existence of illegal groups in that area. Following orders from the Executive Branch, new procedures will be established to study the problems in Chiapas. The Social Development Secretariat will review the work being done, and with the social organizations of that state, it will define the projects for the new year. Meanwhile, Chiapas Governor Elmar Setzer has urged the people of Chiapas to be prudent, and he trusts the Army will shortly reestablish peace in Chiapas. Elmar Setzer denied that he is planning to resign. Meanwhile, EZLN leaders reiterated they will not negotiate with the government so long as the government does not turn power over to the people.
