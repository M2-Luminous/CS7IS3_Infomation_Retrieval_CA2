There is no holding back the members of the coalition since the economic research institutes sighted a cautious cyclical recovery on Tuesday [26 April] of last week. Rainer Haungs, economist with the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], derives "new confidence for Germany as a business location." The first figures support him: the long-distressed chemical industry is reporting increased sales and even the ailing automotive industry is moving toward the future with confidence. "The upswing in Germany is falling in step," rejoices Count Otto Lambsdorff (FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany]). The "stagnation that we have suffered through" has by "no means been the most dramatic crisis of all time," says Kurt Faltlhauser, financial expert for the CSU [Christian Social Union]. And the federal chancellor again sees the German enterprises on the way to the top spot in the world. If he is not deceiving himself. As cynical as it may seem, the upswing is coming too early. The happy news coming just in time for the election campaign makes structural reforms to secure the industrial site Germany seem superfluous. One might have to pay dearly for this recklessness: --If the state puts off urgent reform measures such as reduction of enterprise taxes or making the bloated public service more efficient and reorganizing the social state, --if the trade unions drive wages up too soon, --and if the enterprises fail to push the structural adjustments systematically, then the decline of the Germans to second-class status is programmed in advance. Germany could become the Argentina of the 21st century. Warning voices: "The cyclical recovery is not a signal that the course has been set correctly," says Gernot Nerb, chief economist for the Ifo Institute in Munich. Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt is already feeling pressure from the environmental and labor ministries to set aside the reform proposals in his industrial site program. "I will not abandon my course," promises Rexrodt. "It is impossible to give up cost relief for trade and industry just because we half a half percent more growth." Germany's decline can be calculated. The share of German exports in the world market has fallen for eight consecutive years. For more than a decade, productivity in German industry has been growing much more slowly than in the biggest competitors, the United States, Japan, France, and Great Britain. Whereas the English have achieved an increase in productivity of 4.4 percent in manufacturing since 1985, the German industry is lagging far behind with 1.6 percent. The supposedly higher efficiency must nevertheless serve again and again to justify higher wages. "We must consider whether we can continue to afford this advantage in incomes," says Herbert hax, chairman of the council of experts. The trade unions are already demanding an adjustment in view of the delicate "economic spring" (Kohl). Their motto: we have sacrificed wages in favor of the upswing and now we want to harvest the fruit. "The bitter lesson of the 1993 recession for the employment situation will soon be written off," fears Horst Siebert, one of the Five Wise Men. "The trade unions expect employees to have an appropriate part in this success," is the slogan of Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the German Federation of Trade Unions, for the next round of collective bargaining. "The moderate wage agreements in the last round were not advance action for the upswing but only a partial correction of the excesses of the past," counters Alexander von Tippelskirch, board spokesman for the IKB German Industrial Bank. If there is no reversal in wages, predicts Klaus-Werner Schatz, professor at the Institute for World Economics in Kiel, "then the upswing will go nowhere and there will not be a strong recovery." Stagnation will be followed by the next setback. Political risk: Finance and tax policy determines prosperity and jobs more than ever, warn the research institutes in unison. The taxes for enterpreneurs and citizens must come down to stimulate growth and at the same time to force the state into vigorous economy measures. But there is no sign of that. With respect to the subject of tax increases, the parties are arguing "only about how and not about whether," criticizes Ruediger Pohl, president of the Institute for Economic Research in Halle. "The tax burden for the next five years is no longer calculable." On the executive floors of leading enterprises as well, there is growing concern about the incipient optimism in regard to the economy. In an upswing, the usual defensive fronts develop against painful but necessary cuts in the wild growth from 40 years of success. "Once the good mood is established, it will be much more difficult to rationalize," believes Helmut Werner, chief of Mercedes-Benz. In the most severe cyclical decline in the postwar era, the automotive concern eliminated one-fourth of all management positions and cut costs by 4 billion marks. "That was unthinkable a few years ago." Fellow entrepreneur Peter Vischer, business manager of the medical equipment manufacturer Heraeus-Holding GmbH, has "concluded not even half of the massive reorganization in the enterprise." He sees the danger that "things will not be accomplished if suddenly everything goes well." Anyone who thinks that he can lean back and relax in view of the looming upswing is missing the boat, thinks Siemens-chief Heinrich von Pierer as well: "We urgently need to resolve the structural problems to secure our international competitiveness in the long term," he says to damp rising optimism. Some buckle under more quickly. At Volkswagen in Wolfsburg, the workers are not working more efficiently after the parallel reduction of working time and wages but only more briefly and still too expensively. The cars are not becoming less costly. There are just fewer salable cars being built. Still: the enterprises have come the farthest on the way to reorganization. "They will accomplish the change in any case," believes banker von Tippelskirch. Only a small share will be left behind. The rest would be "stronger in international competition than before." It depends on the politicians and trade unionists "whether the jobs will be created here or abroad." "The shock of the recession had a lasting effect," recapitulates economic researcher Pohl. The enterprises had reduced their costs, opened up new markets, and "are now letting sales people participate in product development rather than just the engineers." Whereas the reorganization is proceeding only slowly domestically, the international competition is applying pressure. In Japan and the United States, enterprises trimmed down much faster and much more drastically. China is on the way to being a technology nation and is offering high-tech at favorable prices. Danger is threatening from the immediate east as well. The reform countries in Central Europe are offering wages like those of developing countries but have educated specialists as in the industrial states, the Institute for World Economics has discovered. German firms are already also moving research-intensive production to the east. The pressure could become ominous if the reforms do not take place. Economist Schatz fears a deadly chain reaction: --the upswing is soon exhausted; --the build-up of the new laender fades; --unemployment remains high; --taxes and contributions must rise to finance it; --the distribution conflicts increase; --the infrastructure decays; --the development of new products and processes fails because of unwillingless to take risks and protracted approval procedures; --with their obsolete products, the enterprises are no longer competitive and lose larger and larger market shares worldwide; and --they invest increasingly in production sites abroad. Gloomy outlook: Germany will become second-class, just an industrial museum. Such a decline is nothing new: Argentina has gone through it. Still, there is growing resistance to the decline, at least verbally. "We must not idly watch developments," Tyll Necker, president of the Federal Association of German Industry, encourages himself. Upswing '94--the danger is perceived but not yet averted.
