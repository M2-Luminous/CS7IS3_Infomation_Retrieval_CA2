According to a statement issued by the President's Office, Klestil will remain separated from his wife Edith and will carry out his official duties without her. Envoy Margot Loeffler, who holds a leading position in the Office of the President -- she is involved in the president's private problems because of her close relationship with the president -- has submitted a request to Foreign Minister Alois Mock for a transfer abroad at the earliest opportunity. According to the President's Office, the president's decision to remain separated from his wife was preceded by efforts to clarify the situation with his wife in the presence of his children living in Austria. Much to his regret, Klestil had reached the conclusion that the couple will remain separated, he announced. Klestil regretted Loeffler's plan to leave the President's Office, referring to her achievements in reorganizing it. [passage omitted]
