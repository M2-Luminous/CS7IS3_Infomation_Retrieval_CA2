Without such an elite, the country can have no future, Kohl said. "We need initiative, responsibility, the courage to undertake ventures, the readiness to make personal sacrifices, and patience in pursuing great goals," the chancellor said at the annual meeting of the German Research Community (DFG) in Halle on 21 June. Even though Germany was holding an international top position in important fields of research, it had lost ground in competition, which had become sharper on the world markets. Kohl said that research results should, therefore, be put into practice more swiftly. "In the research laboratories and scientific institutions of today, decisions are made on our jobs of tomorrow," he told an audience of approximately 500 scientists and guests of honor at the DFG festive meeting. The chancellor said that in the important areas of high technology and biotechnology, industry largely depended on the swift and smooth transfer of research results. To this end, borders had to be more permeable. In addition, more joint ventures between industry and research and a closer dialogue with broad sections of the population were required. The country of poets and thinkers should not become a country of doubters and hesitaters, said Kohl. His most important concern was to increase and improve the dialogue between industry, science, and the state. Kohl said that, without intending to patronize research, he held the view that its structures had to be reviewed. They had to be revised where they had become entrenched and were dominated by thinking in terms of entitlements. The chancellor struck a favorable balance on the development of universities and research in the new laender. He said they corresponded to international standards and compared well with facilities in the new laender. Kohl stressed that the universities in eastern Germany could stimulate the renewal of the university system throughout Germany. Earlier, DFG President Professor Wolfgang Fruehwald was unanimously confirmed in office for another three years. With its meeting in Halle, the German Research Community paid tribute to Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, which celebrates its 300th anniversary this year.
