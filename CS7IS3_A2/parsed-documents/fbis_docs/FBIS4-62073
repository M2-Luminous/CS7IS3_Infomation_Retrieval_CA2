The centerpiece of the visit will be talks about the implementation of the EFP's project to lift out of the crisis the country's air space industry, whose main centers are located, in particular, in St. Petersburg and in northwestern Russia. Regarding the situation in the country, Konstantin Borovoy described the just signed agreement on public accord as "the most cynical action conceivable." The EFP leader, who thinks that currently the Russian Government is pursuing an anti-market policy, said in that respect that he would "not join the Chernomyrdin government" under any circumstances.
