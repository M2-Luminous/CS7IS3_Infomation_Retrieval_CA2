The order to transfer 400 servicemen (around one-third of the personnel of the Russian battalion) was given to battalion commander Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy by the headquarters of the UN forces in Zagreb Monday without coordination with Moscow. Aside from the fact that there was a breach of normal procedure here, which presupposes consent to such measures on the part of the Russian leadership, French General Jean Cot, commander of the UN contingent in Yugoslavia, has acted improperly at the very least. On two counts, moreover. Evidently the intention was to station the Russians in the Sarajevo region, where additional forces are now required -- and at the moment when the NATO ultimatum deadline is about to expire. That is, were NATO to carry out its threatened air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, Russian soldiers would be required to suffer the disastrous consequences of the punitive bombing. But, first, the decision on bombing raids was taken by NATO without prior consultation with Russia and, what is more, Moscow was told that NATO "has no intention of being preached to." Second, France, Britain, and the United States have done everything they can to prevent the convening of the Security Council -- as Russia has proposed -- for the adoption of a special decision on the threats to bomb Bosnia. Therefore the Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries have quite justifiably forbidden the command of the Russian battalion to carry out the redeployment order. Evidently there is still serious talking to be done with our Western partners over future cooperation in peacekeeping operations. Meanwhile, U.S. newspapers have reported that the Clinton administration indicated Tuesday that it will agree to a compromise that does not go as far as NATO's demand for the Bosnian Serbs' guns to be withdrawn from Sarajevo or placed under UN control by the end of the week. In the opinion of U.S. officials, some heavy artillery can stay on the hills above the Bosnian capital. However, the United States will insist on guarantees that these guns will not be fired. According to reports from the Serbian part of Sarajevo, competitions have been held on Jahorina Hill in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Thus, the Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated their respect for the International Olympic Committee's call for a truce during the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.
