Briefing media executives in Lagos this evening on the latest developments around the Bakassi Peninsula, the foreign affairs minister, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, said the federal government's position is that Nigeria and Cameroon can resolve the dispute peacefully, having been traditionally good neighbors. He said the French should hold themselves fully responsible for the consequences of any direct military confrontation between Nigeria and Cameroon. [Begin Kingibe recording] We hold the French responsible for internationalizing it, for encouraging the Cameroonians to go from pillar to post; they are ones who provided the Cameroonians three French lawyers -- international law lawyers -- to go to the Hague to try and file the case at that tribunal. They are the ones who strategized for them to wait until they become the president of Security Council, which was in force yesterday, before they took the matter of Bakassi, and they are the ones who internationalized and introduced an element of war by bringing in their troops into the region where, in fact, the conditions for inviting their local defense staff did not exist. [end recording] Discussing the situation on the ground, Ambassador Kingibe said the Cameroonian Army has already been placed on the alert and the French troops and military hardware are on the ground in that country. He also warned if nothing is done quickly to return to dialogue, the situation might explode. He said that while Nigeria is mobilizing all diplomatic machinery at its disposal to ensure a peaceful resolution of the dispute, it is prepared and has the full capacity to defend every inch of its territory and protect the lives and property of all Nigerians. Foreign Ministry correspondent Godfried Agor reports that Nigeria cannot be bothered by an International Court ruling since the document disputed, dating far beyond the colonial era, confirms Nigeria's ownership of the disputed territory.
