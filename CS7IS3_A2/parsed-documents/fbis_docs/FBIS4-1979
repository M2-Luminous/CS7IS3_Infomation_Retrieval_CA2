The "Hope Project" aims to help dropouts to return to primary schools in poverty-stricken areas. On March 8, the city launched a "Hope Project" donation center in downtown Beijing, which so far has received 350,000 yuan in donations from some 4,000 citizens. Beijing has been leading other Chinese regions in the amount donated to the "Hope Project" ever since it was launched in 1990 to raise funds from society to help children in poor areas return to classrooms and finish their primary school education. Over the four years, the "Hope Project" has provided help to 549,000 children in 1,200 counties in 26 Chinese regions, reaching across all of China except for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Jiangsu. The project has built 204 primary schools for poor areas and given awards to 100 rural school teachers. It has also provided special scholarships for 200 university students and 1,361 middle school students. This year's theme for the "Hope Project" is "One Family Helps One Dropout", setting the goal for an urban family to donate 300 yuan to help a child finish five years of education. The project plans to help one million children return to classrooms in 1994. [Beijing Central People's Radio Network in Mandarin at 1030 GMT on 1 April in its "National Hookup" program carries an under-minute report on the "Hope Project" fund-raising drive in Beijing, which says that "Beijing City leaders Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, Zhang Jianmin, and Wang Daming took the lead in donating money to the newly founded Beijing donation center."]
