Pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy, the Namibian Government is strengthening relations with many countries of the world and member states of the organization of African unity and fighting against imperialism and racism. The Korean and the Namibian people established friendly bonds on the road of the common struggle for independence against imperialism. Especially, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have further developed since the establishment of diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level on March 22, 1990.
