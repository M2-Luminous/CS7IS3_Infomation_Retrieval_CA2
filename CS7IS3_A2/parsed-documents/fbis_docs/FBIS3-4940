Thursday [1400 GMT] (9 A.M. Washington time). The agreement includes the date for a third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea, tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva. Laney made the disclosure during a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and head of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi Yong-tok. Laney briefed Yi on the process and the content of the U.S.-North Korean agreement, according to NUB spokesman Kim Hyong-ki. At the meeting, Yi again stressed the South Korean Government's position that Seoul and Pyongyang must exchange special envoys before the United States and North Korea can hold a third round of negotiations. Yi and Laney shared the opinion that Washington and Seoul need to consult closely on the issue, the spokesman said. If South and North Korea failed to exchange special envoys before March 21, Yi and Laney agreed that North Korea would be in a difficult position, Kim added.
