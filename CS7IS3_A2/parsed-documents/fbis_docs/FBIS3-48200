Peace Keeping Forces [PKO], may be changed shortly, a Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday. The official said the likely refixing has been necessitated as the function of the U.N. PKO forces there has been reduced to relief programs only and major Western countries' troops are set to pull out of the African country shortly. "In particular, we are discussing with the U.N. Secretariat and relevant countries on matters related to the security of the Korean PKO unit since the Italian contingent which has been supporting the Korean unit in terms of security is to return to Italy by the end of March," he said. The official added that despite the planned early withdrawal of the troops of major Western countries, there is no plan so far to bring the Korean unit home ahead of schedule. The Korean engineer unit is supposed to remain in Somalia through July this year.
