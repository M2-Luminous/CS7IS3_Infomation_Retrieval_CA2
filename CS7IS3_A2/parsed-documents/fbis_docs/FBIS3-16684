But, be that as it may, it marks a truly historic event: Exactly three years ago, 17 March, the former Soviet people voted by an overwhelming majority to preserve the unified state -- the USSR. What happened next and how the experience of the first Russian referendum ultimately ended is well known. It would, of course, be possible to say quite a few spiteful things about those who like to "consult with the people." Nevertheless, the following nuance appears more noteworthy: Some time later the same people who had said "yes" to the Union voted equally readily for independence, this time at a regional level. ...We became witnesses to and participants in the notorious sovereignty bandwagon. On departing, each republic took with it as much freedom, economics, politics, security, and even religion as it wanted. The former Union territory became the most "president-intensive" in the world. But now sociologists, sounding out public opinion among the dwellers of the ruins of the "evil empire," once again present us with sensational statistics: It turns out that the overwhelming majority of former Soviet citizens are now, once again, not averse to living beneath the same roof. And not just the ordinary men in the street! Even well-known politicians among the most frenzied radicals weep publicly for the "prematurely deceased USSR." Not that these tears will be believed any longer not only in Moscow but even, probably, in Uryupinsk. It is all easily explained: Separatism is now an unpopular field. Nobody, not even the citizens of the "small but proud" Baltic republics, has benefited from the partition and breakup. Of the entire former Soviet population only the local elites -- leadership, financial, entertainment -- are prospering. Previously they too were ordinary Aeroflot passengers, but now they fly in their own airplanes with a retinue and "retainers." Former party workers, former commodity experts, former minor but cunning officials, unremarkable officers.... Surely the purport of that all-Union shake-up was not just that a band should play at the airport for someone and a saber be waved about? Oh, how strong our people are, nonetheless, with hindsight! How trustful! First they were prepared to follow Kirsan Ilyumzhinov's white cloak into the boundless sea of independence, now they look somewhat too suspiciously upon the "political" beard of Aleksandr Rutskoy.... Again no good will come of it.... They would like very much not to be disappointed again. Three whole years have passed, nonetheless! Russia is no longer the same, and the entire post-Soviet area has greatly changed. So we ask revolutionary gentlemen not to worry: A return to the old ways is simply impossible. We must build our common home anew and seek paths to unification anew -- to effective unification which infringes nobody's interests. We have already lived for long enough in states where everything -- from the economy to the borders -- is conventional, and it is time we thought seriously about the future.
