The first action the EC commission has taken since new year's day was to work out a lengthy list which covers a wide-range of foreign goods and adopt broad anti-dumping measures which are of long-term duration, according to EC officials. The commission has also voted to keep up the momentum of a package of anti-dumping measures adopted five years ago. The anti-dumping list, put forward by the EC commission Monday, covers polyester fibers manufactured by South Korea, Turkey and Taiwan and ferrosilicon from Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Venezuela. Chinese made photo-albums, lighters and paracetamol (a kind of aspirin) are also included in the list. Apart from albums, a number of other Chinese goods have been placed under permanent anti-dumping tariffs since 1988. Under relevant EC laws, "permanent anti-dumping measures" are normally effective for a term of five years and the EC commission decides to continue or cancel the measures when they reach the end of the five-year term, in accordance with changes in the marketplace. The term "market changes" here normally means that under strict anti-dumping measures, the competitiveness of foreign goods is greatly weakened and imported goods are taking an increasingly smaller share of the EC market. The anti-dumping measures in the past either generally expired or were reduced at the end of the five-year term if they genuinely achieved the desired target. But, as the EC is still locked in a serious recession and there is no sign of recovery, the EC commission has decided to maintain or prolong the anti-dumping measures adopted five years ago as they are regarded as very effective in having protected European business interests. In 1988, Chinese exports of paracetamol to the EC soared to 234 tons and the community rushed to impose a price limit of six dollars a ton upon the drug at the end of that year. As a result the figures declined sharply in 1992 to only 61 tons. But the EC commission now believes that the European market should be protected continually and has proposed maintaining the imposition of anti-dumping tariffs upon the import of Chinese paracetamol. Analysts here believe the EC's anti-dumping measures are designed to protect Europe's market, business and economy which have been hit hard by the lingering recession. But analysts warn that the community may have forgotten that while restricting the sale of foreign goods, it has at the same time built up a barrier against its own exports. Meanwhile, the EC has been under fire from abroad for repeatedly increasing subsidies which are intended to stimulate its exports and spur an economic recovery in Europe.
