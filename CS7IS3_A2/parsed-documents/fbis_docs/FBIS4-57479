Now they want to stay. Scientists have no fatherland and science belongs to humanity. Those two maxims are taken literally by the over 40 professors and researchers who have settled in Brazil over the past two years. Bankrolled by scholarships from the National Research Council, they are gradually adapting to the daily routine at Brazilian universities and losing the suspicion that the assignment would be no more than a brief experiment involving half a dozen nobodies. They are optimistic and seem to have forgotten the meaning of the term "goska" -- the feeling that we usually describe as "homesickness" or "nostalgia" -- when they talk about the possibility of returning to Russia. They want to stay in our country as long as they have the opportunity to work. The distance separating Brazil from a country where professors are paid a dignified salary is the same as that separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. Be that as it may, it must indeed be impossible to feel nostalgic about jobs paying an average of $80 per month. Physicist Gregory Surdutovich, 56, was one of the first to arrive. He landed in Brazil in January 1992, impelled by the political instability and drastic cut in science budgets in Russia. Deteriorating conditions were causing salaries to plummet. Despite the shortcomings, he believes that Brazilian research can be improved. "The climate in the Brazilian scientific area today resembles that in my country 35 years ago," says Surdutovich, who is studying the pressure of light on atoms at the Sao Carlos campus of the University of Sao Paulo (USP). Artur Elfimov, 50, the leader of a group of five Russian experts on plasma physics working at the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), agrees. "If the administrators really give their support, this country will be able to make up for lost time in several areas of knowledge," he believes. The researchers are a varied group. Galina Pugacheva and Anatoliy Gusev of the Campinas State University (Unicamp) are studying anomalies in the Brazilian magnetic field. Those phenomena cause the number of lightning flashes in our atmosphere to be 50 percent higher than anywhere else on the planet. Five other Russian scientists are assigned to work at the North Fluminense State University (UENF), which was opened on Monday 28 March. They are interested in producing synthetic diamonds. Under a plan by Senator Darcy Ribeiro (PDT [Democratic Labor Party], Rio de Janeiro), the UENF's mentor, another 15 researchers from the former Soviet Republic [as published] will soon join the team. In the opinion of many people, "importing" Russian scientists means saving time and money. "Training a professional at that level requires at least eight years of heavy investment at a cost that is never below $200,000," says Carlos Augusto Azevedo, head of the Department of Quantum Electronics at the UERJ. "Moreover, it will not take a long time for the work of these researchers to produce results," he adds. "That immigration has already yielded excellent results for us," says Oscar Hipolito, director of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry at the Sao Carlos campus of the USP. But all that enthusiasm comes up against an obstacle: the law prohibiting the hiring of foreigners as government employees. That restriction, detested by the scientific community, has made it necessary for the Russian scientists to stay here as visiting professors on one- to two-year scholarships that pay from $1,000 to $2,000 per month. Rectors and professors are attacking the ban on the basis of the constitutional principle of university autonomy. Their arguments began bearing fruit with the recruitment of physicist Dmitri Gitma, who was hired by the USP in 1992 after passing a competitive examination. Gitma is an exception, however. All the other Russian researchers are here on scholarships, and many of them are experiencing an additional difficulty in order to teach in Brazil: inflation. Physicist Irina Potapenko of the UERJ left Russia two years ago. Her salary, like that of state employees, is adjusted according to the dollar rate every three months. "I live in an apartment provided by the university. But even so, the lag in pay means that there is only enough money for the upkeep fees and survival." Although her pay is eaten up by rising prices, she admits that she is satisfied with her work and is not thinking of leaving the country. When people draw her attention to legal and economic difficulties, she answers with the smile of someone who is already beginning to understand the Brazilian soul: "Take it easy! After all, Brazil is ours."
