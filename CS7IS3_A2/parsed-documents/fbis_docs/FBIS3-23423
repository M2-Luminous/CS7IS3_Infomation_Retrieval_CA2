During the trial, numerous questions were raised about the circumstances engulfing the assault and about al-Turabi's health. Since the court issued its verdict, numerous pending issues have continued, such as: how has the incident affected al-Turabi physically and psychologically? Has he recovered from it or is he still suffering from some of its effects? Was there really a plot behind the assault, as some parties have implied, or was the attack an individual act motivated by a "feeling of being wronged by what is going on in Sudan," as Hashim Badr-al-Din has said? What are the causes of the clamor which accompanied al-Turabi's visit to Canada? Why did the Canadian consular office in Washington refuse to grant al-Turabi an entry visa initially but changed its mind afterward? Was the visit to Canada a missionary and call-oriented visit, as al-Turabi said, or was it to hold political and trade talks and to discuss transactions in the areas of transportation, banking, communications, and pharmaceuticals, according to one of three Canadian parliamentary deputies who were to meet with al-Turabi during his visit? There are other questions: how did the Sudanese opposition in Canada learn of al-Turabi's itinerary, even though it had not been announced officially? What are the circumstances that led to the lack of guards to protect al-Turabi before he left Ottawa? Was al-Turabi traveling under his real name or under the assumed name of "Martin Loony," as some parties have implied? These questions and others were raised during the trial, and some of them have remained unanswered, thus adding more mystery and excitement to this issue. In a series of articles, AL-MAJALLAH will review some aspects of the case, of the trial, and of the accompanying controversy. It will also publish for the first time a photograph of Dr. al-Turabi in the hospital room immediately after the incident. This was the first photograph presented to the jury as part of the evidence aimed at acquainting the court with the injuries sustained by al-Turabi in the incident. Following is the second part of this report: Since the assault on Dr. Hasan al-Turabi at Ottawa Airport in May 1992, numerous questions have been raised regarding the health of the Sudanese National Islamic Front secretary general and on whether al-Turabi has recovered from the consequences of the incident or whether he is still suffering from it physically and psychologically despite the lapse of 19 months since the assault. Even though al-Turabi has resumed his activities and even though he made his first two "official" foreign trips last year, visiting Afghanistan, via Pakistan, and the Vatican, numerous Sudanese, including some officials and some who are close to al-Turabi's family, say that the incident has left its imprints on al-Turabi physically and psychologically. These people reiterate that al-Turabi "disappears" from time to time for a period of one week for treatment from the effects of the Ottawa incident. Interpretations vary on the details. Some say that the NIF secretary general is taken to a place known only to a few, where he stays for a week out of sight to be treated with some drugs that have an evident effect on the man and on his general capabilities. Others say that he resorts to complete rest during this disappearance because he feels extremely tired and exhausted after any effort that he exerts. In addition to some officials who work with the current regime and who do not wish to reveal their identity, Aldo Ajo Deng, deputy speaker of Sudan's Transitional National Assembly (parliament) who broke away from the government last month and applied for political asylum in England, has also talked about this issue. He said that al-Turabi "is hidden" from sight for one week a month to rest and regain his energy, which seems to have declined greatly since the Ottawa incident. He added that numerous people have noticed that al-Turabi tires quickly and that his train of thought is affected if he takes part in a long conversation or in a public event that requires one to stand and concentrate for a long time. Feeling of Exhaustion In a press interview in the wake of the incident, al-Turabi said that he felt exhausted. Moreover, the physician who treated him at Civic Hospital in Canada told the court which considered Hashim Badr-al-Din's case last year that the patient (al-Turabi) had not regained his normal condition when he left the hospital. On top of this, the medical report that was submitted to the court noted that al-Turabi may need treatment in a "special unit" in the United States or Switzerland to regain his fitness. It is not known to date whether al-Turabi has received such special treatment, keeping in mind that he has not visited the United States since the Ottawa incident and that it has not been announced or learned that he has visited Switzerland since that date, even though rumors were circulated in Sudanese circles last year about a "secret visit" al-Turabi made to Switzerland. Extent of Injuries Al-Turabi (62) suffered a brain concussion, lost his speech, and experienced extreme weakness on the right side of his body as a result of the incident. A Canadian police officer is reported to have said in the wake of the incident that the blow al-Turabi received from Badr-al-Din did not cause much damage and that the main injury resulted when al-Turabi's head collided with the ground when he fell. That collision caused a nearly two-inch long wound on the right side of the back of his head. The wound did not need to be surgically stitched but it caused a brain concussion, which began as minor but intensified by the third day, according to the report of Dr. Vasco da Silva, the physician who treated al-Turabi at Civic Hospital. Before the court considering Badr-al-Din's case, da Silva described al-Turabi's injuries as follows: "The injuries can be described as three parts: al-Turabi suffered a superficial wound to the scalp, and this is the first part. The second part is the slight concussion which basically manifests itself in a passing or transient loss of consciousness lasting between 15 to 20 minutes. The more serious injury, which represents the third part, was suffered in what can be characterized as a brain concussion. "As a result of these injuries, especially the third part, al-Turabi experienced unconsciousness and exhaustion. He started to breathe haltingly, and he lost all ability to speak and to respond to verbal commands. This dictated his return to the intensive care room on the third day of his admission to the hospital." da Silva characterized the loss of ability to respond to verbal commands as the "worrying element" which alerted him to the fact that al-Turabi's head injury was not as slight as it had seemed to be initially. In his testimony before the court, Dasilva added: "I realized then that there was something worrying about him (al-Turabi) because he wasn't able to talk properly. When one spoke to him, he answered on a totally different issue, meaning that his disturbed ability to speak made me conclude that there was a positional fault in the brain. This was confirmed by our [later] diagnosis, which showed what I have characterized as a brain concussion." Court Dialogue The following dialogue then took place between Dr. da Silva and the attorney defending Badr-al-Din (the defendant) in court: Attorney: When you say that he (al-Turabi) was giving illogical answers, do you mean that he was unable to talk? Da Silva: He talked. Yes, he talked on the first and second day after his admission to the hospital. But if one asked him: How are you? He would respond: in Toronto, thank you. Attorney: But there was no problem in his ability to speak? Da Silva: This is what one can call impossible or disturbed speech. What I mean is this sort of illogical responses. Attorney: Did you decide that there was a concussion after the sectional scanning of the brain, or did you make your decision before the scan was conducted. Da Silva: I felt that there was something wrong with the brain before the sectional scan was made. The result of the scan confirmed my doubts. Questions and answers then revolved around permission given by Dr. da Silva to a physician named 'Abd-al-Amin, who arrived from Chicago on 27 May 1992 (two days after the incident), to examine Dr. al-Turabi at his family's request. The attorney wondered if it was normal to permit Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin to examine al-Turabi even though he had come from abroad, meaning that he did not belong to the staff working at Civic Hospital. In response, Dr. da Silva said that this was not unusual and noted that Dr. al-Amin suggested two kinds of drugs to treat al-Turabi. According to the medical report, Dr. al-Turabi had an allergic reaction and developed a skin rash because of one of the two drugs. Dr. al-Turabi also experienced weakness on the right side of his body and a total loss of his speech ability. After 19 days in the hospital, there was improvement in the condition of Dr. al-Turabi, who regained his ability to speak and started to walk a little around his room. He also continued to take his medication. Condition Engulfed in Ambiguity Al-Turabi's health condition was encircled by walls of "official" silence through his stay at the hospital. Civic Hospital officials were asked not to make any statements about his health. Reporters' questions were referred to the Sudanese Embassy in Ottawa, which either refused to answer the questions or offered vague answers. Ambiguity continued to engulf al-Turabi's condition even after his return to Khartoum on 21 June 1992. The authorities concerned prevented people from visiting him, and only a few relatives and close associates saw him. Writing about al-Turabi's return, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI, the government paper, said, "al-Turabi's kinsmen, and those who love him and who are close to him and who were around him or in contact with the Canadian hospital where he was being treated, received saddening medical reports at times and encouraging reports at other times. But the final days of his weeks of recuperation witnessed improvement that doctors could not believe and that surprised observers, considering that he began to regain his health and to act as if nothing had happened." SUNA, the Sudanese News Agency, also circulated a report on al-Turabi's return to Khartoum from Ottawa in which it said that he was "in good health." But all other reports and sources said that, even though al-Turabi felt great improvement in his health, he continued to suffer from the effects of the incident for a long time. The first time the Sudanese people saw al-Turabi after his incident was in a "silent film" shown by Sudanese television on a visit which Lieutenant-General 'Umar al-Bashir, the Revolutionary Command Council chairman, paid to al-Turabi's home to reassure himself about al-Turabi's health nearly one week after he had returned to Khartoum. In the film, the NIF secretary general looked pale and exhausted and his voice could not be heard during his conversation with Lieutenant-General al-Bashir. Some people who were permitted to visit al-Turabi weeks after his return have reported that he could not stand for a long time, even though he leaned on a walking stick, and that he also had difficulty moving his right arm and foot because of a slight paralysis resulting form the incident. He seemed to have difficulty speaking. It was also noticed that he talked about nothing other than the incident. Some people interpreted this as part of the psychological effect of the assault and injury. On 31 July 1992, a ceremony was held in the Green Square in Khartoum on the occasion of al-Turabi's return and "recovery." Al-Turabi delivered an address in which he said, according to SUNA, "God fated me to survive and He prolonged my life after they paralyzed a part of my body and stopped my tongue from speaking. But God has restored my speech to me and has healed my paralyzed side." Al-Turabi added, "Muslims are the source of the invocation for my recovery." He also alluded to a plot to assassinate him. Despite the lapse of 18 months since that ceremony, there are still those who say that al-Turabi, even though he has largely recovered his health and his abilities, continues to suffer from some effects of that incident and that he still needs medication and periods of treatment and rest. Questions About His Future The assault on al-Turabi created great confusion within the NIF ranks and it almost touched off an open conflict within the NIF leadership ranks between those aspiring to succeed al-Turabi and those advocating a change in the leadership system so as to fill the void that developed at the time or that could develop in the future if the incident were to leave lasting effects on the secretary general's health. According to reports leaked at the time, a number of the NIF leaders raised the issue of forming a collective leadership to fill the void during al-Turabi's presence in the hospital for treatment and to replace him in case he disappears or becomes unable to work. It was reported that the names proposed to form that leadership were those of NIF Deputy Secretary General 'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad Taha, Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, Ibrahim al-Sinusi, Yasin 'Umar al-Imam, and 'Uthman Khalid Mudawi. But the proposal was rejected by 'Ali 'Uthman, who insisted that the adoption of such a step could produce adverse results and reflect the regime as a regime experiencing void or weakness because of al-Turabi's absence. 'Ali 'Uthman's argument did not convince the NIF's "old generation" who saw that 'Uthman was trying to gain sole control of the decisionmaking and to succeed al-Turabi "even while he is still alive." The feelings of annoyance among the ranks of the "old generation" began to appear in what this generation's men said in their private sessions. Some of them talked about endeavors by 'Ali 'Uthman to marginalize others and about 'Uthman's efforts to gain control of affairs and to impose his tendencies on the NIF and on the regime. It is to be noted that the majority of the Sudanese speak of 'Ali 'Uthman as the planning head behind the 30 June 1989 coup and as the real director of numerous domestic affairs, especially since al-Turabi is inclined to devote a large part of his time to working and planning with the other movements connected with the NIF in the region. It has been noticed that since the assault on al-Turabi, 'Ali 'Uthman has begun to figure more prominently in the political arena, has begun to assume ministerial positions, and has begun to expand his powers and to enlarge the sphere of his influence by giving positions to the Front's "young generation" and by marginalizing the "old generation" that can dispute his leadership of the NIF action. Even though al-Turabi has begun to exercise his leadership tasks since his return and, to a large degree, his recovery, some sort of division of roles has surfaced between him and 'Ali 'Uthman, with al-Turabi devoting most of his attention and time to the foreign movement and contacts and to coordination with other fundamentalist movements through the facade of the Islamic Arab Popular Conference. Meanwhile, 'Ali 'Uthman takes charge of domestic executive action, with the role of grand "master" and guide maintained by al-Turabi in the domestic arena as well. Many in the NIF and outside it realize that it will be difficult for 'Uthman to fill the void created in case al-Turabi disappears. This is because 'Uthman lacks al-Turabi's long experience and his extensive network of foreign relations. 'Uthman is not even known to many beyond Sudan's border, and some view him as more of a political figure than a religious leader. This is why NIF cohesion and unity seem to be tied to al-Turabi and to the extent of his ability to overcome the effects of the Ottawa incident, especially in light of the growing crises and pressures confronting the Sudanese regime internally and externally.
