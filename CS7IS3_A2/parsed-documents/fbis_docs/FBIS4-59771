There are lots of problems. We had a beginning. Still a long way to go. We appreciate very much the efforts of Secretary Christopher by traveling between Damascus and Israel, and his efforts to find ways to bring the parties closer in their positions and by that to facilitate real breakthrough. [passage omitted] [Qol Yisra'el's political correspondent Shlomo Raz] Today we heard of remarks by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat regarding jihad and a commitment he received from Israel regarding Jerusalem. Would you care to comment, sir? [Rabin] If he speaks of a letter issued following the Cairo agreement, then I wrote this letter on 8 May. It was presented before the Knesset. It makes no mention of Jerusalem. There was no other letter which I or any other Israeli wrote following the Cairo agreement which relates to Jerusalem. At the same time, the Document of Principles, signed on 13 September 1993 in Washington, states that there are issues that pertain to the permanent solution. It lists several issues, as examples, including Jerusalem. There will be issues that can be raised during the negotiations on the permanent solution. As for to his remarks regarding jihad, if indeed he called for jihad, it is a grave violation of his commitment, made in the letter he had signed, which resulted in the mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel. If indeed he made that call, it would cast doubt on the continuation of the process between the Palestinians and ourselves. We cannot accept a violation of a commitment regarding the PLO undertaking not to be involved in violence and terror. [passage omitted] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew, which joined the relay of the news conference at 1530 GMT, carries a reply by Rabin to a question on the answers Christopher brought from Damascus, in which he says: "It is not my duty to present the details. I believe that if the secretary decided to return to Damascus and to attempt to continue the dialogue in Syria, perhaps there is a glimpse of hope. I believe that exploiting every opportunity is the right thing to do. I believe the secretary is clear regarding our stands and the components required on our part in order to attain peace."]
