The thing is that Gasprom's European partners get less than their due because Ukraine "draws away" some of the gas during its transit via Ukrainian territory, sources in Gasprom told ITAR-TASS today. The pressure of gas in the pipelines leading to Western Europe and particularly to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey is lower than designed although Gasprom has resumed feeding as much gas as agreed and more into the pipeline - 470 million cubic meters a day. The extra deliveries are designed to compensate Ukraine for the termination of natural gas deliveries from Turkmenistan (80 million cubic meters a day). Ukraine has failed to conform to one of the most important articles of the agreement reached between the Ukrainian governmental delegation and the Gasprom leadership. Under the agreement, Gasprom resumed the deliveries of the stipulated amount of gas until April 10 pending termination of Ukraine's unlicensed use of natural gas from the export pipeline passing through Ukraine. Ukraine also promised to work out a specific mechanism of repaying its debt for the supplies of gas to Ukraine in 1993-1994 and to begin to pay off the debts. Other articles of the agreement also have yet to be fulfilled. Ukraine has remitted less than a fraction of one percent of its 1.5 trillion arrears to the Gasprom account, and according to Russian experts, its financial potential is well-nigh exhausted. There is one way of offsetting Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia - through the switch to joint ownership of the underground gas storage facilities and main gas pipelines on the Ukrainian territory, according to Gasprom. Regrettably, the agreement in principle on this reached during the negotiations in Moscow has met with no support on the part of the Ukrainian leadership.
