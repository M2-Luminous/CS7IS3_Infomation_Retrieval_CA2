A seminar on the work was held in Karachi, Pakistan. In his report, Abdul Rahim Baluch, political adviser to the prime minister of the Sind provincial government of Pakistan, said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused when the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea. This is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, he said. The United States recently manipulated the International Atomic Energy Agency to adopt an unreasonable "resolution" against the DPRK, he noted, adding that pressure can never be a way of resolving the issue.
