Now the leaders of opposition parties will try to relaunch the mobilization this week. Rothschild Francois filed a report: [Begin recording] [Francois] Mobilization, unity, and reconciliation are the watchwords of the coordination committee that issued from among the political parties at the Visa Lodge meeting. Those political formations, mostly hostile to President Aristide, deem the political vacuum in the Haitian executive dangerous and abnormal. Those parties, including the MDN [Mobilization For National Development], FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], and RDR [Assembly of Democrats for the Republic] blame the state for the misery prevailing in the country. This situation could lead to a social explosion in Haiti, according to the analysis of those parties, grouped together within the coordination committee presided over by Attorney Gregoire Eugene. For this assembly of political leaders opposed to the return of President Aristide, mobilization is imperative right now in order to extract the country from the crisis. [Eugene] Facing this imminent peril, it is urgent that the entire national population mobilize. Following the meeting at Visa Lodge on 11 March, it has been decided to launch a national mobilization under the motto: love, unity, reconciliation. A nine-member coordination committee has been established to assure coordination of this mobilization imposed by the realities of the difficult times we are experiencing. We make a point -- given the national peril -- of giving an essentially national character to the efforts for a solution to the crisis. [Francois] The coordination committee intends to hold a news conference on Wednesday. In this meeting, which will be open to other political groups, more should come out regarding the strategy that the committee intends to follow to achieve this mobilization. According to the president of the coordinating committee, based on the initiatives of these political formations from the opposition, the country must come out of the crisis. [end recording]
