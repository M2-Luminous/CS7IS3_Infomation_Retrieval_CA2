Moscow Mayor Forms 5,000-Strong Army. People's Militiamen or Stormtroopers?"] [Text] The report of the formation of people's militias in the capital has provoked a contradictory reaction. Many people are at a loss as to exactly how to view this step by Yu. Luzhkov, the capital's mayor. Judging by the Moscow government's decree of 19 April, something akin to an army is being formed, but without combat weapons. A blue uniform, bulletproof vests, helmets, handcuffs, and batons [sentence as published]. Detachments are to be deployed in each of the city's 133 administrative districts (prefectures). A distinction is being drawn between territorial and mobile forces (operational detachments), which could be attached to a city detachment. E. Bakirov, vice premier in Luzhkov's government, has been made commander of the "blue army." The latter is also appointing the leadership of a city staff for the people's militiamen. The government is funding these forces through its own finance department, and the transport department is supplying them with automobiles and fuel. Anyone who served in the USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Internal Troops will see parallels when glancing at the statute on these formations. Personnel are paid for their service. They can check documents, detain people, and collaborate with Federal Counterintelligence Service forces, and they will be trained by specialists from the city staff for civil defense and emergency situations. They can be used in operations to maintain order. And, let us observe, the decree was even sent to the capital's military commandant for compliance. The numerical strength of the people's militias is being estimated at a minimum of 3,000 and a maximum of 5,000-6,000 men. Of course, crime has to be combated and order maintained. But this must be done only according to the law. And there is no law on people's militias. Is the innovation by the capital's top brass consequently illegal? It turns out that it is in fact forming its own structure of repression which is subordinate to Luzhkov. (This is in addition to the forces of the Internal Affairs Main Administration and municipal militia, which are already subordinate to him). But if there are normative acts which regulate the activity of both militiamen and security firms' employees and which allow someone who has suffered at their hands to defend their rights in court, what is to be done here? After all, it is impossible to take to court a force which does not figure in the laws. This could lead to large-scale tyranny. Generally there is no understanding of what a "people's militia" actually is. In the West there are people who voluntarily assist the police. But their function is to report disturbances by radio and telephone. Although they are paid, this is still a form of amateur civilian activity. But a de facto police body with the attributes of a standing army is being set up from the top in Moscow under City Hall and the prefectures. The Moscow government will maintain it and appoint and remove its command personnel. It is not a people's but a government militia! Would it not be better if it were designed to protect the security of citizens and strengthen legal militia structures consisting of professionals, not amateurs? Thus, the formation of the "blue army" in Moscow is illegal, a burden on the treasury, and senseless from the viewpoint of maintaining law and order. But it does strengthen the personal power of Mr. Luzhkov, who, as mayor and head of the city government, already manages the 9-million-strong city's land, buildings, property, budget, and tax service practically unchecked. He is just like the Prince of Moscow. Notwithstanding the fact that Russian laws do not contain the concepts of a "mayor," "prefect," or "head of the city government." This also violates the treaty on social accord, which prohibits the creation of militarized formations. The mayor has successfully gotten around this by using Khrushchev's old pretext of a "people's militia." This is very reminiscent of the formation of Nazi stormtrooper detachments. And Napoleon III, in order to suppress the people, formed "garde mobile" detachments from declasse elements. Of the kind, let us observe, of which present-day Moscow is chock full, including people from the so-called "near abroad" countries. Apart from them, various political militants and criminal groupings currently masquerading as security firms are sure to rush in closed ranks into the power structure to which the city authority has given its blessing. In general, there are grounds for concern. Security firms' employees have already been used in 1992 to evict residents of a block on Taganka when it was handed over to the "Khoreks [as transliterated] Center" joint enterprise, in which the city government has a share of the profits. The same year a federation of young law-enforcement clubs tried to seize the Oktyabrskiy Rayon Soviet building by agreement with the Central Administrative District prefect. Security firms have been used many times as "forceful arguments" in disputes over premises. What will the formation of "gardes mobiles" under the prefectures bring? In October 1992 similar internal affairs main administration forces cleared a block in Nagatino of the large families which were occupying it. So it would be better if Mr. Luzhkov did not break the law. He has more than enough power as it is.
