Economists, entrepreneurs and professors participated in the meeting held here in Beijing. Cao Siyuan, who was the first to call for the introduction of the Bankruptcy Law and participated throughout in the process of its drafting, said, "During the period, people's courts at various levels have tried nearly 1,000 bankruptcy cases with more than 400 bankruptcies officially declared. This law has particular significance in the market economy as it can help enterprises adapt to the market and accelerate the establishment of a market-oriented economy in China." According to Cao, there were nearly 100 bankruptcy cases heard by the courts from late 1988 to early 1989, but the number dropped to 32 in the following 12 months. However, in the past few years, with the changes in the economy and business practices, many enterprises that incurred losses and fell into debt turned to the Bankruptcy Law to protect their legal rights and interests. There were only 117 bankruptcy cases in 1991, but as many 428 in 1992. The past four years has witnessed a total of 675 bankruptcy cases. In the first half of 1993, another 273 bankruptcy cases were tried. "This is not a large number compared with the Western countries, which see thousands of companies going bankrupt each month. But it is still a significant number for China, a socialist country which is just starting to run a market-oriented economy," Cao said. Statistics show that around one-third of state-owned enterprises are losing money due to poor management or for other reasons. This is a heavy burden for the government as it has to subsidize these deficit-ridden enterprises with huge sums of money merely to keep them in operation, even though they may incur further losses. Yang Kewen, Director of Beijing Industrial Adjustment Association, revealed that 40 percent of state-owned enterprises in Beijing operated at a loss in the last three quarters of 1993, compared with 33.6 percent in the same period in 1992. "Many of these enterprises should be declared bankrupt to stop further losses. But only a few of them have done so," he said. In China, the word "bankruptcy" carries such negative connotations that many people, including factory directors and government officials, have a preconceived negative attitude towards it. As a result, many businesses refuse to declare bankruptcy. Bian Jingzhai, Law Department Director of the All China Federation of Trade Union, said that the law, good as it is, will be hard to implement if auxiliary measures are not taken to help enforce it. "When an enterprise is declared bankrupt, the workers are out of a job, but the directors and mangers, who are supposed to assume responsibility for the losses, are more often than not shifted to other leading posts. Is this fair?" he said. Bian also mentioned that even some senior engineers are forced to take low pay and engaged in manual work after their enterprises are shut down. Who is going to hire laid-off workers in this tense and competitive market? It is understandable that most workers oppose declaring bankruptcy even though their enterprises are losing money and debt-ridden. He also called for the setting up of labor markets to find jobs for laid-off workers. Experts have called for the creation of a Labor Law, Corporate Law, Enterprise Merger Law and law to insure the unemployed and retired, guarantee their basic living standards and protect their rights. "I hope that in five years the Bankruptcy Law can be repromulgated with no restrictions or conditions and not on a trial basis," Cao said. The following are the amendments to the law proposed by the economists: -- The law should cover all enterprises, not just the state-owned ones, as more and more collectively and privately-owned enterprises, and even Chinese foreign joint ventures, will be involved in bankruptcy cases. -- The conditions of the Bankruptcy Law should be clear and specific, so the words in Article Three of Chapter One "enterprises which, owing to poor operations and management that result in serious losses, are unable to repay the debts that are due shall be declared bankrupt" are amended as follows: "Enterprises unable to pay debts that are due shall be declared bankrupt." -- The amount of time needed for applications and the hearing of bankruptcy cases, which can extend to more than half a year in accordance with the provision of the law, should be shortened so as to enhance efficiency and reduce the losses of both debtors and creditors. -- The formation of a liquidation team should be undertaken according to market principles, namely, the leader of the liquidation team should be chosen and appointed by the people's court from among the experts working in firms that do bankruptcy consultation, law firms and accountancy firms, and not from government officials. The members of the liquidation team should be hired by the team leader and approved by the court. According to the decision made at the just concluded Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of CPC, the government will try to turn some state-owned enterprises into limited liability companies which must shoulder responsibility for their profits or losses, relieving the state of financial responsibility for the business. "Under such circumstance, tens of thousands of debt-ridden, long-term loss-making enterprises in China are expected to apply for bankruptcy. That will make our business very prosperous in the coming years," Cao said. He also explained that China's rejoining the GATT and its integration into the international market economy will inevitably eliminate any obstacle and unfair measures that protect failing enterprises. It makes no sense, in a market economy, to subsidize enterprises that are losing money.
