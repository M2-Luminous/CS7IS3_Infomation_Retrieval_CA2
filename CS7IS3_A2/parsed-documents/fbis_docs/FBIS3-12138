The dailies dedicate their front page headlines to reports on the tragedy. Draped in black, AKHBAR AL-YAWM's headline says "Massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque." In its commentary, the paper says that the goal of the Israeli extremists was to deal a fatal blow to peace. It adds that this massacre should not pass unnoticed; we should pause long over it to ask Israel and the world many questions that need answering: What is meant by preserving security in the Middle East region? Is it Israel's security alone? Where is the Palestinians' security? And is it reasonable to leave the destiny of the honorable Jerusalem in the hands of Israeli extremists who determine who enters it and who gets out, who lives and who dies? AKHBAR AL-YAWM says that every Muslim and Christian in the world must strongly condemn this barbaric crime. The world should not content itself with condemnations; it should seek ways to return holy places to their owners instead of leaving them in the hands of those who cannot protect them and who let armed extremists and crazy persons kill innocent people at dawn, AKHBAR AL-YAWM says. In its editorial, AL-AHRAM says this dreadful massacre is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the Israeli Government. It is not possible to claim that a crazy settler committed it of his own accord. The paper notes that there are precedents that fall into the same category. Israel claimed that the person who set fire to the al- Aqsa Mosque before was mentally unstable, AL-AHRAM says, adding that a number of Palestinian laborers working in Israel were killed a few years back and the Israeli authorities claimed that the murderer was mentally unstable. The paper asks if Palestinian blood has become so cheap that dozens of fasting Palestinians should be killed as they performed dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. Is it reasonable that the Israeli Government's only reaction should be just a statement appealing to Palestinians not to take revenge, the paper asks. AL-AHRAM affirms that Egypt will take a clear-cut stand when the UN Security Council considers this barbaric aggression. AL-JUMHURIYAH's main headline says "The Martyrdom of 61 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque." The paper highlights Egypt's condemnation of this heinous massacre and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's call for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to take the proper measures to protect the Palestinian people. In its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH writes that this massacre will burden the international community with the big responsibility of insuring security for the Palestinian people, who suffer daily as a result of the Israeli occupation practices. The paper adds that this massacre once again emphasizes the need to use fair logic, observe human rights, and implement the international resolutions that call for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and for protecting the Palestinians' right to confront the unheeding, continuous Israeli oppression that goes on with the support and encouragement of the United States, which is keen to supply the Israeli Army with the most sophisticated weapons.
