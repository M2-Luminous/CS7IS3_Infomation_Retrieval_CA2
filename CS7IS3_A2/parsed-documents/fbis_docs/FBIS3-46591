The two sides have not reached a full agreement on access to all seven declared nuclear facilities, they said. The tentative agreement now is to wrap up the working-level negotiations next month and leave the details to talks between North Korea and the IAEA. According to State Department spokesman David Johnson, the talks are closing in on the goal and there will be another contact with North Korea soon. While Johnson reaffirmed that North Korea would have to allow unrestricted inspection of all seven facilities, sources said that though Pyongyang suggested willingness to grant something close to a full inspection it certainly did not clearly agree to routine inspections. One source said the situation resembles a half-filled cup: Some will say it's half full, and others will say it's half empty. Washington negotiators decided that this is close enough to an agreement for unlimited inspection and accepted the North Korean proposal to settle the details directly with the IAEA, according to the sources. In their most recent contact, on Wednesday, the United States and North Korea discussed where North Korea and the IAEA would meet and North Korea proposed Pyongyang. U.S. officials opposed the idea because they would rather see an IAEA inspection go into North Korea after an agreement is clearly reached, the sources said. Washington may agree to announce another round of high-level talks with Pyongyang and suspension of the South Korea-U.S. annual military maneuver "Team Spirit" once an IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang and inter-Korean dialogue resumes, they said. A roughly drawn timetable includes more working-level talks in early January, North Korea-IAEA negotiations in mid-January, an IAEA team's arrival in North Korea and inter-Korean dialogue in late January, and high-level North Korea-U.S. talks sometime in February, the sources said.
