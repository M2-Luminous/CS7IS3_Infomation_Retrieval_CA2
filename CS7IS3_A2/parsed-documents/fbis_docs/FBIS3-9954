[Lula] I am willing to make a political offensive against the Brazilian elite, who have managed the country as if it were their private property, frequently running their private enterprises with state funds. The elite have not fulfilled the duties of the state. The elite are collapsing and the PT is not in the government. They are collapsing because of their incompetence. [Lessa] What is your proposal? [Lula] We will implement a policy to end elites. We will implement an income distribution policy. I don't want entrepreneurs to become Marxist but Fordist. I want them to understand that by paying higher salaries, the workers will buy what they produce. Just imagine if workers could afford to buy cars, television sets, chicken, clothes. Our country would be much more civilized. Entrepreneurs do not have that mentality. Their mentality is one of high concentration. They sell the idea that the world will end tomorrow and they want to make all the money today. [Lessa] Then, you want to improve capitalism in Brazil, instead of implementing Socialism, right? [Lula] That is exactly what I am willing to do. At no time has the PT program been presented as a socialist program. The socialist part of it is the strategic program, the dream, the utopia. We are making a program for five, 10, or 15 years, to meet people's basic, vital needs. [Lessa] How will you cope with the division within the PT? [Lula] The press sees one PT, but there is another PT, which is the one I lead. The voting on the moratorium and on the minimum income took place during peaceful sessions of the national party executive board. Yet the press did not notice it. What they want is to depict a war within the PT, a war that does not exist. May God permit the existence of two or more different opinions within the PT. I do not want a party with just one single opinion. [Lessa] But party bloc members have been forbidden to vote on the Constitutional amendment. They are being constrained. [Lula] How many things have I already been forced to do while under constraint?! I had to expel a PT deputy although I was against doing it. This is no political constraint; it is the case of one deputy or another who might be more euphoric about participating in the amendment of the Constitution. The majority of bloc members see this as something normal. Disagreement within the PT is normal. If it had been war, do you think I would have been touring the country, leaving the party bloc alone? I would have stayed in Brasilia. The party will participate in the amendment of the Constitution at the time it feels it should. We do not want to endorse a policy of summary voting, which has been instituted by Deputy Nelson Jobim and the conservative wing. [passage omitted]
