A demonstration plant, which was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered sludge, was operated at the condition of high temperature and high pressure (300�C, 10 MPa). As a result, about a half of organic materials in sludge (48%maf) were converted into heavy oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized (11%maf) were separated from the reaction mixture by high pressure distillation. Heating values of the heavy oils distilled were 37-39 MJ/kg. From the calculation of energy balance on a practical scale, it was estimated that 1.5 t/d of separated heavy oil could be produced as surplus energy through the treatment of 60 t/d of dewatered sewage sludge. Introduction In Japan most of sewage sludge has been treated by incineration. However, the costs of conventional incineration methods are high because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop economical solutions to the sludge disposal problem, and one of these may be a direct thermochemical liquefaction. American researchers have developed the direct thermochemical liquefaction of organic wastes, including urban refuse, agricultural wastes and sewage sludge, with synthesis gas and catalyst.[.sup]1[/] The direct thermochemical liquefaction of sewage sludge without reducing agent[.sup]2[/] and methodology of oil separation from liquefied sewage sludge[.sup]3[/] have been reported. The authors have investigated the liquefaction of sewage sludge under pressurized inert gas around 300�C and tested a pilot-plant (0.5 t/d).[.sup]4-6[/] Based on previous studies, a demonstration plant of sludge liquefaction was designed and constructed. Experimental A demonstration plant is schematically shown in Figure 1. This plant was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered sludge, equivalent to the sewage treatment scale for about 20,000 people. In this plant, the dewatered sludge was liquefied and distilled under the condition of high temperature and high pressure. The sludge was charged into the injection tank, which involved the piston in itself, by sludge pump. Then, the sludge was pressurized by high pressure water and conveyed into the reactor (indiameter 0.43 m, height 7.25 m) continuously by using two of the injection tanks by turns. The sludge was pre-heated by the vapor of the distillate product at the lower part of the reactor and heated to a given reaction temperature by the heat medium from electric boiler at the upper part of the reactor. The pressure in the reactor was kept at a given reaction pressure, which was set near the saturated vapor pressure of water at the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture, which was almost like a liquid, was distilled while high temperature and high pressure was maintained. The distillate and the reaction gas was cooled down at the cooler and depressurized to atmospheric pressure by let-down valve 1. The distillation residue was also depressurized through let-down valve 2 and flashed into the flash tank. The vapor sprung in the flash tank was condensed at the condenser and was recovered (condensate product). The bottom products were also obtained from the bottom of the flash tank. Figure 1. Schematic Flowsheet of the Demonstration Plant Each product recovered (distillate, condensate, and bottom) was separated into three phases, that is, heavy oil, solid residue, and aqueous phase by means of a solvent extraction. The procedure of the separation is indicated in Figure 2. In this work, the definition of heavy oil is dichloromethane soluble material. Figure 2. Separation Procedure of the Product Operating conditions and profile of starting materials are listed in Table 1. Distillate ratio was defined by equation (1). Distillate ratio (-) = mass flow rate of the distillate/mass flow rate of the sludge (1) Table 1. Operating Conditions and Starting Materials Run No. Operating conditions Starting materials S. F R.

S: Volatile solid Raw mixed sludge (a mixture of raw primary sludge and raw waste activated sludge) was used as a starting material. These sludges had been dewatered by a belt press dehydrator after adding a polyelectrolyte coagulant. The term ``volatile solid'' means the content of organic material. Results and Discussion Table 2 shows the organic material yields in Run 930219. Organic material yield was defined by equation (2). Organic material yield (%) = weight of organic material in each phase/weight of organic material in the sludge x 100 (2) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Solid residue was hardly contained in the distillate. This result means that about a half of organic materials in sludge were converted into the heavy oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized could be separated into the distillate without a contamination of solid residue. The composition of reaction gas was mainly carbon dioxide (above 99 wt%). Figure 3 shows the relationship between distillate ratio and distillable heavy oil yield. Distillable heavy oil yield increased with distillate ratio. However, the increase of distillate ratio may cause a plugging of the distillation residue in the pipe. It was supposed that upper limit of distillate ratio was 0.5. Figure 3. Relationship Between Distillate Ratio and Distillable Heavy Oil Yield The heating values of the heavy oils are given in Table 3. The heating values of the heavy oils in the distillate indicated higher than those in the bottom. In other words, the heavy oil of superior quality could selectively be separated by distillation from components of heavy oils. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

The results are illustrated in Figure 4. The capacity of the plant in this estimation is 60 t/d as dewatered sludge, equivalent to the sewage treatment scale for about 200,000 people. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the sludge is treated without any auxiliary fuel. Furthermore, 1.5 tons of heavy oil are produced as surplus energy. This heavy oil can be available for boiler fuel or another application. In conclusion, the treatment of sewage sludge by this method could be sufficiently profitable. Figure 4.
