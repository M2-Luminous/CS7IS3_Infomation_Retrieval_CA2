Aldrich Ames' Arrest in the United States May Become the Biggest Spy Scandal of Recent Years"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our Commentary Do you remember Shtirlits [allusion to master spy figure from Russian fiction] baking potatoes in the fire 23 February? Really, we do not know what Aldrich Ames was intending to do that day, and we must not get ahead of the court investigation. But it is already possible to examine the outline of the preceding and imminent events. In January, speaking in Congress, CIA Director J. Woolsey presented a tough program of spying activity in Russia -- in four spheres. The boss is famous for the fact that during the whole of last year he had put pressure on U.S. legislators in an effort to secure something unprecedented: Despite the "political love affair" between America and Russia following the end of the Cold War, to not only keep appropriations for intelligence at the previous level, but even to snatch another 10 million or so, Woolsey worried the legislators into doing something -- last year, he appeared in Congress 153 times! But, in all sincerity, what can be the best confirmation of being right than a sensational story about the sale of secrets to the Russians? And it is not that important what Shtirlits or Myuller [name as transliterated, allusion unknown] will turn out to be. The main thing is the therapeutic effect. And, incidentally, its consequences. And these can already be seen. "Those who think that the Russians are doing 180 degree pirouettes and are becoming our closest allies are wrong," Dan Glickman, chairman of the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence at Congress, said yesterday. And although White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers avoided answering the question of whether a reassessment of U.S. attitudes is not imminent in connection with the Ames affair, recalling that the spying activity began in 1985, "that is, in a fundamentally different historical period," CNN and CBC, citing sources in the administration, claim: "Russia will be allowed to send home its diplomats who collaborated with Ames on a voluntary basis. They will not be deported." We did not manage to get in touch with Yevgeniy Primakov, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director. He went to Bratislava on Tuesday for a meeting with his Slovak colleagues. So it was Yuriy Kobaladze, leader of the Foreign Intelligence Service press service, who commented on the fact of the Ames' arrest for us. Or rather, he justly recalled there is not a single intelligence service in the world which comments on cases of the involvement of specific invidivuals in its network of agents. And then he recommended that we should turn to the CIA or the FBI for information about what deeds Ames had done in the United States. All U.S. journalists received the same recommendations when they besieged the "public" subdivision of the "secret" organ on Wednesday. Behind the restraint of the Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman, there doubtless lies a calm reaction, which his colleagues on the other side of the ocean would do well to learn from. According to certain specialists in the intelligence sphere, to launch a spy-mania campaign instead of calmly dealing with their unexpected failures is just bad form. Ultimately, they believe, we are not doing anything that the Americans would not allow themselves to do in Moscow. This latest case graphically demonstrates that relations between the intelligence services of great powers cannot be entirely "gentlemanly." Of course, the Americans should have a clearer idea of whom they should arrest and whom they should not arrest in their own country. But among a number of other reasons, the fact that our counterintelligence not so long ago arrested a fairly high-ranking Russian official working for the CIA, as we found out, was not the least important reason. Imagine that the Ameses really did work for the USSR. This means that the practice of a "tit for tat" response, usual in such cases, came into effect. Let us also recall that the "affair" came out at a time when Russia stunned the world with a specific initiative on Bosnia -- which the United States did not like at all, being accustomed to profiting from the amorphousness of our diplomacy over many years now, and constantly trying, little by little, to squeeze us out of the process of the adoption of major foreign policy decisions still further. And suddenly, success, a resolute stance, and the chief role in the Bosnian spectacle, which had been played out for many months according to the West's musical score. What disappointment for Washington, used to putting our Foreign Ministry in its own pocket! Finally, if the Ameses do nevertheless turn out to be the people they are represented as today, then let us congratulate not only our diplomats, but also our intelligence service. And, incidentally, ourselves: It turns out that we are not paying it money for nothing for its activity. The money is not being wasted. Somehow we forget about this when we excitedly interview the deserters and betrayers who figure in our press, if not as martyrs to the cause of democracy, then at least as entrepreneurs in the "free market of state secrets."
