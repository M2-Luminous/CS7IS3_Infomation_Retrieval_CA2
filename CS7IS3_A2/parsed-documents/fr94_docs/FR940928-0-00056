FR940928-0-00056 FR940928-0-00019 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Part 430 of Chapter II of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as set forth below. PART 430_ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS 1. The authority citation for part 430 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6291&hyph;6309. 2. Section 430.2 is amended by adding paragraphs (15) and (16) in the definition ``Basic model''; adding definitions for ``Lamp Efficacy,'' ``Fluorescent Lamp,'' ``General Service Fluorescent Lamp,'' ``Incandescent Lamp,'' ``General Service Incandescent Lamp,'' ``Color Rendering Index,'' ``Cold Temperature Fluorescent Lamp,'' and ``Medium Base Compact Fluorescent Lamp,'' in alphabetical order and revising the definition of ``Act'' to read as follows: §430.2 Definitions. * * * * * Act means the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;163), as amended by the National Energy Policy Conservation Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;619), the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;12), the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;357), and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486). * * * * * Basic Model * * * * * (15) With respect to general service fluorescent lamps which have photometric and electrical characteristics, including lumens per watt and Color Rendering Index (CRI) which are essentially identical, and which do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption. (16) With respect to general service incandescent lamps which have photometric and electrical characteristics, including lumens per watt, which are essentially identical, and which do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption. * * * * * Cold Temperature Fluorescent Lamp means a fluorescent lamp specifically designed to start at -20 ○F when used with a ballast conforming to the requirements of American National Standards Institute standard C78.1. Color Rendering Index or CRI means the measured degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by a light source as compared with the color of those same objects when illuminated by a reference source of comparable color temperature. * * * * * Fluorescent Lamp means a low pressure mercury electric-discharge source in which a fluorescing coating transforms some of the ultraviolet energy generated by the mercury discharge into light, including the following: (1) Any straight-shaped lamp (commonly referred to as 4-foot medium bi-pin lamps) with medium bi-pin bases of nominal overall length of 48 inches and rated wattage of 28 or more. (2) Any U-shaped lamp (commonly referred to as 2-foot U-shaped lamps) with medium bi-pin bases of nominal overall length between 22 and 25 inches and rated wattage of 28 or more. (3) Any rapid start lamp (commonly referred to as 8-foot high output lamps) with recessed double contact bases of nominal overall length of 96 inches and 0.800 nominal amperes, as defined in ANSI C78.1&hyph;1991. (See Incorporation by Reference §430.22(a)) (4) Any instant start lamp (commonly referred to as 8-foot slimline lamps) with single pin bases of nominal overall length of 96 inches and rated wattage of 52 or more, as defined in ANSI C78.3&hyph;1991. (See Incorporation by Reference §430.22(a)) * * * * * General Service Fluorescent Lamp means any fluorescent lamp which can be used to satisfy the majority of fluorescent lighting applications, but does not include any lamp designed and marketed for the following nongeneral applications: (1) Fluorescent lamps designed to promote plant growth. (2) Fluorescent lamps specifically designed for cold temperature applications. (3) Colored fluorescent lamps. (4) Impact-resistant fluorescent lamps. (5) Reflectorized or aperture lamps. (6) Fluorescent lamps designed for use in reprographic equipment. (7) Lamps primarily designed to produce radiation in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. (8) Lamps with a Color Rendering Index of 82 or greater. General Service Incandescent Lamp means any incandescent lamp (other than a miniature or photographic lamp) that has an E26 medium screw base, a rated voltage range at least partially within 115 to 130 volts, and which can be used to satisfy the majority of lighting applications, but does not include any lamps specifically designed for:
