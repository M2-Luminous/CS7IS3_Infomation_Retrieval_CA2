In conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent he described how he was arrested. "A few minutes before the start of a collegium session an unfamiliar man entered my work office and, referring to the fact that he had suffered at the time of the Chernobyl tragedy, demanded that I issue a license to trade in alcoholic beverages. I did not even have time to tell him to whom and where it is necessary to apply in such cases, before a second stranger burst into the room and placed a pile of dollars on the table. `This is a bribe,' he explained, and left equally suddenly. Without touching the money, I at once asked my assistant over the intercom to detain the rogues, but militia personnel had already entered the office and ordered me not to move. You would have to be very naive not to see an obvious provocation in what happened. There can be no doubt that the `cooperators' were agents of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But I still cannot understand who needed to make precisely myself the hero of such a comedy or why. I am simply obliged to see this matter through to the end, and I expect answers to all my questions." It would, of course, be a great exaggeration to allege that ministers are jailed in Armenia almost every week. At the same time the official authorities make no comment at all on such happenings, even the most recent. In the conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent the trade minister found it hard to explain why the government, of which he is a member, did not issue an appropriate statement right after his arrest and still continues to maintain silence. Meanwhile, as Armenia's general prosecutor declared, the minister was arrested without his approval, and there are no grounds for charging Tigran Grigoryan. An investigation is still continuing, however, and this alone will be able to dot all the "i's." But for the time being people will go on whispering for a long time behind the back of the minister, who has been defamed before the whole world.
