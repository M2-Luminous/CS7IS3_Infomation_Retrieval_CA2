Dhlakama said that Frelimo is carrying out efforts to bolster the capacity of militiamen and the Rapid Intervention Police. Speaking to journalists on his arrival in Chimoio yesterday, President Joaquim Chissano said Frelimo is not bothered about the training of the new nonpartisan Mozambican army. He said this is evidenced by the failure to create the necessary conditions in the training centers. [Begin Dhlakama recording] That is normal. That is normal. The Mozambican Government is not giving emphasis to this very important process. As you are aware, the barracks, the training camps have not been rehabilitated. The process is very much behind schedule. Instead of giving emphasis to the training of a nonpartisan national army, Frelimo is carrying out efforts to bolster the capacity of militiamen and the Rapid Intervention Police. It is infiltrating troops into the Mozambican police. This is a lamentable situation. All the same, I believe that we will be able to exercise our influence. [end recording] The Renamo leader said the demobilization process is currently experiencing difficulties because the government is not interested in seeing things move smoothly in order to boycott the elections scheduled for October this year. [sentence as heard] Meanwhile, today, the second day of his visit to Manica Province, President Afonso Dhlakama will carry out internal work with his party members, and this evening he will have a meeting with businessmen in the province. According to his working program, he will leave tomorrow for Gondola District, and he will then visit the Manica Provincial Hospital and some companies in Chimoio. He will also hold a meeting with his party's technical cadres stationed here in Manica. Yesterday the Renamo leader was honored with a friendly dinner on the occasion of his visit to Manica Province.
