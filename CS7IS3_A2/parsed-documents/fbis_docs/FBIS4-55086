Is your visit to Sarajevo linked with the outcome of the talks? [Tudjman] I believe that the two delegations will reach an agreement on the implementation of the Washington agreement. My visit to Sarajevo does not depend [Tudjman laughs] on the Vienna talks. It depends on technical reasons. As you know, I am ready and I was ready to go but this depends on UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and other factors. [Al-Isa] Nada Al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio-Television. Mr. President, Croatian press has carried a statement by Kresimir Zubak [Bosnian Croat leader] in Vienna. I am confused by what Mr. Zubak said: That Mostar will be the most difficult issue as far as borders between cantons are concerned. I am asking you this because so far Mostar was supposed to be under EU administration as a single city. [Tudjman] I do not know about this statement by Zubak. Of course Mostar should be under EU administration, but it should also be the capital of the Herzegovina canton, i.e., of the grand county of Herzegovina. This is probably being discussed now and I believe that the delegations will reach an agreement. [Rexepi] Adrijana Rexepi, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, in an interview for Pristina's ZERI, Josip Manolic, the chairman of the Chamber of Counties, commented on a statement you made three years ago that Kosovo was Serbia's internal problem. Manolic said that this was part of a deal you made with President Milosevic and that since then Albanians in Croatia could not regulate their documents and their status. Can you tell us what all this is really about? [Tudjman] It is about a basic principle according to which the status of all ethnic groups in certain states should be solved within those states in line with international conventions. Nothing else is involved. [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, the situation near Brcko is very tense. What is your prediction? Is this area really going to be decisive for the war in Bosnia? [Tudjman] Yes, the situation around Brcko does give cause for genuine concern. But in view of the open involvement by the international community, including the United Nations, I believe that the complications of war [zapetljaji rata] will be avoided. This is, however, not totally certain but I personally expect that if the Serb forces launch their offensive the international community and the United Nations will respond in a more resolute way than has been the case so far. [Baratez] Mr. President, Zeljko Baratez, GLAS SLAVONIJE: Is Croatia going to do something to stop the further export of oil from Djeletovci [Serb-held oil field in eastern Slavonija] and to prevent the aggressor from destroying the evidence of his crimes in eastern Slavonija? We know that they have been filling up mass graves with soil and taking bones elsewhere. Thank you. [Tudjman] Croatia will continue to place firmer demands before the international community on the way UN Security Council resolutions should be implemented unless the Serb side shows readiness to adhere to the agreement on normalizing relations, normalizing Croat-Serb relations within Croatia and on normalizing relations between Croatia and Serbia. In other words, if there is no sign of their readiness -- and so far we have unfortunately had no such signs -- Croatia will understandably take steps at a diplomatic level and elsewhere to ensure that the issues you raised are tackled and that there is a speedy integration into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia of the Croatian areas now under the protection of the peace forces, or rather under Serbian occupation. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, how do you comment on parliamentary events and what will happen at the forthcoming session? Will Mesic and Manolic resign and who will replace them? [Tudjman] One thing should be clear about the events in parliament. Attempts by those who wanted to create a parliamentary and a constitutional crisis failed. This was the goal of Mesic and Manolic when they formed their new party. The Croatian Democratic Union remains a majority party, with an absolute majority in both chambers of parliament. It can be expected that this so-called parliamentary crisis will be solved in a democratic, parliamentary manner. Croatia is organized as a state with a multiparty parliament, and according to all parliamentary and multiparty principles the chairmen of the chambers [Mesic and Manolic] must be from the ranks of the party that has the majority in parliament. It is normal to expect Mesic and Manolic to accept the democratic principles and that an agreement will be reached through a parliamentary debate between party representatives. This should be solved in a parliamentary, democratic, civilized manner and, of course, if this should not be the case the majority party can make certain changes in line with the Constitution -- changes that serve to preserve a democratic, parliamentary system. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the kuna [new Croatian currency] be introduced on the occasion of Statehood Day [30 May], and can you tell us more about the name kuna [marten]? Many say that that was the name of the currency used during the NDH [Neovisna Drzava Hrvatska -- Independent State of Croatia during World War II] and stress its' association with the then Fascist regime. Mr. Manolic even said: Why not call it the zec [rabbit] or the lisica [fox]? [Tudjman, laughing] Well, I honestly have neither read about nor heard that piece of witticism. I know that when we discussed the name of the Croatian currency there were people who were against it. However, following the very serious debate we had in both political and scientific circles we decided to give the name kuna to the Croatian currency. Why? Well, because the animal was used for payments in kind from the 11th century. If I am not mistaken, the name kuna was first mentioned in documents as a means of payment in kind in 1018. It was used throughout Croatia, and not just in Slavonia but right down to the island of Cres. Also, another point: Marten was used as the means of payment in kind in a large part of the world, from Russia to Canada. Marten was not just used for payments in kind but also as a currency. There are documents that indicate that in the 13th century the fur of one marten was equal to 10 dinars. In addition, the majority of European currency names, such as the Latin currency and the English pound, the German mark, and the Italian and French currencies date back to barter trade. So, by naming our currency after what was used in Croatia as means of payment in kind we are merely following the European tradition in naming national currencies. Such a statement -- that the currency should be called the zec or the lisica -- is slightly surprising, and dare I say frightening -- coming as it did from people who frequently appear on the political scene, since these names have no historical background while the name kuna has. It is even more surprising that statements against the kuna have come from university professors. In other words, kuna [the animal] was not just a means of payment in kind but was also depicted on Croatian money during the Croatian-Hungarian union, on its coins. The kuna is on the coat of arms of one of the three Croatian kingdoms, i.e. of the kingdom of Slavonia -- there is a kuna on the coat of arms of the kingdom of Slavonia. At some stage in history the kingdom of Slavonia was synonymous with Croatia. Consequently, linking the kuna only with the NDH is not wise at all. On the contrary, it shows petty politics and an attempt to discredit the Croatian democratic authorities. Speaking about that, we should remember that after its establishment in 1939, the Province of Croatia [Croatian part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia] also wanted to introduce a Croatian currency and planned to call it kuna. Artist Kerbic made prototypes of the currency called kuna or banica, but all this did not happen because the then Croatian political authorities were not sovereign, and there were conflicts about the currency issue. When we discussed the problem of naming the new Croatian currency we considered all that. We considered the tendency in Europe and Croatia to develop the names of national currencies. We concluded that there was no reason why nowadays, when we have an independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatian state...[pauses] that today we can give the Croatian currency the name that has the greatest tradition in Croatia as a means of payment both in kind and as a currency. The fact that the name was in use during the Second World War in a Quisling regime that functioned within Hitler's new European order -- other European countries now also have currencies that they had before, during the Second World War. When we created the independent sovereign Croatia, we wanted finally to give the right name to the Croatian national currency. All the more so because that name is very easy to pronounce here and abroad and because it is unique. There is no name similar to that. When for a while we considered the name kruna [crown], we concluded that we are not a kingdom -- after the loss of the medieval kingdom we had no independent Croatian kingdom -- and that there are many currencies called kruna in Europe -- Czech, Norwegian, Swedish, and all sorts of krunas in Europe. The kuna will be the unique Croatian currency. Consequently, all historic and political reasons were in favor of the name kuna. We thus displayed political and national maturity, and the determination to defend our historic traditions and the interests of the sovereignty of the Croatian nation. Academician Brozovic is preparing a special monograph on that issue -- I think it will be published soon. All this will be explained. I believe that we can be happy and proud that we are introducing a new Croatian currency along our true traditions, and also in line with the tradition of naming national currencies in European countries. [Segoje] Zvonimir Segoje, Hrvatski Vjesnik, Vinkovci and Zadar. When the war ends with Serbia's military defeat, Serbia will have to pay reparations. It is obvious that they [the Serbs] will not be able to pay. Serbia set an example [of getting reparations paid in some other way] when it got the area of Stubica from Bulgaria after the First World War, instead of the reparations. We respect the post-Second-World-War borders, whereby the historic Srijem and Boka Kotorska are outside of Croatia. Will we ask for Srijem, Boka Kotorska, and perhaps a part of Backa instead of the reparations? [Tudjman] The reparations would certainly be justified for historic and other reasons. But, we also must bear in mind that we are living in a different world today. We are living in a world where the new order that is being created does not accept violent changes of state borders. This world wants to secure, within existing states, national rights for other nations and national minorities. I am afraid that we would not get any support for such demands in the present democratic world, that we could cause unwanted consequences. But, Croatia will certainly bear in mind the destruction that was done, it will bear in mind its rights and will set some demands before the international community, which we think are justified and for which Croatia could get support from the international community in which we have to live. [Unidentified correspondent] I presume that you know what is happening at the Vienna talks. It has been reported that some kind of result will be achieved by 1400. Can you confirm this, and is it true that the issue of who will be the president of Bosnia in the first 12 months is an obstacle for the talks? [Tudjman] I believe that the delegations will find a solution, as I have said. As far as the main issues regarding the setting up of the federation and the confederation [of Bosnia and Croatia], the issue of who will get the top posts, should not be vital. However, what is vital is to immediately start implementing the principles we have agreed upon at the talks we have had so far, including the Washington agreement we signed. This agreement says that the prime minister and the president of the federation cannot belong to the same nation in the same term. Therefore, the Croats are not making any exclusive demands. The Croatian delegation just wants the agreement -- the agreement that was reached under the auspices of the United States and the international community, they want the agreement and its implementation to be respected. I believe -- and as far as I know from the reports last night -- I believe that the agreement has been reached. [Heinrich] President Tudjman, I am Mark Heinrich from REUTER. Can you tell us, according to your information, how many deputies from the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] have joined the new party set up by Mesic and Manolic, and do you think that more deputies will change party ranks? [Tudjman] According to evidence so far, of 85 HDZ deputies in the Chamber of Deputies, seven joined Mesic and Manolic. Therefore, that does not bring into question the absolute majority of the HDZ in the Croatian Parliament. According to parliamentary principles, even the party that has a relative, rather than an absolute majority, has the right to appoint the presidents of the assembly chambers, that is, to have proportional influence in the parliament. Consequently, precisely because we cannot even speak about a rift in the majority party, but only about the departure of several deputies, I think that the changes caused by this will be dealt with at the next session in a normal, democratic way. As I said before, I expect -- and there are indications that an agreement will be reached between the heads of parliamentary delegations in the Assembly, and that this will be carried out in the usual parliamentary fashion. After all, those gentlemen always invoke democracy and democratic principles, so we can expect that they will abide by those principles. All the more so because we live at a time -- you raised the question of a possible war around Brcko, so it is possible that the situation will further deteriorate in that area -- when we need a stable constitutional and political system in Croatia. The question inevitably arises as to who would need the destabilization of the democratic Croatia, the destabilization of the Croatia that the world, Europe, the United States, and the international community need as a stable country. Therefore, I expect that in this context this problem will be solved in a normal democratic way. [Modric] Sanja Modric, Novi List. Mr. President, this year you took part in the 1 May celebrations in the Maksimir park, which was very well received by the people. Do you perhaps intend to take part in the celebration of [the anniversary] 9 May at the Square of the Croatian Great today, organized by several associations of citizens? [Tudjman] No, I personally will not be there. But, my participation in Maksimir was not a gesture of particular importance, I have been to Maksimir before. That was the Labor Day of all citizens of the world, and also of Croatian citizens. I am, of course, the president of all Croats and all [Croatian] citizens, regardless of their party allegiance. Croatia will continue to function this way in future. [Correspondent] [name indistinct], HTV [Croatian TV]. I would like to refer back to the Square of the Croatian Great. Recently there has been an increasing number of demands to change the name of the square back to its original name -- the Square of the Victims of Fascism. Can you give us your comment on this? [Tudjman] Well, such demands have also reached me. It is interesting that they were linked with the problem of the kuna, which I have already mentioned. No, the Square of the Croatian Great will not be renamed again to the Square of the Victim of Fascism, because we created the democratic modern Croatia on the reconciliation of the divided Croats. If we had left the Square of the Victims of Fascism we would have had to rename one of the main Zagreb squares the Square of Victims of Communism -- because there were no fewer victims of Communism than of Fascism in Croatia. Let us build our democratic Croatia on the tradition of both anti-Fascism, the Croatian anti-Fascism -- for Croatia gave a larger contribution to the anti-Fascist struggle in the Second World War than any other peoples of the former Yugoslavia...[pauses] But Communism also inflicted a large number of victims on Croatia. We were trying to bring together the divided, opposed Croats, and through this reconciliation we created a democratic, modern Croatia -- and we will continue with such a policy, and not divide the people with some squares of the victims of Fascism and Communism etc. I have also personally recommended to the mayor of Zagreb to call Dotrscina -- an area where Croatian anti-Fascists were indeed killed -- the Square or the Field of the Victims of Fascism. On the day of our statehood we will inaugurate the monument, or rather the Altar of the Croatian Homeland in Medvedgrad. This will be a location where we will pay our respects to all the victims from our history, regardless of which side they were on when they died for Croatia, Croatian freedom, the Croatian homeland. [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. We have often mentioned the Vienna agreement here. We have said nothing about the agreements -- which were set in motion and then stalled, stalled quite seriously -- between Croatia and representatives of Serbs from the so-called Krajinas. Instead we have witnessed situations in which the Croatian Army has fully complied with the signed agreements and has withdrawn but the refugees have not returned. There is no chance of them returning in the near future. What is the obstacle that stalled these negotiations? To what extent will they be affected by the latest situation in parliament and those negotiators who have been criticized by the public? What is the latest situation? What kind of hope can refugees have in the light of the current situation? [Tudjman] The latest development is the fact that instead of implementing the agreement on normalization and the Serb side's political promises that it would embark on normalization, it has hardened its' positions to the effect that Krajina is something special and that it will no longer be returning to Croatia. This is a truly new development. We do take this into account. This hardening position has probably emerged in parallel with the hardening positions in Bosnia, that is with the open and escalating questions in Croatia's occupied areas for as long as the Bosnian question remains unsolved. [sentence as heard] We have made it clear, we are still making it clear, both to the Serbian side and the international community, that we remain committed to the principle of necessary normalization in relations, to the need for and the feasibility of a political solution. We are, however, not going to tolerate delays in resolving the incorporation of the Croatian territories protected by the peace force, i.e. under Serbian occupation. We must start resolving the problem of enabling the refugees to return. If we do not succeed in implementing this agreement on normalization with the Serbian side with the help of the United Nations and the international community, then we will have, on our part, to take every step in order to secure the return of refugees and the incorporation of this area into Croatia. Our public, as well as the Serbian side and the international public must rest assured that we will do so. As far as this question is concerned we will, of course, bear in mind the question whether those who have negotiated so far have fully carried out their task, whether they are trusted by the public, as you put it. In any case I have already decided that Djordje Pribicevic should take part in the negotiations, i.e. take part in the team. It remains to be seen whether there will be any other problems. [Ramljak] Is there any chance of people who are real refugees being directly included in the negotiating team? Perhaps, someone who is a member of the refugee community. [Tudjman] If this were purposeful, we could indeed do so. Let us be realistic, though, in this respect. Someone from the ranks of refugees might represent the interests and views of his own area. One should instead resolve these problems as a whole. It has turned out that it is impossible to have a large number of negotiators because it is impossible to find solutions. Understandably, yes, if this were purposeful, if we found such a justifiable suggestion accepted by me and the Croatian Government. [Ramljak] Excuse me once again, I would like to ask something in connection with the last question. Mr. Mikelic speaks about a new territorial organization of Krajinas. Mr. Martic says that they will defend the Posavina corridor. Mr. Prijic says that the line of separation is practically a state border. Mikelic says that they have started an economic recovery in Krajina. Will the Croatian side take some concrete steps if the Serbs move from words to deeds? [Tudjman] I think I answered all your questions a minute ago. Of course, we must take into consideration these irresponsible -- not to say anything worse -- statements by representatives of the Knin Serbs. We have pointed out to the international community that the problem is in Belgrade, that this is Belgrade's occupation -- a Serb, a Yugoslav occupation -- of those areas, because they provide them not only with money and documents which state that Knin is part of Serbia, but also with weapons and so on. In that respect, we will take all measures -- both through the international community and internally -- to bring such behavior to an end. I repeat, if we fail to achieve a political solution within the framework of the agreement on normalization and clear statements of all international factors -- from UN Security Council resolutions to statements by representatives of the world's most important powers from the United States, China, and even Russia which recognize Croatia's territorial integrity -- then, naturally, Croatia will have to take different steps. But, of course, then we will have -- I hope -- the political support of the international public, which is not ready to accept an armed liberation of those areas prior to all political options being exhausted. [Correspondent] [Name indistinct], VECERNJI LIST. You have said that seven deputies would follow Manolic and Mesic. You have recently said that about 1 percent of the HDZ would leave with them. Do you still think the same? [Tudjman] Yes, I do. It is obvious that a bit more than 1 percent of deputies have left. I still say that not more than 1 percent of the HDZ members will leave. In turn, a significantly larger number will join the HDZ. This is already happening in all counties, and in the diaspora. We have received hundreds of cables and letters of support for the central HDZ policies and the state policy. These messages say that their [Mesic's, Manolic's] departure will in fact strengthen the HDZ, its central policy adopted at the second HDZ assembly. Among hundreds and hundreds of letters, only one was against [the central HDZ policies]. You know what it says, what he [the author] finds important! He says: As a HDZ member I also join Manolic and Mesic because I cannot accept the decisions of the second HDZ assembly, because I cannot accept the new name of the Croatian currency, and because I disagree that God Save Croatia should be the HDZ anthem. So these are the reasons then [Tudjman laughs] why this single one among hundreds of letters agrees with Mr. Manolic. I believe that these hundreds of letters reflect the general mood, not among hundreds but among thousands and tens of thousands of HDZ members and among those who are not its members. All this indicates that the HDZ, as the central democratic Croatian party, will continue to gain strength. [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, last week the United Nations explicitly called -- for the first time -- on the Bosnian Army to steer clear of the corridor. They called on both the Serbs and the Bosnian Army to steer clear of the Brcko area. It is a fact that the corridor is vital for the Serbs as it links the occupied areas of Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia proper. It is also a fact that there have been difficulties and problems in the talks between Croatia and Serbia and Croatia's Serbs. What is your comment on this move? Does this amount to the creation of some new UNPA [UN protected area] zone in Bosnia? [Tudjman] I believe that, having experienced all their bitter lessons in seeking a solution to the Bosnian crisis, international factors have drawn the conclusion that neither side should be allowed to spread the war. After all, the Croat-Muslim agreement on cooperation, on the federation and confederation, was reached under international supervision so as to restore peace as soon as possible rather than to prolong the war. Hence, what you have pointed out should be seen from this point of view -- the international community will try to prevent the war from spreading. In Bosnia itself there is a threat of complications on a wider international scale. [Kuzmanovic] As regards the threat of the war spreading -- does this in a sense cement their [Serb] gains if they can keep this corridor as a protected zone? [Tudjman] No, this does not cement the corridor because the international community will not let the Serbs keep all 70 percent, they [Serbs] even say that they hold as much as 73 percent of Bosnian territory. Things have been made clear -- agreements are being sought on the basis of the agreements hitherto reached within the Geneva Conference to the effect that the current Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation should get 51 percent and the Serbs 49 percent. Given the agreement on the federation and confederation, not only is this waiting in the wings, but the responsible diplomats taking part in this conference are saying that the Serbs should pay slightly more than this for a solution. Consequently, by no means will the international community accept such a territorial solution that will correspond with today's real situation. [Veric] Luka Veric. Mr. President, it is a fact that many Croatian citizens are leaving the country. Many of them are educated young people. A number of ethnic Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina are also leaving the country. What is Croatia doing to stop this? Is there any interest in this? Some people say that we are talking about worrying numbers of people leaving. Thank you. [Tudjman] We could say that we should worry about it, but I believe that we are not talking about such large numbers. Croats are leaving for foreign countries, and young people as well, as a result of the war evils that we have experienced, the occupation of one quarter of the Croatian territory, and of everything that the war imposed on us. Even in normal conditions, insufficiently developed countries cannot prevent the so-called brain-drain into the more developed countries of the world. In Croatian conditions, in such war conditions, both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this was an inevitable consequence. But at the same time young people are coming back to the homeland despite the conditions. I have had a report of some 100 young people returning. With the creation of a democratic Croatia and the economic reforms, with the curbing of inflation -- we have already begun the positive process, not only of attracting investment from the diaspora and from foreign countries, but also of having Croatian people return to the homeland. We see such cases on a daily basis. The democratic Croatian authorities must certainly do their utmost to stimulate this process as much as possible. When the war ends and the problems are resolved, and agreements are reached -- like the ones with the United States and the one that the prime minister signed in Iran and with some other countries -- through the development of political and economic relations we will create increasingly favorable conditions to stop our people leaving and, on the contrary, to have them return to us. [Unidentified correspondent] The allocation of socially-owned apartments to high-ranking state officials has caused a lot of negative reaction. What do you think about this? [Tudjman] Yes, there are well-justified examples of some objections raised as regards this, but there is also a lot of political scheming here, and also -- and many people would not be aware of this -- a lot of political-psychological warfare against a sovereign Croatia. What are we talking about here? We are for a transformation from the socialist-type social ownership of apartments into private ownership, so that people have the right to buy apartments. The right to buy has been given to those who had tenancy rights [to live in socially-owned apartments] and to those who could pay [for the apartments] in foreign currency. In that respect all citizens were in the same position. Those who were behind the repressive rule over the Croatian people in the former regime and those who were persecuted by the former regime because of their democratic and national feelings were in the same position regarding this. If there are some irregularities they should be corrected, equally for everyone. You are probably aware that I personally, on the rare occasion when I chaired a government session -- I think in January last year -- chaired a session when the need to fight all forms of crime mercilessly was the particular focus of attention. The need to fight the remains of the communist bureaucratic system and all forms of crime within the new democratic system was discussed. But I will tell you that there is a certain lack of understanding, and attempts by political schemers to discredit the transformation of the former socialist ownership into private ownership, and attempts to destabilize the authorities in this field. In upcoming days some people will appear before courts who, between 1990 and the end of 1991, worked in Croatia in an organized and public way against the founding of a democratic Croatia and its survival. One of the main aims of their activities was to compromise the leading people of the new democratic system. This was a part of their organization's program, which had the organizational and program name of Opera. Such activities have resumed, in one way or another, until today. I can show you on one example how this works in the case of apartments. When, after 20 years I got a passport for the first time, so that I could travel abroad, I met a young man in Canada in 1987 among the people of various party and non-party allegiances in the Croatian diaspora. I was told he was not interested in politics but was very competent in the field of electronics and communications, and that many companies -- from Toronto to Ottawa and Vancouver -- were headhunting him. I was told he was the sort of person Croatia needed. Between 1986 and 1989, that is before the democratic Croatian authorities were established, I used to send invitations to Croatian emigrants, in particular to the young and capable ones, to return to the homeland. Ivica Mudrinic was among them. He is the one I just spoke about. Ivica Mudrinic returned to the country, I do not know how old he (is/was), 35 or 40, with his four children. He made his knowledge, ability, and his patents available to democratic Croatia, his homeland. What did the homeland give him in return? It gave him a tenancy right, the same right enjoyed by those who had made him and his father flee, who had imprisoned me and others. So, can we say that this is an example of crime or dishonesty of the Croatian ministers? I am for the remorseless elimination of all forms of crime, but I am also for giving a real political and ethic name to each phenomenon [as heard], and for seeing what lies behind some appearances. I do not know exactly how many tens of thousands of apartments we have already sold, and how many there are left to be sold. This process should be finalized as soon as possible, so that we can implement the denationalization and privatization. We will not allow anyone to prevent us from doing what we want. We have had over one half of the Croatian population living abroad, some people even say that about the same number of able-bodied people have left the country as have stayed in it. There is no democratic Croatia if there is no possibility for these people to return. There are no democratic authorities unless the same rights are given to these people as to those who have stayed in the country. I am not saying that they should have any preferential treatment, but simply the same rights. We should make good use of their experience, both democratic and technical, technological, scientific. We should stimulate the reconciliation of all citizens of Croatia, in the interest of [preserving] what we have already achieved -- an independent, internationally recognized Croatia, which is not only recognized but also needed by the world for the creation of a new democratic order in this part of southeastern Europe. In this light our objective is to have a legal order of the highest level. What we have written into our Constitution and laws -- we will be able to fully implement them when the war is really over, when we return 250,000 people -- I cannot say to their homes for their homes are destroyed, but to their ruined hearths. When we reintegrate all these areas into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and when we can devote ourselves to the economic reconstruction, to the scientific and cultural progress in Croatia...[pauses] We must consistently and fully direct all our resources for Croatia to become a country of freedom and, fully and in every respect, a country of legal order. This is something that cannot be secured by any country that is drawn into war in one way or another. This is something that is illustrated by the case of the United States during its war with Japan. It [the U.S.] could not apply, it could not comply with the civil rights of Japanese citizens. It had to organize collection centers, camps, and confiscate their property etc. for national security reasons. There are, however, those fools who accuse the Croatian authorities of setting up the camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Croats did not set them up first because the Croats had to fight there, first against the Serb aggression. They had to survive. Consequently, every phenomenon should be assessed in the light of the exact circumstances in which the democratic Croatia was created, defended, and consolidated. [Janacek] Janacek, [word indistinct] Mr. President, Mr. Veljko Knezevic, the official representative of the authorities in Belgrade said in an interview to the HRT [Croatian Radio and TV] to our colleague Rajic; he used the term Republic of Serb Krajina as he was talking about Croatia's occupied areas. Can Croatia tolerate the fact that the official representative of a country that has not recognized the statehood of that area -- although it itself has not been recognized -- can freely voice such statements? Or perhaps, he has permission for such statements? [Tudjman] I believe that, officially, Croatia cannot tolerate such statements. If this representative -- who arrived under the agreement on the normalization of relations, which implies the recognition of Croatia within its borders -- were to continue to air such statements, not only in our country, I believe, he would have to stop enjoying our hospitality.
