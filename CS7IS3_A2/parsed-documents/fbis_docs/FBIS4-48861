At the end of last week, the Mandingo faction of ULIMO, loyal to Roosevelt Johnson, launched an attack on Tubmanburg and took control of the city center, forcing Alhaji Koromah's Krahn faction to retreat to the western suburb. Shortly afterwards, an ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] convoy heading for Tubmanburg was ambushed and a group of soldiers were taken hostage. On this program yesterday, ECOMOG field commander Major General John Inienger told us that, following negotiations with Alhaji Koromah, he had managed to secure the release of some of the ECOMOG soldiers, but that at least five others were still being held hostage. Well today, Alhaji Koromah called us up from Monrovia to give us his version of events for the last few days around Tubmanburg. On the line, Heather Saleh asked him what he had to say: [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, the first thing is that it is not true that we have lost Tubmanburg. Tubmanburg is under our full control, and you can ask UN and other sources. We just took a tactical retreat to the barracks, and then encircled the enemy, and then we have driven them out of the place -- and many of them have died. Of course, they were being assisted by ECOMOG artillery, especially the Nigerian contingent that is there. [Saleh] You say Tubmanburg is under your control, but you have had to, in fact, move your headquarters away from Tubmanburg to Voinjama, and you said that the Krahns controlled the city center. [Koromah] That was the first day. We moved our administrative headquarters to Voinjama because of the level of insecurity in the Tubmanburg area. The military headquarters is still there and that the city center area that was being occupied by the dissident forces. [sentence as heard] They are not only Krahn people, necessarily, OK? So, we have recaptured the city center. It is under our control now. You can ask the UN people. They will confirm that. [Saleh] So according to you, there are no forces of Roosevelt Johnson in Tubmanburg now? [Koromah] In the first place, these are not forces of Roosevelt Johnson. You know, this is misinformation. Johnson has only been a public relations officer for these forces, and he represents nothing. These are forces of General T. Kallah. These dissident groups have been driven away from Tubmanburg, and we are chasing them in the swamps and in the forest areas. But the question of Gen. Inienger telling us that we hijacked his vehicles, this is not true. He has been misinformed. These vehicles, when individual Nigerian soldiers were fighting along with the dissidents and they were captured, and we have three of them now, and they have been confessing the news of some of their higher ups who give them the command to get involved in this war. [sentence as heard] [Saleh] But you do admit that you are holding a number of ECOMOG troops? [Koromah] These people were captured along with the dissidents, and I have promised Gen. Inienger that they will be released very shortly. They were about 24 of them that we captured. We have released 21 of them, and the other three are being questioned to give us information, and they shall be released very shortly. [Saleh] When did you regain Tubmanburg? [Koromah] Yesterday. Yesterday. In fact, we never really left the entire city. It was just the city center, because we did not want the citizens to get caught in the crossfire. So we moved to the actual military barracks. [end recording]
