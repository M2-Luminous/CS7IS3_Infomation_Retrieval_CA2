It will not make it easier either for the EU to focus on the problems of the Norwegians, who are holding out for better entry terms, especially on fish. The apparently technical dispute over the EU's "blocking minority" voting system masks firmly opposed views about the balance of decisionmaking power between big and small states, as well as tensions between sovereignty-conscious nationalists and federalists. Spain and the UK want to keep existing rules to preserve their ability to block measures they dislike. Currently, 23 votes out of 76 (normally two large states and one small) can stop legislation in the Council of Ministers. If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes, according to their size. A majority of the 12 want to maintain the carefully nurtured existing balance between big and small EU club members by requiring 27 votes to block proposals, a figure arrived at by arithmetical extrapolation from present rules. It was decided at the 1992 Lisbon summit to postpone until the 1996 constitutional review any radical look at how a Union set to expand later into East and Central Europe should take decisions. Madrid accepts 27 as the threshold except when three member states with at least 23 votes object or even abstain. In practice, this means two large and one small country. However, the European Parliament, which has to decide by March 10 whether to start approval proceedings for the new members in time for them to enter next January, wants to make it even more difficult to block Euro-laws. At the moment the Parliament says it will not put through enlargement if the 12 keep the blocking minority at 23. The issue has to be resolved by EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday [7 March] and Tuesday, when they will also have a last try at reaching terms with Norway. Mr Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the Council of Ministers, said on Tuesday night: "We have domestic problems to be solved, but they will not stop a successful enlargement." He may be being optimistic. Contacts by telephone and letter have taken place this week between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to try to resolve the voting rules dispute. Senior European Commission officials believe the UK will budge, through fear of endangering the EU's expansion. The British themselves are cryptic. Their position on voting "is as firm an element as anything in our negotiating brief," one official said, only hours before Britain caved in on the issue of agriculture subsidies for the newcomers. Spain is another matter. Mr Carlos Westendorp, its European affairs minister, has made clear Spain must get some fish from Norway's rich waters and its blocking minority formula. Madrid believes otherwise that it and Italy and Greece could be outvoted on issues which concern them alone, like, for instance, olive oil subsidies. Mr Gonzalez supported this line in a letter to Mr Kohl this week and at a press conference in Madrid. It would be politically difficult for him to get neither fish nor votes. Norway sticks unswervingly to its line: "Not a single fish for Spain," leading one German diplomat to tell a Norwegian colleague that "negotiating with you is like Salman Rushdie negotiating with the Iranians." But some negotiators believe Oslo might "consolidate" the fish it conceded as part of the European Economic Area trade zone treaty, which came into force this year but would cease to apply once Norway joins the Union. Its battle cry could then become "Not a single new fish" for Spain. Some Brussels diplomats believe, too, that Spain could be flattered into line, if it got its present eight votes raised to 10, putting it on a par with the other big countries: France, Germany, Britain and Italy. The flaw in this argument is that two votes added to 23 does not make 27; Spain's interests would still be vulnerable.
