Our respects from Caracol. We would like you to speak with our director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the station's master control room, regarding the status of public order in the country today, as Colombia is electing a new president. [Pardo] The reports on the public security situation that are available to us thus far do not reveal any incidents that could delay the elections. The Defense Ministry is going to provide related information and official public order reports on a regular basis. However, at this time, we do not have any reports from any place saying that, because of public order problems, elections will be delayed. [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, our respects from Caracol's central master control room. Do you believe soldiers should be able to vote in the elections? In Colombia, legal regulations and the Constitution stipulate that soldiers cannot vote. [Pardo] No, I do not believe soldiers should vote. I believe that, in light of the current situation Colombia faces, the circumstances, and the role played by the military forces in Colombia, it is not appropriate for soldiers to vote. I believe so because the Colombian Armed Forces play the fundamental role of guaranteeing the elections. For instance, the public forces are guarding over 90 percent of the 47,000 voting tables. The parties themselves have asked for the public forces to be present at the voting tables and sites, lending their support for the electoral organization. This entails an absolute and total neutrality and a lack of party allegiance on the part of public forces members. This is why I deem it appropriate to maintain this legal prohibition that dates back to 1930 and has been part of Colombian traditions. [Arizmendi] Judging from your experience, do you believe our next president, whom we will be electing today, should appoint a civilian to the Defense Ministry? [Pardo] This is normal in a democracy. I believe that all Colombians must begin to get used to this situation and that it should be usual within the Defense Ministry. [Arizmendi] At this juncture, do you believe all generals nationwide are happy and satisfied and consider having a civilian as defense minister a pleasant experience? [Pardo] As for myself, the task I have fulfilled has been, rather than pleasant, very constructive and significant. On behalf of democracy, it is crucial that the defense minister have the capacity to answer politically and assume political responsibilities. I deem this appropriate for any democracy, and for the Colombian democracy, in particular, I believe it should be the rule in the future. [Arizmendi] Would you like to remain in your post as defense minister if you are confirmed by the president-elect? [Pardo] I have a term, which will end on 7 August. [Arizmendi] Are you planning to go overseas or stay in Colombia? [Pardo] I am trying to get a scholarship to study abroad. [Arizmendi] Where would you like to study? [Pardo] I do not know yet, any place abroad. I have a few possibilities in mind, have sent several applications, and hope something will come through. [Arizmendi] What would you like to study? [Pardo] Basically, I am interested in reflecting on all I have done in the public arena all these years. I would like to further my knowledge regarding that area. There are many new trends, international situations, and I have great interest in learning more about issues of this sort. [Arizmendi] In order to participate actively in Colombian politics later on? [Pardo] [Words indistinct] to study. [Arizmendi] It is time to make assessments. [Words indistinct] What is your assessment on the war against the guerrillas? [Pardo] I believe there is a basic factor in this situation. Three or four years ago, the guerrillas constituted a necessary player [referencia obligatoria] in Colombian politics. Any issue being debated required to some extent -- in order to be thoroughly examined -- the opinion of the guerrillas. The guerrillas gave their views and issued communiques on every subject. They constituted a permanent player in the entire political process and the national situation. This situation has changed dramatically. Today's guerrillas might continue causing harm and might be able to perpetrate crimes, but they do not constitute a key player in Colombian politics anymore. Today's guerrillas are a criminal element that remains on the sidelines. We are all concerned about the guerrillas and would like to see the problem resolved promptly, preferably in a negotiated manner, but the truth is that they do not constitute a leading player in Colombian politics anymore. [Arizmendi] However, how many soldiers have been deployed nationwide today to guarantee peace and keep the order? [Pardo] There are between 130,000 and 140,000 soldiers directly involved in the electoral process.
