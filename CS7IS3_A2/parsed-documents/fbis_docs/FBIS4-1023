In the hills of the former Yugoslavia during World War 2, the partisans of Tito and other leaders tied up tens of thousands of Hitler's finest troops, who were backed up by sophisticated artillery and aircraft. NATO's commanders, who today are equipped with airborne computer- guided weapons of destruction aboard American F-16 warplanes, know that a ground war against the Serbs would be costly and all but unwinnable. Like the Wehrmacht and NATO, the SADF [South African Defence Force] has deployed its iron fist in the hills and valleys of Zululand. Its men on the ground are backed by the SAAF's [South African Air Force] Dakota transport planes, Cessna 185 spotter aircraft and Puma and Alouette helicopters. The air force says that although no jet strike aircraft -- Impalas or Mirages -- are on specific standby for Natal, they are available. Against them is ranged a motley assortment of impis [warriors] armed with anything from AK-47s, shotguns, G-3s, pistols and revolvers (including homemade items) to spears and knobkerries. On paper the SADF should win a battle against them without so much as working up a sweat. However, the fighting -- if the current violence escalates into that -- will not be on a piece of paper on some desk in a staff college. An acknowledgement of the seriousness of the situation, in military terms, came last week with the report (so far not denied) that the SADF was considering deploying one of the navy's replenishment ships -- probably the former Russian icebreaker SAS Outeniqua -- to Richards Bay to act as a floating hospital. The SADF has downplayed the story, but the thinking behind the move is illuminating. For one, the ship could be staffed by trained medics and doctors of the SA Medical Services, closer to the action than hospitals in Durban or elsewhere. A hospital ship would also have adequate stocks of "clean" blood. These are important considerations for the morale of men in the field if what is essentially a policing exercise turns into a war. Richards Bay harbour is also more secure than many other centres in Zululand are likely to be if the Inkatha Freedom Party's supporters turn to guerilla-type warfare. This is of particular concern when considering use of 10-ton Puma helicopters, which will be the primary means of rapid troop deployment. They can operate fully loaded for less than three hours. If refuelling depots cannot be secured adequately, the helicopters will lose their effectiveness, and it will take longer to deploy ground troops. Ships like the SAS Drakensberg and Outeniqua -- both around 20,000 tons displacement -- can carry tens of thousands of litres of fuel for helicopters. Both have flight decks that will accommodate Pumas as well as Alouettes. Security of the Pumas must be one of the prime areas of concern for the SADF planners, particularly in the light of the incident in Tembisa last week in which a single 9mm bullet downed a civilian helicopter. The SAAF has said only that precautions are being taken to protect the aircraft and crews, and has not gone into details. These precautions are likely to include measures to diffuse the heat of jet turbine engines to reduce the infrared "signatures" of aircraft. There have been no indications that weapons like the shoulder-launch, head-seeking SAM-7 are common in Natal, but police have picked up at least one during operations to find illegal weapons along the Mozambique and Swaziland borders. Many of the helicopter pilots, from 15 Squadron in Durban and elsewhere, have years of experience, learning a few tricks about avoiding fire during the bush war in Namibia and Angola. But sometimes not even experience is enough to cope with weapons like the SAM-7 or the RPG-7 grenade launcher. Also a shoulder-launch weapon, the RPC-7 is easy to use and extremely accurate, even in the hands of a comparative novice. That much the U.S. military learnt in Somalia, where the weapons downed a number of U.S. Marine Sikorksy Blackhawk helicopters. If the shooting gets serious in Natal, it will be whole new ball game, even for veterans of Angola and Namibia. The enemy will be ill-defined -- hiding out in crowds of demonstrators, slipping down narrow alleys between township houses, moving through valleys in the dead of night -- and the "rules of engagement" will be far more strictly defined than they were in Angola. "Collateral damage" -- the euphemism for the deaths of innocent civilians -- is something the peacekeeping SADF will have to avoid at all costs. In places like the crowded townships of kwaZulu, Inanda and Mbumbulu, near Durban, the heavy 90mm guns mounted on the Ratel and Eland armoured cars will be next to useless because of the indiscriminate destruction they wreak. Heavy-calibre 0.50 or 12.7mm machine-guns would also cause heavy destruction if levelled against township houses and shanties or hillside huts. Ratels and Elands, despite their fearsome appearance, are vulnerable to RPG fire, as such grenades can penetrate armour up to 20mm thick. The SADF troops first deployed in the townships of the East Rand proved highly effective, not least because they were treated with great respect by ANC-aligned self-defence units, which discovered that the "brown jobs" would counter-attack aggressively, unlike SAP [South African Police] units. Less respectful of the troops have been hostel residents, although few have dared to really "mix it" with the soldiers. However, the IFP's "R-5 Brigade" made up largely of unemployed rural kwaZulu men and imbued with the fighting spirit and history of the Zulus, might be a tougher nut to crack. Believing in the divine purpose of their mission to defend their kingdom and backed up on occasion by protection from the spirits against bullets, the warriors and their Kamikaze approach will be difficult to deal with. They will also have the invaluable benefit of being on their own turf, knowing their hills and valleys for better than the SADF. Indeed, security force members with the most experience in the area are to be found in the kwaZulu and SA police forces. The kwaZulu Police look set to remain loyal to King Goodwill Zwelithini and the kwaZulu government. Despite the markedly better training of the SADF, the advantage in bushcraft terms will be even more marked for the SADF's adversaries when they are compared with black soldiers conscripted from other areas or with white troops doing call-ups. White conscriptions is probably going to provide the biggest headache for the SADF in dealing with the Natal problem. After April 27, very few white Citizen Force soldiers will be willing to give up their time -- and very possibly their lives -- to fight in what is in may ways regarded as a black man's war. And these white part-time soldiers will definitely be needed to help the SADF cope. Military expert Helmoed Romer-Heitman has said that if the Natal situation does degenerate into guerilla warfare, the SADF will need about 20,000 troops to contain it. These troops are simply not available in the regular ranks. The SADF has fewer than 40,000 regular members, about 13,000 of whom have already been deployed to help stabilise the homelands. About 3,000 troops are in Natal, and more will be on their way there after units in the East Rand are freed by deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. The NPKF is generally regarded as inadequate for deployment in really "hot" areas, and -- for now, at least -- will be put into only those areas already stabilised by the SADF.
