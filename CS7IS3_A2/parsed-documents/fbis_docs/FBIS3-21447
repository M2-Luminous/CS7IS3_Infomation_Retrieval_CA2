Narasimha Rao, is in Davos, Switzerland, to find takers for his economic reforms package. In an increasingly competitive market for international capital, restructuring an economy by itself is not enough. It has to be marketed and sold. Davos' World Economic Reform provides an excellent advertising platform to draw the West's attention to the changed Indian economy. India being a latecomer to the restructuring game, Mr Rao faces an uphill task in selling his government's reforms. Countries which started reforming earlier or have taken their restructuring further are already capturing significant chunks of global capital. Mr Rao will need to make a pretty strong sales pitch to convince international investors India also offers high and safe returns on their investments. But no amount of hard sell can push an inferior product. So what is Mr Rao pushing? The government has been highlighting its success on three fronts--reducing the fiscal and current account deficits and containing inflation. The fiscal deficit has been brought down from 8.4 per cent of the gross domestic product [GDP] in 1990-91 to 5.7 per cent in 1992-93. The current account deficit is currently $2.6 billion, down from $7.7 billion in 1990-91. Inflation has been brought down from 12 per cent in 1990 to around 8 per cent now. Yet government profligacy, despite claims to the contrary, has not been reined in. The 1993-94 fiscal deficit displays all indications of settling at around 6.5 per cent of the projected GDP. With industrial output stagnating in the first half of the year, GDP growth projections of 5 per cent now seem optimistic. The deficit ratio could be considerably higher. This year's fiscal mismanagement has been touted as a politically induced aberration. There are some aspects of India's fiscal correction for which official explanations are not so readily forthcoming. The revenue deficit is now about half the fiscal deficit and growing. Fiscal correction has largely been at the cost of capital formation. Capital expenditure has declined from 6 per cent of the GDP in 1990-91 to 4.3 per cent in 1992-93. The government is now offering only 17 cent [as printed] budgetary support for infrastructure projects. The trade deficit contraction has come out of a reduction in imports rather than significant export growth. Imports have been controlled more by domestic demand recession than by any policy change. Since 1991 import tariffs have been reduced. But the average tariff cut has been less than the devaluation of the rupee, thus giving imports an advantage. The government is usurping credit for the largely exogenous growth of exports in the latter part of 1993-94 although it has not achieved much by the way of controlling inflation. The spectacular decline in the current account deficit this year is largely due to an exogenous jump in foreign portfolio funds flowing into India. This inflow has more to do with the state of recently opened Indian stock markets than with macro-economic indices. Inflation in India is driven mainly by agricultural production, the fiscal deficit and monetary expension. Net bank credit to the government is growing around 12 per cent over the past couple of years. Money supply growth is averaging over 15 per cent, way above target. Fortunately for the government, the monsoons have been generous for five years in a row. Inflationery pressures have been dampened largely by good harvests. Monetary and fiscal correction cannot claim credit for this. But the major weakness in the government's reforms programme remains in the government's attitude towards the exercise. The emphasis has been on making them look good on paper. There is no economic logic in the government's including divestment receipts in its revenue account. There are of course International Monetary Fund loans whose dibursements depend on the size of the deficit. What is surprising is the IMF has accepted the government's accounting procedure which incorporated divestment receipts to compress the fiscal deficit by 0.5 per cent of the GDP over the past two years. Similarly, the government's definition of the primary deficit subtracts gross rather than net interest payments from the fiscal deficit. This does not make sense either but helps present a better picture. The Reserve Bank of India, too, has not sterilised burgeoning foreign exchange reserves, disregarding its effect on the price line. Here again the emphasis has been on advertising short term achievement at the cost of future export efficiency. In fact most of the restructuring so far has been done with an eye on revenue generation. The government is yet to address the really important issues, the high capital-output ratio and labour market reforms. That India remains a high cost economy is not seriously debated. And the government roll back in capital expenditure is not helping matters. Liberalisation is not laissez faire. If the idea is for India to evolve into market socialism, the government cannot overlook its role in infrastructural development. As long as infrastructure remains the bottleneck, hopes of reducing the capital-output ratio could remain just hopes. More alarmingly, there is a complementary nature between private investment and infrastructure that the government can afford to ignore at its own risk. Mr Rao would benefit from a closer scrutiny of the Chinese experience where a minimum social overhead capital was generated before foreign capital was invited in. Apart from infrastructure, the other major area where the government has a major role to play in market socialism is in social spending. But expenditure on health and education have been declining in real terms since reforms began. The government has not been able to resist cutting expenditure on these accounts to keep its books in better shape. Labour market reform has been on the cards since 1991. It is still on the cards. The government has been on the verge of taking tough decisions for the past one year. But somehow they never seem to materialise. The attitude most discernable here has been wait long enough and the problems will go away. The idea is not replace retiring employees. Then by 2000, there will be no overstaffing. The question is whether India can wait so long. Mr Rao has hidden behind politics to explain its lack of enthusiasm on reforming the labour market. The government's lack of majority, we have been told, has held it back. Mr Rao has managed to cobble an absolute majority in Parliament in his three years in power. Yet an exit policy is as distant as it was when he assumed office. The present government has a year and a half to go. Two Southern states go to the polls later this year. With them, the runup to next year's general elections begins. It is difficult to envisage the government taking on the unions at this juncture. Unless the government begins to take stock of the runaway revenue deficit and monetary expansion, infrastructural and human resource constraints and labour market reforms, the actual investment climate will continue to remain inclement. Taking hard decision is sadly not Mr Rao's forte. But if he is to raise international confidence in the Indian economy, hard decisions are what he will have to take. Posturing at international fora is one thing, backing up claims is another.
