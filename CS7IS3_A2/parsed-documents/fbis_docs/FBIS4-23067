I. Fedorenko, N. N. Kisel; UDC 621.396.377] [Abstract] This article presents a solution (using the integrals method) to the two-dimensional problem of the diffraction of an electromagnetic wave on an ideally conducting infinite cylinder partially covered with a dielectric. Inside the cylinder are thin resistive strips of finite conductivity. It is assumed that the contours of the cross section of the cylinder, coating, and strips are of an arbitrary form. The diffraction of anE- and H-polarized electromagnetic wave is considered. The results show a possibly substantial effect of the strips on the scattering characteristics of metal-dielectric cylinders in a resonant range. The algorithms described here make it possible to study a structure with varied electrophysical strip parameters along the cross section contour. The electron paramagnetic resonance may be reduced by 10-15 dB without changing the weight a nd size of metal-dielectric cylinders. Figures 5; references 11: 10 Russian, 1 Western.
