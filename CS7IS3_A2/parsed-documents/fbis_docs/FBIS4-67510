In particular, the recently created public organization--the Ecological Equilibrium foundation--opened its first self-financing structure in April, the bureau of environmental evaluation, whose primary business will be putting together normative documents for enterprises regarding maximum allowed discharges into the atmosphere. They will do it in cooperation with the foundation's partner--the Logos scientific-industrial foundation. The bureau plans to offer other types of evaluation as well. I would remind that the Ecological Equilibrium foundation presented itself to the public on 1 March, describing as its goal development of environmental business. This organization intends to turn money-losing ecology into a zone of profitable and stable business. The bureau will conduct independent evaluation and project appraisal and bring it to a ``working'' condition by bringing in a broad range of specialists, including economists. The first business project the foundation is already working on will be waste utilization at the Kudryashevo swine-breeding complex--one of the four largest animal husbandry complexes in Russia. Liquid waste will be processed into a solid substance--organic fertilizer. Remarkably, this requires minimal equipment, while productivity is quite high--as high as the demand for organic fertilizer. The next step earmarked for implementation this year is the creation of a minicomplex: a parking lot, a gas station offering a skeleton set of repair and maintenance, and a car wash. Of course, there are quite a few such facilities in the city, but none meets ecological safety standards. The new one, which is envisaged to be built in the Krasnoobsk area, will be fitted with a closed-loop purification system. This brings up a question: Why was it necessary to set up a public organization if the problems of ecological equilibrium are worked on one way or the other by state structures--the oblast and the city committees on ecology and natural resources. ``Briefly, I can answer it this way: State ecological organizations spend taxpayers money on liquidating the consequences of poor management. How successfully--you judge for yourself. Our foundation is trying to attract the public that is in some way or the other concerned over the unhealthy environment, earn money, and invest it in economically profitable projects and programs, in, as they say, `high technology,''' replies foundation President Oleg Nikolayevich Kolmakov. ``At the same time, we work in close--one may say, brotherly--contact with the oblast and city committees.''
