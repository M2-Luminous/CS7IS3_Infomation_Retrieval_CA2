Speaking to reporters recently, Gen. Walker said more than 60 LPC fighters were discovered in the Firestone area planning to attack NPFL positions in Harbel District in Grand Bassa. He said AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] personnel at Firestone are masterminding the planned attack. General Walker is, meanwhile, urging civilians in the area not to panic as the situation is under control. At the same time, the Liberia Peace Council has been accused of killing relief personnel in southeast Liberia. The International Action Against Hunger based in Monrovia says the LPC killed two MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] personnel recently in the southeast. It says the killing of the relief personnel by the LPC poses danger to relief organizations operating in the area. A spokesman for the group says the killing of the relief personnel has tampered with delivery of humanitarian assistance to thousands of people in that region.
