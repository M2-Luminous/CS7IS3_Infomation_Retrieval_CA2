The U.S. report released yesterday included Brazil among the countries that violate civilian rights. In its reaction to the U.S. report, the Brazilian Government considers as unfounded charges of disrespect for civilian rights because the document does not consider the efforts by the Brazilian federal, state, and municipal governments to solve the problem. The Brazilian Government believes the subject must be discussed by international organizations and stresses that the accusation is unacceptable because the U.S. Government does not release reports on human rights violations in its own territory.
