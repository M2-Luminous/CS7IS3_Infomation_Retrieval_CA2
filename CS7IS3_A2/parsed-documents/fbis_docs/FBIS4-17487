"In the military sphere NATO air strikes did not bring any results and will not bring them at present", he told a press conference on Monday. The minister believes the major way to settle the conflict is to hold in the near future a meeting of the leaders of Russia, the United States, EU countries and the UN. The summit, according to Grachev, can be held in any European state and should involve also the political leadership of the whole of the former Yugoslavia. Grachev urged to strengthen the peace-keeping forces in Gorazde and to avert bloodshed in the city itself. He informed that a 19-men strong Russian platoon will be transferred to Gorazde. The minister said it is also necessary to promote normal humanitarian provision for the population there. Grachev is categorically against the withdrawal of Russian peace-keepers from Bosnia. "This would be an untimely and inappropriate decision fraught with a further political isolation of Russia in the world community. It is possible to pull out Russian forces from the region only after the settlement is reached by political means", he said. The Russian minister believes it is not only Serbs who are to blame for the current crisis in Bosnia. Both conflicting sides are to blame, according to him.
