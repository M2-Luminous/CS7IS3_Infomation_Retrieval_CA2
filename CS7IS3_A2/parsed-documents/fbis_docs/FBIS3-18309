Naturally, the issue arose during UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's contacts and talks with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the prime minister, and the official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is being constantly briefed on the developments and the Greek Government maintains an open line with Moscow, Belgrade, and Zagreb with the aim of averting suspension of the peace talks. Both Mr. Papoulias and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd expressed hope that today's incident will not hinder the peace process. The following report by our correspondent Foivos Kardhis gives the details on the British foreign secretary's visit: [Begin recording] [Kardhis] The dogfight in Bosnia raised strong concerns in Athens and with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd, who met shortly afterward and expressed hope that it would not become an unexpected obstacle to the peace process. Mr. Papoulias and Mr. Hurd immediately had telephone conversations with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin and at noon with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. This open line with Moscow stresses the West's conviction that this time as well Russia will have a decisive role in averting a new crisis. Mr. Papoulias contacted the prime minister twice to convey to him the latest reports from Bosnia and NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Mr. Hurd asserted in a harsh tone that the Atlantic alliance is implementing a policy that was already decided upon and will do the same in the future, whereas at his news conference he noted that the aircraft were shot down because unlike former violations of the no-fly zones, which were isolated, this time the operation involved a whole formation. However, nobody aims at a new escalation of tensions in Bosnia a few days after the decision of [words indistinct] military involvement by the West with the expiration of the ultimatum on Sarajevo. [Papoulias] It is our joint conviction that, no matter how unpleasant and difficult what happened is, it cannot revoke the [words indistinct] peace process. [end recording]
