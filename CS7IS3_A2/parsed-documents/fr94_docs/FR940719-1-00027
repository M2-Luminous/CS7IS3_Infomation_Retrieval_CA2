FR940719-1-00027 FR940719-1-00009 High-value Wetlands The proposed rule contained an exception from avoiding or compensating for the loss of wetlands that would have applied to all wetlands in Alaska. No distinction was made between wetlands that exhibit greater or fewer functions and values. More comments were received regarding the uniqueness and value of Alaska's wetlands, and the need for protection of high-value ones, than on any other issue. A few comments recommended ways of incorporating consideration of high-value wetlands into the rule. Many comments addressed functions and values of Alaska's wetlands, including particular examples of high-value wetland functions or particular wetlands in Alaska that exemplified certain high-values. A majority of comments on the issue indicated that, if issued, a final rule should specifically address the need for protecting high-value wetlands. To this end, a number of comments cited the potential loss of all 345,000 acres of estuarine intertidal vegetated wetlands, which play a significant role in maintaining, among other things, much of Alaska's fishing industry. Several comments noted that conflicts between development and wetlands are highest in coastal areas, where building demands and valuable habitat coincide. Several comments also questioned to what extent EPA considered the potential adverse cumulative impacts of the proposed rule on wetlands-dependent hydrologic functions and wildlife. However, other comments stated that the proposed rule should not expressly provide a separate level of protection for high-value wetlands. Some comments asserted that the lack of clear criteria for distinguishing high-value wetlands from low-value wetlands was a good reason not to restrict application of the rule to certain wetlands in Alaska and argued that attempts to apply certain requirements only to ``high-value'' wetlands would likely be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process. Other comments stated that almost all the State's high-value wetlands are already protected in conservation units. Others stated that high-value wetlands would still be protected through State and local permitting and land use management programs. The State of Alaska reiterated its commitment to identify and protect all of its high-value wetlands through coastal zone management, State freshwater wetlands pollution control, and other regulations. Under the proposed rule, the requirement to avoid or compensate for impacts to wetlands in Alaska would be removed, thereby requiring only minimization of impacts to wetlands, including high-value ones. Of those comments specifically addressing the mitigation sequence, most favored the option of maintaining the full sequence of avoidance, minimization, and compensation for high-value wetlands. One comment stated a preference for protecting high-value wetlands, but allowing the development of low-value wetlands where unavoidable and with no compensatory mitigation required. To address the issue of how to consider high-value wetlands, comments suggested a variety of classification schemes. One approach recommended applying the rule on an ``ecoregion'' scale (e.g., the North Slope), as opposed to the entire State. One comment elaborated that it would be fair to ``relax'' mitigation sequence requirements for areas like the North Slope, but not for areas with less abundant wetland types. Others suggested evaluating the one percent wetlands loss on a watershed basis, including one comment that asserted that the exception for the entire state of Alaska was inappropriate since the importance of the biological values and hydrologic functions of individual wetlands is realized on a much smaller scale, and that boundaries should be based on hydrologic and/or biological criteria.
