FR940706-2-00048 FR940706-2-00030 [OPP&hyph;00386; FRL&hyph;4899&hyph;7] Statement of Policy for Water Soluble Packaging; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for water soluble packaging. That policy has been developed in a draft Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Water Soluble Packaging (WSP)'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice. DATES: Written comments, identified by the docket number [OPP&hyph;00386], must be received on or before August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: The PR Notice is available from Jeff Kempter, By mail: Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 713, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;5448. Submit written comments to: By mail: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Jeff Kempter (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 713, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;5448. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Water soluble packaging (WSP), which usually consists of polyvinyl alcohol, is used to package certain powdered formulations of pesticides to minimize exposure to pesticide handlers via inhalation. EPA is proposing to streamline the registration requirements for WSP to encourage use of such ``reduced risk'' packaging. Under the proposed policy, EPA will register WSP along with other forms of packaging under one registration number under the following conditions: 1. The confidential statement of formula (CSF) must list the chemical name(s), trade name(s), supplier(s), CAS Registry number(s), and amount(s) of components of the polyvinyl alcohol film and printing ink(s). All WSP components must have been previously cleared and not listed as ingredients to the product. 2. The ``Directions For Use'' on the label must provide mixing directions in terms of WSP packages to be added per unit volume of water. To add WSP to an existing registration, a registrant would notify EPA by submitting a letter certifying compliance with the PR Notice, and enclosing two copies of the CSF and one copy of the revised label. This Federal Register notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing any comments, EPA determines that changes to the Policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the draft PR Notice prior to release.

Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16331 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
