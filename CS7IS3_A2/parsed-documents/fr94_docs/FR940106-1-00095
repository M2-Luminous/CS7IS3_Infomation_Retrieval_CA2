FR940106-1-00095 FR940106-1-00011 Sacramento River Delta survival index values reflecting historical habitat conditions in different types of water years (Table 2) were calculated by the USFWS using the 1989 version of the above models, together with historical data on temperatures, water exports, and the percentage of Sacramento River flows diverted at Walnut Grove, as described in USFWS 1992a. All total survival values are calculated as monthly averages, and assume, based on past sampling results, that 17% migrate through the Delta from the Sacramento River in April, 65% in May, and 18% in June. At low temperatures, the Sacramento River regression gives mortality values (m 1 ) of less than zero, indicating that the regression does not give biologically meaningful results at these lower temperatures. The USFWS transforms these negative values to zeros before calculating total survival. Derivation of San Joaquin River Index The smolt survival indices for the San Joaquin River Delta were developed from coded-wire tagged smolt study results (USFWS 1992b). The CWT experiments were specifically designed to evaluate the benefit of constructing a barrier at the head of the Old River Channel to keep smolts in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. Smolts diverted into the Old River Channel are on a direct path to the State and Federal pumping plants, and are also likely subject to high temperatures and increased predation. The smolt survival relationship for smolts kept in the San Joaquin River is: y = 0.191271+.000067x Where y = smolt survival and x = San Joaquin flow at Stockton in cfs (r=0.68, n=8, p<0.10). There was evidence from the individual CWT studies that water exports had a substantial effect on survival for those smolts migrating down the San Joaquin to Suisun Bay. For instance, separate releases in 1989 under high export conditions and low export conditions indicate approximately double the survival under low export conditions. Although adding exports to the regression equation did not improve it, probably because there are not enough experimental releases under enough variety of conditions to provide a significant relationship, the USFWS developed an additional equation to model this factor, and used both this equation and the above flow equation to estimate smolt survival indices for the San Joaquin River. A discussion of the methodology is provided in USFWS 1992a and 1992b. This additional relationship is: y = (.341271^0.00025x 1 +0.00067x 2 )/1.8 Where x 1 = CVP+SWP exports in cfs and x 2 = flow at Stockton in cfs. Past adult escapement data was used to estimate smolt survival for historical conditions because there is still not enough CWT information under a broad enough variety of flow and export conditions to rely solely on CWT study results. Escapement values on the Y axis were replaced with survival values from 0 to 1.0. This assumes that adult production is an indicator of smolt survival. This assumption is generally valid, because less of the overall natural mortality occurs after the smolts enter the ocean. The relationship is as follows: y = (4.90106+.000286x 1 ^.000774x 2 )/12 where y = smolt survival, x 1 = mean daily flow at Vernalis from March 15 to June 15, and x 2 = mean daily CVP+SWP exports from March 15 to June 15. The USFWS used this relationship to estimate historical smolt survival indices for various periods of time (see Table 2). Further support for the importance of flows to salmon smolt survival comes from CWT study results showing a significant relationship between flow at Stockton and survival through the lower San Joaquin River (USFWS 1992a). 40 CFR part 131 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 131_[AMENDED] 1.
