The FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] is getting more coverage than ever in the columns of the Arab-language weeklies. Except for an interview with Tourabi, it was the lead topic this week. RISSALAT EL-ATLAS (No. 46) This weekly marks the ascension of Liamine Zeroual with an article entitled: "How Far Will Algeria's Sixth President Go in Implementing His Ideas?" The weekly asks, "Will he be able to steer the ship of state to a safe port through this violent tempest? And will Algerians who were holding their breath after the conference finally be able to breathe again?" The weekly's editorial page focuses on the national conference. "Under the headline: `President...and Hostage,' the editorialist writes that what happened at the conference "was as terrifying as expected." "The national conference failed. What was most distressing about the meeting is the fact that the de facto authorities made it a forum for reiterating their determination to pursue exclusion, eradication, and defiance of the will of the people. This is apparent," the editorialist continues, "in the inflamed speeches of Ali Kafi and Salim Saadi, in the maintenance by the HCE [Higher State Council] of its unconstitutional prerogatives, and in the platform of the CDN [Natioanal Dialogue Commission], which was tailored to the advantage of the government by allowing it to continue to control everything, from the `president of the republic' to the planned `transition council' and all other institutions, constitutional or otherwise." The weekly also points to an even more serious insult to the feelings of the nation, "namely the meeting held between what was called civilian society and the so-called helpful sectors of society, the majority of which were associations, coalitions, and committees. Among the latter was the Committee To Safeguard Algeria, which ever since its creation has been responsible, as we know, for so many wrongs and injuries in its efforts to destroy democracy, elections, and the people's right to choose." Very pessimistically, the weekly opines that, "this is the road back to where we started, using the same methods and following in the steps of the former transition phase, filled with so many tragedies and painful events." "For a glimmer of hope to persist and grow stronger, Mr. Liamine Zeroual should not have been named to the presidency on the basis of the conditions set by the HCE and rejected by Bouteflika, because these conditions make the position strictly honorary. And also for hope to persist one could wish that it had not been Benhamouda and Benmansour proposing Zeroual's candidacy, as the French-language press reported. Because that would mean that the president would be, just like his predecessors, a hostage of the mafia and the ghosts that have ruled Algeria up to now," concludes RISSALAT EL-ATLAS. The weekly devotes another article, equally acerbic, to the same question. For example: "While those who spoke at the national conference regretted the loss of the chance for harmony and condemned the boycott of the major parties, those words were only for `popular' consumption, because what really happened at Club des Pins is what the regime had planned and wanted to make happen. "The regime does not want consensus, for it knows that would work against it. The El-Khatib commission played precisely the role that had been scripted for it." RISSALAT EL-ATLAS also published an interview with Hassan Tourabi, reprinted from EVENEMENT DU JEUDI and translated into Arabic. In the interview Tourabi says, regarding the assassination of Algerian intellectuals and foreigners living in Algeria, that "everything depends on what name we give the battle..." "In Western philosophy, it is considered legal to resist repression and oppression, and this is called `resistance' or `revolution'; and in any case all revolutions have their victims, and the Algerians are of a revolutionary nature. Remember the price they paid to drive out the French: more than a million martyrs," said Tourabi. EL-HADETH (No. 8) In an article entitled: "The FIS and the Regime: Movement Toward The Negotiating Table?" this weekly raises the question: "What happened behind the scenes that led Anwar Haddam to publish his famous communique from Washington?" In answer to this question, the weekly notes that: "analysts are divided into two camps: One group believes the statement was simply a ploy imposed by FIS overseas representatives in order to diffuse pressures that Western circles were bringing to bear on FIS political figures due to the intensification of activities by armed Islamic groups. Other analysts," EL-HADETH continues, "have seen behind the declaration an indicator pointing to real detente, at least between the political wing of FIS and the regime." Between these two contradictory theories, EL-HADETH claims to describe what really happened behind the scenes. "According to a very well-informed source, the naming of Liamine Zeroual was a bid to put an end to the policy pursued by the previous group since the advent of Boudiaf, a policy that consisted of not entering into serious dialogue with the radical Islamist opposition, banking instead, first of all, on the weight of the security apparatus and second on moral and material support from certain Western circles." The weekly continues: "But that gamble, based mainly on a security solution, has failed, and its repercussions at the social and political levels were not just serious--they were catastrophic." "It seems that the military institution, which has been implicated on more than one occasion since the events of October 1988, no longer trusts the civilians, who once in power find themselves locked into narrow calculations, the strategy of `wait-and-see,' and vacillation, instead of making hard decisions," opines EL-HADETH; it cites the example of "the previous team, which on the one hand announced its intention of having a dialogue with the opposition but as soon as it started to become a reality backpedaled from its declared position and returned to its original stance, a move that obviously exacerbated the political crisis and showed the opposition that the government team had no serious intention of resolving the crisis." EL-HADETH then quoted again from the above-mentioned source to the effect that: "the previous government team labored under many inhibitions, which turned into deep-seated anxieties having to do with lack of faith in itself, doubts about its own legality, and the fact it was running short of time... All these misgivings engendered a feeling of frustration within the regime, especially when it fell hostage to groups that were beating the drums for the eradicationist line, albeit not working as political groups to implement that line..." "The regime found itself cut off from both camps--from the majority of the people as well as from the opposition," EL-HADETH concludes. EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR (No. 42) The weekly opines that our military leaders: "have been fomenting one coup after another, of every conceivable variety. There has been a tank behind every president ever installed as head of state, and behind every president who resigned. Only the military's votes count, when the issue is what constitutes electoral legality or revolutionary or historical legitimacy. By now, many people have seen through the `trick': The position of the presidency in Algeria depends on meeting two basic conditions: One must either have revolutionary or historical legitimacy recognized by the military, or one must be a general oneself," the weekly concludes. On the last page is an article entitled: "Military Government, Pending the Advent of `Madani' Government" (author's play on words: "madani" means "civilian" in Arabic), in which the author says that: "we do not really see any harm in the military institution taking power. It is the only institution still standing in our country... Throughout history, as El Hachemi Cherif said, democratic revolutions have come to power by force, not the ballot box; in the past, the army used to say it kept its distance from politics and was not interested in political power." Later on in the same article, EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR discusses what it calls: "the shepherds of civilian society and village political life." "When S. Sadi pays tribute to the military regime for averting a "madani" regime (author's play on words), and when Benhamouda marches alone to Club des Pins to demand Zeroual's presidency, we can guess how the village `brains' in civilian society are going to practice politics: with drum and flute." "We, the young," the weekly continues further down, "remember very clearly the oath taken by Kafi to bring to power young technocrats who favor modernity and new ideas...but the reality is quite different." ESSABIL (No. 39) This weekly gives its lead story the headline: "Was the Dialogue a Failure?" Yes, it answers: "If we judge the dialogue on the basis of the results announced, the judgment must be negative...and one can say that it failed...because neither of the major interlocutors claimed it was a success, nor did the public buy its `artificial' conclusion...even though its architects called it an extraordinary achievement. And if we gave an interpretation from the point of view of the method by which it was organized, we would say it was a coup d'etat against the most basic and elementary underlying principles of dialogue." On a more optimistic note, the weekly concludes: "While the dialogue was not everything the big parties and everyone else concerned with saving Algeria wanted it to be, does that mean that those who opted for this form of communication were deceiving themselves? This new failure of dialogue does not mean dialogue is doomed to fail every time, and the heads of the most important parties have said the boycott of the national conference does not mean a boycott of dialogue per se."
