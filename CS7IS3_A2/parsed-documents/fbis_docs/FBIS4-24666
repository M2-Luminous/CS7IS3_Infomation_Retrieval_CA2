Dozens of key mines which enjoy preferential treatment in capital and raw material supply have been built over the past ten years to meet the growing demand. "They have formed the backbone of the coal industry," said an official from the coal ministry. China relies heavily on coal for its energy supply. Statistics show coal accounts for over 75 percent of the country's consumption of primary sources of energy. By 1993, 45 key coal mines were completed with an increased production capacity of 110 million tons per year. Of the total, 12 are classified as extra large mines each with annual production capacity well above three million tons. China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking first in the world. Experts said investment for those key mines over the past decade totalled 39.8 billion yuan, making up 44 percent of the gross budget for the coal industry. Meanwhile, their production capacity, at 110 million tons annually, accounted for 56 percent of the total increase, the experts said. China began listing coal mines as key construction projects in 1982 to escalate the development of the coal industry. Since then, the number of projects has been increased from eight to twenty-five. Up to now, three projects have been completed. The remaining 22 still under construction are on the list of 151 key projects for this year. "This indicates China's preferential investment in energy and raw materials industries," which have been the bottleneck in China's economic development, said the official. He said those key mines were characterized by their large scale, high speed and short construction period, indicating better returns on investment. With advanced technology and equipment, those mines enjoy higher mechanization in coal production, he added. At present, four coal mines -- Datong, Gujiao and Pingshuo of Shanxi Province and Huolinhe of Inner Mongolia -- boast annual production capacities of more than 10 million tons. The official said that the construction of these mines played a pivotal role in stabilizing China's coal output and promoted China's development of the whole coal industry. China will pour 6.78 billion yuan into the key projects and the production capacity of the mines under construction is expected to hit 79 million tons. He admitted that problems still exist for these projects, such as a short supply of capital funds and building materials, which delay construction and put the projects behind schedule. He suggested that a system be set up to guarantee and manage the supply of funds and building materials to ensure the smooth construction of the projects. He said that the shortage of coal is bound to recur in the long run despite the present excess supply of coal on the domestic market. China plans to produce 1.4 billion tons of coal by the end of this century. "The government should exert macro-control over the coal industry and make sure the key projects being carried out to keep abreast with China's economic development," he said.
