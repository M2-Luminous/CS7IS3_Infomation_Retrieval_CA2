The gift was "produced by a French farmer" as his "only way of feeding his family," said a communique released in this southwestern French town, headquarters of the activist group Rural Coordination. In Paris, Puech denied receiving a parcel of cannabis from the farmers. "If such a parcel reached me, I would immediately hand it over to the police." Criticising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the farmers' communique said low world prices had forced Third World farmers to produce drugs. "By accepting the ratification of GATT, Mr. Puech has opted for a world of unemployment, violence and drugs. Farmers will adapt their crops to this," the communique said. The gift of cannabis was made to mark the end of Puech's first year as minister, the communique said. More than 120 countries will sign the new GATT in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 12-15.
