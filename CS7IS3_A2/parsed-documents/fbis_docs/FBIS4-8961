The two incursions by Greek commandos into Albanian territory, in which several Albanian soldiers were killed or injured, will not change the borders between the two states or liberate "Northern Epirus." They simply reveal the policy of Athens' socialist government of PASOK [Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement] and Papandreou, demonstrate the social and political climate in the Greek state, and heat up the overall situation in the region, in which a war has been waged on the territories of former Yugoslavia for over two years. In its recognizably arrogant and cynical style, official Athens refused to accept the Albanian reactions, accusing Tirana of "creating unnecessary tension in bilateral relations"! The Athens Government is blaming a certain "Northern Epirus Front" (that is how Athens describes southern Albania) for carrying out the entire operation out of revenge for the "bad position" of the Greek minority in Albania, and also because that piece of the Balkans is in Albania and not Greece! In some Athens newspapers this "Front" is still threatening new operations. This should now serve as an alibi for Papandreou's state and, according to its loudspeakers, the whole affair should stop here. For its part, official Tirana has threatened to use its right to "employ the same measures," and has asked the Security Council to condemn Athens for the incident. No matter how understandable the Albanian reaction is, the whole case is also a kind of warning to Athens. It has been noted that Albania, under the pretext of taking care of "its brothers," is interfering in the internal affairs and issues of neighboring countries, unreservedly accepting the positions of "its brothers," and not those of the authorities of the countries where they live as a minority. Tirana's direct interference in the affairs of [the Party of Democratic Prosperity] the party of the Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and particularly its involvement in the arms affair in which some of its members were implicated can easily produce similar situations and cause bloody incidents with even more terrifying consequences. The tragic incident on the Albanian-Greek border, however, cannot and must not be put to the sidelines, because it forces the question that has been hanging in the air for some time -- where will this behavior of Athens politicians lead, and what else can be expected? Ultimately, even if we accept Athens' claim that the government has nothing to do with the commandos' actions, it is still responsible for the creation of a climate of nationalism, chauvinism, hatred, and revenge, together with the desire to occupy foreign territories. That is the new reality that amazes all those who, until just recently, naively believed that there is democracy today in the place that gave birth to the word democracy. By making dangerous provocations in its surroundings (except for the Former Yugoslav Republic [FYR] of Serbia, which will be probably left for the final phase), Athens is creating hotbeds of crisis by setting the Balkan peninsula on fire, which has been made particularly explicit after the old, capricious, and extremely vain Papandreou resumed his seat on the prime minister's chair. Within a very short time he had succeeded in heating up his state with the imposition of the "Macedonian question" as promoted by the previous government after the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia and after the report of the Badinter Commission. By deceiving the electorate last October by saying that the world would not accept the "new state" in the Balkans without the agreement of Athens, that he would easily change its name, and that all "Greece's friends" were on his side, Papandreou easily won the elections. Nevertheless, in the disturbed Greek economy, sustained by European Community money, instead of enthusiasm he has introduced nationalism and chauvinism, and instead of getting his citizens back to work, he sends them to meetings where they hysterically threaten to protect their allegedly imperiled hellenism even by force. Nonetheless, the world and Europe, which never tried to hide its feeling of dissatisfaction after PASOK and Papandreou returned to power, have no understanding of Greek nationalism, and they have not only recognized, but also started to help the Republic of Macedonia. The response of the narcissistic prime minister and his family was to introduce the embargo against Macedonia and to threaten the Balkans, Europe, and the whole world that he would do his best to destroy the state on his northern border if it refused to give in to his blackmail. According to the plan, Macedonia should be economically destroyed, which would cause a range of social disruptions and the destabilization of the present authorities. These would then be replaced by an extreme nationalist group, which would cause a conflict between the Macedonians and the Albanians resulting in the destruction of the state and the subsequent division of the country between Greece and the Serbia, and later, perhaps, between others in the Balkans. The Athens politicians thus want to close the Macedonian file forever and bury the Macedonian national question once and for all on their territory. Milosevic's state was the first to be caught in this trap, because it wished to settle some old accounts, but there are also others who, although elevated to pluralists and democrats overnight, still cannot stop dreaming of the past and unrealized dreams. Sofia, for instance, is constantly being offered a return to the good old days of the late 1970's, when Zhivkov and Papandreou had monthly meetings, and as compensation it is being offered the construction of a road across Pirin Macedonia to the FYR Serbia and Romania. On the other hand, Bucharest is being offered "support and understanding" for its serious problems with the large Hungarian (and Catholic) minority, by promoting a new Orthodox brotherhood. At the same time, they are all scared of the "Albanian question" and Kosovo, of the Muslim world and Turkey, accused of planning to reconstruct the Ottoman Empire, although it is Athens that insists that the Aegean is a "Greek sea," and that the whole of Cyprus is a part of hellenism! Living constantly in an atmosphere of extreme nationalist feelings, it is no wonder that a group of "crazies" has appeared, demanding justice and corrections to "historical errors" on the territory of a foreign state, and murdering foreign citizens. That is why the irresponsible reactions of Athens irritate, because it does not even want to dissociate itself from the deed, let alone condemn it. What will happen if such "crazy" groups enter Macedonia, Bulgaria, or Turkey, and what if they respond with the same measures as Tirana is now threatening to do? Apparently, Papandreou does not care about that. The main thing is that he has finally shown his partners in Europe and NATO that he can do whatever he likes, and that they can do practically nothing. He is sending the army to the northern borders to intimidate Macedonia and make a mockery of Europe. He recommends to the Greek lobby in the United States and Canada that Greek terrorist actions in Australia, where Macedonian houses of culture and churches were torched, may also take place in their countries. It seems as though Papandreou does not want to change his image as a tough nationalist, and so nothing more can be expected of him. The way that he is, and the way that he is pushing his state and the Balkans into a crisis more dangerous than the one 82 years ago will not change even if Macedonia accepts his ultimatums. At a certain moment he will probably satisfy his vanity, but the next moment he will think of something else to keep his neighborhood in constant tension. Unfortunately, that is the essence of his Balkan policy.
