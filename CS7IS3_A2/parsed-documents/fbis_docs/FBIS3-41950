This was the sixth edition of the biennial conference following those held in Tokyo, Chicago, Karlsruhe, Kyoto, and Clearwater. One of the short-term objectives of the EC is the construction of an experimental reactor as part of global cooperation. It will be based on the magnetic confinement of deuterium and tritium plasma, followed by the design and construction of a demonstration reactor. The experimental fusion reactor, named ITER [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], is to be built around the year 2000 and already involves major research efforts into materials, subjected to the extreme service conditions which cause their deterioration. The international conference in Stresa, attended by 400 scientists from 23 countries (for the first time there was a major delegation from Russia), examined the mechanisms of degradation and the remedies for expanding the working potential of materials for fusion reactors. More specifically materials can be developed which, though becoming partially radioactive due to the neutrons generated by the fusion process, will be able to lose their radioactivity gradually within 20-30 years. By using this type of material the energy generated by the fusion process may become clean. [passage missing]
