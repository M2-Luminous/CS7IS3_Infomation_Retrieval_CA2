FBIS3-18136 "drweu039_i_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 FRANCE Juppe on Middle East, Bosnia Issues LD2702201094 Paris TF-1 Television Network in French 1755 GMT 27 Feb 94 LD2702201094 Paris TF-1 Television Network Language: French Article Type:BFN [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by announcer Anne Sinclair; from the "Sept sur Sept" program; monitored in progress -- live] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sinclair] We heard today, Alain Juppe, that Israel has announced the release of 800-1,000 Palestinian prisoners, and that 'Arafat considers the Israeli proposals to disarm extremists only as superficial, since he is asking for the disarming of all the settlers. France has said that it condemns the massacre. What can you add to this? [Juppe] Grief, first of all, of course, and our sympathy for the families of the casualties. Nothing is sacred any more in the world today. Even places of worship are becoming places of barbarism and places of killing. [Sinclair] And today in the Lebanon, since today in the Lebanon, in a.... [Juppe, interrupting] I was indeed thinking about Juniyah too, where people were killed in a church. First and foremost, our condemnation and the horror we feel at such barbarism, as well as the desire to find out what really happened, since, as shown in the reportage you have shown, there are contradictory theses. It is necessary to get right to the bottom of what really happened. [Sinclair] Have you got an opinion? Do you think that it was indeed the act of a madman, as the Israeli government has claimed was the case, that is an isolated act? Or do you think that it is a genuine plot.... [Juppe, interrupting] I do not have more information than you do. You know, for six months now, it had been what we feared. Let me remind you that there was a declaration of principles on 13 September, and, over the following days, the mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization. It was a moment of joy at a time when the international situation was not always rosy, unfortunately. We thought: Peace is on the rails, at last. At the same time, we were all aware that all the hawks on all sides, and even the madmen on all sides, would do their utmost to break this process. This is the question which is being asked today: Will the peace process come to a halt? Or will we be able to give it another boost? [Sinclair] For you, could this, on the contrary, trigger a process which would be a bit quicker? Indeed, things have been dragging on since 13 September. [Juppe] This is what should be done, and this is a role France can play. Those involved in the peace process will need courage for this. I would like to hail those who have committed themselves to this; the Israelis, of course, Rabin, Peres, and also Yasir 'Arafat, for whom I have special thoughts this evening. I raise my hat to him, because he will need courage to continue on the way he has chosen. At the same time, it is necessary for the Israelis to react quickly and firmly. [Sinclair] What exactly are you expecting from the Israeli government? Do you think that the PLO is right when they ask for the disarming of all the settlers -- 120,000 of them? [Juppe] It is necessary to disarm all extremist movements who do not hide the fact that their objective is to halt the peace process. Disarming all settlers is a different matter, because many of these settlers have also been threatened, and there were casualties among Israeli settlers. In any case -- and this is an idea which I support -- it is necessary that the disarming of extremist movements and the security measures, which are indispensable in the occupied territories -- since it is still Israel, the Israeli government who is responsible for security -- give rise to the sending of UN observers so that they can control whether the proposed measures are efficient indeed. It is also necessary for the Israeli government to take confidence measures. They should release prisoners, yes, but they should do more than that. You said that there were between 800 and 1,000. I think that there are more than 10,000 in Israeli prisons. The issue of settlements must also be raised, i.e. the presence of these Israeli settlers in the occupied territories. [passage omitted] Change in the daily life of the people in the occupied territories -- and especially in Gaza -- is also a credibility test for peace. If peace is not better than war, why should the people in the occupied territories opt for peace? They must be given reasons to choose peace, and this is why their daily life must be changed. [Sinclair] You said earlier on that a number of measures must be taken. The Security Council has met and parted without any agreement. They will meet again tomorrow. What are you expecting from the Security Council precisely? You said that you were expecting it to send UN observers? [Juppe] I for one do not believe in sending an intervention force. We can see all the problems this causes, and we will probably come back to this later when talking about Bosnia. I do believe on the contrary that observers, who make it possible to control, to check what is happening, could be useful. It is not because the Security Council did not agree on anything today, this Sunday, that they should not continue on Monday. Experience has proven that tenacity in diplomacy is a cardinal virtue. [Sinclair] Alain Juppe, the cease-fire was violated in Mostar today. Three mortar shells were fired in Sarajevo yesterday. Two Bosnian soldiers were killed in Sarajevo on Thursday, and French soldiers were targeted at the airport. It is generally agreed that 20-30 percent of Serb batteries may not have been totally dismantled. Given the circumstances, can we say that the Serbs have yielded -- as you put it in an interview with LE MONDE'this week -- or is it a false defeat, as the magazine LE POINT put it? [Juppe] Nobody is crying victory, and I am not either, far from it. My first reaction last Monday, when we knew what was happening after the ultimatum deadline, was to say: This is a first step, the main things remain to be done. It is now obvious, the most important things remain to be done. Having said that, a number of facts must also be recalled. The first fact I would like to recall is that in Sarajevo, for three weeks now, there have been no further bombings. Three mortar shells were fired, it is true -- as you said -- yesterday. One was fired by the Muslims, two by the Serbs. However, on the whole, people can now go out on the streets. This is a change. [Sinclair] People can go out on the streets, but they cannot leave the town. [Juppe] No, of course not, it is only a first step. [Sinclair] There is still no water, no electricity, no telephone, and they cannot go out. It is still a besieged town. [Juppe] This is why our next objective -- after this first step, which means that children can get out of cellars and go sledging in Sarajevo, and I hope it will last, I hope it will with all my heart -- we must now come to the next stage [sentence as heard]. The next stage is what we call the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. What is a besieged town? It is a town one cannot leave, one cannot enter, which supplies do not reach normally. We must put an end to all this. This is why we have asked -- not to place Sarajevo under UN protection, as the report suggested, I took it down on my piece of paper, we never used such words ... [Sinclair, interrupting] UN-administered. [Juppe] We suggested it should be administered. We hope -- and I hope this will be possible for the Security Council tomorrow or the day after tomorrow -- that the United Nations will appoint, that the Security Council will appoint a high-ranking administrator who will address right away the restoration of daily necessities: water, gas, electricity, as you have said, and supply facilities. This is the second stage. [Sinclair] You said: It is not protection we advocate, it is administration. What is the difference? [Juppe] There is a significant difference. [Sinclair] Does it mean that UN troops will be in Sarajevo for 20 years, as was the case in Berlin? [Juppe] This is another matter, because, beyond Sarajevo and the effective lifting of the siege, that is the restoration of almost normal conditions of life in that town -- which cannot be taken for granted yet -- we have other two tasks to carry out. First of all, we must deal with the other zones in Bosnia where fighting is still taking place: Mostar, Maglaj, and others. This is why France, in the draft resolution which is currently being discussed by the Security Council at the initiative of France, has also suggested that the list of safety zones should be extended. And finally, it is necessary to think about the global peace plan, because, as I have said on several occasions, all these operations will not make any sense if there is no political settlement. [Simclair] I would like to come back to Sarajevo, just a couple of words. Is Sarajevo the capital of Bosnia or is it not? If it is, the capital of which Bosnia? Or will it be a town with a special status -- this is why I mentioned Berlin? [Juppe] No, there is no doubt today. As long as Bosnia- Herzegovina is a UN member-state -- which is the case -- its capital will be in Sarajevo and the Bosnian government is the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is why, a while ago, I dismissed the word "protection." The aim is not to place the Bosnian government under any protection. The aim is to make sure that the necessities of daily life can be met as quickly as possible in Sarajevo. Who are our opponents today in that race against time, if I may put it this way -- but time goes by so slowly in Bosnia that the expression may not be relevant. We have two opponents, three maybe. First of all, the inability of those signing documents to respect what they signed. There has been some talk about a fresh cease-fire between Croats and Muslims. You saw that a few hours later, it was violated again. It is thus necessary to maintain the threat, this seems vital to me. Fortunately, France is there to say it, together with a few others, the Americans especially. It is not because the ultimatum deadline is behind us that the threat is no longer there. The possibility to use air strikes to gag those who would not respect their commitments must be maintained. [Sinclair] I wanted to ask you something on this subject. When does one consider that commitments are not honored? Is there not a difference about this between NATO and the United Nations? The United Nations seems to be dreading military actions against the Serbs. This is what we saw the other day at Tuzla airport. Tuzla, after all, was declared a zone protected by NATO as far back as January. However, not only has Tuzla not been re-opened -- there has been some talk of the 7 March deadline, the United Nations extended it to the 18th [pauses], when does one consider that all the conditions are met for the threat to be used, as you put it? [Juppe] I am not the one who will decide. I am the minister of foreign affairs, I am not an officer, I am not on the ground. We have devised a precise procedure. It is up to the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] command, and you know who exercises it; a French general in Sarajevo, General Soubirou; a British general for the whole of Bosnia, General Rose; a French general for the whole of Yugoslavia, General Cot. It is up to them, who are on the ground, to say: In this particular case, we are asking for permission to use air strikes. We, the politicians, have said that we were ready to do so. In Tuzla, the question has been raised indeed, and I personally called the UN secretary general to tell him: If the UNPROFOR command ask you to order air strikes, I would like to tell you that France agrees to that, because the conditions were met. [Sinclair] Do you believe that the UN forces staff were timorous? [Juppe] It is up to the staff to decide; don't expect me to pass sentence on soldiers who are risking their lives on the ground. I said earlier that we had three enemies. I mentioned the inability of the belligerents to keep their word. The second enemy, or the second adversary, if I may say so, is the UN lack of resources, and I believe that this must be repeated again. It is not enough to vote through resolutions in the Security Council; money and troops are also needed. When security safe havens were set up, the UN secretary general said: I need an extra 7,500 soldiers to guarantee their existence. Only three countries in the world answered his call, which one? First, in July 1993, France which sent an extra 1,000 soldiers. Then two small countries, and this much to their credit, the Netherlands and Nordic countries [as heard]. [Sinclair] When we read your remarks in LE MONDE, you clearly called on the Americans to join us today. [Juppe] I call on everyone. In this tragedy everyone is lecturing us. I believe France has paid its fair share and even more than that, I recall that we had many killed on the ground. Finally, our third enemy, is the dissipation of diplomatic efforts. You showed it earlier in a video clip, negotiations are currently under way everywhere, In New York, in Bonn, in Geneva. [Sinclair] We will come around to this later. When you say more soldiers are needed, it must be understood that to run Sarajevo and all the other zones, that every time the Serbs pull back from positions they hold, these must be occupied by UN soldiers, this explains why more men are needed. [Juppe] Obviously. [Sinclair] Now to return to the issue of other safe havens, particularly the Muslim enclaves in Serb territory such as Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, and others, do you believe that the same method used in Sarajevo, namely an ultimatum, should be used? [Juppe] I believe that today, the ultimatum as a method is not justified. [Sinclair] Why? [Juppe] Because it is an unwieldy tool and because conditions are met to use force. Let's take the example of Tuzla. What was decided regarding Tuzla on several occasions, the last time on 10 and 11 January? Things are decided and then people are needed to recall what had been decided and to get things moving. It was decided to reopen the airport. [Juppe explains with help of map] It is an airport which is in a Muslim zone, the green zone [on the map], but it is under the threat of Serb guns. What was decided? It was decided to reopen the airport simply to dispatch humanitarian aid which is only reaching Sarajevo airport. [Sinclair] It must be recalled that a million and a half people rely on this humanitarian aid in this region. [Juppe] It is obvious that if aircraft could land here with food and medical supplies this would greatly help the action of non- governmental organizations and of the United Nations. The Serbs are refusing and say: If aircraft land, they will bring in weapons in the Muslim zone. The Atlantic Alliance decided to go in regardless and said that if the Serbs were opposing this and were shelling then they would be neutralized by the use of air power. [Sinclair] That was back in January. [Juppe] Yes, indeed. We were told from New York that this would take place on 7 March, this was then postponed to 18 March. I believe that it takes a great deal of time and that this operation could take place much earlier if a stronger political will were expressed. The same holds for Srebrenica [showing it on the map], a Muslim enclave within a Serb zone, where freedom of movement does not exist anymore. Once more the Atlantic Alliance has decided to restore this freedom to enable UN convoys and troops to move freely. In this case we have been discussing this for two months or six weeks, this is under way, but with great difficulties. [Sinclair] I am asking my question again: Do you believe that the United Nations is not as willing to react to this situation as NATO, which seems to be taking resolutions which have been followed by results in Sarajevo but not in these zones? [Juppe] Yes and no, but this is in keeping with the nature of each one of these organizations. What is NATO? It is a military alliance. What is the United Nations? It is an organization dispatching peace soldiers. Therefore, it is not unusual for the logic of the two organizations to be different and this is why the Alliance had to step in to support the United Nations. [Sinclair] I can sense your impatience. [Juppe] You see, as far as this case is concerned, if I were not impatient I would be unaware, well I have been trying to do something for the past 11 months and I can see that it is difficult. [passage omitted] The sensitive issue of access to the sea [for Bosnia] is that Bosnia-Herzegovina stops here, as we can see on this map. If we want to have access to the sea we must move through Croat territory, through Croatia itself, and the Croats are saying, we will not cut our own territory, we will not isolate Dubrovnik, therefore we refuse. We found a way to solve this issue which is one of the issues under discussion in New York today, it is to attempt to get Croats and Muslims together and to set up what we call a Croatian-Muslim federation. With this condition it seems that the issue of access to the sea could be solved more easily. This is a path which must be explored, it worries me somehow and I will tell you why. It looks as if in current diplomatic talks every issue is being dealt with bit by bit. We try to get Croats and Muslims to agree, and I am simply asking what will happen later with the Serbs? We must not forget that no global peace will be achieved if we do not reach a solution acceptable to all parties. Therefore I find it extremely important -- I was mentioning diplomatic efforts -- to get together all the pieces of the puzzle. [Sinclair] The Russians made proposals for an international conference but Western countries -- with the exception of Germany -- do not seem to fully agree, why? [Juppe] The idea as such is not bad. However, the Russians made proposals for an international meeting at the highest possible level, that of heads of state and governments. Can you imagine President Yeltsin, President Clinton, President Mitterrand and a few others meeting tomorrow or the day after? To decide what? An international conference must be prepared, we will be in favor of such a conference the day we have made progress, the day we have outlined a preliminary agreement between all parties. Meanwhile, and this must take place rapidly, this week, next week, talks at the level of experts, possibly at the level of ministers must move forward in order to find a solution acceptable to all. [Sinclair] When we speak of an agreement acceptable to all, what does it mean? The old Bosnian dream of a multi-ethnic Bosnia is over. Today we regret this Bosnia which has disappeared forever and we are moving toward something else, namely toward a Bosnia divided into several ethnically homogeneous republics, if I may so. [Juppe] In France we are lucky enough to have many ideologues who have set ideas, who have plans for Bosnia and their plans are that Bosnia should be a united state in which various ethnic groups would live together, as they are saying. [Sinclair] This was initially a Bosnian dream, before being adopted by the ideologues. [Juppe] Yes, but this dream does not fit reality any more, we must have the courage to say so. I am not convinced that we are helping the peace process by brandishing this idea which has been superseded by events today. First, I strongly question the use of the term multi-ethnic, this is the same people; cultures and religions are different but this is one people. When three communities have been tearing each other apart for several months, for several years, when they have been killing each other, raping each other and so on, how can you -- even if you are writing for a famous French weekly -- decide that they will be forced to live with each other? This is why the whole of the European Union, in agreement with the [warring] parties, moved toward the preservation of a Bosnia-Herzegovina member of the United Nations but made up of three entities: a Croat entity, a Muslim entity and a Serb entity maintaining very flexible links between themselves. The percentage of territory to be given to each one of this community was even very precisely drawn up. They accepted this and what I am wishing now is that we will not move too far away from this plan. [Sinclair] [passage omitted] When you say I question the term multi-ethnic, are you also questioning the term ethnic cleansing used this week again by the former Polish prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is the author of a report for the United Nations. He said this week that 2 million people had been forcibly displaced in this war and that ethnic cleansing was still continuing. [Juppe] I never questioned this. I am simply speaking of religious cleansing, these are religious communities, Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim caught in the middle. [Sinclair] There has not been any similar movement of population in Europe since the war. [Juppe] In Europe, but -- and this does not excuse these -- there were others elsewhere, when India and Pakistan divided in 1947, millions of people were displaced. There were movements of populations between Greece and Turkey too following the Trianon Treaty, and I condemn them. [Sinclair] Europe had another idea, namely to ban this on the continent. You hope that the diplomatic process will be cleared on the ground before this international conference which, I believe, you would like to be held in Paris following a French initiative. [Juppe] Why not? But this is not the issue, I believe that we should avoid any kind of chauvinistic behavior or competition, we must find ways to an agreement. I am tempted to say that the best peace agreement is not the one which is decreed to be the best following questionable norms, but the one accepted by all parties. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Before we discuss French politics, let us talk about Algeria. The leader of the Armed Islamic Group was killed by the Algerian security forces today. This group threatened foreigners and all those who may cooperate with the Algerian government, and claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of French nationals, including that of the Thevenot couple. There is endless violence in Algeria, an extremely difficult economic situation and the danger of social unrest. Where do you place General Zeroual's action against such a background? [Juppe] I would like to quote President Mitterrand. I believe he used this sentence about Bosnia: This concerns us. I don't think I need to explain why, apart from history, geographic closeness, and the importance for France to find a stable partner in Algeria. Because the instability in Algeria, the destabilization of northern Africa -- I need not go on -- we know what sort of results this can bring. I would like to pay homage to Mr. Joachim Grau, who has just been featured [in video report]. This interview [with him, last January] was moving, he explained that he had always lived there and that was his country -- he is the sixth French national to be killed. I would like to repeat -- I believe it is my duty to do so -- that we have taken every precaution to protect our community, which is significantly large there. Two-thirds of the children registered with French schools have returned to France. The number of diplomatic staff has been reduced. Relatives of private companies' employees working there have also returned, but none of these measures can be one hundred percent effective. The solution must come from Algeria, this is self-evident. For months now, we have been saying that first of all the Algerian economy must be reformed because what has been taking place there, in Algeria, is the result of 30 years of economic chaos and the blatant failure of a collectivized economy. Things must change. [Sinclair] The IMF has firmly asked for.... [Juppe, interrupting] Absolutely. The main news is that over the last three or four months, the Algerian government has established contacts with the IMF, has negotiated with the IMF and we, the French and the Europeans, have said that, should there be an agreement, we would be ready to offer Algeria our help so that it may try and get out of its economic slump which is fuelling the young people's unease. The second prerequisite is that there should be political dialogue. As General Zeroual himself said, the security solution is not a solution at all because we can see that the escalation of violence is continuing week after week. [Sinclair] Do you mean political dialogue between the Algerian authorities and members of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]? [Juppe] Absolutely, as well as the Algerian factions or the political movements who accept dialogue and leave their Kalashnikovs behind, including those members of the FIS who reject violence. It seems that this discussion process is now under way. Unfortunately, violence does not seem to decrease, and this is why I am still extremely concerned by the situation in Algeria.
