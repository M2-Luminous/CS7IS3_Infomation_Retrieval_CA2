Before leaving, Rabin held consultations with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in preparation for Peres' meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Davos, Switzerland. The discussion was long and detailed, and was attended by Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] generals, and Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who will accompany Peres in Davos. It was stressed that Israel would retain control of the external crossing points; there would be no PLO presence on the Jordan bridges. At the terminals, Israel would retain the right to check any person or object that gave grounds for suspicion; however, every effort would be made to make Israeli control of the terminal less visible.
