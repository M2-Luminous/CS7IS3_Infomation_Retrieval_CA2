During a news conference, Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Commission on Human Rights, describes as unacceptable the discussion of a draft anti-Cuban resolution draft sponsored by the U.S. delegation, which will be voted on next week. Perez Novoa deplored the U.S. Administration's policy of hostility based on the fact that it cannot bring itself to accept Cuba's level of development of social, economic, and political programs despite that hostility. Cuba has stated and reiterated over the years that it is ready to discuss its differences with the United States under conditions of sovereign equality and without preconditions. Perez Novoa added that the United States avoids and rejects normal relations and a discussion of differences.
