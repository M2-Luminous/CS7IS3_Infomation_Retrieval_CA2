They read: "Don't blame me -- I voted for Bush." However, this criticism is not representative. Most Americans do not regret the change. This applies both to those 43 percent who voted for Clinton and to some who prefered Bush or Perot. On his first anniversary, opinion pollsters affirm to the President, whose popularity dropped to an unprecedented low for newcomers in the middle of last year, that some 60 percent are now satisfied again with his performance. It was the same percentage that had expressed their advance confidence when Clinton first took office. That Clinton is seen as a man on whom people can pin their hopes has something to do with his personality. His engaging manners blend with the stylistic elements of a Kennedy and the communicative talent of a Reagan. At home, he is seen as a pragmatic worker who is ready to make compromises. Abroad, he is self-assured and presentable, which could be seen in his recent trip to Europe. One can hardly criticize anything about the form; if anything, one can find fault with the political substance, which sometimes appears to be lacking body. Clinton, who presented his administration as a clean prototype of a "new ethic," is nevertheless being followed like a shadow by the "question of character." The damage caused by old stories of women and business deals in Arkansas is still limited. The voters, who had heard about it, gave him a kind of absolution in the polls in November 1992. If the "revelations" that are still to be expected remain confined to his term as governor -- and do not extend to his time in the White House -- he will probably get out of it without much harm. However, since in the view of the U.S. media, presidents do not have a private life and have a transparent past, Clinton has to be watchful regarding everything that might look like an attempt to cover something up. The slow, albeit meanwhile recognizable, upswing is Clinton's most valuable political asset. Strictly speaking, the recovery may have more to do with Bush's careful laissez-faire and the responsible and flexible attitude of the U.S. Treasury than with Clinton. Still, he is profiting from it. Inflation and interest rates are low. Unemployment has decreased to 6.4 percent. In the last quarter of 1993, the growth rate was over 5 percent. The industry and the consumers are optimistic. Only national debts and the budget deficit remain at such a high level that any increase in funds has to be ruled out both for domestic policy programs and foreign aid. However, as an "activistic" government head, Clinton is exposed to this very temptation. In sharp contrast to the eighties, when Reagan, a Republican, denounced a costly, overinflated bureaucracy as "part of the problem but not of the solution," Democrat Clinton personifies the belief in the "good administration." His course corrections range from tax to family policy. They include courageous laws (firearms control, social work for scholarships) and controversial initiatives (admitting homosexuals into the Army, abortion at public expense). Yet, the three most ambitious projects -- health, welfare, and education reform -- are emerging only gradually. At the same time, doubts are rising whether these projects can be financed, particularly as far as the promised national health insurance is concerned. In foreign policy, Clinton can, at best, present a mixed balance. Here his first year often was an irritating tightrope walk between realpolitik and appeasement. Hesitation in the face of conflicts and the tendency to pursue the path of least resistance manifested themselves in many ways: in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, NATO turning down the Central Europeans out of consideration for Russia, and the treatment of the "nuclear communists" in North Korea. Empty threats and the obvious resolution not to interfere in alien conflicts cannot have won him much respect from despots of the likes of Milosevic or Cedras. On the credit side, Clinton can point to achievements in the one sphere he is interested in and that affects the U.S. pocket: foreign trade. Here, the acronyms NAFTA (North American Free Trade Association), GATT, and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation) stand for his most impressive success. In the Middle East, however, where the superpower sees its "vital interests" affected because of Israel and the oil reserves, Clinton's mediating activities -- from the handshake with 'Arafat to his meeting with Al-Asad -- are proof of a respectable commitment. The lessons Clinton learned from his first 12 months include the understanding that he can in no way keep out of foreign affairs, and, like a "laser beam," focus exclusively on national economy. Despite credible assertions of partnership, neither his leadership power nor his determination to lead have so far been sufficiently tested. In an unusual way, Clinton has turned out to be a new generation American. More than all of his predecessors since World War II, he has no problem with leaving Europe and other faraway regions more to themselves.
