FR940525-2-00092 FR940525-2-00061 Finally, the ability to effect direct cross-trades will avoid the adverse consequences of any market impact which trading in particular equity securities may generate. 8. BFM represents that each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 9. The Independent Fiduciary will provide written authorization before a Plan Account is permitted to participate in BFM's cross-trade program. This authorization will be terminable at will upon written notice by the Independent Fiduciary. BFM will receive no additional fee or other compensation for providing such cross-trading services. No penalty or other charge will be made as a result of the termination of an Account's participation in the cross-trade program. Before any authorization is made by a Plan Account, BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary for the Plan Account with all reasonably available materials necessary to permit an evaluation of the cross-trade program by such fiduciary. These materials will include a copy of the proposed and final exemption, an explanation of how the Plan Account's authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, and any other reasonably available information requested by the Independent Fiduciary. 10. The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction will be provided with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the transaction is completed. The confirmation will set forth information regarding the particular equity securities involved, the number of shares involved, the price at which the transaction was executed, and the specific ``trigger event'' (identified in condition 2(a) above) which caused the cross-trade transaction to occur. 11. BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program with a report, at least once every three months and not later than 45 days following the period for the report, setting forth: (a) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the previous period; and (b) with respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the subject equity securities were traded on the date of such transaction. In addition, the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program will be provided with a summary report at least once a year, and not later than 45 days after the end of the period for the report, which will include: (a) A description of the total amount of Plan Account assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade transactions completed during the year; (b) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization for the Plan Account to participate in the cross-trade program can be terminated without penalty upon BFM's receipt of a written notice to that effect; (c) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization regarding the cross-trade program will continue unless it is terminated; and (d) a description of any material change in BFM's cross-trade practices during the period covered by the summary report. BFM states that these reports will provide the Independent Fiduciary with a mechanism for monitoring the operation of the cross-trade program. BFM represents that the authorization procedures and the limited circumstances in which cross-trade transactions will be considered, in conjunction with BFM's use of the Optimization Program, will prevent BFM from favoring one Account at the expense of another Account in a cross-trade transaction. 12. The equity securities involved in any cross-trade transaction will be only those for which there is a generally recognized market with adequate pricing information to permit use of the Optimization Program for the Accounts. All cross-trades will be effected at prices determined according to an established, fixed methodology which will be applied uniformly to all Accounts. Under this pricing methodology, each cross-trade transaction will be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction, as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ). In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price will be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction in which case the price will be the last sale price for the securities. However, if more than one source is used by BFM to price a particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price will be equal to the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. BFM states that no foreign equity securities, other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available, will be cross-traded by the Accounts. The pricing methodology will be communicated to the Independent Account Representative at the beginning of the Account's participation in the cross-trade program. The pricing methodology will apply to all cross-trade transactions implemented by BFM under the proposed exemption. BFM states that utilization of an established, fixed pricing methodology will prevent it from being able to use any discretion to manipulate cross-trades to benefit one Account over another Account. Moreover, BFM will in all cases utilize price data obtained from an independent pricing source.
