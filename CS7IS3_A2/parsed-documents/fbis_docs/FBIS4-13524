Ahmad Bahr, head of the Gaza Strip Islamic Society, added that these negotiations should be carried out under an independent Palestinian decision that ensures sovereignty and security for the Palestinians alone. The negotiations should also take place under international supervision so that it will be proven to the entire world that it is Israel which is persisting in obstructing any efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive and just peace. Bahr added: These negotiations must proceed within the framework of the strategy of Hamas and with the support of its leadership and leaders abroad, and be preceded by a truce between the Israelis and the Palestinians in order to ascertain the sincerity of Israeli intentions. Bahr called on Rabin to change his hard-line and suppressive policy in the occupied territories -- a policy that is being implemented by the Israeli Army against defenseless civilians and which has led Hamas to retaliate in an exceptional way against Israeli civilians, as Hamas is not eager to kill civilians because this is forbidden by Islam. Bahr believes that the resolution of this conflict lies in the hands of the Israelis who daily are committing massacres, destroying houses, and violating the human rights of Palestinians to live in freedom and peace on their soil and homeland.
