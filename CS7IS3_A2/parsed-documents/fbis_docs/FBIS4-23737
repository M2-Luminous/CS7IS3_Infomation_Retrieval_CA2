Today at around 0600, while representatives of the two armies were meeting at the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] headquarters, government soldiers and Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militias abducted 32 people from their refuge at the Saint-Famille parish in Kigali. When this information reached the Rwandan Patriotic Front representatives, they left for the Saint-Famille parish in the company of UNAMIR officials to obtain details of the incident. This doubtlessly forced the abductors to release their victims. Evacuation operations, which were affected today by the barbaric acts of government soldiers, will resume tomorrow.
