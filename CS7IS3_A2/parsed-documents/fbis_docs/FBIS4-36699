FBIS4-36699 "drnes113dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th on Donor States Meetings, Need for Aid Sha'th on Donor States Meetings, Need for Aid JN1006141794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1045 GMT 10 Jun 94 JN1006141794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the Palestinian delegation to the international coordination committee of donor states, in Paris by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jerusalem; date not given; from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] [Text] [Sha'th] Meetings were held yesterday with all members of the coordination committee of the donor states, including the World Bank delegation. I believe they were important meetings on the road to translating the obligations and promises made by these donor states into quick and direct financial aid, which can contribute to pushing things forward to establish the new central administrations, to respond to the needs of thousands of Palestinians and their families who have suffered for a long time under the occupation, and to respond to the needs of economic development to create jobs for the Palestinians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, who are suffering from severe unemployment. The donor states are called upon to extend all this aid in a form of specific material aid during today's meeting, God willing. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, of course you have reviewed the difficult economic situation for the participants in these meetings, as well as the need to immediately delivering funds in order to implement the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. What approach are the participants states taking? [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, there is an awareness of the pressing need for this international aid, which should be in the form of quick cash, and not merely commitments and promises. There is also a realization that the peace process is completely reliant on the Palestinian National Authority's [PNA] success in turning this [self-rule] agreement into a tangible thing for the Palestinian people. It must let them realize the benefits of peace and the other meanings of freedom, dignity, independence, and the building of the homeland and economic development. I believe that there is a realization of all this. However, we are waiting today to see if this realization has been transformed into quick aid. [Mu'addi] Are there any reservations by the donor states which could obstruct the transferring of funds to the Palestinians? [Sha'th] I cannot see true reservations in this sense, particularly after the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction has been established, after the new budget has been prepared, and after the PNA has assumed powers in Gaza and Jericho. However, these states should move from the state of realization, feeling, and interest into a state of paying funds. These states have rules, laws, and constitutional institutions, and therefore, we should encourage them to move quickly to the stage of implementation. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is today's agenda, and when do you expect the decision will be made? [Sha'th] Today, there will be a meeting to be attended by all states. These states' members will make statements, beginning with the Palestinian delegation. The meeting will end at 1700 with a news conference. So, we should expect practical results before 1700. [Mu'addi] A final question, what are the sums of money we are talking of, Dr. Nabil Sha'th? [Sha'th] We are talking about translating promises of more than $2 billion into specific sums to be paid during this period, or next month and the months which follow, in order to rectify the deficit in the budget, and to allow funds to pour into economic projects. So, we are talking about $100 million, at least, at the beginning.
