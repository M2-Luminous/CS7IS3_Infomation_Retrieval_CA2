SUMMARY: The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(4)) requires that all agencies publish in the Federal Register a notice of the existence and character of their systems of records. Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is adding a new system of records entitled ``Accounts Receivable Records_VA'' (88VA20A6). DATES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the proposed system of records. All relevant materials received before December 5, 1994, will be considered. All written comments received will be available for public inspection in Room 119 of the address given below, only, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays) until December 13, 1994. If no public comment is received during the 30-day review period allowed for public comment, or unless otherwise published in the Federal Register by VA, the new system of records, and the routine use statements included therein, are effective December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed routine uses may be mailed to the Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs (271A), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel D. Osendorf, Director, Debt Management Center (389/00), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, 1 Federal Drive, Ft. Snelling, Minnesota 55111, (612) 725&hyph;1844. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for collecting debts resulting from individuals' participation in certain programs administered by VA. These programs include_but are not limited to_compensation, pension, educational allowance, guaranteed and direct home loans as well as education loans. VA established the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS) in 1975 as a pilot project for automation of debt collection and indebtedness record retrieval. At the time, and for a number of years after, collection activity was shared among the Centralized Accounts Receivable Division (CARD)_a division of the VA Regional Office and Insurance Center in St. Paul, Minnesota_and the 58 individual VA regional offices. Generally, collection techniques were limited to written requests for payment and referral for litigation to the United States Attorneys. CARD collected only certain categories of debts while the regional offices had responsibility for the remaining categories. Methods of locating delinquent debtors were relatively expensive and labor-intensive. Since the inception of the CARS pilot project, additional means of automated collection and locating debtors have either been authorized or made available by new technologies. Chief among the vehicles broadening the scope of debt collection authority was the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365). The Act authorized disclosure of personal information to consumer reporting agencies, made possible disclosure of taxpayer mailing addresses to creditor agencies and authorized disclosure of debtor information for purposes of administrative and Federal salary offset. Since the enactment of Pub. L. 97&hyph;365, new technologies have enabled creditor agencies to pursue authorized collection activities with increased efficiency and innovative methods. These methods, in many cases, involve some form of computer matching. Among the new technologies is the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS). This is an automated telephone system enabling participating Government agencies to verify information provided by new loan applicants. Information for CAIVRS is retrieved from an automated data base. In 1990 and 1991, VBA debt collection activities for major benefit programs were, for the most part, consolidated under one automated system_CARS_and one organization_Debt Management Center (DMC), The Director, DMC, reports directly to the VBA Chief of Staff. CARS is, now, the system of record for indebtedness accounts resulting from participation in all major VBA programs, except the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program (38 U.S.C. ch. 30 and 10 U.S.C. ch. 106). While that program's indebtedness records are maintained on a personal computer system, certain ch. 30/106 debt-related computer matching services are performed by DMC through CARS. With the new means of collection and locating debtors developed over the years, computer matching with other Government agencies has become a significant part of the routine activity conducted by DMC. Computer matching using CARS data is performed in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended. Disclosures are made as routine uses under Privacy Act systems of records 58VA21/22, ``Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records-VA'', and 55VA26, ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records, and Vendee Loan Applicant Records-VA''. Typically, the responsibility for revising or introducing new routine uses associated with debt collection falls upon program staff who are not directly responsible for debt collection operations. This new system of records is being established to reflect the centralized environment VBA continues to build for collection activity as well as to provide the public with one reference for routine use disclosures related to debt collection. The debt collection program adheres to VA security and reporting requirements under title 38, Code of Federal Regulations and other Federal regulations, as well as the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), and the appropriate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, title 26, United States Code. Approved: October 27, 1994. Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
