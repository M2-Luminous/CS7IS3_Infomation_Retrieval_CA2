(Zandie) added that there are virtually no such threats from Russia in reality, and that much would be done for Latvia's security by Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program. In (Zandie's) view, cooperation with Russia would also be good for NATO. At NATO headquarters today, the Latvian Defense Ministry delegation met with two other NATO spokesmen. During the meeting they mainly discussed European security problems and the involvement of NATO in solving them.
