As the May Day demonstrations have shown, there are not a few wishing to become such a leader. Moreover, even such discarded political figures as Valentin Varennikov are trying to play first fiddle. Yesterday Varennikov was registered as a candidate for the Federation Council in the Chelyabinsk constituency. A founding congress of the Accord for Russia movement, scheduled for 19 May, is supposed to elect a Russia-wide leader. The chances of Valentin Varennikov's making it back even into a group of opposition leaders, just as of securing a seat in parliament, are not very good. The opposition has far more colorful figures capable of claiming a leadership role. These are primarily Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Valeriy Zorkin, Ilya Konstantinov, and Sergey Baburin. It was originally believed that they would all rally around the Accord for Russia movement whose founding congress, scheduled for 19 May, will clear up who is the most important among them. It can be presumed even now, however, that one of the initiators of this movement, Valeriy Zorkin, will most likely not be such. Obviously the Accord was to have become the former Constitutional Court chairman's sponsoring organization because there are no other forces behind him. However, although representatives of the majority of opposition parties and unions have signed the program document of this movement, no mighty coalition has emerged. "October heroes" Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ilya Konstantinov are currently engaged in creating a new movement, The State [Derzhava]; Gennadiy Zyuganov has a self-sufficient Communist Party which has no particular need for blocs with any other organizations. Generally it now turns out that the majority of opposition politicians are convinced that Zorkin is obviously unfit for the role of leader, while the Accord has no chance of becoming much more than a Moscow political club. As for Rutskoy and Konstantinov, it is also difficult to see any forces standing behind them. Meanwhile Rutskoy has already promised that the State movement will encompass thousands of people, that it will have an "iron discipline," and that finally, it will come to power no later than in a year. Yet it is absolutely unlikely that the opposition will want to recognize Rutskoy as leader. Most politicians from this camp relate to him negatively. Stanislav Terekhov considers him one of the main culprits for the October defeat while Gennadiy Zyuganov is convinced that after the amnesty Rutskoy must leave the political arena altogether. Even Konstantinov, who calls Rutskoy a friend, says in private that the former vice president "usually changes his views three times a day." The political bankruptcy of the majority of the current opposition leaders could prove beneficial for Communist Party Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, who will thus get rid of competition. The fact that Zyuganov heads Russia's largest party and bears no responsibility for the opposition's October defeat makes him the most acceptable figure for the role of Russia-wide opposition leader. How realistic his chances of becoming such will be shown by the congress of the Free Russia People's Party, scheduled for 22 May, whose leadership Rutskoy may give up for the sake of creating the State movement. Then the sole thread linking the former vice president to any consequential political movement will be broken. Also critical for Zyuganov's future will be the Accord for Russia congress.
