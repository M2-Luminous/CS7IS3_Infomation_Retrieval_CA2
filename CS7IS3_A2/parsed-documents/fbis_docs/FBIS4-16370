"It is impossible to stop this process and its politicizing is inadmissible," Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov, on a visit in Moscow, declared in his interview with Interfax. He pointed out that "in general, refugees return to their homeland irrespective of the course of the negotiations." "We have been solving this problem for a year already, the department of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, Russia and Uzbekistan render their backing to us. More than 60 percent of refugees, primarily from Afghanistan have already returned to their homeland, said Alimov. Lavrov [as received] believes that the delegations must negotiate so that all refugees willing to return to Tajikistan could do this. The Tajik leadership should undertake additional measures in order to ensure security for returning refugees and their reintegration into the political, economic and cultural life of the republic. It is necessary to realize that the process of return of refugees is irreversible. There might be attempts to hinder it but only on the part of the opposition, Alimov stressed. In his words, some time ago as may as 700 refugees were already prepared to return to Tajikistan from the neighboring Afghanistan but this process was suspended due to a rocket shelling of the border. "Unfortunately, last year we also experienced great difficulties with the repatriation of refugees due to an outbreak of Cholera in the boarder area," Alimov stated. "If the parties started to exploit the plight of refugees to solve their immediate problems it would be a serious mistake," said Alimov.
