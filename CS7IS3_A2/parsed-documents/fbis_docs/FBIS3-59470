The data show that, as of yesterday, Croatia has used more than 13 million kw per hour. The Slovene distribution system has been recording "stolen" electricity. Each hour, day and night, it has notified the Croats by fax that they have exceeded their quota. So far over a hundred reminders have been sent. The employees were unable to tell us what they plan to do if Croats continue to violate the agreement. They are awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Croatia continues to import about 6 million kw per day from neighboring countries.
