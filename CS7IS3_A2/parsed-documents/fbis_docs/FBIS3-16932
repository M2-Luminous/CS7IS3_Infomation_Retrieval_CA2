For four years, he has been working against the odds for the transfer to private ownership of the Russian production apparatus. His tactic, which is not very "capitalist" (150 million coupons have been distributed to citizens who invest them as they wish in auction sales) has managed to create millions of small shareholders. It absolutely must end on 30 June 1994. On that date, the transfer of property will theoretically have been achieved, but the enterprises' problems will still exist. [Gherardi] Does the new political configuration in Russia endanger the privatization process? [Vasilyev] I do not think so. The people all have privatization coupons, and now they feel they own something. No political party dares to call that into question. Of course, there is no lack of critics: the Communists and Centrists, for instance, say that the military-industrial complex and land should not be privatized. But President Yeltsin has never stopped expressing support for privatization. The proof of this is that the Committee for the Management of State Property chaired by Anatoliy Chubays has remained in place. [Gherardi] And what is the public's attitude? [Vasilyev] I would say that there is "quiet support" for the privatizations. The people find that things are not moving quickly enough, those in remote provinces are insisting that they should not be left out. We have tried to move closer to them with our 90 regional committees. It is true that there is frustration, especially among those who squandered their coupon at the start. [Gherardi] How did they lose them? [Vasilyev] We distributed one coupon per person (in other words around 150 million coupons), with a face value of 10,000 rubles [R] (Footnote 1) ($1 equals R1,600. The sum of R10,000 is more a convention than a price), but sold for the symbolic sum of R25. Some preferred to immediately exchange their coupon for cash -- or vodka. Others made a bad investment and are regretting it. But a coupon market was very quickly established: The rate stagnated at around R5,000 until mid-1993 and then rose to almost R30,000 after the October events (Footnote 2) (The attack on the rebel Parliament) and returned to between R20,000 and R25,000 in recent weeks. [Gherardi] What means do the Russians have for judging the enterprises in which they invest? [Vasilyev] There are information campaigns in the newspapers and on television. But it is primarily by word of mouth. The enterprises in the energy, oil, and food processing sectors are very successful, as are hotel chains or stores. On the other hand, the public does not really like the firms in the military-industrial complex. [Gherardi] What is the status of privatization operations? [Vasilyev] They are progressing very rapidly. Around half of the industrial apparatus has already been privatized. Eighty million coupons (in other words 55 percent of the total) have been turned into shares. The people who waited, hoping that better enterprises would be put onto the market later, have not necessarily miscalculated, but they are then likely to run out of time: The coupons lose their value as of 1 July 1994 (the date has already been postponed by six months and there will be no new postponement). On that date, 70 percent of industrial property will have been transferred to the private sector. We will have become a bourgeois country! [Gherardi] Do the Russians prefer to buy the enterprise which employs them? [Vasilyev] Not necessarily. Just 15 to 20 percent of the coupons have been used in that way. By the way, that gives an idea of how much confidence the employees have in their enterprise! The biggest share (27 percent) has been invested in joint investment funds: 640 of these funds were created in a few months, and the largest one received 3 million coupons. And 10 percent of people decided to invest in enterprises other than their own. [Gherardi] Has privatization changed some aspect of corporate management? [Vasilyev] Privatization has not radically changed the situation on the ground. The positive point is that there are now identified owners. Of course, the structure of the capital is not very efficient: In three-fourths of cases (out of 8,300 enterprises sold by the end of December 1993), it is the enterprise's employees who have bought 51 percent of the capital. But in this privatization formula, 29 percent of the remaining capital must be auctioned (in exchange for coupons). It is true that the power has largely remained with the existing shareholders, but the freedom to sell shares will lead to reorganizations. There are already quarrels between the directors and outside investors to buy their shares back from the workers. They are approached even on the shop floor! [Gherardi] They will not have been "bourgeois" for very long... [Vasilyev] Not all are prepared to sell! There will be many small investors in Russia for a long time. That is not necessarily a bad thing. That creates a class of small owners who form the strongest basis for democracy. I will go even further: Hitherto there had been no social support for a policy of combating inflation; this new class will very quickly see the importance of financial stabilization and will give its support. In this sense, stabilization and privatization go together. [Gherardi] But what future can enterprises "privatized" in this way have without fresh capital or new men? [Vasilyev] The problem of recapitalization will very soon be raised. Nothing prevents enterprises from issuing new shares. Half of those which have been privatized have done so or are preparing to do so. Of course, that creates great competition to secure capital: The enterprises will be forced to open up their capital structure and often to give up control. But this will be a natural process, without any intervention by bureaucracy. They have assets they can sell. They will also try to establish alliances with foreign or Russian partners. [Gherardi] Is there a difference in productivity between the privatized firms and the others? [Vasilyev] We cannot see it very clearly yet. All the enterprises must be reorganized in a radical way: Know the market better, organize their distribution, and improve production. That will take at least one or two half-year periods. But there are dozens of examples of very efficient enterprises, even on an international level. We can mention firms like Lubertsy, which manufactures carpets in the Moscow area; or Kurgan in the Urals, which produces parts for oil extraction equipment; or even clothing factories in St. Petersburg. The quality they produce is comparable with that in other parts of the world, but at much lower prices. [Gherardi] Which enterprises still have to be privatized? [Vasilyev] We have already sold very big companies, such as ZIL (automobiles) for instance, which now have thousands of foreign shareholders. Others were of a more modest size. The average number of employees in the privatized enterprises was around 1,000. At present, we are preparing for the privatization of Gazprom (Footnote 3) (Gas monopoly which was chaired by current Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin) for April. This is an enormous operation: 89 million shares representing 29 percent of the capital will be offered to the public. I think the demand will be very high. [Gherardi] What share will continue to be owned by the state? Will Russia be a mixed economy? [Vasilyev] The mixed economy exists everywhere, it is a question of degree. There are natural monopolies which will remain in state hands, like RAOES, the Russian equivalent of EDF [French Electricity Company] or some enterprises in the military-industrial complex. But the state should be involved as little as possible in corporate management, it is incapable of running enterprises.
