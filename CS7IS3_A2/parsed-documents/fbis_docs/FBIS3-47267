Reporter Yi Hak-sil, of the Central Broadcasting Station, met with Chang Tae-pong, vice minister of the Building Materials Industry Ministry, and Han Song-chon, deputy director of a bureau of the ministry. [Begin recording] [Yi Hak-sil] I congratulate you on the Building Materials Day. [Chang Tae-pong] Thank you. I feel deep emotion in greeting this significant day. Thirty years ago, on 8 January 1964, the great leader convened a consultative meeting of functionaries in the building materials industry sector and made there a historic speech entitled "On some measures to develop building materials industry." The great leader's historic speech at the meeting was a programmatic guideline in founding and developing a self-reliant, modern, and our own style building materials industry. This is why our functionaries and workers in our building materials industry sector have significantly celebrated 8 January every year as the Building Materials Day to commemorate forever the day which opened an epochal turning point in developing the building materials industry of the country. [Yi] We can say that our building materials industry has traversed the road of rapid development thanks to the great leader's wise leadership and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's energetic guidance. What do you say? [Han Song-chon] That is right. The great leader took epochal measures for developing the building materials industry right after the national liberation and since then he has wisely lead on to build building materials production bases throughout the country. Our building materials industry today has greeted a new heyday in its development thanks to the tested leadership and energetic guidance of the dear comrade leader who is upholding the great leader's lofty intent. We can say with great dignity and confidence that large-scale cement plants and many building materials production bases have been built throughout the country thanks to the wise leadership and great consideration of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. We will also further plan and coordinate organizational and political work and production guidance so that all work sites that have been built into self-reliant and modern building materials production bases, which can outstandingly guarantee any large-scale construction projects, can produce more building materials. Thus, we will further enhance the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style through the success of more building materials production. [end recording]
