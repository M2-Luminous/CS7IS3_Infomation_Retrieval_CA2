Wounded soldiers were meanwhile pouring into military hospitals from frontlines 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the city where dawn artillery duels left three southern troops dead and 28 wounded, the officials said. Two shells hit the fish market at al-Mu'alla on the sea front, killing two people and wounded around a dozen others, several seriously. A salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five houses in the working class district of al-Mansurah. Shells also hit the Khormaksar district near the airport and northern suburbs near the front. A southern military spokesman said three missiles were also fired at Aden, two of which were brought down by anti-aircraft fire. The third exploded on the hills overlooking the town, injuring two women and damaging wooden houses. Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been locked in civil war for almost two months.
