Russia is transferring more troops to areas near Finland because of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, and the implementation of Start II is making the Northern Fleet the most important nuclear weapons center for Russia. Klenberg was explaining the military development of the Calotte area in Rovaniemi today. Klenberg said that there are no changes in the military situation in northern Europe despite the upheavals in Central Europe. Klenberg also reiterated the defense forces' negative stance toward new road and railway connections to areas that are important from the military point of view. However, the Ministry of Communications is continuing to plan the Salla [northeastern Finland] railway line. Experts evaluating the profitability of the Salla railway line have recommended that one-third of the financing come from share capital and long-term transport agreements. The rest would be financed with loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Ministry of Communications is to have talks on the project with the Russians at a ministerial meeting planned for the autumn.
