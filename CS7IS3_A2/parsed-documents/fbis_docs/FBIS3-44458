Eighteen open border posts have been set up along its 4,200-km border line. Last year, some 470,000 Chinese and foreign business people went through these posts as well as 2.07 million tons of cargo, up by a third than in 1992. By now, the region has established an extensive transport network of railways, highways, water routes and airlines. The Hulun Buir league in the north of the region, which is famous for its flourishing border trade, has set up seven trading posts along its 1,700-km-long border line with Mongolia and Russia. To date, the league has established stable trade relations with more than 1,000 firms from 22 countries and regions, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Mongolia, the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Besides, the league has opened 12 tourist routes leading to the vicinity. In 1993, the volume of barter trade between Chinese, Russian and Mongolian tourists stood at 20 million yuan (3.4 million U.S. dollars) and one billion rubles (8 million U.S. dollars), respectively. Manzhouli has always been called the "bridge of Eurasia" for its large trade handling volume. Since the city was approved by the government to be an open outlet in 1992, it has become China's largest border trade city, which has multiple functions, including exporting, processing, financial trade, international transport and storage. Erenhot, another renowned border city, also launched large-scale construction projects last year. As more new roads, trade centers and storehouses are being built, the city is developing into a new grassland border trade center. To make it possible to do business all the year round, a bridge is expected to be built across the Erhkuna river along the Sino- Russian border. Meanwhile, air traffic is expanding. In addition to the weekly flight between Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar, capital of Mongolia, a through-flight between Hohhot and Hong Kong is to open to traffic before long. The region's second airport, Hailar airport, is to operate soon.
