FBIS4-58367 "drnes086_j_94013" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Statement Reports Activities of Southern Army Statement Reports Activities of Southern Army JN0405063494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 4 May 94 JN0405063494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by Defense Ministry and General Staff Command spokesman; place and date not given] [Text] Even as the homeland was still recovering from the bloody wounds of the regrettable 'Imran tragedy, which was caused by the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party leadership as part of its criminal scheme to fragment the homeland, and instead of learning a lesson from that tragic incident in which the homeland lost some of its best army personnel and was the biggest loser, that gang continued to escalate the military situation, fabricating and inflaming tension in the homeland without the least sense of responsibility or remorse. It is currently issuing orders to move and mass forces in the direction of the old border areas. Yesterday, 3 May, it moved the 'Abbas, (Tasyir), and Milhim Brigades toward the former border areas in the Shabwah axis. This is a new link in the chain of escalation and tension which reveals the aggressive ambitions of this criminal gang and its hostile stand toward the Yemeni people and Yemeni unity. It barricaded itself behind these military units over which it practices its hegemony, turning them into a sword brandished against Yemeni unity. It did so after obstructing all sincere efforts to merge the Armed Forces and rebuild them on national and scientific bases, prevent party affiliations within their ranks, and keep them away from party and regional influences and political conflicts. It refused to apply the law banning party membership in the Armed Forces, considering these forces a national institution and the property of all the people as well as a shield that protects the homeland and its unity. It sought to sabotage the institutionalized and disciplinary structure of the Armed Forces through a series of unpatriotic and irresponsible acts. It enlisted into the Armed Forces party-affiliated groups who had nothing to do with the military. They were given grants, rank, and promotions in a haphazard and illegal manner and were instigated and wrongly indoctrinated to split national ranks. The source added: Today, we call on the heroes of the valiant Armed Forces in the units over which the party maintains a tight grip and in whose ranks the party exercises the process deception, charlatanism, and forgery, to express their national and responsible stand in favor of the people, homeland, unity, and constitutional legitimacy. Exposed are the worn-out, aggressive, and criminal gang and its diabolical scheme through which this secessionist group seeks to implicate the comrades in arms and companions of duty and struggle in bloody and destructive fratricide. They did this not in defense of the homeland, its sovereignty, security, and stability or to safeguard its democratic system and gains or the accomplishments of the September and October revolutions, which were watered with the blood of martyrs and sacrifices of strugglers and the people's sweat and hard work, but to maintain the seats of power, the parochial interests, and selfish and destructive whims. Therefore, they are beating the drums of war and pushing the heroes of the Armed Forces to fight. They are doing so when the blood of the martyrs of our people and Armed Forces in Abyan, Shabwah, Dhamar, and 'Imran is not yet cold. The valiant fighters of those military units, who are pushed by the renegade and separatist gang of the Socialist Party to instigate infighting to destroy the homeland and fragment its unity, will live up to their national responsibility and natural position. They will be in the right trench alongside unity to defend it and the homeland and to ward off the advocates of separation and wars. They will stand against that separatist gang which seeks to dismantle the homeland and takes money in payment for the souls of the innocent martyrs. Out of a sense of responsibility and sacred duty, in appreciation of the sacrifices of the martyrs, and in order to spare the homeland the inferno of death and destruction, we call on those brave heroes to reject all orders issued by that oppressive gang that defies the homeland, constitutional legitimacy, and the people's genuine morals and values. That gang views the homeland only through its narrow interests. It deals with the people only through its adventurous ambitions and crazy desire to oppress the people through the tools of death and destruction of everything beautiful in this beloved homeland. May God, the people, and the public opinion be witness that we have warned against the gravity of those reckless stupidities. We appeal to the rational ones in the command of the Socialist Party to responsibly assess the situation, resort to reason, heed the calls of peace, brotherhood, and love, to maintain the security and stability of the homeland and citizens, and not to be dragged into the fabricated lies which seek to trigger new bloodshed and tragedies for the public.
