Good Luck!"] [Text] After two weeks of work, the State Duma took a breather until 1 February. It was expected that the deputies would hurry back to their voters to share their first impressions and hear the initial reactions to their activities as deputies, but many parliamentarians remained in Moscow. By no means have all the questions of work and daily life been settled. Setting up in a new place is a complicated business. This also applies to the workplace -- who sits where and in what kind of surroundings. You would not give this job to any highly paid assistant. The committee arrangements, now generally completed, give some idea of the Duma members' aspirations. Let us dwell on two for the moment. The most densely populated is the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finance Committee. According to the latest figures, it will have 43 members. "Russia's Choice" and "New Regional Policy" [NRP] will have the numerical majority, with nine representatives each. The remaining factions are represented by between two and four deputies. It is interesting that before being elected to parliament, 20 of the 43 Duma members who wanted to make their mark in this sphere of legislation were directors of small enterprises or trade houses, chairmen of commercial banks, or presidents of private investment funds: in short, people who understand budgets, taxes, banks, and finance. It is also interesting that even the factions that are ideologically incompatible delegated "private capital" representatives to the committee. The stratum of economists is very thin. The conclusion is that the division in the committee will not be along notorious "monetarist-producer" or "market-state" lines, but where private and corporative interests meet. Perhaps this very committee will set an example of civilized lobbying. Now a few words about the composition of the Defense Committee. It has been reported that it is headed by Colonel Sergey Yushenkov ("Russia's Choice). His deputies are Nikolay Bezborodov (KPR [Communist Party of Russia]), Yevgeniy Loginov (LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]), and Aleksandr Piskunov (NRP). All three are servicemen. The committee includes four representatives of the NRP, three each from "Russia's Choice," the Communists, and the LDPR, and one each from "Women of Russia," the Democratic Party, and the Agrarians. And the committee is not so large that it cannot be listed in full: Vladimir Volkov (history teacher from Orsk), Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov (defense and security adviser to the Russian Federation president), Andrey Generalov (president of the trade and industry chamber in Tutayevo), Marina Dobrovolskaya (chairman of the Union of Navy Women), Georgiy Lukava (head of department at the Moscow State Technical University of Civil Aviation), Aleksandr Mikhaylov (chief of the Russian Federation Agriculture Ministry Main Administration for Kolkhozes), Colonel General Yuriy Rodionov (Russian Federation deputy chief military inspector), Yevgeniy Fedorov (serviceman), Nikolay Fedorov (lawyer), Artur Chilingarov (president of the Association of Polar Expedition Members), Sergey Churkin (coordinator of the Vologda LDPR Oblast organization, and Anatoliy Yaroshenko (director of the "Bolsheurinskoye" joint-stock company, Bolshaya Urya, Krasnoyarsk Kray). It is hard to say how efficient these Duma Defense Committee members will be and how quickly they will set up a legislative mechanism. One thing is clear, though: All members of the Defense Committee, and of the other committees, as a matter of fact, are simply doomed to cooperate. Communists and democrats, reserve sergeants and generals, the young and the experienced -- they have all committed themselves to providing laws for the serviceman's life and service and laws that will enable Russia to defend itself and its interests. So all we military people can do is wish the new committee normal, efficient work under the slogan: "Less politics and more laws."
