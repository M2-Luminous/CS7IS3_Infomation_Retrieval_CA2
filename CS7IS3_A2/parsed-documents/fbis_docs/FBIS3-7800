Dear Mr. Chancellor, I would like to thank you for your letter and for the efforts you are investing to help Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. I am particularly grateful for the support Germany has lent us in the crucial moments before the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. The residents of Sarajevo have lived to see the end of the two-year nightmare, during which one of every four citizens has been killed or wounded. However, the city is still under blockade, and Serbian artillery withdrawn from around Sarajevo has obviously been redeployed on other battlefields, which has disturbed the balance of power on those battlefields. Maglaj and Bihac have come under heavy attacks, which could result in thousands of fresh victims and further ethnic cleansing. I believe that the final elimination of Serbian artillery is a condition for any serious political negotiations. The current military imbalance to the advantage of the Serbian side has turned the peace negotiations into a diktat. Our hopes for a speedy denouement to the Bosnian crisis are linked to resolving our misunderstandings with the Croatians. We signed a cease-fire agreement which is to come into effect on 25 February. I hope that this time the Croatians will honor the agreement and withdraw their forces which, according to the UN secretary general's report, consist of at least 5,000 soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Croatia. The involvement on the part of Germany and the United States would probably help Bosnia and Croatia find a solution to this situation, and to re-establish cooperation in many areas. Yours sincerely, Alija Izetbegovic
