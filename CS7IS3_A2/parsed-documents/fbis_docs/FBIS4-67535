The environmental situation in China is more serious than most people might have realized, says Zhang Kunmin, vice-director of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). Pollution is particularly severe in some economically-developed and densely-populated regions; and city pollution has been worsening and spreading to the rural areas. The pollution caused by rural enterprises is also more serious as indicated by a survey conducted by NEPA. Environmental pollution and ecological damage have become a barrier for economic development, social stability and reform and opening to the outside world. "Insufficient investment, outmoded production facilities, and lax law enforcement are responsible for the current environmental problems," said Yang Zuojing, deputy director of NEPA's pollution treatment department. China spends 20 billion yuan ($2.30 billion) on environment protection every year, which is 0.7 percent of its annual gross national product. Such a percentage is low. But in a time when the country is thirsty for development funds, it is not easy for the government to rapidly increase investment for protection. How to protect environment effectively without much financial investment has been analyzed and reanalyzed. Their are many options including the introduction of clean production methods, better management of environmental investment and stricter law enforcement. NEPA is considering setting up a national environmental protection methods, better management of environmental investment and stricter law enforcement. NEPA is considering setting up a national environmental protection fund, combining government environmental spending, overseas investment as well as enterprises' licence fees for emitting pollutants. Based on this fund, a national protection investment corporation can be established to deal with transprovincial environmental problems and help the central government implement international treaties. This will make better use of investment. An experiment in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, has proven effective. In 1988, with the support of the NEPA, the Shenyang Environmental Protection Investment Corporation was founded to oversee the design, bidding and management of environmental projects. Part of the local government's old allocation was transformed into the environmental fund, which the Corporation then gave out as loans. By the end of 1992, the corporation handled more than 162 million yuan ($18.6 million) of environmental loans. The sum of environmental funds also tripled to 30 million yuan ($3.5 million). With more money, problems are easier to solve. The corporation is supposed to be responsible for its own losses and gains, but it still retains some administrative power. It receives guidance from the city's environmental protection bureau and its loans, to a certain extent, are still government allocations. If the receivers of the loans use them efficiently, they do not return the principal; if not, they will have to repay part of the investment and interest. But the fund managers have their headaches. Because the interest rate of the loans is much lower than that of the banks, some enterprises would rather delay in repayment. This has affected the flow and growth of the funds. If a national investment corporation is to be founded, the government's environmental allocation to enterprises should be transformed into loans and the interest rate of the loans should be raised, NEPA sources suggested, adding that the enterprises' licence fees for emitting pollutants should not be used freely. Besides a better management of the investment, the NEPA has also tried to introduce clean production methods. In clean production, manufacturers select the best treatment programme after examining possible pollution sources in each production procedure. According to Yang, with the aid of the World Bank, NEPA started clean production programmes in Beijing, Yantai, in Shandong Province, and Shaoxing, in Zhejiang Province in 1993. The programme aims to establish model clean production bases, introduce clean production technology and give technical training classes. Up to now, about 50 Chinese people have attended clean production classes given by foreign experts. With little investment, 51 pollution reduction packages have been adopted in six enterprises in Beijing, altogether 203 tons of COD were reduced and some 6.3 million yuan ($724,000) was saved. Yang has high hopes for the investment bank and clean production programme, but he is less optimistic about the prospects of law enforcement improvement. The awareness of environmental laws is low. More often than not laws are not strictly observed and enforcement is lax. Some officials, especially the senior ones, let power and opinion overrule laws, Yang said. Many times the environmental protection agencies find themselves lacking the authority to solve the problems facing them. "There is no clarified legal articles stipulating the kind of punishment for the law violators," Yang said. Some environmental protection departments in enterprises and local governments have been merged or cancelled. And some local environment protection chiefs have been replaced when they try to do their job. Theoretically speaking, enterprises and projects seriously breaking anti-pollution laws should be shut down. But it will be a difficult decision to make because the State has to consider the benefits of the unemployed workers--most of whom would from State factories [as published]. Yang urged that relevant laws and regulations be amended. Now some enterprises would rather pay fines for emitting pollutants than treat pollution, which costs many times higher. Statistics from GUANGMING DAILY indicated that the fines for environmental pollution in 1992 and 1993 totalled 5.05 billion yuan ($580 million), but during the same period, the money invested to treat the pollution reached 5.57 billion yuan ($640 million). To keep up with the new realities of the market economy, the State plans to upgrade a series of environmental laws this year, including those concerning the air and water protection.
