The latest move comes in the wake of recent pronouncements by the U.S. Government to cut off all aids and diplomatic efforts for peace in the Liberian crisis because of continuing setbacks in the full implementation of the peace accord. The Transitional Legislative Assembly subcommittee on disarmament headed by Dusty Wolokolie, and the committee on reconciliation, headed by former Margibi County representative under the defunct NDPL [National Democratic Party of Liberia] government, David Menyongai, are presently in Gbarnga holding talks with the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in Gbarnga.
