The situation of Cuba and the "landlocked position" of Bolivia and Paraguay were the cause of difficult negotiations among the foreign ministers of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which concluded Wednesday in the Colombian Caribbean city of Cartagena de Indias, according to different diplomatic sources. Another thorny issue was the Argentine proposal to include an antiabortion statement, which was debated under the umbrella of the "defense of human life" to which the declaration finally alluded. The negotiations led to a change in the text, which toned down the implicit all-out defense of privatization that appeared in the preliminary drafts of the document. Also, the recommendation to prevent an "excessive emphasis" on economic adjustment plans, which could affect state help to the neediest population, was eliminated from the draft. The corrected and eliminated points were a source of irritation to countries, such as Argentina, which have seen their levels of absolute poverty and unemployment rise, despite a parallel growth of the gross national product achieved through fiscal austerity. The document, which maintained the neoliberal aspect of the policies that are applied by the majority of the countries, was signed by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, in exchange for a more vigorous mention of the U.S. embargo against the island. The mention of Cuba, although indirect, includes the words "coercive" and "unilateral," which happens for the first time in an Ibero-American statement since the "summits" began four years ago in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who organized and hosted the event, asked that the "landlocked" topic that annoys Chile be discussed by the foreign ministers of that country, together with the foreign ministers of Paraguay and Bolivia. Bolivians have claimed formally since 1979 the territories on the Pacific Ocean that they lost to the Chileans in a war last century. The controversy was unleashed by the recommendation to "seek more favorable conditions for countries of relatively less development," with a "special" mention of the "landlocked" position of Paraguay and Bolivia. The foreign ministers struck out the names of Paraguay and Bolivia and replaced the controversial wording with "the factors of the geographical situation referred to in the last paragraph of Article 18 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty (ALADI)," that is the unnamed "landlocked" situation. Argentine President Carlos Menem promised Pope John Paul II he would promote an Ibero-American condemnation of abortion, with a view to the upcoming World Conference on Population and Development that will be held this coming September in Cairo. Laws in Spain, Portugal, and Mexico, however, give women the right to resort to abortion under given conditions. This precluded reaching a unanimous decision. The matter was overcome at the last minute with the inclusion of the "commitment" to "respect the right of human life, the right to health, and the quality of life of mothers and children" and "to contribute in an relevant manner" to the meeting in Cairo.
