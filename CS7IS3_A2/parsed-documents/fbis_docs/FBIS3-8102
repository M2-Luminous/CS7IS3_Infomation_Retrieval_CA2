This agreement, which was reached under the auspices of the United States, has been interpreted differently. Moreover, there are many reserves about its feasibility considering the fierce Muslim-Croatian clashes that have been underway for several months already. However, some dilemnas still remain and are still appearing. Where, in fact, lies the final [words indistinct] when Serbs are completely ignored in all this? [Jovanovic] First, this is a bilateral agreement, and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a (?trilateral) civil war. This is a bilateral agreement that was reached with the active help of a foreign power, which also sets certain limitations. Finally, this is an agreement that, in the way it works, is virtually suspending, if not disregarding, the tripartite agreement on the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was reached at the Geneva conference. These are three facts that represent [word indistinct] objective limitations on the agreement and cast a certain light on the agreement as an independent action that has been developing while disregarding, and often contrary to, what has so far been done within the Geneva conference and in the ancillary efforts, be they within the European Community, by Russia, or by some other countries. However, if this bilateral agreement is aimed at a humane goal, that is, to extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and at the moment, the only form of real civil war in Bosnia is the war waged between the Muslims and Croats, and if on the basis of that result it wants to regulate relations between the Muslims and the Croats in a permanent way, not touching on the interests and rights of the third, Serb, side, then there will be nothing to object to in such an agreement. However, if it has some other aims, if it not only left the third side unconsulted, but even faced it with an impossible choice between accepting and rejecting the agreement -- albeit in case it fails to accept it, it would have to be punished for its alleged uncooperativeness -- then this agreement could be qualified as the agreement of two sides against the third, with the assistance of a major power. I would not like to forecast that this may come true, but if it nevertheless happens, it will be a big step backward in comparison with the present situation and the efforts made within Geneva conference for a tripartite, just, and permanent end to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this agreement, we have several elements that warn that this offer will be of very little attraction to the Bosnian Serbs. The setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being returned to the canton concept, a concept of several cantons to boot. Central authorities are essentially strengthened compared to what was envisaged in the constitutional arrangement in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics. And finally, what is most important, the question of territorial borders has not been mentioned at all, and this setting of borders should be done, above all, in close cooperation with the Serbian side. The fact that this most-important question, without which there is no further work, [words indistinct] in this (?bilateral) agreement, is the greatest drawback of this agreement as it points to its basic weak point, that is, that it is an agreement of two sides and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a war of three sides. And the third side, which was probably the most significant in this situation, was not included in the process of agreeing and decision making, so that it remains completely unclear as to what further attitude the authors of the agreement and the people interested in its implementation are going to have toward the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how could all that reflect on the current state of Serbian-Croatian relations? What I have in mind is what has been reached in Geneva in the agreement on the beginning of normalization of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb? [Jovanovic] The decision of the two sides, Serb and Croatian, to make the first step in the process of normalization represents the result of awareness that without settling Serbo-Croatian relations on the whole, there can be no mention of any permanent settlement of the situation and stability in the Balkans. This awareness is not only this on the Croatian and Serbian sides, but also on the side of all other factors who are involved in solving the Yugoslav crisis. Therefore, logically, this Washington agreement should not suspend the agreement between the governments of the FRY and the Republic of Croatia on opening offices on both sides, nor should its provisions, and particularly its unexpressed aims, confront the aims that the opened process of normalization of relations between FRY and Croatia wants to reach. However, many unclear points in the Washington agreement, above all the unclear point on the question of the further treatment of the Serbian side in Bosnia and also the ambiguity regarding the attraction [privlacnost] that made Croatia accept something it has always categorically rejected so far, commands caution as well as an increased carefulness. For any attempt to put this agreement into practice or to interpret it as an agreement against overall Serbian interests may not only aggravate the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also call into question the very process of normalization between the FRY and the Republic of Croatia. [Colovic] Some people fear that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon become -- if it is not exactly that already -- an arena of competition between the United States and Russia for the division of spheres of interest, not only in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia, but, also, starting from the war in Bosnia, the competition would spread to the entire Balkans. How would you comment on that? [Jovanovic] Well, it cannot be good if the crisis in Bosnia would last longer or if it was complicated further. It cannot be good for the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for the interests of the neighboring states, and certainly not for the peace and stability in the region as a whole. Everybody who thinks responsibly about politics is doing everything with a view to ending this war as soon as possible and finding a complete, just, and permanent solution. However, there are a lot of foreign interests that have, after all, brought about the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and pushed its people into the civil war, that have still not been satisfied, and that can also expand and be realized only with the continuation of the crisis. A quick end to the crisis does not suit many of these interests, and particularly not an end that would cap the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina and accelerate the solution of other aspects of the overall Yugoslav crisis. What is alarming, even after this Washington agreement, even though there is plenty of talk about the end of war, peace, and political cooperation between some entities, is that we are still not close to this goal and that, perhaps, we should fear that we will not get all that close to it if the suspicions that this agreement means the reanimation of a Muslim-Croatian axis against the Serbs on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and against the FRY prove to be true. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, finally, can you say a few words about the future of the international conference on former Bosnia-Herzegovina and former Yugoslavia? Can the latest development of events threaten it? Is its mandate changing? I am referring primarily to the new initiatives. There has been talk about the summit of the five, which, as it is alleged, would also be open to others? [Jovanovic] The peace process has so far evolved within the framework of the mandate and support of the UN, the European Union, and other relevant international factors, primarily the Bosnia-Herzegovina factors, understandably. The Washington initiative and its fruit, however, are a result of an entirely separate treatment of the important segments of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, independent of the framework of this peace process and even contrary to the hitherto joint stance and of the outcome that was particularly pronounced in the constitutional document about the regulation of the Bosnia-Herzegovina union. In this sense, and bearing this in mind, it is difficult to reconcile all these contradictions and see a future for the work of the Geneva conference on the basis of the Washington document. One thing should have been clarified beforehand, namely, either to establish the end of the so-called Owen-Stoltenberg plan or to announce the birth of a new plan, a new method, and a new approach that is expressed in the Washington document. On the other hand, there is the Russian initiative, which departs from the responsibility of the five biggest states and does not negate and oppose the results of the Geneva process, but, on the contrary, wishes to accelerate the completion of the construction of peace on the basis of these results. However, the United States' reserve toward the Russian initiative has now materialized and it is now evident why the United States failed to support this initiative -- because it was preparing to launch its own initiative without the participation of others, and, in our case, without consulting the Serbian side. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, in the name of the listeners of the Argument Vise [Argument More] program, thank you very much. [Jovanovic] Thank you, too.
