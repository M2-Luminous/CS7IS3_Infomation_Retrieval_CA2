"It is like telling a fox to guard a henhouse," say coalition Sejm deputies. Yesterday, the National Defense Committee [KOK], which includes the president, the prime minister, Sejm and Senate speakers, the chief of the General Staff, the BBN chief, and the four most important ministers, adopted a document prepared by the National Defense Ministry [MON] entitled "Fundamental Problems of Poland's Defense System." It is an assessment of the country's security and a demonstration of future directions for reforming the defense system, said Henryk Goryszewski at a press conference. We recommended the document to the Council of Ministers. We deleted only one or two little pages.... But the problem is that these "little pages" relate to the most important issues, among them, who is to be the boss of the chief of the General Staff (Army commander): Is it the defense minister or the president? KOK made a decision that Goryszewski will prepare a law dealing with all types of conflicts of powers and that he will present it in two weeks. According to unconfirmed sources, MON chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk was the author of the idea; he is clearly getting impatient with the ongoing debate on supervision of the Army. Prime Minister Pawlak supported Kolodziejczyk because he did not want to be at odds with the president. The Council of Ministers Defense Issues Committee adopted a document entitled "Concerning Problems of the Country's Security" more than a month ago. In the document, the committee noted that an army's subordination to the defense minister is typical for European countries. But Goryszewski is in favor of the Army's subordination to the president: One should counteract party influence over the Army. After all, the government in this country consists of parties and party coalitions. In Goryszewski's view, MON has so far not come up with a draft law that would define the powers of the president and the minister. But, among the appendixes to the "Fundamental Problems..." there is such a draft law that contradicts the president's ideas. Prolonging the dispute is very dangerous to the Polish Army, says former Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Freedom Union. All of this should be settled soon, while the chief of the General Staff should be subordinated to the minister, just like it is done in a majority of European countries. Well, KOK wants that, so let Goryszewski write, write, write..., Jerzy Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of the Sejm Defense Commission, told GAZETA WYBORCZA in an indolent tone.
