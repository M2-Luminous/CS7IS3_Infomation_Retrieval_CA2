FR940317-0-00019 FR940317-0-00006 This interim rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis must be identified with a metal eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. We estimate that the cost of applying eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected will be less than $50. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
