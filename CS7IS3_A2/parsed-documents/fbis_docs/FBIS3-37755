An understanding was reached Monday during telephone talks between President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan and the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, a spokesman for the Georgian leader has informed Interfax. The spokesman said that Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya is expected to visit Ashgabat this week to continue the talks on postponement of the Georgian gas-supply debt to Turkmenistan. By different estimates the debt amounts to $100-400 Mn. Meanwhile, the energy crisis in Georgia has reached a peak. For two days, the republic was only supplied with a minimal of electric energy owing to the accident at the Tbilisi hydro-electric station. Metro, TV and radio stations did not work in Tbilisi. There is no water supply in Tbilisi homes. Telephones are on the blink. The leader of the Georgian Energy Department Yuriy Chediya has told Interfax that the Tbilisi hydro-electric station has been repaired and supplies energy once again. The spokesman said that the situation would be critical if gas supplies were cut.
