FR940831-2-00056 FR940831-2-00041 Listing of Controlled Carriers Under the Shipping Act of 1984 AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Amendments to list of controlled carriers. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission is adding Vietnam Sea Transport and Chartering Company and POL-America, Inc. to the list of controlled carriers, subject to the advance tariff filing and other regulatory requirements of section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984. The Commission is removing the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines and the Far Eastern Shipping Company of Russia, from the list of controlled carriers. Information received indicates that they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier pursuant to section 3(8) of the Shipping Act of 1984. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert D. Bourgoin, General Counsel, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sections 3(8) and 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(8) and 1708, provide for the identification and regulation of certain state-controlled carriers operating in the waterborne foreign commerce of the United States. The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') has determined that Vietnam Sea Transport and Chartering Company (``Vietnam Sea Transport''), headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and POL-America, Inc. (``POL-America'') headquartered in Gdynia, Poland, meet the definition of a controlled carrier under section 3(8) of the 1984 Act, and are, therefore, being added to the list of controlled carriers. Upon inquiry by the Commission, Vietnam Sea Transport responded that its operating assets are directly owned by the Government of Vietnam (``GOV'') and that the GOV has the right to approve or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, including the chief operating or executive officer of the carrier. Vietnam Sea Transport advised that it intends to operate at least two Vietnamese-flag vessels in its service in the U.S. cross-trades. POL-America responded that Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia, Poland, a government-controlled carrier, holds the majority interest (70 percent) of POL-America. Under the 1984 Act, government ownership is deemed to exist where the majority interest of a carrier is held by a government entity or instrumentality. In this case, Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia, according to Commission records, is owned by the Polish Government. All vessels operated by POL-America are under the Polish flag. The Commission has determined to delete the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines (``NSCP'') and the Far Eastern Shipping Company (``FESCO''), currently named ``FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C.,'' from the list of controlled carriers, because they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier set forth in section 3(8) of the 1984 Act. Information submitted to the Commission by NSCP indicates that the Government of the Philippines (``GOP'') sold all of its rights, title and interest in NSCP's three vessels of Philippine registry, as well as all of the issued and outstanding shares in NSCP, to Madrigal-Wan Hai Lines Corporation (``Madrigal''), a private corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines. Sixty percent of Madrigal is said to be owned by A. P. Madrigal Steamship Company, Inc., a private Philippine Corporation owned by Philippine nationals, and forty percent is owned by Wan Hai Lines Limited, a private Taiwan corporation owned by non-Philippine nationals. The Commission is also advised that the GOP has no right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, or the chief operating or executive officer of NSCP. The Commission has determined that because NSCP is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the GOP, it no longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list of controlled carriers. FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C., the legal successor to the Far Eastern Shipping Company, provided information advising that it was created pursuant to the Russian Federation President's Decree No. 721, which enacted measures allowing state enterprises to incorporate as private limited companies_stock societies. FESCO was organized and registered in the Russian Federation on December 3, 1993. FESCO reported that as of July 15, 1994, fifty-five percent of the company's shares belong to individual shareholders comprised mainly of current and former employees of FESCO. FESCO further advises that: twenty-five percent of the shares belong to 70 legal entities; the remaining twenty percent of the shares belong to Primorsk Region Committee for the State Property Management, a government entity, which is required to sell these shares either to legal entities or individuals before December 3, 1995; FESCO's operating assets are neither directly nor indirectly owned or controlled by the Russian Federation or any governmental entity; and that the Russian Federation does not have the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of the directors or the chief operating or executive officer of the company. The Commission has determined that because the Russian Federation neither owns a majority interest in FESCO, nor has the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of its directors, or its chief operating or executive officer, FESCO no longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list of controlled carriers.
