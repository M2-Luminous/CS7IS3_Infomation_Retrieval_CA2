I believe that Yuriy Meshkov's statements regarding the separation of Crimea from Ukraine are ill-considered, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an exclusive interview with UKRINFORM correspondents today. It would appear that Meshkov is doing this out of emotion or in order to aggravate the situation. His statements saying that Ukraine should give up Crimea are, to say the least, not serious. It is a territory of Ukraine that is recognized by the whole world community, Kravchuk said. Kravchuk believes it is unlikely that the Republic of Crimea would be able to lead a proper life without Ukraine. If our links are severed, the peninsula's population of almost 3 million will feel it straight away. But we do not want to give in to emotions and arrogance, the Ukrainian president stressed. Kravchuk believes that Meshkov's illegal actions could become a barrier to friendly relations and partnership between Ukraine and Russia. That is a great responsibility for one man, who, profiting from current misfortunes and difficulties, flouting all international norms, is trying to separate Crimea from Ukraine. But apart from aggravating the situation, he will not succeed in doing anything, Kravchuk said.
