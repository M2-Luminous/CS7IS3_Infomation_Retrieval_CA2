The declaration, which was written by five UN experts, gives Indians worldwide the right to self determination. Based on the history of African countries, the Brazilian Government believes such a concept may give the Ianomami Indians, for example, the right to declare independence from Brazil. The Brazilian concern is considered exaggerated by the Indian defense organizations present at the meeting. In a long speech Ambassador Gilberto Saboia clearly established that Brazil intends to oppose this or any other concept that places national sovereignty in jeopardy. "The Declaration of Indian Rights must be simple, balanced, and realistic," the ambassador said. Gilberto Saboia reminded the representatives at the meeting that such a declaration will have to be approved by consensus. That is, without the consent of Brazil the whole text will not be approved. Saboia said Brazil does not accept the expression "indigenous peoples" in the draft declaration, for the same reason: The word "peoples" is historically linked with independence. The ambassador said: "Statements like that in the draft declaration may prompt ambiguous interpretations that are out of keeping with international law, the principles and objectives of the UN Charter, and the basic principles of the sovereignty of state and territorial integrity," Saboia wants UN experts to clarify the meaning and extent of the principles described in the draft declaration which guarantees the rights to autonomy and self government for Indians. The controversy continues because the process of preparing the declaration does not end there: Before approval, the declaration must go through a series of negotiating channels within the United Nations and cannot be approved by the UN General Assembly without the agreement of members like Brazil.
