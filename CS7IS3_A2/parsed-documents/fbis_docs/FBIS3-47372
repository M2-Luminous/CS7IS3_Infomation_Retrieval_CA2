Luciano Pettinari, international secretary of the Italian Party for Communist Refoundation, said the United States is trying to justify its military threat to North Korea on the pretext of "preventing" the latter's "nuclear program," but could convince nobody of it. It is foolish of the United States to try to force "sanctions" on North Korea through the UN Security Council, he said, adding: The point in question is that nuclear warheads aimed at the North and more than 40,000 U.S. troops present in South Korea pose a greater threat than a feasibility of North Korea's "nuclear program". S.J. Mabulla, chairman of the Scientific and Technical Association of Tanzania, said that if the United States wants to save its face as a great power, it had better honestly respond to talks with the DPRK. Noting that if the United States truly want a solution to the nuclear problem, it must sincerely accede to talks, the Radio Reloj Nacional of Cuba said that a peaceful solution of the nuclear problem depends entirely on the attitude of the United States. The Swiss paper UNSERE WELT said that the United States should renounce its policy hostile to the DPRK and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.
