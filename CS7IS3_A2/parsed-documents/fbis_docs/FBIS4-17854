Lukin also pointed to "the weakness and dissociation of the Russian policy both at the inter-ministerial level, and at the level of interaction between the Foreign Ministry and the presidential administration. Our diplomacy decided to exert pressure on the Serbs in a rougher way, using a personal factor," he noted. In Lukin's opinion, this factor lies in "the halo of heroism around two successful trips by our leaders to the Balkans," created by the media, having in view Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy, representative of the Russian president in former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin. Such coverage of the trips, he said, led to the fact that "the mission of our leading diplomat turned out to be counter-productive." Lukin pointed out that neither Russia, nor the West in isolation can handle the situation in the Balkans and they should act in coordination with each other. Lukin said that upon return of the parliamentary delegation from former Yugoslavia, his committee intends to work out recommendations for the president on adjustment of the policy toward the Balkans. He noted that these recommendations "will also concern the gradual lifting of sanctions against republics of former Yugoslavia if they fulfil certain conditions."
