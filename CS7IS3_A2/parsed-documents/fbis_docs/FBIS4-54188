Japan's Construction Ministry and France's Housing Ministry will confirm which materials will be eligible for exemption by the end of October. The plan, which is slated to come into effect in November, will also cover construction methods. France will be the first country to agree to have talks on such a reciprocal requirement with Japan, though Japan hopes to make a similar agreement with the United States and with Canada, they said. An examination is required for construction materials and methods by each government for safety measures against strength or fire. But each country has its own requirement. For instance, a certain French construction material that meets French standards has to be checked again in Japan when it is imported here.
