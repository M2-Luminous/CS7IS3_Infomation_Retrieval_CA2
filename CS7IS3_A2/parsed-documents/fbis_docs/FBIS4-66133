Eduard Kiener, director of the Federal Office for Energy (OFE), made this statement on Wednesday evening [18 May] during the Rundschau program on the German-language television network. He added that he had already expressed this opinion before a parliamentary commission, but that he had not received any answer yet. An OFE report, which has not been published so far, indicates that the DSN requires 15 to 18 additional persons. Questioned by journalists of the Rundschau program, Mr. Kiener said that if a critical event should happen, it could be said that the DSN does not have enough personnel. According to him, parliament is partly responsible for this situation because of its "personnel freeze" policy. Beznau II The Rundschau program also revealed that the operation of the Beznau II Nuclear Plant has been modified, which has led to an increased level of radioactivity in the pressure containers of the reactors. [DSN director] Naegelin said this issue would be closely examined. There will not be any increased risk. If a negative result should appear, there is still time to take corrective measures, he added. According to Mr. Naegelin, even though the plant does not meet the current technical standards for safety, the measures taken are sufficient.
