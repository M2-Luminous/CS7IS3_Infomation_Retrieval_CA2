This was stated today at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He stressed that "without waiting for explanations about what the minister of foreign affairs was really saying, or at least for the full text of his speech, representatives of the U.S. Department of State and some Baltic states deemed it possible to make hasty and unfounded statements." One gets the impression, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted, that "instead of concentrating on the continuation of constructive work to finalize the agreements and treaties that are now the subject of negotiation, our Baltic partners have lifted individual quotations out of context in order to attract world attention yet again and to try and gain certain political dividends from this." According to Karasin, "another aim of this maneuver is to whip up an artificial hullabaloo and avoid making decisions on how the rights of the Russian-speaking communities in Latvia and Estonia can be properly safeguarded." "In our view, the West should also be concentrating attention on these problems rather than criticizing a Russian minister in the way that an official spokesman for the U.S. State Department allowed himself to do," Karasin declared. According to the Russian representative, the heart of the matter was "explained at length by the Russian foreign minister during yesterday's television address, and then again in the closing stage of the conference. "We do not see any need for additional clarifications," Karasin concluded.
