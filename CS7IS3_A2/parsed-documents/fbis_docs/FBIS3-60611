Dimitri Kljuev keeps calm. He stands by the red phone, his eyes glued to the control panel, which shows a leak in the first circuit -- in the reactor area. As Kola reactor block IV shift supervisor, he gives brief instructions. In a short time the 440-megawatt plant is back under control. Kljuev and his six colleagues take a break. "Tomorrow we really get down to business," says the Russian nuclear engineer. Peter Reibert, who is in charge of the Greifswald nuclear power station training center's 25 computers, will be giving Kljuev and his colleagues something to sweat about. In an inconspicuous- looking building, CAG, an offshoot of the former Greifswald nuclear power station, simulates the nightmare of many an environment policymaker: "Our program embraces everything, from a measuring instrument breakdown right up to the worst emergency scenarios." The team from the Russian island of Kola will spend three weeks in front of the operating panel, where they feel quite at home: The control room is identical to their Russian model, and all the reactor reactions are simulated in real time. The crucial difference is that Greifswald stores almost 150 standard accidents to which WWER-213 reactors have succumbed, whether they have occurred in the Ukraine, Bulgaria, or Hungary. "We train for emergencies here," says Reibert. Every move that the operating personnel makes is recorded on camera and discussed. When necessary, critical situations can be repeated and analyzed. The simulator in Greifswald was originally intended for in-house use, training personnel for the local nuclear power station in GDR days. When the reactor was shut down for safety reasons after unification, the simulator was retained, and the Federal Environment Ministry has been financing additional training for eastern European nuclear engineers there to the tune of about 2 million German marks a year since 1992. More than 20 reactor crews have taken the three- week crash course to date. There are over 40 plants in the WWER class -- not to be confused with the Chernobyl type -- in eastern Europe; the low level of training, in the former Soviet Union in particular, is scandalous. Moscow had all the know-how for handling atomic plants, but the collapse of the USSR brought a split in responsibility for atomic piles as well. "New states, such as the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Lithuania are now cut off from the brains of the nuclear industry and left on their own with their reactors," says Bernd Mueller, head of CAG. This notwithstanding, none of these states is keen to forego the use of nuclear power. The reactors -- none of which meets western safety standards -- are still running. "A further drop in standards is only to be expected," says Reibert. Skilled staff are emigrating as well. In the Ukraine, for instance, some plants can only run five shifts instead of the normal seven, while the Russians have withdrawn all their technicians from some reactors in Kazakhstan. There are hardly any facilities for training reinforcements. Training takes place on the job, and knowledge is often handed down by word of mouth, the "elders" passing their experience on to the younger generation. When they arrive in Greifswald and confront the entire accident potential inherent in the plants where they work, it is a nerve-racking experience. "After four or five hours' constant stress, we give them the afternoon off, otherwise it's too much for them," says trainer Reibert.
