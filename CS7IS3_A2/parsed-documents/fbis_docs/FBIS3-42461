Lipscomb had already predicted the possibility of the similarity of the structures of a B[.sup]32[/]H[.sub]32[/] molecule and a multi-atom carbon molecule with the Formula C[.sup]60[/]. The shape of the 20-sided B[.sup]32[/]H[.sub]32[/] molecule is similar to the ball-shaped C[.sup]60[/] molecule [the buckyball]. Lipscomb and his colleague L. Massa (New York's Hunter College) conducted a systematic study of the possible correspondence between boron compounds and fullerenes--the new class of carbon molecules that include C[.sup]60[/]. In the boron hydrides, the boron atoms bond to each other to form a particular shape and the hydrogen atoms radiate from the cages formed by the boron atoms. Superimposing the two molecules, the 60 carbon atoms on the boron hydride molecules match up with the hydride molecule's 60 faces, while each of the 32 boron atoms would fall smack in the middle of the faces formed by the carbon atoms. You can calculate the number of matches using the Descartes-Euler formula, which describes the fit between the two types of molecules by summing the number of faces and the number of atoms in the vertices (less two). In closed geometrical structures, contacts represent the connecting lines between vertices; in molecules--they represent the shortest distances between neighboring atoms. Like fullerenes, hollow boron molecules should have new useful properties. Lipscomb and Massa suggest chemists try to make closed boron hydrides using laser beams to vaporize a calcium boron compound in the presence of hydrogen.
