Before he left, he had time to give a lecture on his policies lasting nearly two hours to foreign correspondents working in Helsinki. Zhirinovskiy's main message this time was that the West should keep its hands off Russia. He considers himself to be the savior of Russia. Sinikka Siekkinen has been following Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. [Siekkinen] During his visit, Zhirinovskiy has been busy in different parts of Helsinki and given controversial statements, sometimes at a striptease night club and sometimes at the grave of Mannerheim. Immediately after his arrival, Zhirinovskiy threatened Estonia with occupation and Finland with nuclear war, but official Finland kept quiet on Zhirinovskiy's statements. This is how Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto answered my question today. [Begin recording] [Siekkinen] Is Finland cringing before Zhirinovskiy when Finland has not officially reacted to his statements? [Haavisto] In my view he has been here as the guest of the Eduskunta, and in my view the Eduskunta should take responsibility for his visit here and his possible statements. [end recording] [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy, who is experienced as a troublemaker, has been banned from several countries, but wherever he is, he raises curiosity. At the news conference this morning, many had come to listen to Zhirinovskiy in order to try to understand his line of thought. Zhirinovskiy rewarded his listeners by giving a fairly comprehensive but confusing and controversial review on the aims of his policies. The starting point of his policies is that Russia has been betrayed three times this century: First during the Russian Empire, then during communism, and now during the so-called democracy, however, this time without weapons. Zhirinovskiy will not tolerate a fourth time. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian fading to English translation] Either the West leaves us alone and we take care of our own problem and solve our own problems. [end recording] [Siekkinen] He urged the West to keep its hands off Russia, because according to Zhirinovskiy, Russia can solve its problems itself and if the West does not realize this, the disintegration of Russia will continue and there will be a third world war. Zhirinovskiy regards himself as the savior of Russia with a historic mission. The greatest threat to Russia comes from the south, where there are 400 million Muslims. Zhirinovskiy regards them as barbarians who also threaten Western Europe unless he and Russia stop the south, with nuclear arms, if need be. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian, fading to English translation] I am against using, I am an opponent to the use of any kind of weapons, whether it be nuclear or conventional but [words indistinct] the interest of Russia. [end recording] [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy says that he is against the use of any kind of weapons, but if Russia is threatened, it has the right to use all kinds of weapons it has, including nuclear weapons. After these statements Zhirinovskiy left for home to solve the problems of his own parliamentary group. Yesterday, two members of his parliamentary group resigned, tired of Zhirinovskiy's policies.
