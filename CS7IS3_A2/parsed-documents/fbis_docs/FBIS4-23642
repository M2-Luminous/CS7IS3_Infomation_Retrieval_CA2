They finalized 22 draft resolutions which will be submitted to the heads of state by Monday. One of these texts, probably the most striking, calls for a return to peace in Rwanda. We shall come back to this later. [passage omitted] Rwanda is the subject of a draft resolution. Dominique de Courcelles has read it: [Begin Courcelles recording] The Council of Ministers strongly condemned the massacres and killings that are still being carried out in Rwanda and called for an immediate end to them. It added that this was a crime against humanity and called for the trial of those behind them in accordance with international law. It called for an immediate end to hostilities and the institution of a cease-fire. It called on the belligerents to put an end to any hatred propaganda through their media. Finally, it asserted yet again that the Arusha peace accord was the basis for a lasting solution to the conflict. It was pleased to note that several African countries had promised to contribute troops to UNAMIR II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] and had launched an appeal to the international community for financial and logistic help. It also called for urgent help for the refugees and displaced people. As we can see, the tone of the declaration is firm. However, neither of the two sides and none of the neighboring countries has been singled out for being responsible for the crimes, the war or any involvement in the Rwandan tragedy.
