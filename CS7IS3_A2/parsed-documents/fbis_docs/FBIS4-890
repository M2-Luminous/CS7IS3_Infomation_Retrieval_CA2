A statement, released here on Tuesday [19 April] and signed by SPM chairman Omar Jays, was reacting to Monday's attack on a UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) relief plane at the southwestern Somali town of Afmado, in which a Gambian UNHCR employee was killed. In the statement, the two factions which control southern and southwestern Somalia also pledged that they would carry out investigations to determine who were responsible for the tragedy. Alhadji Keba Sanneh, 53, was in an UNHCR plane arriving in the southwestern town from Nairobi when unidentified armed men opened fire, killing him, but four other people inside the aircraft escaped unhurt. Sanneh was nominated last week by UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, as head of the cross border aid operations organised from Kenya since September 1992. In her reaction to the death on Monday, Ogata said in Geneva that "the death will remind Somali leaders of the tragedy into which Somalia has been plunged and encourage them to renew their determination to find peace".
