FBIS3-61084 "jpusr001___94015" FBIS-USR-94-001 Document Type:JPRS Document Title: FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 5 January 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Russia Seeks Place in World Arms Market 944Q0112A Moscow KOMMERSANT in Russian No 48, 6 Dec 93 pp 10-11 944Q0112A Moscow KOMMERSANT Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Article by Alla Glebova and Sergey Tsekhmistrenko under the "Arms Market" rubric: "Russia Regaining a Niche in the World Arms Market"] [Text] However, the State Will Trade in Arms Mikhail Maley, the chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission for Scientific-Technical Issues of the Defense Industry, exclaimed: "The thing has happened that I have dreamed about for the last two years: Specialized foreign trade associations (trading in weapons--note by KOMMERSANT) were removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and placed directly under government management." According to information received by the KOMMERSANT editorial office, a secret document that as a matter of fact provides for the creation of a unified state system for trading in arms manufactured in Russia was signed by the president of Russia in the middle of November. Until recently, the editorial office did not have confirmation of the fact that the decision had been made. Only last week did Aleksandr Shokhin mention the issuance of the edict at a press conference, and Aleksandr Maley, whom KOMMERSANT approached for consultation, confirmed the existence of the document. As specialists from Maley's commission hope, the restoration of vigilant state supervision of the now numerous traders in Russian arms who have already fanned out throughout the world will help Russia to accomplish a very important task: to regain the lost markets for arms sales in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Near East in the environment of stiff competition and to try to assert itself in new markets. As recently as five years ago, Russian weapons had guaranteed markets for sales in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Near East. However, these markets have virtually been lost because of the well-known events. Meanwhile, competition in the arms market is quite keen. Therefore, weapons from the United States, France, and so on began to be delivered to these regions instead of Russian weapons (whose exports have fallen by a factor of almost five in the last three years). This year, Russia has participated in the largest worldwide arms exhibitions. Specialists say that the latest Russian military materiel on display in Ankara, Abu-Dhabi, Dubai, and in Budapest at the "C+D '93" exhibition which was held last week "took the buyers' breath away." However, commercial results are not that impressive. Despite the fact that many countries (China, Syria, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and others) are clearly becoming interested in Russian armaments, things did not develop beyond an expression of interest. However, this is not the main point either. The specialists see reductions in output as the root cause of the disorderly retreat of Russian arms producers from traditional markets for their sales. Last week, the Security Council of the Russian Federation gathered in order to determine the reference points for a new industrial policy of Russia and to discuss materials on the situation in the economy based on the results of nine months of this year, which had already been reviewed by the government. The "Conversion" section was the smallest, just over half a page, in a voluminous review prepared by the government staff. To date, this has been the only attempt to show the defense industry in the light of facts and trends. It is maintained that over the period of the year that has ended, the total volume of production in defense industries dropped 15 percent; the volume of military output dropped by more than 30 percent, and that of civilian output--by 10 percent. It turns out that the proportion of civilian output in the total volume of output of the military-industrial complex comes to about 80 percent (whereas in 1988 it was just 44 percent). The number of plants that manufacture mostly military output continues to decline steadily, and comes to one-sixth of the total number of enterprises in the "defense sector." In short, the "defense sector" is being disarmed quickly, and the unknown author of the half-page of text discreetly praises it for good behavior. However, as eyewitnesses testify, the things that made the government happy scared members of the Security Council--they came to the conclusion that the military-industrial complex is on the brink of technological peril. Having discussed the submitted papers, members of the Security Council set forth borderline conditions, the violation of which would pose a threat to the security of Russia. The Security Council Ordained: There Shall Be a Military-Industrial Complex Mikhail Maley viewed the last meeting of the Security Council as a milestone: "Solutions have become possible in Russia...." In his words, the Security Council essentially gathered in order to do a simple and understandable thing--finally establish the reference points for the development of the military-industrial complex of Russia. Reports on the condition of the defense industry were made by Andrey Kokoshin, the first deputy minister of defense, Viktor Glukhikh, the chairman of the State Committee on the Defense Industry, Viktor Mikhaylov, the minister of atomic industry, and Yuriy Koptev, the head of the Russian Space Agency. The positions of the speakers coincided: It is necessary to preserve priority technologies; it is impermissible to discontinue individual types of production which will not be successfully restored in the future; the opportunity to build up mobilization capacity in the event of a military threat may not be lost. A member of the Security Council who wished to remain anonymous stated: "This is not at all to say that the volume of arms production should be boosted. It is just that we must not lose the capability of producing modern tanks or missiles that are far superior to the potential of foreign military materiel." It was noted at the meeting of the Security Council that a disproportionately sharp decline in the defense industry has been caused primarily by the lack of funding. According to information from sources close to the Government of Russia, the debt of the Ministry of Defense to the enterprises of the military-industrial complex that has piled up over the last few years has come to 500 billion rubles [R]. Of course, this is of a different order than the debt of the budget to the defense complex as a whole (it has already reached several trillion rubles and, incidentally, likewise has not been paid). However, economists note that enterprises that produce mainly civilian products can somehow stay afloat by selling such products. Unlike those, a majority of enterprises that work almost exclusively for the Ministry of Defense have no additional sources of financing and are forced to cut back military production, primarily outlays on scientific development. Minister of Finance of Russia Boris Fedorov, who spoke at the meeting of the Security Council, noted that norms for allowances for science were set at the level of 5 percent of the military budget; actually, 3 percent is spent for such purposes. This means that Russia is running the risk of losing its primacy in the development of the latest types of weapons which many world-class specialists acknowledge. Sources close to the Security Council maintain that the council may secure a special decision of the president aimed at supporting the defense industry, however, through changes in the structure of the military budget rather than through additional funds. In the words of Mikhail Maley, Boris Yeltsin stated at the meeting of the Security Council that from now on, 10 percent of the military budget will be allocated to develop the industry. The Security Council also demanded that the government guarantee payments for the arms already ordered by the Ministry of Defense, and repay debts with the inflation index taken into account. Summing up the proceedings of the Security Council, Mikhail Maley noted that he was particularly happy about the decision to implement economic reforms in the territories with military industry clusters under the aegis of the military-industrial complex: "Comprehensive development programs will be worked out for the Udmurt, Mari, Chuvash, and Mordvinian Republics, and for Novgorod and Moscow Oblasts, which will provide for everything--from weapons exports to the establishment of bakeries whose equipment will be produced by the military-industrial complex. According to Mr. Maley, these programs will be presented at the February meetings of the Security Council. I Am the State The payment of state debts, improvements in conditions for financing arms producers, supplemental funds for supporting viable scientific programs in the area of military technology--all of those may ultimately be considered investments making it possible for Russia to produce good weapons, and even the best weapons in the world. The defense sector should recoup what is invested by boosting arms exports. Military experts note that the military-industrial complex lived through all of 1992 with the motto "Make money by selling weapons." However, in 1992 exports of weapons generated only $2.3 billion (an estimate by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin; other sources give an even smaller sum--$1.9 billion), instead of the planned $6 billion, and then under older contracts. Meanwhile, according to estimates by the same military specialists, right now Russia may earn $10 billion, or even more annually by exporting weapons. Experts in the defense field note that a qualitative change will not occur until Russian arms stop competing against Russian arms on the world market. Until mid-November 1993, as many as four specialized Spetsvneshtekhnika, Oboroneksport, GUSK, and Promeksport--traded in Russian weapons. In addition, the right to trade in weapons was being sought by Voyentekh, which had been established to sell weapons of old models from the stocks of the Ministry of Defense. Each specialized association billed itself as a structure representing state interests, but each was a departmental structure and for this reason acted in its own interest. Promeksport, which was established within the organization of the Russian Federation Committee on the Defense Industry, advocated the interests of the industrialists; Voyentekh operated in the interests of the Ministry of Defense. Spetsvneshtekhnika, Oboroneksport, and GUSK, foreign trade associations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, were together looking out for their own interests. Departmental structures were endowed with equal rights, competed against one another in foreign markets, drove down prices, and frustrated the signing of one another's contracts for the delivery of Russian weapons. The departmental associations competed and continue to compete against direct weapons producers, many of whom have been granted the right to direct access to the market for products manufactured above state requisitions. For example, the Baykal company, Izhmash, or the Kalashnikov joint-stock company have such permits. Until recently, the Tula arms plant also belonged to this category, but the government permit it had has already expired. Finally, spice is also added to this sauce by "foreign" suppliers of Russian weapons from both the faraway and adjacent foreign countries, who are also doing a brisk trade in weapons produced or designed in Russia. Countries of Eastern Europe have resolved to considerably reduce their national armies and are now selling off surplus weapons accumulated by them during their tenure with the Warsaw Treaty Organization. These surpluses are of Soviet manufacture. Moreover, still in preperestroyka times, the countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization were granted the right to independently sell some of the products manufactured at local enterprises, and are now vigorously taking advantage of this right. Soviet weapons (or spare parts for them) were produced within the framework of state-to-state cooperation and "technical assistance"; for example, the production of the Kalashnikov assault rifle has been established in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Romania. The export strategy of Moscow was guided by considerations of political trends, boosting the positive balance in trade with African countries which, as it now turns out, are incapable of paying for the deliveries; its brethren in the socialist camp have mastered the principles of free competition, by no means only in theory, and have achieved great success in the more solvent Asian market. Weapons specialists note that no modifications have been made in the design of weapons over the years in which Soviet licenses were used. The legendary Mikhail Kalashnikov, who came to the capital of Hungary for the "C + D'93" small-arms exhibition studied carefully the models of his namesake automatic weapons manufactured in Romania and Hungary. He subsequently remarked that our former allies merely "modified handles and butts to suit their ethnic specifics." As far as the quality of weapons produced under licenses is concerned, specialists do not rate it too favorably. What kind of confidence in the "Kalashnikov" trademark on the whole may there be, they note, given that Kalashnikov assault rifles manufactured in China on occasion jam after the very first burst? This is also one of the reasons why Russian weapons have begun to lose the battle for the world market. As KOMMERSANT experts in patent law say, Russia has virtually no opportunity to influence the former member countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization in order for them to stop the production of weapons under licenses. The already mentioned "Kalashnikov," having been developed by a secret laboratory, is not protected by any patent; such was the procedure. One thing remains--to count on buyers sooner or later giving preference to the acquisition of higher-quality weapons directly from the original producers anyway. To be sure, such original producers turned out to be unexpectedly numerous after the disintegration of the USSR. By now, Russia has got competitors not only on the banks of the Vistula and the Oder, but also of the Danube and the Neman--Ukraine and Belarus, where the main plants producing equipment for air defense systems and the largest plants for aircraft and armored vehicle repairs are concentrated. Having become independent states, these and other republics of the former USSR are selling piles of the most up-to-date weapons, which they obtained during the division of the assets of the Soviet Army. Specialists note that existing procedures for the issuance of licenses have become yet another serious obstacle in the path of increasing arms exports from Russia. Up until the aforementioned Yeltsin's edict, the issuance of licenses to export products for military technical uses was among the responsibilities of the Main Directorate of Military-Technical Cooperation (GUVTS) of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. According to GUVTS Chief Aleksandr Kotelkin, in addition to an end-user certificate (to avoid unauthorized re-exports of weapons to third countries), a government permit, a petition, and an initialed or signed contract should be filed with the directorate in order to obtain this license. Mr. Kotelkin noted that, in and of itself, this procedure is quite logical and justified. However, he acknowledged that under Russian conditions, seeing the license through the echelons frequently takes up to nine months. According to information from Russian weapons traders, the process of obtaining licenses in some CIS countries is much simpler and much less time-consuming, which gives exporters from the republics of the CIS a clear advantage in comparison to Russians. Worse still, in Russia the procedure for the issuance of licenses for weapons applies to the delivery of spare parts. Specialists from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations consider this feasible; after all, if one has a full set of components it is not difficult to start the assembly of the entire object. However, traders note that in many cases the prolonged waiting period for licenses to export spare parts interferes with prompt technical services for foreign buyers, which substantially reduces the competitiveness of Russian exports. Incidentally, the latest documents of the government do not fundamentally change anything in the existing licensing system (one of them is published in this issue of KOMMERSANT). However, changes are forthcoming in the system of arms trade, and major changes they are. The simplest thing that immediately comes to mind would be to merge all Russian competitors together, which was actually done--the Rosvooruzheniya corporation will unite all of the main weapons traders existing in Russia as of now. The first attempt to create a unified state company for the arms trade was made as early as 1991 by Sergey Krasnov, the most experienced weapons trader in the USSR (for a long time, he headed the relevant division of the GKES--State Committee for Economic Cooperation). After the GKES was abolished, the relevant divisions were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and Sergey Krasnov was fired by Petr Aven, the minister of foreign economic relations at the time, apparently for a bias toward monopolism. Two years later, they revisited this idea. Boris Yeltsin stated at a meeting of the Security Council last week that he intends to personally oversee military-technical cooperation, and ordered that a statute of the corporation be prepared by 25 December. General Viktor Samoylov, an adviser to Deputy Prime Minister Shumeyko for military issues, was appointed acting chief of the Rosvooruzheniya. According to Mikhail Maley, the Rosvooruzheniya corporation will not adhere to strict centralization in the export of weapons. It will retain jurisdiction over issues on which the strategy of military-technical cooperation, the delivery of large batches of arms, and the latest developments hinge. It is expected that the existing regional associations of arms producers, such as the "Kalashnikov" joint-stock company, to which the largest military plants of Udmurtia belong (including the Izhmash) and the Baykal association, will keep and even strengthen their status. The federal company will operate in coordination with them, providing general guidance. However, the managers and government overseers of the federal structure do not conceal the fact that the degree of freedom of action for regional associations will be determined by them, after all, proceeding from the situation in each segment of the world arms market. In a conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, Mikhail Maley noted that the employees of Spetsvneshtekhnika, Oboroneksport, and GUSK will be hired to work for the state corporation only subject to certification. In his opinion, the Voyentekh and the Promeksport do not have any prospects, whereas great deeds lie in store for the Rosvooruzheniye company. In his words, even Andrey Kozyrev, a well-known fighter for compliance with international agreements, called on Russia to expand arms exports as he spoke in the Security Council. As Vitaliy Bokhanov, one of the leading arms specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, noted, Russian exporters intend to expand their presence in the already familiar markets of Central Europe, the Near East, and Africa, which Americans have lately begun to dominate. New markets have been planned--Southeast Asia, where Russia will have to fight China for a place in the sun, and Latin America, where the positions of American producers are also strong. All the Best for Sale It is worthwhile to consider the exhibits presented by Russia at the two most recent arms exhibitions in Dubai (the United Arab Emirates) and Budapest (Hungary) precisely from this standpoint--as an attempt to make [Russia's] presence known in new arms markets and to revisit those already familiar to Russian producers. In the opinion of Russian specialists who participated in the exhibition, the Dubai-93 aviation exhibition (which was held from 7 to 11 November) brought Russian aviation back to the Near East. Having joined UN sanctions against Iraq, Libya, and the former union republics of Yugoslavia, Russia deprived itself of traditional markets for the sale of armaments. The IDEX-93 exhibition in Abu-Dhabi (the United Arab Emirates) which was held at the beginning of the year heralded the return of Russian arms to the Near East, but this time from the side of the Persian Gulf. Out of 30 aircraft that took off there daily, 10 were Russian-made. No contracts have been signed so far, but in the opinion of the managers of the Aviaeksport joint-stock company (the organizer of the Russian exhibit), the results exceeded all expectations. The Russians demonstrated their most up-to-date weapons at the Dubai-93 aviation exhibition. The new combat plane Su-35, which, according to Yuriy Tsupko, the main engineer of the mass-production plant for the Su-35, "has no analogs throughout the world because of unique design solutions and technologies," had its foreign debut precisely in the skies over Dubai. In conversations with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, both Soviet and foreign military specialists noted that the Su-35 displayed incredible maneuverability, despite the fact that this is the only combat aircraft whose auxiliary fuel tanks are located in the tail. The plane is interesting not only as a state-of-the-art design development: Technologies for the processing of titanium, lithium, and composite materials in which Russia has a lead were extensively used in manufacturing the plane. In addition to the Su-35, which is not being mass-produced yet, the Su-27, the Su-30 MK, and a couple of sports Su-29's--a present to the king of the United Arab Emirates--performed in the skies over Dubai. Even the delivery of the equipment to the United Arab Emirates was thought-out and spectacular: En route to the aviation exhibition, the Su-27, the Su-30 MK, and the Su-35 performed the first Moscow to Dubai direct flight in the history of Russian aviation, refueling from a transportation Il-76 in the air. Russian specialists have just one answer to the question about the need for such spectacular deeds: the market. Following the defeat of Saddam Husayn, the market of Persian Gulf countries is the most favorable for the member countries of the anti-Iraqi coalition, whose materiel acquitted itself splendidly in action. The above notwithstanding, Western experts who put the need of the United Arab Emirates Army for combat planes at 30 refer to the Su-27 as the most likely competitor of the American F-16 and F-18. Unlike the United Arab Emirates, which is an arms market new to Russia, the Budapest exhibit took into account the circumstance that, after all, Central Europe once was a permanent buyer of Russian weapons. To this day, the armies of Eastern Europe are outfitted almost 99 percent with materiel produced under licenses or on the basis of documentation from the USSR (although specialists noted joint developments with third countries which were presented at "C + D '93"). At present, as this materiel is already becoming obsolete, Russia offers know-how in the area of its upgrading; a special section of the exhibit was devoted to this. The former colleagues of Russia from the Warsaw Treaty Organization simply cannot afford Western weapons. Russian weapons sellers count on Prague, Warsaw, or Bucharest volens nolens turning their gaze to the former "elder brother" again, having postponed the ideas of re-equipping their armies to NATO standards until better times. The Russian exhibit at the "C + D '93" in Budapest followed the policy of presenting the latest types of weapons. Against the background of other countries' exhibits, the Russian exhibit looked superb, as was noted by Russian and foreign specialists alike and the minister of foreign affairs, who visited the Russian pavilion. To be sure, as the leaders of the Russian delegation noted in private conversations, the brilliance of the Russian exhibit was also due to the fact that the competition was caught off guard--"had they known what we were bringing, they would have prepared better." The competition did not expect the Russian side to show this extensive selection of products without analogs on the world market at an exhibition which is being organized for the first time and so far does not have a sufficiently weighty reputation among specialists. Nonetheless, the latest accomplishments of the domestic designer thought in the area of small arms, hand-held antitank systems, and individual protective equipment were shown in the main Russian pavilion organized by the GUSK. The following were presented internationally for the first time: the 9-millimeter Baksan submachine gun (Russian gun producers pin great hopes specifically on this caliber, because it fits NATO standards), the 12.3-millimeter Udar revolver system, the original firearm system consisting of the AKS-74U assault rifle with grenade launcher attachments and the GP-25 grenade launcher mounted under the barrel, and the hunting carbines 6P18 (7.62 millimeters), Berkut (7.62 millimeters), and Sobol (5.66 millimeters). Visitors to the exhibition could also familiarize themselves with the models of weapons without analogs elsewhere in the world which had already been displayed in Abu-Dhabi and Ankara, such as the APS submersible assault rifle (5.66 millimeters), the SPP-1m submersible pistol (4.5 millimeters), the PSS pistol (7.62 millimeters), the AS assault rifle (9.0 millimeters), and the PSS sniper rifle (9.0 millimeters) with silencers; the improved-effectiveness Gyurza pistol; the RPG-29 shoulder-fired antitank grenade launcher and the RPG-27 rocket-propelled antitank grenade. Some specialists, in particular Vitaliy Bokhanov, one of the leaders of the Russian delegation, believe that in the future, it will be precisely the sale of antitank systems (they are manufactured by the NPO [Scientific Production Association] Bazalt), which will dominate the Russian exports of close-range weapons. The Kub Association of Aid to Entrepreneurship represented at the exhibition the interests of a number of enterprises enterprises [as published] of the military-industrial complex of the Urals Region--the Motovilikhinskiye Zavody joint-stock company, the Permskiye Motory, the Inkar, the Nytva metallurgical plant and the Kamensk-Uralskiy foundry. In a conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, Igor Lazukov, executive director of the association, stressed that participation in the "C + D '93" is both the first foreign venture by Kub and its first military experience. Products manufactured by people from the Urals--the Uragan and Smerch artillery systems, aircraft engines for civilian aviation and the air force, bimetallic rolled metal sheets for the production of cartridges--were geared specifically toward consumers from the Central European countries. Participation in the exhibition became the swan's song for GUSK: Under the edict that has already been mentioned repeatedly, it became a part of the Rosvooruzheniya company established under the president. Although GUSK technically does not exist anymore, the task of breaking into the world markets for small arms and some other close-range weapons still remains topical, according to Aleksandr Semenov, the general director of the Russian exhibit at "C + D '93" and GUSK deputy chief. Russia does not intend to be content with a secondary status in this struggle. For now, it is premature to talk about the commercial effectiveness of Russia's participation in the "C + D '93," despite the high grades given to the Russian exhibit by foreign specialists. There were virtually no official delegations in Budapest; for this reason, the interests of potential customers were represented mostly by intermediary companies that are not authorized to sign contracts. However, the Russian side did not count on instant success to begin with. As Mr. Semenov noted, by participating in the exhibition, Russia strove to show that, despite the complex period that the country is going through, its "defense sector" has overcome the stagnant condition characteristic of recent years, and that its products, despite the opinion of the competition, are quite up to world standards and are even superior to them. [Boxed item] Foreigners Finance the Russian Military-Industrial Complex At present, the Su-35, the most advanced combat plane in the world, carries the trademark of the Tesmo-Don-Gulf company. Givi Papiashvili, who came from Soviet Georgia, founded a company by this name in Dubai. This trading company intends to accomplish programs for the placement in the United Arab Emirates market of not only the Su's, but also the largest helicopters with the greatest load-lifting capacity in the world, the Mi-26's. Mr. Papiashvili will receive profits from his investment activities only after contracts are signed. Experts are inclined to believe that two years of efforts by the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau to return to the Near East will be crowned with success after the Dubai-93 aviation exhibition. American interests will also be taken into account in this case, because the Su-27 will most likely be outfitted with American airborne equipment. [End of boxed item] [Boxed item] Russian Businessmen Are Also Prepared To Pay Vladimir Kastyrin, who heads the Moscow Airways joint-stock company, made a sensation in Dubai. He stated that he was buying 50 Be-32 planes produced by the imeni Beriyev Taganrog Scientific and Technical Aviation Complex (TANTK). Moreover, as a KOMMERSANT correspondent learned, the first Be-32 presented in Dubai is already the property of Moscow Airways and was built with its funds. So far, Moscow Airways has been the only Russian air carrier company that has dared to finance the domestic aircraft industry. Mr. Kastyrin believes that, to be sure, it is necessary to turn to the West; however, the main point is not to lose the promising domestic market for air carriers. It is profitable to develop the latter only through using the relatively cheap Russian equipment. Mr. Kastyrin said: "We need the Be-32 as the Chinese need rice. This plane is extremely versatile: It can use virtually any surface as an airfield (including water and ice). This plane is inexpensive (its base price is $2.4 million), convenient, and indispensable in environments lacking roads, such as Russia, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula." In Dubai, representatives of the Aeroconsulting private company, the Irkutsk aviation plant, the imeni Beriyev TANTK, the Aviaeksport joint-stock company and the Moscow Airways joint-stock company announced their intention to form a consortium to mass-produce the Be-32 by the middle of 1995. According to Nikolay Sharlau, the ideologist of the creation of the concern and director of the Aeroconsulting company, it is planned to manufacture five Be-32's in 1995, as many as 24 in 1996, and subsequently 50 aircraft annually. Vladimir [as published] Sharlau said: "The government is preparing a decree 'On the Implementation of a Program for the Mass Production, Sale, and Operation of the Commuter Airline Plane Be-32.' However, this will be merely moral support for the Be-32 program. For the first time, not a kopek of state funds will be used to organize the mass production of a plane." The program will be profitable if 500 aircraft are manufactured with the last delivery date in 2004. [End of boxed item]
