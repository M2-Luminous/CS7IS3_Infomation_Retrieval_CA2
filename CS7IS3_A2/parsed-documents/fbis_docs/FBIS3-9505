Our stance coincides with the deliberations of different circles in Europe concerning the future actions to be undertaken with the aim of having a united Europe one day, when all the states will have their opportunity according to how they are prepared, internally and externally, to join such a union. "The goal of the visit was to realize various contacts with high-ranking German politicians and my opinion is that it was done in the proper time, having in mind the embargo of our southern neighbor and all the consequences emerging from it inside the community itself. At the same time, we transmitted our views about the situation here and about the way we view the solution for the problems we have with the Republic of Greece. Not a single interlocutor could find an excuse for the measures undertaken by Greece against Macedonia, and on the other hand, it was very important that I had the opportunity of expressing our readiness for further discussions. We have hitherto also emphasized that we are ready to talk about all questions, but we also stressed that we could have no discussions if all the basket was not put on the agenda, in order not to leave anything unclarified that could tomorrow serve as a reason for misunderstandings or new embargoes.'' Asked about the meeting and the discussions with Mr. Van den Broek, President Gligorov replied: "The meeting occurred at his request and we had long discussions about the ways out of this situation. I underlined that the basic issue was how Europe would find a solution for the embargo, because our stance is that it is not just a problem of the Macedonian-Greek border, but it refers to a part of the border of the European Union. Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union is also involved in this problem, because it is not a bilateral, but a unilateral act of a state. My opinion is that there were no differences in the stances, however we talked a lot about the possible modalities, but without reaching a firm stance on how to get out of that situation."
