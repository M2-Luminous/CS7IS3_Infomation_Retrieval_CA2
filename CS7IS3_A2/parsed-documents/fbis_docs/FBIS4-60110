As the saying goes, "anyone who thinks that a leopard can change his spots is mistaken." Anyone who imagines that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would willingly agree to a comprehensive peace without receiving the price in the form of applause by the Israeli political hawks, is mistaken. Rabin yesterday again sought escalation despite Yasir 'Arafat's clarification of what he meant by the call for jihad for Jerusalem. Rabin refused to tone down the false fury, perhaps because he wanted to make the maximum gain of cheap popularity in the hawks camp which is basically opposed to any just peace. There is no need to recall that Rabin's past positions on such issues as security and the intifadah were closer to the Likud's position than they were to several of his colleagues in the cabinet he now heads, but it is necessary and proper to say a few frank words on the matter. The Palestinian president may have underestimated the dimensions of the deliberate "political interpretation" of the word jihad in the Western media but he has on all occasions demonstrated full practical commitment to the agreements he signed. Furthermore, the place where the statement causing the crisis was made was not a place in an area of charged religious sentiments, to warrant its interpretation as an instigative statement. The parties really interested in defending the peace process, be they Arab, American, or Israeli, have refused to dwell on that fabricated issue, preferring instead to enhance the process by reaffirming the principle of withdrawal, guarantee of security, and clear understanding on future steps toward a just and comprehensive peace. These parties with positive intentions are aware of the danger of playing with fire for "local consumption" particularly at a time of major blessed Islamic occasions. It would be better for those trying to eschew the phased withdrawal process and the move toward full withdrawal to abandon their dangerous adventure because the alternative would be a return to the bloody option which would spare nobody.
