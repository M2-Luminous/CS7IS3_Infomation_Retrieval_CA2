And if you are about to move into a building where several stories are burnt out, almost all the windows are broken, ceilings and even supporting structures are damaged, and hardly any utilities are operational.... This was precisely the state in which the fine, snow-white administrative complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was found recently, when specialists arrived to carry out a detailed survey of the building and give an in-depth report on the nature and scale of the damage. It is well-known that on 5 October the president signed an edict on handing over to the Russian Federation Government the administrative complex where parliament worked until recently. He thereby restored historical justice, if you like: The complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, which came to be known as the "White House," was originally occupied by the Russian Federation Council of Ministers (indeed, the building was erected for that purpose). Experts appeared at the site the following day. The impression of "devastation and desolation" -- as Petr Surov, head of the government apparatus construction department and first deputy chairman of the government commission, admitted to me at a recent meeting -- was depressing. Even with intensive work, restoring the 20-story building (or, to be more precise, the 24-story building, if you count the two basement floors and the clocktower) to its former working state before September next year seemed unrealistic. But a tough schedule was set: The stylobate (six floors) to be completed in 1993, and the upper levels, comprising the seventh to 20th stories, to be completed by 15 February 1994. Moreover, the leaders of the government commission were given the necessary powers to engage any construction firms and other organizations in the work to restore the government building; and to conclude contracts with foreign firms. "We immediately realized that we could not manage with Moscow builders alone (they have their own intensive program)," Petr Surov said. "So we engaged colleagues from a number of Russian cities, as well as foreign specialists. The extremely tight schedule made the supply of materials and equipment a crucial factor: We needed building and finishing materials (granite and marble), elevators, and fire prevention systems. Our foreign partners were able to deal with these matters promptly. In other words, we undertook to complete the work within the deadline by making sure we had all the necessary materials and equipment. "We received offers from 27 foreign firms. Many of them were pursuing not so much commercial aims as political objectives: They wanted to help us restore the government residence, thereby expressing their solidarity with Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet and the current reforms. "The Turkish firms Gama and Enka were chosen because they have made a good name for themselves in Russia. Enka already built a maternity home and a military hospital with 1,200 beds in Moscow and renovated the Petrovskiy Arcade. Gama agreed to work without any advance payment, using its own money to buy the necessary materials. "Other firms were also engaged, mainly those that supplied equipment when the complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was originally built. Take the elevators, for example. We had to replace 19 out of 49. This was done by Otis (a U.S. firm). The shuttle-mail system is being restored by Ascom, the Austrian company, which originally installed it. Hanwell (a U.S. firm) is renewing the fire-prevention systems. There was no hard currency available, but within 24 hours they had flown everything necessary to Moscow and started work. The commercial equipment for the dining room and snack bars (they are up and running, incidentally, and catering for the construction workers) was supplied by an Italian firm, which started work even before signing the contract and sent all the necessary equipment within one month. "First of all, we had to bring the building `back to life,' make it `airtight' (virtually every window was broken), and get the utilities operational, that is, provide water, heating, and a working sewerage system. As many as 5,000 people were engaged in the restoration work virtually from day one. "Then we had to eliminate the consequences of the fire and destruction. Many dividing walls had collapsed, some ferroconcrete floors were sagging, and some beams had to be reinforced. Obviously, all the debris and rubbish had to be quickly cleared from every story. "This was not easy. The building is approximately 100 meters high and the freight and passenger elevators are the only form of transport, but they were not working (the electric wires were burnt through). However, together with their colleagues from Otis, Russian specialists had all the elevators working within four days. Using an efficient hourly system (each story in turn), the construction debris was removed and carefully packed into sacks. As many as 100 trucks of rubbish left the government building, covered in scaffolding, each day. "People worked flat out, making the deadline -- which had recently seemed unattainable -- a real possibility. People from Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, Tolyatti, Omsk, Tomsk, Rostov, and other cities worked around the clock, showing that we can work. "Of course, all the necessary conditions were created for the construction workers: Everyone was accommodated close by, at the Ukraina Hotel, free meals were organized, and their wages reflected the work done. "The `treatment' of the facade has proved very difficult: It was quite literally decimated by the shelling. The process of polishing the lower six stories is now complete: Only the upper levels remain. But there the situation is worse: 1,200 square meters of marble slabs have to be replaced. This is being done by Gama (our specialists refused, suggesting that we wait for warmer weather). "The tower clock has been repaired (the hands were riddled with bullets): It started working again on 30 December. One firm (Russian) asked for 600 million rubles to repair the clock. But local specialists did everything -- quickly and much more cheaply. "A total of 10 stories are now complete. Furniture is being arranged, communications systems are being switched on, and the first `new arrivals' are expected. Our department is already here, incidentally," Petr Surov said. "All the various chambers are ready: the awards chamber, the reception rooms, the Gold Chamber, the Blue Chamber, the government sessions hall, and the leaders' office suites. Construction workers are also ahead of schedule in the upper levels. The seventh story (including the reequipped dining room) and the eighth to 12th stories are complete. Plus the technical operations story (the 20th), which is responsible for the heat and water supply and all other utilities. "All work will be finished by 15 February as planned. Not only restoration, but also modernization. It is intended to develop the communications systems in the future. The question of protecting the government building along the lines of the President Hotel, for example, is being discussed. It is planned to do this in the summer." Petr Sergeyevich and I walked through the restored building. It is now white again. The tinted windows and reinforced window frames have somewhat changed its appearance and made the building more beautiful than before. The interior decoration is also of the highest quality. All rooms in the stylobate (the first to sixth stories), and also the eighth to 12th stories of the central upper tower passed inspection by a working subcommission on New Year's Eve. (For your information: The state commission will sign a certificate of approval on completion of the complex). Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has been informed that the Russian Federation Government headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will move to its new address in the near future. Happy house warming!
