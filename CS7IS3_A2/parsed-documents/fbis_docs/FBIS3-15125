This means that not only all its subscribers in Russia, but also readers in 114 world countries will receive the paper. The suspension in publication of the paper was not the editorial board's fault but the result of interruptions in budget funding. Nevertheless, the journalistic collective believes it is responsible to readers and apologizes to all for the resultant loss of information. Naturally, the information that you failed to receive during this period is irreplaceable, but we will try to repay our debts by other means: The break provided an opportunity to better consider and prepare a number of innovations. Now each week, on Thursdays, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will publish a 16-page issue. This will make it possible to widen the range of reports on the most important aspects of the federal authorities' activities. The content of the newspaper's official section will also be enriched -- in addition to legal and administrative acts of the Russian Federation president and government, we will begin to carry the main Federal Assembly documents concerning the vital interests of the state, the population, and entrepreneurs. We feel a special debt to those who have been unable recently to take advantage of the advice provided by our RETSEPT [Prescription] supplement. A consultative health center is being set up under the editorial board and the best medical forces are being recruited, and we hope that with their help we can be useful to those who bring their questions to us. We will tell you, Esteemed readers, about the work of this center and about how to use its services at a later date. Pages 2 and 3 carry features under the rubrics "In Russia," "In the World," "Subjectively Speaking," and "Official." This has made it possible to give considerably broader coverage to events in our country's regions and throughout the world and to more fully present the spectrum of opinions on urgent problems of society's life while at the same time, as it were, putting the official position of state figures and institutions together in a special section. Our other, traditional supplements, sections, and pages "Money," "Economics," VEKHI [Milestones], "Culture," "Leisure," "Sport," and so forth are also being updated. With the help of professional lawyers and parliamentary deputies the editorial office wants to organize consultations on the most difficult and acute questions of protecting human rights. We hope that there will be no more interruptions in publication. Stay with us! [Signed] ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Editorial Collegium
