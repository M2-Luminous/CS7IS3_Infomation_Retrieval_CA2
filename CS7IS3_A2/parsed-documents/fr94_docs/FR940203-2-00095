FR940203-2-00095 FR940203-2-00057 This criterion calls for a licensee to demonstrate that the early withdrawal is for activities that would occur under reasonable decommissioning scenarios and would prevent funds being used for activities that do not reduce radioactivity at the site and ultimately permit release of the property for unrestricted use. A licensee that has already prepared its §50.82 decommissioning plan (which must be submitted within 2 years after a permanent cessation of operations) could reference the appropriate part of this plan. A licensee that has not yet completed its §50.82 decommissioning plan would have to provide other documentation to demonstrate that its proposed activities were clearly decommissioning activities. 2. The expenditures would not reduce the value of the decommissioning trust below an amount necessary to place and maintain the licensee's reactor in a safe storage (SAFSTOR) condition if unforeseen conditions or expenses arise. (For example, if the waste shipments were rejected by the disposal site because of lack of storage space or legal impediments, a licensee would have to show it had the funds to return and store any affected components on site and to store any radioactive components and materials that had remained on-site.) Consistent with the purpose of the decommissioning funding regulations, assurance of availability of funds to safely decommission a facility, and the principle that a preapproval activity does not foreclose the release of the site for possible unrestricted use, this criterion calls for a licensee to show that it can maintain the status quo at a facility and that the proposed activities will not preclude the ultimate unrestricted use of the site. A licensee would have to document the rationale for the minimum amount estimated to be needed to return to a safe storage condition if decontamination or removal activities are interrupted and the components and equipment involved have to be stored safely at the site. Such on-site storage after shipment could, in the worst case, require construction of a storage facility. This criterion ensures that decommissioning activities that occur before approval of the §50.82 decommissioning plan do not reduce funds below a level that would ensure continued maintenance of safety at a defueled, shutdown facility until the decommissioning plan is reviewed and approved. A licensee could satisfy this criterion by demonstrating that it has sufficient funds in either its decommissioning fund or other available funds to maintain the status quo at the facility, that is, maintain safety in the defueled, shutdown condition. It should be noted that this criterion is also pertinent to the normal, end-of-life decommissioning; licensees are to accommodate the possibility of unforeseen occurrences by providing for contingencies. (See Regulatory Guide 1.159 at 1.159&hyph;10, Item 1.4.4.3. The general guidance of Regulatory Guide 1.159 concerning provisions for ``contingencies,'' however, does not explicitly identify the nature of such contingencies. The NRC's proposed criterion is more explicit.) The NRC notes that 10 CFR 50.82(c)(1) requires that, ``funds needed to complete decommissioning be placed into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside the licensee's administrative control during the storage or surveillance period, or a surety method or fund statement of intent be maintained in accordance with the criteria of §50.75(e).'' Because the definition of decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2 implicitly includes the costs of placing and maintaining a reactor in safe storage, a licensee should continue to provide assurance of adequate funds for these expenses at all times during the SAFSTOR period. Thus, licensees are required to maintain this assurance both before and after the NRC approves a licensee's §50.82 decommissioning plan. 3. The withdrawals would not inhibit the ability of the licensee to complete funding of any shortfalls in the decommissioning trust needed to ensure availability of funds to ultimately release the site for unrestricted use. This criterion encompasses the principle that activities allowed before approval of the decommissioning plan do not significantly increase decommissioning costs. A licensee would be required to document the effect of the withdrawals on the decommissioning funding plan, addressing the current fund balance and collection schedule, and demonstrate that the use of funds before NRC approval of a decommissioning plan for the facility would not impair the licensee's ability to fully fund the plan submitted to the NRC (or, if no plan has been filed, the actions necessary to permit release of the site for unrestricted use). A licensee would, for example, have to show that the decommissioning actions potentially taken out of sequence of any decommissioning plan submitted (or reasonable decommissioning alternatives if no plan has been submitted) would not significantly increase decommissioning costs or impair its ability to obtain the funds necessary to complete decommissioning.
