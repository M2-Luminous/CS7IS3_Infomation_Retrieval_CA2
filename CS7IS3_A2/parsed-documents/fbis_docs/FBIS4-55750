Like a genie from the lamp, he appeared on the political scene, where -- instead of activism -- he has very frequently and deliberately displayed aggression, and -- instead of respecting other protagonists in political life -- he has practiced the skill of passing judgment without evidence. Yesterday's scandal -- that has to be the right word for it -- in the FRY Assembly is only a continuation of a string of similar acts by Mr. Seselj. Let us remember how he tried to use violence against the taxi drivers, how he showed his strength in the close encounter with the teachers, and how -- instead of presenting arguments -- he told his female colleague, the deputy from Montenegro, that she should go to a gigolo club. He has been using language devoid of all the basics of decency to keep smearing people and vulgarizing the public scene in Serbia, all under the guise of political activity, in which the measure of truth is only what he says or does. His publicly displayed inclination toward violence or -- to be more precise -- toward extreme radicalism, is deeply contradictory to democratic and political pluralism, and it cannot justify itself through violent confrontation. To accept such methods is the limit that, if exceeded, leaves room for no surprise, including physical clashes with those who have different political views. The behavior of Radical leader Mr. Seselj irresistibly reminds one of a mutation of democracy. It is no exaggeration to say that, rather frequently, he has skillfully combined elements from the political grey area and his status of inviolability to leave a large number of ordinary people with the feeling of real fear. Never was anything good achieved through bad means. Particularly not when the first signs of the improvement in the situation in former Yugoslavia are to be seen, and when a climate is being created that is not favorable to the political options and methods of Mr. Seselj. The leader and some of the SRS deputies can of course continue to behave in the manner of smashers of civilized dialogue, proposers of the abolition of other political organizations and different views. The question is, however, whether more indifference and contempt as a moral stand can be our alibi for our reluctance to define clearly and decisively the pathological in the political and everyday life. The later it is done, the higher the price to be paid.
