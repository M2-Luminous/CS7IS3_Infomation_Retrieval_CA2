Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his official residence where they held talks behind closed doors. In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro pointed out that the rise to power of the African National Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between the two countries. "Probably with no other country is there the possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties between both peoples," Castro said. After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation that accompanied him. Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation, whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: "There are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and affection for Cuba." The statesman confirmed he has been treated very respectfully by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the entire world. He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state and heads of government from approximately 40 countries. Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from Africa and the Middle East.
