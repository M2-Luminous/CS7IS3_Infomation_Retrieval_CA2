Concerned countries in fishing are South Korea, Japan and China, and in supply, the United States and Russia. They are signatories of a two-year moratorium on pollack fishing in the Bering Sea that is due to be lifted this year if resource conditions improve. They have been meeting regularly to discuss ways of conserving pollack resources in the sea since February 1991. They agreed on the difficult question of setting catch quotas at the previous meeting in November last year and are expected to touch on drawing up the agreement text and other disputed issues.
