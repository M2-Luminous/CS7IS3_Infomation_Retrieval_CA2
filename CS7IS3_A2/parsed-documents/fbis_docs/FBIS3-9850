The sides agreed that relations between our countries have not reached the desired level and our countries have not made complete use of their potential. These relations can be improved and expanded, something that can be achieved through the meeting of the two prime ministers, that is the prime minister of Romania and of Russia, that will take place in the near future. With Romania's president I held only a political dialogue, Pavel Grachev said, noting that he informed the Romanian president about the internal political situation in Russia, the division of political forces, and the actions taken by the president and the government to find solutions to the internal and foreign policy problems and to the problems of reform. President Iliescu informed the guest about the domestic and foreign activity of the political leadership in Romania. The sides reached the conclusion that our countries have many similar ways to ensure their development. Iliescu declared that Romania wishes to achieve a closer cooperation with Russia and is expecting a meeting with Boris Yeltsin, a meeting that he hopes will take place still this year. Russia's position is identical, namely to strengthen ties with Romania, which diminished at a certain point. Grachev declared that he held talks with President Ion Iliescu on several foreign policy issues, especially about the Partnership for Peace with the countries of Western Europe and with the United States. The sides reached the conclusion that the partnership should be based on the principle of equality, there should be a basis for mutual advantage, and all countries in Europe should be drawn into this partnership to ensure joint security.
