FR940613-2-00118 FR940613-2-00076 In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992; 106 Stat. 1582) (1993 Appropriations Act), Congress appropriated $3.1 billion for activities under section 14, and in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993 (1994 Appropriations Act), Congress appropriated $3.23 billion for these activities. A total of $202,560,000 in set-asides is available for this program to fund Vacancy Reduction Program activities. B. Allocation Amounts A portion of the funds available for this program will be used for travel and administrative expenses of the assessment teams, as authorized by Section 115 of the 1992 Act. Of the remaining amount, no PHA applying for funding under this NOFA may receive more than 15 percent of the total available funds. Subject to this 15 percent limitation, eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) that are Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies will be provided funding in the full amounts approved for Vacancy Reduction Program activities. For PHAs that are Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agencies, if insufficient funds remain to fund all eligible and approved activities under this NOFA, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be its pro rata share of the total remaining funds available, in accordance with Section I.J(3) of this NOFA. All units that are funded in whole or in part by the Vacancy Reduction Program must be brought into compliance with the Housing Quality Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, and must be readily marketable when the work is completed. C. Background In order to gain greater insight into the vacancy problems of the PHAs required to participate in the Vacancy Reduction Program, the Department sent a survey form on April 2, 1993, to all PHAs that, based on HUD data bases, were troubled or mod-troubled on January 1, 1993, or had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on that date. Of the 400 identified PHAs, 345 responded to the survey. These PHAs reported a total of 56,324 vacancies, about half of the total vacancies nationally. The responses showed that additional funding was necessary to cure only half of the vacancies in the inventories of the responding PHAs. Of those vacant units whose occupancy was not dependent upon additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of the total vacancies were as follows: •Ready, awaiting leasing_5.7%; •No demand (defined as few or no persons on the waiting list)_3.5%; •Undesirable (defined as requiring 4 or more offers to obtain a tenant, but not requiring funding)_2.0%; •Funded under a modernization program_29.7%; •In litigation_6.5%; and •Other reason not requiring funding_3.2%. Of those units in which vacancies could be eliminated with additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of the vacancies were as follows: •Awaiting demolition_5.4%; •Needing modernization_30.0%; •Needing repair_12.8%; and •Other reason requiring funding_1.1%. Of the vacant units that would benefit from additional funding, the estimated costs of rehabilitation (exclusive of any costs for lead-based paint testing and abatement) and percentage of total vacancies were as follows: •Up to $5,000_4.8%;
