Congress participants want to meet with the president of the National Assembly so he can formally record this three-member government. Jean Luckenson's report follows. [Begin recording] [Luckenson] A government of public security was established on 20 January at 1600 by resolution of the the Congress for National Salvation held at the National Theater by the Group of the Great North 18 to 20 January. The three named to lead this government were Raoul Kenol, a lawyer representing Artibonite Department; Charles Plaisimond, an industrialist representing the Department of the West; and Louis Toussaint, judge at the Court of Appeals in Cap-Haitien. The congressmen spoke on behalf of the deputies and senators of the 45th Legislature. [passage omitted] Before the members of the government of public security went to the parliament to meet with Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, congress Secretary General Herve Leveille stated that they are strong; they will block the country and prevent everybody from working if the parliament disagrees. [Leveille] If [the parliamentarians] do not accept [the two resolutions we adopted], we will block the country. We are now going to the parliament so it can adopt them. [Unidentified journalist] Mr. Leveille, what will you do in the event the parliament refuses? [Leveille] We will know what to do. We will know what to do. [repeats] [Journalist] Is it a revolutionary solution? [Leveille] [words indistinct] to handle certain things carefully. [Journalist] Do you have the support of the Army? Do you have the support of the Army? [Leveille] The Army is an institution in the service of the people. The Army is not an institution.... [Luckenson] You say you will block the country if the parliament does not agree [with your resolutions]. Will you tell us how? [Leveille] With force. We can block the country. [Luckenson] What strategic means will you use? [Leveille] We will block the roads. [Luckenson] A few minutes later, the members of the new government of public security, made up of political personalities hostile to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return to power in Haiti, accompanied by the forces of order, went to the parliament while over a dozen men and women demonstrated their opposition to President Aristide and the international community. Upon their arrival at the parliament, the members of the government of public security were received at the diplomatic lounge of the Legislative Palace while the secretary general of the Chamber of Deputies [as heard] was taking steps to get in touch with the president, Frantz Robert Monde, who said that they will look into this issue in the next few days, [especially] at the reopening session of the Chamber of Deputies if a quorum is reached on 25 January: [Monde] Only the unity of the sons of the homeland can save this country, which is in an acute and very delicate crisis. We said and we repeat: Your file will be read and entrusted to a special committee; the parliament will give its verdict with confidence and as soon as possible. [passage omitted] [Luckenson] We should tell you that two resolutions have been adopted. The first contains three [number as heard] points: safeguarding national sovereignty, condemning the embargo, reinforcing the public institutions, and restoring the authority of the state. The second resolution establishes the government of public security. Several political personalities, including Professor Hubert De Ronceray [leader of Mobilization for National Development], Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the Nerette-Honorat government], the Reverend Richard Vladimir Jeanty [leader of the Haitian Party of God], Jean-Claude Roy [leader of the Union of Haitian Constitutionalists], former Agriculture Minister Jacques Baker, and Carl Denis [of the National Coalition] were present.
