As a result, the number of transistors per chip and the chip surface areas are steadily increasing. The larger chip surface areas require long lines with large capacities, and lines to which numerous capacity loads are connected. Since this kind of large capacity load must be driven at high speed, high-speed, high-performance LSIs are better off using bipolar transistors, with their powerful current driving capabilities and large transconductance, rather than metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). Therefore, chips designed for high-speed and high-performance are employing a bipolar complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) process that combines the high integration levels and low power consumption of MOSFETs with the high-speed operability of bipolar transistors (hereafter abbreviated BJT). Also, as LSIs are made to handle higher levels of integration and to operate at higher speeds, the power consumption per chip continues to increase. To lower the power consumed by chips while ensuring reliability in line with the shortening of MOSFET gate lengths, all manufacturers are experimenting with processes for reducing chip supply voltage. As these processes advance, supply voltages will almost certainly drop from 3.3V to 2.5V, and then down to 2.0V. However, the operating speed of BiCMOS circuits rapidly deteriorates as supply voltage is lowered, making it impossible to maintain their superior speed capabilities vis-a-vis CMOS circuits. As further advances are made in shortening MOSFET gate lengths while reducing supply voltage, it is quite likely that future BiCMOS circuits and the BiCMOS process will lose their significance. This report was put together on the premise that we are entering the age of quarter micron MOSFET gate lengths and supply voltages of less than 2V, and introduces a new BiCMOS gate that employs circuitry schemes to reduce the degradation of characteristics at low-voltage operation prevalent with conventional BiCMOS gates, and which is expected to become a basic element in high-speed LSI system configurations.[.sup]1)[/] Operation of Conventional BiCMOS Circuits Figure 1 provides a diagram of a BiCMOS circuit (in the narrow sense of the technology) that has been used for some time now, and Figure 2 shows a BiNMOS circuit. EQUATION Figure 1. BiCMOS Circuit Figure 2. BiNMOS Circuit The basic operation of a BiCMOS circuit consists of the CMOS inverter receiving the input signal, that output is then input to the base of the BJT, and then using the high current drive capabilities of the BJT, the circuit charges/discharges at high speed the load connected to the output. This operation is illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. Basic Operation of a BiCMOS Circuit From Figure 3, the delay time (t[.sub]pd[/]) of the BiCMOS circuit can be expressed using two formulas: t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]B[/] x V[.sub]F[/]/I[.sub]D[/] + C[.sub]L[/] x V[.sub]CC[/]/2/I[.sub]C[/] (1) I[.sub]D[/] = g[.sub]m[/] x _D_V = g[.sub]m[/] x V[.sub]sg[/] (2) C[.sub]B[/] here is the sum of parasitic load viewed from the BJT base terminal, V[.sub]F[/] is BJT flatband voltage, I[.sub]D[/] is the MOSFET drain current, C[.sub]L[/] is external load capacity, V[.sub]CC[/] is supply voltage, I[.sub]C[/] is the BJT collector current, g[.sub]m[/] is the MOSFET mutual conductance, _D_V is logic swing and V[.sub]sg[/] is the MOSFET source-drain voltage. Part one of Formula (1) expresses the internal delay time generated by driving the BiCMOS circuit BJT, and part two of the formula expresses the delay time involved in driving the external load. When external load is small, internal delay time dominates, and the operating speed of the BiCMOS circuit is slower than that of a CMOS circuit. Conversely, when external load is large, part two of Formula (1) becomes larger than part one and the impact of the internal delay time portion of t[.sub]pd[/] becomes nominal. Therefore, when external load capacity is large, part two of Formula (1) dominates, and since the current (I[.sub]C[/]) that charges/discharges external load becomes h[.sub]FE[/] (- 100) times larger than CMOS drain current (I[.sub]D[/]), the BiCMOS circuit operates faster than a CMOS circuit. The load capacity (crossover capacity) at this time is said to ordinarily be around F/O-3, C[.sub]L[/]-0.3pF. Low Voltage Operation of BiCMOS Circuits Reducing the supply voltage simultaneously decreases logic swing. The reduction of logic swing (_D_V) brings about a decrease of MOSFET source-drain voltage (V[.sub]sg[/]). If we adhere to scaling rules, the thinking is that shortening the gate length (L) will increase g[.sub]m[/], enabling the reduction of I[.sub]D[/] to be prevented. But in actuality, it is thought that the existence of properties not affected by scaling (such as source resistance (R[.sub]S[/])) tend to saturate g[.sub]m[/] growth even if we shorten L to the sub-quarter micron regime. Therefore, as indicated in Formula (2), in future it is felt that reducing supply voltage will depend on reducing drain current (I[.sub]D[/]). The reduction of I[.sub]D[/] will lead to a drastic increase of part one of Formula (1) in BiCMOS circuits. This will increase the internal delay of the BiCMOS gates, and reducing supply voltage will make the extent of deterioration of high-speed characteristics greater than that of CMOS circuits. This will result in crossover capacity moving further toward the high load side. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4. Relationship Between Delay Time and Crossover This is how the reduction of V[.sub]cc[/] in BiCMOS circuits manifests itself in an extremely pronounced increase of t[.sub]pd[/]. From the above it is clear how the internal delay time peculiar to BiCMOS circuits increases as a result of the reduction of V[.sub]cc[/], making it impossible for the BiCMOS to maintain its superior high-speed operation vis-a-vis CMOS circuits. As is clear from Formula (1), the only thing that can be done to avoid this situation is to decrease either C[.sub]B[/] or V[.sub]F[/]. V[.sub]F[/] is pretty much determined by the band gap of the silicon material used to fabricate the BJT, and the amount of this energy basically cannot be changed. It is also possible to decrease C[.sub]EB[/] and reduce C[.sub]B[/] by decreasing the size of the BJT emitter, but this will simultaneously reduce the emitter current value (I[.sub]E[/]) and/or the collector current value (I[.sub]C[/]). As pointed out above, we don't want a design that sacrifices the BJT's greatest merit, its powerful drive current. New BiCMOS Circuit 1. V [.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the Current Level Figure 5 illustrates the principle behind reducing BJT V[.sub]F[/] at the current level in a newly-proposed BiCMOS circuit. Circuit-wise, this approach ensures that the BJT base potential (V[.sub]B[/]) doesn't drop below the ground level. Figure 5. Principle Behind Reducing BJT V[.sub]F[/] in BiCMOS Circuit With this circuit, the BJT base node potential (V[.sub]B[/]) shown in Figure 5 does not drop below the nMOSFET threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/]). At this time, the delay time of the BiCMOS circuit (t[.sub]pd[/]) is expressed by the following formula: t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]EB[/] x (V[.sub]F[/] -V[.sub]tn[/])/I[.sub]D[/] + C[.sub]L[/] x V[.sub]cc[/]/2/I[.sub]c[/] (3) And V[.sub]F[/] is reduced to V[.sub]a[/], which is expressed as follows: V[.sub]a[/] = V[.sub]F[/] -V[.sub]tn[/] (4) Since in an ordinary process V[.sub]F[/] is approximately 0.8V and V[.sub]tn[/] is approximately 0.6V, V[.sub]a[/] works out to approximately 0.2V. Taking this kind of configuration will increase BJT OFF current (I[.sub]off[/]), and the degree of increase can be readily estimated vis-a-vis ON current (I[.sub]on[/]) using the formula: EQUATION This increase in OFF current is an extremely small 1/2200, and can practically be ignored from the standpoint of high-speed operation. As used here, q is amount of unit charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, V[.sub]EB[/](off) = 0.6V, V[.sub]EB[/](on) = 0.8V and T = 300K. Figure 6, 7 and 8 give examples of BiCMOS circuits designed based on this principle. The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7 operate at V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]F[/] at high level output, and at GND + V[.sub]F[/] at low level output. With the circuit shown in Figure 8, output low potential is lowered to ground level by operating the load discharge side of the BJT until the saturation region. EQUATION Figure 6. Example 1 of New BiCMOS Circuit Figure 7. Example 2 of New BiCMOS Circuit Figure 8. Example 3 of New BiCMOS Circuit The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7 lower the amount of charge needed for BJT ON and OFF, and even if the MOSFET I[.sub]D[/] is reduced, BJT ON and OFF can be operated at high speed. However, the minimum operating voltage for these circuits is 2 V[.sub]F[/] + _D_V, so that with V[.sub]F[/] is approximately 0.8V, _D_V is approximately 0.8V (in this report, we make logic swing the same value as ECL100K, or 0.8V), V[.sub]cc[/]min is approximately 2.4V. Therefore, a BiCMOS circuit that uses BJT for load charge-discharge, and operates the BJT in the active region has a minimum operating voltage of 2.4V. Operating the load discharge BJT of the circuit shown in Figure 8 until the saturation region enables the minimum operating voltage of the BiCMOS circuit to be reduced to V[.sub]F[/] + _D_V is approximately 1.6V. We talk about the operational problems encountered by operating the BJT until the saturation region later in the report. 2. V [.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the Voltage Level Using only the mechanism discussed above, the most operating speed can be improved at low voltage operation is 20-30%. This is caused by the fact that when an ordinary (enhancement-type) nMOSFET is used to turn ON the load discharge BJT as shown in Figure 9 (a), the BJT does not operate to the point where the input signal potential reaches V[.sub]F[/] + Vt (> 0). When considering a supply voltage of less than 2V, the input threshold value in this case would simply be too large (V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 1.4V, at V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 0. 6V). Therefore, we put together a proposal advocating the use of a depletion-type MOSFET to turn ON the load discharge BJT (See Figure 9 (b)). In this case, the input threshold value for load discharge would be V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]t[/] < V[.sub]F[/], making possible high-speed load discharge. Figure 9. Operating Speed at Low-voltage Operation (The thick lines indicate the range of the voltage that the BJT 3. Proposal for a LV-BiFET Figure 10 is a graphic illustration of a circuit that incorporates the mechanisms discussed in the previous two sections. This circuit is felt to be the simplest form of achieving the mechanisms discussed in sections 1 and 2 above. Figure 10. LV-BiFET Circuit We have called the circuit indicated in Figure 10 a low-voltage operational bipolar field-effect transistor or LV-BiFET. This LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn-type BJT with one pMOSFET each and a depletion-type nMOSFET (D-nMOSFET). Although we use a D-nMOSFET, its source is connected to the base of the BJT, and DC current does not run through the D-nMOSFET part. LV-BiFET Operation We will use Figure 11 to explain the operation of the LV-BiFET. Q1, Q2 turn ON voltage is 0.8V, the pMOSFET (M1) threshold value (V[.sub]tp[/]) equals 0.65V and the D-nMOSFET (M2) threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/]) is -0.65V. As a result, the input threshold value of the BiFET is GND (0V) + V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]tn[/] + (substrate effect) or is approximately 0.2V on the low level side, and V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]tp[/] or V[.sub]cc[/] is approximately 0.65V on the high level side. Low level output is GND + V[.sub]offset[/] (V[.sub]offset[/] is the Q2 emitter-collector offset voltage) or 0.05V, and high level output is V[.sub]cc[/] - V[.sub]F[/] or V[.sub]cc[/] is approximately 0.8V. Figure 11. LV-BiFET Basic Operation Low level input (Figure 11 (a)) turns the pMOSFET (M1) ON, turns the D-nMOSFET (M2) OFF, turns the output pull-up BJT (Q1) ON and turns the output pull-down BJT (Q2) OFF, thereby resulting in high level output (V[.sub]cc[/] - V[.sub]F[/]). And high level input (Figure 11 (b)) turns M1 OFF, M2 ON, and as a result of M2 conducting the base potential, this base potential becomes the same for both Q1 and Q2. At this time, Q2 emitter potential is at GND level, and Q1 emitter potential is transiting from V[.sub]cc[/] - V[.sub]F[/] to GND + V[.sub]offset[/]. Thus, the voltage between the emitter bases (V[.sub]EB[/]) is larger at Q2 than at Q1, and output is low level (GND + V[.sub]offset[/]). Figure 12 illustrates an output holding operation. At low-level input (Figure 12 (a)), M2 sub-threshold current (I[.sub]leak[/]) is considerably smaller than M1 I[.sub]D[/], putting Q1 base potential at the V[.sub]cc[/] level and maintaining output at high level. When this happens, Q2 base potential is maintained at V[.sub]F[/] - V[.sub]a[/]. As used here, V[.sub]a[/] represents a minute voltage. At high-level input (Figure 12 (b)), M1 turns OFF and M2 turns ON, but because the high-level input is V[.sub]cc[/] - V[.sub]F[/] and M1 V[.sub]tp[/] is set at |V[.sub]tp[/]| < |V[.sub]F[/]|, M1 does not turn completely OFF, resulting in a minute drain current (minute-I[.sub]D[/]). The Q1 and Q2 bases are also the same potential at this time. The relationship between this minute I[.sub]D[/] and the amount of the Q2 base current leak determines the low potential side of the DC base potential of Q1 and Q2. Figure 12. LV-BiFET Output Holding Operation Principle At this point, we carried out simulations based on Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) parameters of a 0.55�m BiCMOS process (All simulations discussed hereafter use the same parameters.). And calculation of load capacity and load resistance, including source and drain capacity, conformed to a 4M BiCMOS SRAM design using this process.[.sup]2)[/] In this situation, an internal node capacity (BJT base node capacity) of F/O approximately 4 is too large, and external load capacity pull-down ends before the internal node charge at output pull-down decreases sufficiently (before the internal node potential drops to V[.sub]F[/] - V[.sub]a[/]), resulting in the generation of an unnecessary through-current in the BJT. As shown in Figure 13, we used an additional element (one BJT and one condensor) to evaluate the characteristics of the broad-range F/O on the same circuit. Figure 13. Characteristics Evaluation Circuit The BJT equipped with the additional element was for extracting the internal node charge at higher speeds. This BJT can be eliminated once the proper relationship has been established between the internal node capacity and the output load capacity. And the condensor (C) is for carrying out Q2 ON and OFF operations in active pull-up and pull-down modes by coupling with the input. Figure 14 illustrates the voltage waveform when the LV-BiFET supply voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4, and Figure 15 shows the current waveform. As can be seen from Figure 14, the low-level potential of node-A is approximately 0.7V, and the low-level potential of node-B is approximately 0.6V, and the effective BJT turn-ON voltage (V[.sub]a[/]) is roughly 0.2V. And as can be discerned from Figure 15, the DC through-current is so small that it can practically be ignored. Figure 14. Voltage Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4 Figure 15. Current Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V Comparison With Conventional Circuits Next, let's compare the operating speed and power consumption of the LV-BiFET circuit with conventional circuits. The types of conventional circuits targeted for comparison purposes were CMOS, BiNMOS, BiCMOS and NTL circuits. Figure 16 indicates the circuit constants of the circuits compared. For the sake of convenience, we made these comparisons using a one input - one output inverter. With the exception of the NTL circuit, the input signals to all the other conventional circuits entered through the MOS gates and input capacity (C[.sub]in[/]) was made a uniform 0.1pF (Naturally, the C on the input side of the BiFET also included C[.sub]in[/].). Because input to the NTL circuit entered through the base of the BJT, C[.sub]in[/] was smaller than 0.1pF. Figure 16. Comparison of BiFET Circuit With Conventional Circuits Figure 17 shows the operating waveforms for all of the circuits when supply voltage was 1.6V. The reason supply voltage was set at 1.6V was to make the logic swing of the BiFET and BiNMOS ECL100K convertible (_D_V = 0.8V), i. e. (V[.sub]cc[/] = V[.sub]F[/] + _D_V = 0.8V + 0.8V = 1.6V). With V[.sub]cc[/] equal to 1.6V, the logic swing of the LV-BiFET, CMOS and BiNMOS circuits was 0.8V, 1.6V and 0.8V, respectively. Since the NTL circuit could not operate at 1.6V, the diagram in Figure 17 shows a waveform for a supply voltage of 1.9V and a logic swing of 0.4V. The figure does not show the waveform for the BiCMOS circuit compared because the lowest supply voltage that a BiCMOS circuit can operate at is 2.4V (2 V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]D[/] = 2 x 0.8V + 0.8V = 2.4V). Figure 17. Operating Waveforms For All Circuits Operated at 1.6V Figure 18 shows the supply voltage (|V[.sub]cc[/]-GND|) dependence of delay time when F/O is equal to 4. The operating speed of the LV-BiFET was second only to that of the NTL circuit when supply voltage was under 3V. The reason the NTL circuit operating speed improved as supply voltage was reduced is because its logic swing decreased together with the supply voltage as a result of calculating the delay time by fixing the resistance value used in the circuit. Just as with the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits, the delay time of the LV-BiFET increased in line with the reduction of supply voltage, but this increase in delay time was smaller than that recorded for the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits due to the effects of artificially lowering the BJT turn ON voltage. Also, since the LV-BiFET was designed for optimum operation at 1.6V, it exhibited about the same delay time as the BiNMOS at supply voltages of 3V or more, and the effect of lowering the BJT turn ON voltage was not very pronounced. The LV-BiFET can also be designed for high-speed operation by optimizing it to operate at around 3V. Figure 18. Supply Voltage Dependence of Delay Time at F/O = 4 Figure 19 graphically depicts power consumption as a function of supply voltage when F/O is 4 and operating frequency is 100MHz. The LV-BiFET exhibited the lowest power consumption of all the circuits compared at supply voltages ranging between 1.6-3.5V. This can be accounted for by the fact that the LV-BiFET's logic swing had a smaller V[.sub]F[/] (= 0.8V) than the CMOS circuit, by the fact that the LV-BiFET transistors operated at high speed at the output stage, and the LV-BiFET employed BJT with greater drive capabilities for both output pull-up and pull-down, and by the fact that the LV-BiFET exhibited a smaller through-current at the output stage than the BiNMOS circuit. Figure 19. Power Consumption as a Function of Supply Voltage At F/O = 4 and 100MHz The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely superior operating characteristics at 1.6V compared to those of both the CMOS and BiNMOS circuits, recording 1.7-times the operating speed and 45% less power consumption than the CMOS circuit, and 1.7-times the operating speed and 35% less power consumption than the BiNMOS circuit. Figures 20 and 21 depict LV-BiFET delay time and power consumption at 100MHz as a function of fanout when operating at 1.6V. The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely small dependence on fanout due to the fact that it charges/discharges external additional load using BJTs with large load drive capacities. Also, as was already shown earlier, because the LV-BiFET reduces the characteristic self-delay time of the BiCMOS (the time expressed in part one of Formula (3)), its delay time crossover point with the CMOS circuit is less than fanout 1, making it faster than CMOS circuits at all fanouts ordinarily considered. The delay time for the LV-BiFET came in second only to that for the NTL circuit, and for the reasons stipulated in the previous section on supply voltage dependence, the LV-BiFET exhibited the lowest power consumption for all fanouts. Figure 20. Delay Time as a Function of Fanout at 1.6V Figure 21. Power Consumption as a Function of Fanout at 100MHz Figure 22 shows the relationship between power consumption and delay time. At 1.6V of supply voltage, the LV-BiFET exhibited a 70% smaller power-delay product than the CMOS circuit, a 60% smaller power-delay product than the BiNMOS circuit and a 55% smaller power-delay product than the NTL circuit. Figure 22. Power Consumption-Delay Time Relationship (at F/O = 4, 100MHz) Table 1 lists up the characteristics of all the circuits compared. The LV-BiFET used for simulation purposes exhibited the smallest power-delay product of all the circuits compared, recording at 1. 6V of operating power a 70%, 60% and 55% smaller power-delay product than the CMOS, BiNMOS and NTL circuits, respectively. At present, the one drawback of the LV-BiFET is its large surface area overhead resulting from its use of two BJT. And as shown in Figure 13, when an additional circuit is attached to the LV-BiFET, its surface area equals that of a BiCMOS. However, the merits of being able to achieve high-speed operation and low power consumption at the low supply voltage of 1.6V are considerable. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Characteristics of Each Type of Basic Gate Process Dependence of Operating Characteristics Just as with CMOS circuits, the delay time and power consumption characteristics of the LV-BiFET change in response to changes in the MOSFET V[.sub]t[/]. Based on the circuit depicted in Figure 16 (a), we used SPICE simulation processing to predict changes in the pMOSFET and nMOSFET V[.sub]t[/]. At 1.6V, when the respective V[.sub]t[/] fluctuated between +0. 1V and -0.1V, delay time only deteriorated around 3%, but power consumption increased a maximum of two-fold. This occurred when |V[.sub]tp[/]| decreased. The increase in the minute drain current of the pMOSFET shown in Figure 12 (b) was caused by delaying the pull-up BJT Q1 turn OFF and created a through-current between Q1 and Q2. Therefore, in order to make the most of LV-BiFET characteristics, you must pay adequate attention to the increase in the pMOSFET threshold voltage (V[.sub]t[/]) (the decrease in the |V[.sub]tp[/]|). To operate the LV-BiFET at less than 2V, operate the output pull-down BJT until it reaches the saturation region. In our SPICE simulations, we employed a T[.sub]F[/] of approximately 20ps and a T[.sub]R[/] of approximately 2ns. There are considerable problems concerning the time required to draw out the excess carriers in a base, but with the LV-BiFET, even when we increased the T[.sub]R[/] value to 10ns and carried out simulation, there was very little impact on the operating characteristics of the circuit. This is because the BJT used in the LV-BiFET are only operated in the small base voltage range (However, if the T[.sub]R[/] value is increased more than a single digit, normal operation ceases to be possible.). And since it will be possible in the age of LSIs that operate on 2V or less supply voltage to design BJT with low voltage resistance, designers will have much more freedom in their design of bases and collectors. Thus, we feel it is easy to design BJTs themselves so that they exhibit relatively low T[.sub]R[/] values. The drawbacks to LV-BiFETs are their large layout surface areas, the fact that their pMOSFET threshold voltage (V[.sub]t[/]) increases (|V[.sub]tp[/]| decreases) and power consumption increases. But as progress is made in scaling down MOSFETs, LV-BiFETs should prove very useful from the standpoint that they will furnish the same advantages as BiCMOS circuits even at supply voltages of under 2V. Also, if a process can be developed for integrating the MOSFET source-drain region and BJT base regions, then it should be possible to eliminate the use of additional circuits even when F/O is small. What is more, the BJT we used in simulation processing this time were BiCMOS process transistors based primarily on f[.sub]T[/] is approximately 10GHz CMOS. However, if we utilize faster BJT, we should be able to achieve LV-BiFET with even more superior characteristics vis-a-vis CMOS and BiNMOS circuits. Conclusions This report has served as an introduction of a new high-speed BiCMOS (LV-BiFET) circuit that operates at 1.6V and has a 0.8V logic swing. The LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn bipolar transistors, one pMOSFET and one depletion-type nMOSFET, and achieves high-speed operation at low voltage by using circuitry schemes to artificially reduce the turn ON voltage of the bipolar transistors. The results of SPICE simulations made it possible to estimate that with an F/O of 4, a supply voltage of 1.6V and an operating frequency of 100MHz, the LV-BiFET is 1.7-times faster and consumes 45% less power than a conventional CMOS circuit, and is 1.7-times faster and consumes 35% less power than a BiNMOS circuit. The LV-BiFET is even faster and consumes less power than a conventional CMOS circuit when in a low load state of F/O = 1. Although there are a number of drawbacks to LV-BiFET, such as their large layout surface area and the need to pay close attention to circuit design, we believe that in the age of low, 2V or less supply voltage, the LV-BiFET points out one direction for achieving high-speed, high-performance LSI (BiCMOS LSI).
