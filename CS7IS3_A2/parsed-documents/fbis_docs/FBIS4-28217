FBIS4-28217 "dreas111_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Thailand More on Iranian Bomb Suspects More on Iranian Bomb Suspects Dailies View Arrest BK0806131694 BK0806131694 BFN [Editorial Report] Bangkok KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT in Thai and Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June carry editorials on the arrest by Thai police of three Iranian suspects in the foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in March. Police have finally arrested three suspects in the attempt to sabotage the Israeli Embassy by using a truck laden with C-4 explosives, the editorial in KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT says. The 600-word editorial, on page 2, entitled: "A Sporadic Fad Cannot Cope With Sabotage," believed there are more than three people involved in the attempt. Short of evidence and information, police cannot make further arrests, especially of those who are the masterminds behind the plot. Those people are dangerous because they have the power to order more operations to be carried out despite the fact that a number of terrorists have been arrested. The editorial supports the instruction by the police director general who wanted investigators to urgently wrap up inquiries so that the three suspects can be tried by the court of justice and the result be made known to the public. It says: "Investigators should be able to produce substantial evidence to charge the three who are foreign nationals. Otherwise, the case could affect bilateral relations." There has already been a sign of that -- Radio Tehran yesterday reported that the Iranian Government had filed a protest letter to the Thai Government asking that a trial be carried out promptly, it says. The paper concludes: "We support the order issued by the police director general for police to intensively monitor people suspected to have links with international terrorist groups and to tighten security for key establishments following the arrest of the three suspects. It goes without saying that the order was meant to block the attempts by terrorists to mount pressure on the police while investigations are being conducted against the three. We hope that officials will respond to the order of the police chief and carry out their duties seriously and consistently, and not just on and off as in the past." MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It also urges the police to prove that the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not just scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as members of international terrorist groups, the government should, in order to give more weight to the arrest, seek cooperation from the Malaysian Government for more information on the suspects as it was found that they once lived in Malaysia. Cooperation from Malaysia would enhance Thailand's credibility in doing justice to the arrested terrorists," MATICHON says. It also wants the government to contact Iran on the issue. "Iran is another country which should be able to supply Thailand with information about the suspects who hold Iranian passports," says the editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we cannot expect much from Iran since it is natural that Iran would rather be cautious and try to demonstrate that it has nothing to do with activities by international terrorist groups." The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand," the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make that policy known to those countries which support international terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to come to Thailand.
