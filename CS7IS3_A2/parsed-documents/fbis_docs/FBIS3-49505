Madeleine Albright told Klaus today. During a meeting between Albright, head of U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili, and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, the three participants held similar views on the "Partnership for Peace" project. To the countries of the Central European region, it presents an open opportunity for establishing close military and political ties with NATO, according to the statement issued by the Premier's Office. The project is also a tool, according to Klaus, for strengthening the internal stability of the Central European region. U.S. presence in Europe is important for democratic development and stability of the whole of Europe, Klaus said at the meeting, adding that the Czech Republic is interested in its neighbors' success and prosperity. The Czech Republic prefers concrete accords like the Central European Free Trade Agreement to summits and joint declarations, Klaus said.
