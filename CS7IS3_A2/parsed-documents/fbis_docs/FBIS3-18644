In addition, he stressed that an "autonomous" PS would attract many communist voters, for he sees no reason why those who voted for the PCP should vote instead for the PS. Asked to comment on his belief that the PS's support comes from the middle class, Guterres noted that for the PS to win an election, it must attract a significant share of those who voted for the PSD in 1991 and did not vote again for it in the last municipal elections. Consequently, the PS must appeal, not only to the less privileged classes, but also to the "dynamic sectors" of society, without being "the party of the excluded." Asked whether this means the center-left, Guterres agreed, noting that this is where his party belongs. He stressed the view that there is no distinction today between democratic socialism and social democracy, despite the fact that his party does not resemble the PSD, which "for historical and accidental reasons has a name that does not correspond to its ideology." Guterres expressed his belief that the state's role is to "regulate and promote social justice and equality of opportunity," for the market, without which it is "impossible to guarantee the efficient functioning of the economy," cannot achieve these goals. Guterres was also queried on his recent statement that Portugal must have a strategy vis-a-vis Spain. The PS leader replied that Lisbon must defend Portuguese interests and should not accept a "regional and peripheral" position within Europe with regard to Spain. Finally, when asked whether Portugal ought to participate actively in a possible NATO intervention in Bosnia, Guterres said that while Portugal should not refuse to contribute to peace missions, Portuguese Armed Forces should have a greater role to play in peace processes in the former Portuguese colonies than in the former Yugoslavia, whose relations with Lisbon are not of primary importance.
