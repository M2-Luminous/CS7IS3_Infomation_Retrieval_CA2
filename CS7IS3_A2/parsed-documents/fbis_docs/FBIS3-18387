In statements in the Congress lobby prior to reporting to a closed session on the operational situation of the Armed Forces, the minister explained that it is still not known to which force the downed aircraft belonged because noone is owning up to it. For this reason, an increase in tension is not expected. Garcia Vargas considers that, in a sense, the attack was expected because it has always been thought, he said, that the violation of the air exclusion zone should elicit a response. Yesterday saw the materialization of a possibility that had always existed. He also referred to the possibility of mortar attacks on Sarajevo. If this shelling is continuous, he said, there will be a NATO attack.
