An RNS congress is to be held in Suzdal early in April to adopt a charter of the organisation. The conference was addressed by RNS leader Aleksandr Sterligov. He made an evaluation of the situation in the country, noting disunity among the ranks of the patriotic forces of Russia. It follows from Sterligov's remarks the RNS has virtually lost all allies after the events of the Autumn last year and the December parliamentary elections. Sterligov pointed out the correctness of the RNS' principled position of nonalignment with respect to the National Salvation Front as well as non-participation in the latest elections.
