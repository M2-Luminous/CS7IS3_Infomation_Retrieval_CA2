OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0059 Title: Statement Regarding the Importation of Radio Frequency Devices Capable of Causing Harmful Interference Form Number: FCC Form 740 Action: Extension of currently approved collection Respondents: Individuals or households, state or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 496,500 responses; .037 hours average burden per response; 18,371 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: FCC Form 740 declaration is submitted to the Commission and U.S. Customs Service upon importation of radio frequency (RF) devices. The information collection describes devices being imported that may be harmful to authorized radio frequencies so that the FCC, with the assistance of Customs, can carry out this responsibility. Examples of RF devices include: Microwave ovens, virtually any product containing a computer microprocessor, computers and computer peripherals, telephones with memory or other advanced features, video cameras and recorders, transmitters and transceivers, most receivers including television receivers, electronic musical instruments, video games, and radio remote control toys. Rule changes in 1990 reduced the number and types of devices for which the import declaration is required. Those rule changes also has led to the use of electronic submission of the required information. Because of the effect of the change to electronic filing, the number of paper forms submitted annually has dropped by an estimated sixty percent. The information continues to be used by FCC to ensure that radio frequency devices imported into the United States and its customs territory comply with applicable FCC Rules and Regulations. Information is necessary to FCC/FOB Enforcement Division, FCC Laboratory and U.S. Customs. Purpose is to keep non-compliant devices from being distributed to the general public thereby reducing the potential for harmful interference being caused to authorized communications. When a violation is discovered, the FCC can issue a fine or request Customs to issue redelivery notice to the importer. If the importer does not redeliver the RF device to Customs, the importer is subject to fines imposed by the U.S. Customs Service. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0073 Title: Application for and Certification of Overtime Service Involving Inspection of Ship Radio Equipment Form Number: FCC Form 808 Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 200 responses; .084 hours average burden per response; 17 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: FCC Form 808 is used to request an overtime inspection of compulsory shipboard radio equipment, pursuant to section 4(f)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC Rules and Regulations, 47 CFR 80.59(e). The information requested certifies that the overtime service was requested and performed. If this form were not completed, the U.S. Government would not be reimbursed for the overtime money paid to the employee. Federal Communications Commission William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
