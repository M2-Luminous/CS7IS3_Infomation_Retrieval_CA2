FR940525-0-00054 FR940525-0-00024 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 625 [Docket No. 940262&hyph;4062; I.D. 050994D] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of commercial quota adjustment. SUMMARY: NMFS announces adjustments to the commercial quota for the 1994 summer flounder fishery. This action complies with regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP), which require quota overages landed in any state to be deducted from that state's quota the following year. The public is advised that a quota adjustment has been made and is informed of the revised state quotas. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the FMP are found at 50 CFR part 625, the final rule being published on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57358). The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state is described in §625.20. The commercial summer flounder quota for the 1994 calendar year, adopted to ensure achievement of the appropriate fishing mortality rate of 0.53 for 1994, is set to equal 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) (59 FR 10586, March 7, 1994). Section 625.20(d)(2) provides that all landings for sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual commercial quota. Any landings in excess of the state's quota will be deducted from that state's annual quota for the following year. Based on dealer reports and other available information, the following states were determined to have exceeded their 1993 quotas: Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The remaining states of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York did not exceed their 1993 quotas and, therefore, no adjustments are necessary for these states. Table 1 shows the 1993 quotas adjusted for authorized transfers made between states during the year, 1993 landings, 1993 overage amounts, 1994 quotas, and the adjusted 1994 quotas taking into account 1993 overage amounts, by state.
