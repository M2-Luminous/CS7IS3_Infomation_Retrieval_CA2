[Prime Minister Tansu] Ciller says "I did not do it all by myself." This is partly true. However, she also says "I am trying to undo the mistakes of the last past 10 years." It would be hard to agree with that statement. I am going to give you an example to explain how critical is the situation we are in. The total balance of payments deficit between 1982 and 1992 -- Ozal governments and the Yildirim Akbulut, Mesut Yilmaz, Suleyman Demirel, and Ciller governments -- is less than the total balance of payments deficit in 1993. The situation is that serious. The recent economic situation is a big fiasco. In other words, in this chaotic situation, one prime minister went through two governors of the central bank. This is unacceptable. This is a crisis. I know both [former governor] Rustu Saracoglu and [former governor] Bulent Gultekin. They are decent and professional officials. Gultekin has a very good background and he knows his job. I do not think the prime minister is known outside of the country as well as Gultekin from an academic career perspective. To make a comparison, we can say that these bureaucrats know their jobs better than Ciller. The head of the central bank reached a point where he was not able to do his job. Actually, this was the cause of his frustration. Saracoglu stayed on the job because of [President Suleyman] Demirel. Otherwise, he would have been replaced earlier. Ciller does not know and understand the issues. Instead of approaching the issues properly, without being influenced by the others, her approach to issues is "I will give the orders and the job will get done." If this had not been the case, she would have appointed a minister responsible for the economy. This situation conflicts with modern methods of administering. She has no ability to administer. She says that she is a professor. This is true and I am sure she teaches her students about general economics. However, this is different from administering a government's economy which requires special knowledge. She cannot understand this. As a matter of fact, it is clear that she does not know the job. The recent foreign exchange crises happened because of her inability to manage. Because she said, "I will do the job myself" she did not appoint an economy minister. So, she is the main reason for the situation. However, the major opposition party leader is also exploiting the situation. State employees are being encouraged to resign. This is not patriotism. This is our own government we are hurting. Let people decide for themselves if they want to resign. There is no reason for Yilmaz [general chairman of the Motherland Party] to provoke them. Because this provocation will harm the country.
