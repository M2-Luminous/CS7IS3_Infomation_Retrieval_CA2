Private enterprise needs to be developed faster, especially in the service sector, said Liu Minxue, head of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the country's top business watchdog. Liu told a national conference in Beijing yesterday that governments at all levels should encourage cooperation between the private businesses and other economic sectors to create a mixed economy. The State had a policy of encouraging private enterprise in all kinds of areas -- except key national economic sectors and industries like defence, Liu said. A strong private sector is one of the preconditions of fair market competition, he said, adding that local governments should consider it part of the country's economic structure and work hard to develop it as a principal component of an integrated socialist market. Encouraging the private sector is part of the State's plan to develop a sound market system based on the new laws against unfair competition and on consumers' rights. SAIC reports say the private sector is becoming more and more important to local economies in both the better-developed coastal regions and some poor inland areas. Twenty-eight provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have issued local measures and policies to promote private business. As a result, the country had 16 million private businessmen and women by the end of September, 11.7 percent more than 12 months before. There were 210,000 private enterprises, 73 percent more than the previous year, Liu said. Last year's tax payment from private businesses and enterprises was expected to be 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion), according to the State Tax Administration. Meanwhile, Liu said at the conference that China will do more to ensure fair competition among enterprises. The measures are expected to come out soon following the introduction nationwide of a new business registration system, a move considered very important to the growth of the market economy. The new registration system aims to give enterprises the chance to make their own decisions and make them responsible for profits and losses, said Liu. He said the reform means less direct government control, except in key State enterprises. Most enterprises will now sign on directly at registration departments instead of first getting approval from government departments as before, he said. Liu also pledged to enlarge the scope of registration to include businesses run by universities and research centres. By the end of last September, the number of registered businesses in China was 7.113 million, 22 percent more than nine months before, Liu said.
