President 'Arafat, who was speaking at a Fatah Central Committee meeting in Tunis, said that in the first stage 25,000 Palestinians will arrive in the self-rule area. The Fatah Central Committee meetings witnessed heated debates and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on one hand, and Ahmad Quray' and Hakam Bal'awi on the other. Leaked information indicates that Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris economic talks with Israel, threatened that he will not go to Paris in protest of Hani al-Hasan's objections to and observations on the economic talks. Differences within the Fatah Central Committee extended to Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Ghunaym, Major General Muhammad Jihad, and 'Abbas Zaki when they expressed their dissatisfaction over the current situation, especially following the Cairo accord. According to Palestinian sources close to the Fatah Central Committee, the situation inside the committee became more aggravated after Muhammad Ghunaym, who is responsible for mobilization and organization in Fatah, submitted his resignation protesting the decisions about the higher national authority. For his part, Ghunaym stressed that he did not submit his resignation nor was there any mediation for rescinding his resignation because it did not happen in the first place. Ghunaym said that this session of the Fatah Central Committee meetings is devoted to drawing up the blueprint of the coming stage in Gaza and Jericho. He added that each committee member has his own views about this subject and that there were differences between some viewpoints. He explained that the Central Committee has not drawn up the final blueprint yet. Other sources in the Central Committee emphasized that President 'Arafat expressed his anger at the visit by Mahmud 'Abbas to the United Arab Emirates, stressing that 'Abbas went there without a decision by the leadership. Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, backed 'Arafat on this issue. The sources said that some Fatah Central Committee members, including Hani al-Hasan, voiced strong criticism at Nabil Sha'th's negotiating performance. They said that 'Arafat proposed to Hani al-Hasan to manage the negotiations with Sha'th. Al-Hasan told 'Arafat that in the past he had called for reassessing the negotiating reference point and adopting a policy of playing off the political blocs and persevering. Al-Hasan continued: What I said about the multilateral talks has proven to be true, but unfortunately it was ignored by the Palestinian leadership. The Fatah Central Committee meetings will continue until the final perception of the Palestinian self-rule authority is drawn up. It has been learned that President 'Arafat is disappointed with the Israeli position, which has engrossed the PLO in details while failing to broach the extent of the self-rule authority's powers.
