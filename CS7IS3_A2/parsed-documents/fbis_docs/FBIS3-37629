Security Council resolutions, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said here on Friday after his talks with President Francois Mitterrand. The Kazakh leader made a brief stopover here on his way from New York to Almaty. Addressing journalists after being received in the Elysee Palace, Nazarbayev pointed out that his arrival in Paris coincided with a "critical phase" of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Each side should adhere to U.N. Security Council resolutions. If the resolutions are implemented, we will get every chance to arrive at a peaceful solution to the conflict," he emphasised. Nazarbayev told journalists about the contents of his talks with President Mitterrand, pointing out that they considered a wide range of international problems, the state of affairs in Central Asia and CIS countries, in particular. The president of Kazakhstan said "there were no divergences of opinion" during the talks. He said Franco-Kazakh cooperation develops in the proper direction, which is indicative of "a further strenghtening of friendly contacts between Kazakhstan and France." By way of example, Nazarbayev cited contracts concluded between the Kazakhstan Government and such large French companies as Elf Aquitaine, Total, Citroen, and Cogema. "President Mitterrand and I agreed to give a boost to the functioning of the mixed economic commission set up by the governments of our two countries," Nazarbayev said, adding that the first priority task of Almaty is to strengthen bilateral cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises. After talks in the Elysee Palace, the president of Kazakhsatn left by air for home.
