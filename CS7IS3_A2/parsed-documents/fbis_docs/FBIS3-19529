Despite the recession, which has hit public finances hard, he is to announce some good news this morning in the Council of Ministers: Last year's budget deficit has not grown as much as expected. According to the final figures, it should total 315.7 billion French francs [Fr]. At first glance, this is great news, since we have long expected 1993 to end up being an outright disaster -- with an unprecedented hole in government finances. A year and a half ago the Socialists predicted in the initial finance law that the deficit would be Fr165.4 billion. Then everything started going wrong. Set up by Edouard Balladur at the time of the transition, the Raynaud Commission -- which was given the task of assessing the legacy -- estimated last spring that the deficit could reach the catastrophic level of Fr320 to 360 billion by the end of the year. The government will therefore be able to use this as an example to bolster its argument that it has engaged in sound management: first because since spring -- and at the time of the corrected finance law -- it has done everything to limit the slide, setting itself the goal of not exceeding a deficit of Fr317 billion; and second because it even managed to do better than that during the implementation phase. This is proof that the flood has been contained and that the government is now on the way toward bringing the deficit down to around Fr300 billion by the end of 1994, as predicted. In addition, it should manage to do this even more easily since, according to reliable sources, the government is said to have chalked up an even lower deficit in 1993 of around Fr300 to 305 billion. However, it is said that the government has given this up and has taken certain expenditure into account for 1993 (primarily capital appropriations) planned for 1994 and has allocated certain receipts planned for 1994 to 1993. This would have the twofold advantage of not contradicting the conclusions of the Raynaud report on the Socialist administration, as well as alleviating the 1994 budget. Nevertheless, there is one cloud on the horizon. While the budget deficit is once again falling, government debt is skyrocketing. It will probably rise from Fr2.110 trillion at the end of 1992 to Fr2.470 billion at the end of 1993 (a little less than initially predicted) and to around Fr2.870 trillion by the end of 1994.
