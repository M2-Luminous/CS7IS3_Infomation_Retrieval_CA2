This will ensue if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak does not reverse the decision last week on the dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. Stanislaw Wolny said that the decision by Marek Borowski is all but 100 percent certain. The resignation is to be presented to the prime minister most probably on Friday, after Waldemar Pawlak's return from Brussels. This news was commented as follows by spokesman of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski: [Begin Siemiatkowski recording] The resignation of Marek Borowski was never considered. I can say more, Mr. Borowski is a sufficiently responsible politician to be fully aware of the fact that, first, he must continue that which he has undertaken. Second, he was designated by the SLD to fulfill this very important function and so he must be aware of the fact that only the adoption of the budget can lead to the political stabilization of the parliament, the Sejm, and the coalition. And these are matters far more important than even the very important considerations that have caused the crisis between Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and the prime minister. Really, all the issues that led to the crisis will be resolved only after the return of Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is in Brussels at the moment. Most probably he has already had the opportunity to meet the prime minister and clarify the issues that led to the sparks, the sparks along the government axis. Although this is not yet a matter that would have the character of a coalition crisis, this is a certain misunderstanding that we would wish to have resolved among the interested parties.
