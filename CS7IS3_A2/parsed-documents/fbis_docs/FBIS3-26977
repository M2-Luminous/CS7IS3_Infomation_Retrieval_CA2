In an interview published by the German weekly magazine "DIE WOCHE," the U.N. Chief said there will be no hesitation in implementing relevant Security Council resolutions by means of air strikes. "If NATO grants me full powers, I can act immediately, because I already have the full power of the U.N.," he was quoted as saying. When asked whether Germany should send troops to participate in proposed U.N. actions, the secretary general said that in strengthening the status of the U.N., Germany plays a very significant role in the world. NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum ordering Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 February], or face allied air strikes. The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo street market in early February killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200. Over the past few days the international community has tried to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO ultimatum will be able to end the Bosnian war. In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton administration officials have reiterated that the Bosnian Serbs must turn over their artillery and mortars to the United Nations, move the weapons out of range of Sarajevo, or render them "inoperable."
