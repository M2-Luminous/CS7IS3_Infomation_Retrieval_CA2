Background and Program Description On January 26, 1992, the major provisions of titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect. The ADA provides legal protection to individuals with disabilities in the areas of public accommodations, commercial facilities, State and local government services, transportation, and employment. Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in a broad range of public accommodations, commercial facilities and certain transportation services. Title II prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government programs and services, including transportation, and State and local government employment. The employment (title I) and transportation (title II, Subpart B) provisions of the ADA are regulated by other Federal agencies and are not the subject of this Notice. Section 506 of the ADA requires that the Department of Justice render technical assistance to entities and individuals that have responsibilities or rights under title II (subtitle A, State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) of the ADA. Pursuant to this requirement, the Department provides a variety of ADA-related services and information, including: _A telephone information service (for voice and TTY callers) through which members of the public may obtain recorded information and place orders for ADA materials 24 hours/day and may discuss questions they have about the ADA with information specialists during certain business hours. This service has recently been converted to a toll-free ``1&hyph;800'' number and the number of hours of staffed service has been expanded; _A speaker's bureau through which organizations can arrange to have ADA experts from the Civil Rights Division speak on a variety of ADA issues; and _Distribution of written materials, including the Department's regulations implementing titles II and III, technical assistance manuals for titles II and III, an ADA Questions and Answers booklet, and other reference materials. These materials are available in standard print, large print, braille, audiotape, and computer disk. They may also be obtained through the Civil Rights Division's electronic bulletin board. Under section 506(d) of the Act, the Department has authority to award grants to individuals and non-profit entities for the purpose of supplementing the Department's technical assistance efforts. The Technical Assistance Grant Program is designed to develop and implement cost-effective and efficient strategies to disseminate information about the responsibilities and rights of covered entities and individuals under titles II and III of the ADA, with the goal of fostering understanding of, and facilitating voluntary compliance with, the ADA nationwide. This grant program is designed specifically to increase the level of knowledge of the ADA in order to ultimately increase the level of voluntary compliance with the ADA. The program is not intended to fund or support site-specific compliance implementation (e.g., funding to make specific facilities more accessible). Nor is it intended to fund or support inspections, reviews, or tests to determine whether an entity is meeting its compliance obligations. Proposals to conduct projects of these sorts will not be considered. Since the initiation of the grant program in 1991, the Department has awarded grants to 30 non-profit organizations. The recipients have included a wide range of groups, and the types of projects previously funded include: Projects to develop and disseminate educational materials, including detailed manuals, brochures and videotapes, to explain the regulations and how to comply with the ADA; projects to disseminate existing information to targeted audiences; projects to develop and conduct ADA training programs and seminars; projects to operate telephone information lines to answer various questions about the provisions of the ADA; and projects to develop and incorporate ADA materials into professional educational curricula and programs. Grantee projects have targeted various audiences of persons with responsibilities under title III or title II of the ADA, persons with disabilities with rights under the ADA, and persons who, because of their areas of professional or technical expertise, provide services that may assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act.
