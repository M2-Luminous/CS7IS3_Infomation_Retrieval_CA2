FR941021-1-00057 FR941021-1-00009 A review of general aviation accidents from 1982 through 1989 found six accidents caused by heart attacks in air transport pilots. These accidents resulted in seven deaths, one serious injury, and six destroyed airplanes. Parallel statistics for commercial accidents (from 1962 through 1989) revealed 4 accidents with 95 deaths, 15 major injuries, 2 destroyed commuter airplanes and 2 destroyed air transport planes. These statistics project an annual, cardiovascular-related accident cost of $2.0 million in damaged airplanes, and $27.2 million in lost life and injury costs. Multiplying the total $29.2 million projected cost by 5 percent, to estimate the likely proportion of these costs that would be averted by the proposed cholesterol test and standard, results in a potential annual benefit estimate of $1.46 million. Accordingly, the ten-year benefits are projected to be $14.6 million, with a 1993 present value of $10.3 million. The FAA projects that the expected minimum potential benefits of the proposal ($10.3 million) would exceed the estimated cost ($3.7 million). Part 61, Certificate Validity Period, Third-Class Under the proposal, persons under age 40 would generally only be required to undergo a physical examination every 3 years. Medical certificates for persons age 40 through 69 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and older would be required to undergo a physical examination every year. The amendment would reduce: (1) the projected years of pilot pathology exposure by an estimated 0.2 percent, (2) the projected flight hours of pilot pathology exposure by some 4.1 percent, and (3) the projected number of third-class medical examinations by 14.5 percent. Accordingly, it is expected that the proposed amendment would not induce any costs to third-class applicants considered as a whole. The evaluation does not specifically quantify the potential benefits from the expected minor reductions in pathology exposure. The expected ten-year savings that would derive from the 14.5 percent reduction in examinations is projected to total $23.7 million in direct testing and time costs (a 1993 present value of $16.5 million). With a projected benefit of $16.5 million and no expected net costs, the FAA finds that this provision would be cost beneficial. It is noted that the provision would transfer costs and benefits across age groups. Third-class applicants younger than 40 would take fewer examinations and would be expected to manifest a higher incident of undetected pathologies. Conversely, the group of applicants age 70 and older would take more examinations and would exhibit fewer undetected pathologies. However, the net effect would be a reduction in both examinations and pathologies, consistent with Executive Order 12291 which requires that regulatory objectives be chosen to maximize the net benefits to society. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, provides threshold cost and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. After reviewing the projected effects of the proposed rule in light of these standards, the FAA finds that the proposal would not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. International Trade Impact Statement The proposed rule would have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries and foreign firms doing business in the United States. Paperwork Reduction Act The paperwork burden associated with part 67 is currently approved under OMB number 2120&hyph;0034. Any increase or decreases associated with this NPRM will be submitted to OMB for approval.
