Details in the following report by Kassab Samawi from Amman airport: [Begin recording] [Samawi] Their Majesties King Husayn and Queen Nur were on hand to welcome back Jordanian nationals, who returned to the homeland aboard transport planes of the Jordanian Royal Air Force. There were around 300 men, women, and children aboard the C-130's, plus a number of Arabs and foreigners, that made a nonstop six-hour flight from Sanaa Airport to Amman across Saudi Arabian airspace. [passage omitted] How was the journey and how did you go about bringing the Jordanian nationals from Yemen? [Unidentified pilot] Thanks be to God, we were instructed by his majesty the king to fly to Yemen to fly home the Jordanian nationals there. We set up the necessary arrangements, including preparing the planes, and obtaining the requisite clearances to overfly other countries. Thanks to God, we took off for Sanaa this morning where we touched down at around 1000 Amman time. The situation was not exactly comfortable. When we touched down the Jordanian ambassador and the military attache were on hand to greet us. All the arrangements were excellent. We had the passengers get on board fairly quickly so we could take off as soon as possible, given the potential risks in view of the current state of affairs in Yemen. [passage omitted] [Samawi] Your Majesty the King: Yemen's crisis has always been on your mind and you have always sought to keep the situation from becoming as it is now. As you receive returning Jordanians, would you care to comment on the developments in Yemen? [Husayn] I cannot express how saddened and pained I am over what is happening, measured against our expectations for the reconciliation that we sought to bring about. We call on God to spare Yemen further devastation and safeguard the country's national unity. I hope Yemen's current troubles will give way to a happier era for the country and all our brothers there. [Samawi] Is there anything that Jordan can do at this point in time to arrest the deterioration in sisterly Yemen? [Husayn] We will do what we can. A medical team travelled to Yemen with the planes that flew there to pick up Jordanians from Sanaa. We hope this unnecessary bloodletting will stop. [Samawi] Thank you, Your Majesty. [Husayn] Thank you. [Samawi] A number of wounded from the two opposing sides are now receiving medical treatment at the al-Husayn Medical Center in Amman. [end recording]
