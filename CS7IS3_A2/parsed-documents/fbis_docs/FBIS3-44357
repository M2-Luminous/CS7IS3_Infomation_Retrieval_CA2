The People's Bank of China, the central bank, published at seven this morning [2300 GMT] what it calls the market rate which sets one dollar against 8.7 renminbi yuan. This is yesterday's average price of U.S. dollar at the government monitored foreign exchange swap markets in major Chinese cities. The exchange rates between Chinese yuan and the other major foreign currencies have also been readjusted accordingly. Yesterday's official rate was 1: 5.8 between U.S. dollar and yuan. An official with the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) said that the rate is set with reference to the swap market rate. "Before the inter-bank foreign exchange market is established and goes into operation, the swap market rate will be an important and reliable reference since it basically reflects the market demand and supply and has been accepted by the general public," the SAEC official said. He noted that the rate also conforms to the latest changes of main hard currencies in international financial markets. "It's relieving to see that the unified exchange rate of the first day is that close to the swap market rate," said Tao Liming, a financial expert contacted by XINHUA through telephone. "It will boost the confidence of the public in the yuan and can be accepted by enterprises since most of them have long been running business at the swap market rate," said Tao who heads the International Finance Research Institute under the Bank of China.
