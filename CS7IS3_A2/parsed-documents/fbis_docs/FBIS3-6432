Baysa] [Excerpt] A foreign-based Filipino communist leader, in a letter intercepted by military authorities, said recently that Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman, is losing his grip on Philippine and Western Europe cadres. Lucas Fernandez, believed to be the alias of revisionist bloc leader Nathan Quimpo, wrote in a letter from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, that Sison is no longer enjoying the support of communist members abroad. In a press statement, the Armed Forces of the Philippines Civil Relations Service (CRS) quoted Quimpo as saying "almost all solidarity groups in Western Europe, North America, and the Asia- Pacific Region have started distancing themselves from Sison." Quimpo said the Sison-led Stalinist bloc has lost support from revolutionary, progressive, and centrist political parties, including the Eurocommunities, left socialists, "greens," social democrats, and labor parties. As gleaned in his letter, he said over 60 percent of CPP members in Western Europe and 70 percent of National Democratic Front (NDF) members in the Philippines oppose Sison's leadership. He accused Sison of steering the underground movement towards a more extremist and violent strategy against the government. "Sison is slowly transforming the CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front] into another Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)," Quimpo said.
