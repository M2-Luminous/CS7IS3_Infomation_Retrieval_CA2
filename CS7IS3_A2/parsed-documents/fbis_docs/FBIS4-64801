The Finnish Broadcasting Company's Finnish-language television news program on Friday [22 April] announced results of the most recent opinion poll on the issue. Of those queried, 31 percent oppose joining and 21 percent have not yet made up their minds. The margin of error in the poll is approximately 3 percent. The differences are not great, compared with the corresponding poll taken a month ago. The EU supporters have now increased by 2 percentage points, and opponents by four points. The group of those unsure whether they are for or against has clearly gotten smaller. This is above all interpreted as resulting from the way the poll was conducted. Questions in the second poll were asked through personal interviews, and not by telephone [as was the earlier one]. The poll was conducted by Taloustutkimus. A total of 921 Finnish voters were interviewed in their homes in early April. Among other questions presented them was: "Should Finland join the EU in accordance with the results achieved in the accession talks?" In addition, the interview subject was invited to explain his stand. Most replied that Finland cannot afford to stay outside, that the country would otherwise simply not be able to manage. It is also assumed that EU membership will improve exports and reduce prices. Opponents to the EU based their arguments on the belief that Finland would lose its independence and its right to decide its own interests if the country joined the EU. In addition, many are afraid Finland will be forced to pay large sums. General uncertainty was also mentioned as a reason.
