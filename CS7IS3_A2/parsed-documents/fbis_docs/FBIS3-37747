According to him, the Karabakh units holding most of the heights there did not find it hard 5 days ago to surround and neutralize a large Azeri army group. "The adventure in Kelbajar, which pursued largely political goals, turned for Azerbaijan into pointless losses; over 500 troops got frozen to death high in the mountains," Ivanian said. In the meantime the Karabakh army's arsenal was supplemented with trophies: 12 armored vehicles, including five tanks, two 152-mm self-propelled artillery installations, a jet rocket system, heavy guns and other military equipment. According to the general, about 20 Azeri servicemen surrendered. The Karabakh side lost 3 men; 15 troops were wounded. The general believes that, having failed to score genuine success in its two-months-long offensive, Azerbaijan ought to get convinced once again that "to use the language of force toward the people of Karabakh" is useless.
