Preliminary 1993 figures by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution indicate that there were some 1,100 acts of violence by left-wing extremists, while the other side accounted for 1,820 such incidents (in 1992: 980 and 2,638, involving one and 17 deaths, respectively). Included among the acts of violence are murder and homicide, bomb and arson attacks, breach of the public peace, personal injury, traffic blockages, and severe damage to property. Christian Democratic Union Bundestag Deputy Heinrich Lummer said that irrespective of the "convergence of extremism" reporting on leftist violence is neglected in most media: "All forms of extremist violence must be stigmatized." Left-wing extremism, the former Berlin senator for the interior said, is "overshadowed insofar as national exposure is concerned."
