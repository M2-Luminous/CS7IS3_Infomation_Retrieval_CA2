In all the re-created Cossack troop districts -- the Don, Astrakhan, Volga, Kuban, Terek, Orenburg, Amur, Ussuri, Yenisey, Irkutsk, Transbaykal, and Siberian districts -- lists of young boys who will serve in their own Cossack details, divisions, and battalions as well as protecting the border, have been handed over to the military commissariats. Clearly, following the 75-year-long enforced disbandment of the Cossacks, it is hard to organize new combat-ready units. There are also a lot of other problems which Vladimir Naumov, field ataman of the Council of Russian Cossacks, spoke about in an interview which he gave in Volgograd. "All our proposals concerning the organization of the first Cossack draft were accepted by the military department, approved by Minister Grachev, and submitted to the State Duma Committee for Matters of Defense and Security. Unfortunately, I cannot say when this question will be examined by deputies. Time is passing, the spring sowing is ending, but the hearing of the question keeps being delayed. "Taking the Cossacks' wishes into account, the military department approved the uniform which the Cossacks had in 1914 -- khaki soldier's shirts and pants made of blue cloth with stripes in the traditional colors for Cossack troops -- crimson for the Don, yellow for Astrakhan, and so on. Sleeve chevrons will also be introduced. "The Ministry of Defense is examining whether commanders of Cossack details and battalions should be Cossack officers from the same areas as the new recruits. For this reason, the recruitment of students from Cossack regions to the military schools is being announced. Naturally, `The History of the Cossacks' must be an indispensable educational discipline in these training institutes. "If they are really going to be organized, why should the Cossack regiments not be given back the names which they bore before the Revolution? For instance, the Don regiment named for Ataman Platov, or the Yermak Timofeyevich regiment. This would discipline the young Cossacks, cement their ranks, and make them honor the traditions of their ancestors. The fact that information to the effect that a draftee is a Cossack can be put into his military registration documents at his own wish is a source of joy to the Cossack. In that case, the entry `Cossack' will be made in the `Special Notes' section." Aleksandr Kotenkov, Russian Federation deputy minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy, comments on the report by our Volgograd correspondent: "It is true that the spring draft for the Army in Russia's Cossack regions has been announced, but, within the framework of existing legislation, it has been on general principles. There is no specific Cossack form of recruitment for military units or large units, as the law on Cossack military service has not been adopted yet. "The elaboration of a draft law to this effect is currently being concluded in our ministry, and it will be submitted to the Russian Government for agreement and conclusion next week. "With the adoption of this document, the formation of Cossack units will really develop. The Cossack servicemen's full dress will be traditional, depending on which Cossack group they belong to, and the everyday uniform will remain the same as it is in the entire Russian Army. This is natural. It is hard to imagine a member of the tank crew, for example, in a Circassian coat and Astrakhan hat and with a dagger. "It is no secret that today the Army draft is proceeding with difficulty for a whole number of reasons. But, according to our calculations, with the introduction of the Cossack model for forming military units, the number of draftees in Cossack regions will increase at least tenfold."
