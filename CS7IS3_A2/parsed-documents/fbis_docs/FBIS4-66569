"The policies adopted by Chadli sowed the seeds of social instability, political confusion, and economic crisis," writes Boudersa on page 25 of the book. The author divides the book into four main parts: general political principles; the crisis and solutions; the providential man; and impediments to a solution. There is also a concluding section with bibliographical references. Citing Ibn Khaldoan, the author notes that: "war is natural to man: Any nation, any race can serve as an example." And examples are cited: the FLN [National Liberation Front] versus French colonialism, Fidel Castro, diverse Third World leaders combating underdevelopment, as well as the "wars" of Western democracies against unemployment and inflation. In Algeria, two statesmen opted for policies based on the "war footing" principle. The first, says the author, was Boumediene. "The nation, he said, had enemies to vanquish: neocolonialism, underdevelopment, illiteracy, regional imbalance, poverty, misery, and injustices." The second "warrior" who imposed himself on the national political scene was Mohamed Boudiaf. The latter openly declared war on the Algerian politico-financial "mafia," the author notes. He quickly won legitimacy once he opted--intuitively, and quite sincerely--for a policy based on the "war" that was Boumediene's legacy. Indeed, his "battle" was espoused by the entire nation, by society as a whole. Maamar Boudersa says that politicians and statesmen who ignore this principle and fail to apply it lead their country down the path to instability, turbulence, even civil war. Chadli, with his policies aimed at preserving power by methods opposite to Boumediene's, sowed the seeds of political and economic instability. Thus Chadli, under the slogan "for a better life," gave economic preference to consumption, to the detriment of investment. The author notes that this policy, presupposing a limited economic role for the state, was inspired more by Keynes than by Marx or Lenin, as others have tried to argue. The author organizes the second part of Faillite des politicards algeriens around studies of Algeria's heads of government since the unrest of October 1988. Hamrouche and Ghozali, he says, followed the same policies as their predecessors. The predecessors: in other words, those who contributed, each in his own way, to the decade of the 1980's--which as everyone knows ended up destabilizing state, society, and the national economy. Abdelhamid Brahimi was not the only one to blame, he says. The team included Chadli, Taleb Ahmed Brahimi, Larbi Belkheir, Belkaid Mehri, Messaadia, Abdelghani, Belakhdar... In all this criticism, our scholar spares Abdessalem, who he says tried to solve the underlying problems, rather than just put out brush fires like Hamrouche and Ghozali. However, we know that even Abdessalem ultimately failed. During his tenure, Algeria fell into a major economic recession, aggravated by a policy that made war against practically everyone but failed to score any victories. Boudiafism! The author writes that the assassination of President Boudiaf has benefited those who opposed him and who after his death have sought to bask in his political legacy. Boudersa recalls in this connection what Lenin wrote about false Marxists: "Throughout history, after the death of revolutionary leaders who were popular with the oppressed classes, the enemies of those leaders have tried to exploit the reputation of the deceased to dupe the oppressed." Islamism versus nationalism. The author writes that in order to realize its political objectives, the outgrowths of a defeatist policy, and destroy the system based on Boumediene's "war" legacy, a secret weapon was chosen--a weapon that according to the author was eminently serviceable, of local fabrication, and historically durable: realization of the "old and defunct reformist-colonial project introduced as an alternative to the national-liberation vision." In the same vein, the author notes that the national charter of 1976 was "enriched" in this direction, when the national commission chaired by Taleb Ahmed called for establishment of an Islamic state as elaborated by Mohamed Harbi's in L'Algerie et son destin [Algeria and its Destiny]. Even Hamrouche discussed it in his talks at Matignon (Paris) with Michel Rocard, as reported by the press: "The rise of Islam, amplified by the French media, he said, disturbed and dumbfounded many people, he said. But the government was never upset or fearful. His analysis was correct. Events showed we were right." "The influence of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] quickly ran up against its limits... Now...I have a real problem: I would not like to see the FIS disappear. It is necessary for this abscess of fixation, this socially reactionary formation, to remain." As for impediments to resolution of the crisis, Boudersa says that while corruption may have been the common denominator of the political coalitions responsible for the country's ruin, the only possible way to rebuild it is through a coalition against corruption. Boudersa bases this conclusion on the principle of war. Boumediene made war on unemployment, the enemies of the nation, underdevelopment, regional imbalance, illiteracy, and poverty. Boudiaf made war on corruption, Chadli made war on Algeria. An impassioned book, of burning relevance to today's problems, and a very fast read.
