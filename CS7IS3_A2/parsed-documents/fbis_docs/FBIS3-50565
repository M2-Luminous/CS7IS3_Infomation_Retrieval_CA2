The opposition is asking that these events not to be used as a pretext for unleashing a witch hunt or persecution campaign or for prolonging political uncertainty. The political parties agree that the armed uprising in some Chiapas municipalities is a desperate reaction to a situation of severe dissatisfaction by the Indian communities, which have subjected to discrimination, poverty, and plunder for several decades. PRI, PAN, and PRD leaders made and urgent call to the government not to attempt a military solution for what is an economic and social conflict. Rene Bejarano, PRD president in Mexico City, said that a massacre in Chiapas must be avoided at all costs and that the events must not be used to initiate a witch hunt or persecution campaign or to create more political uncertainty. [Begin Bejarano recording] Because in-depth political reforms were postponed for the sake of alleged economic reforms, the chain broke at its weakest link. In that respect, to carry out a military incursion without seeking a negotiated solution would only cause a massacre.

The PAN leader demanded a decisive position from the government to prevent the problem from spreading and to deter other political forces from manipulating the incidents for their own benefit as social peace is at risk. [Begin Romero recording] This could lead to some type of election manipulation [words indistinct] at this time. On the other hand, the concerns expressed are understandable, but it would be very serious for us to fall into sensationalism. I believe this situation will be controlled. [Interior Secretary] Mr. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido must know quite well what is happening since he was Chiapas governor at one time. I believe he is still Chiapas governor on special leave. [end recording] PRI Leader Demetrio Sodi criticized the fact that reports disclosed last May related to the presence of guerrilla groups in Chiapas had been disregarded. Sodi indicated that instead of assigning blame, it is necessary to find out what really took place and why the conflict reached such dimensions. [Begin Sodi recording] ... blame someone, we would first have to find out what really happened. In other words, if we recall that last May several newspaper reports and interviews indicated that a guerrilla movement was rising in the region. Our contacts with social groups revealed that there were groups obtaining weapons and preparing a spectacular political blow such as what took place yesterday. [end recording]
