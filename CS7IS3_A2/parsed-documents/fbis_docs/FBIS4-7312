The offices, in Hiroshima Prefecture in western Japan, were checked to see if they were operating a cartel over private construction projects there, the sources said. The four makers -- Sanwa Shutter Corp., Bunka Shutter Co., Suzuki Shutter Mfg Co. and Toyo Shutter Co. -- are suspected of conducting prearranged bidding and making secret price arrangements for construction projects in the prefecture for the past several years. The FTC suspects the four makers of violating the antimonopoly law. It is also investigating branches of the four firms in other regions over suspected similar illegal activities, the sources said. The head of the general affairs department of Toyo Shutter said the FTC made an inspection of its Hiroshima branch in January or February this year, but denied it was involved in forming cartels. The four companies account for about 80 percent of the total sales of shutters in Japan, industry sources said. Sanwa, Bunka and Suzuki are based in Tokyo and Toyo is based in Osaka.
