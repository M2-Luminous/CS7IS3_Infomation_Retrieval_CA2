FR940506-2-00142 FR940506-2-00079 2. In the future, Bando may make loans directly and may purchase loans from the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, and may therefore have more than 10% of its assets on a consolidated basis invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries. Accordingly, applicants request that condition 6 of the Prior Order be modified to require separate financial statements of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis are invested in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries and securities similar to securities in which the subsidiaries invest. F. Standards for Exemption Under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) 1. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy of the Act. The relationship of Bando's shareholders to the activities to be carried out by the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be no different than if such activities were carried out by Bando because (a) the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bando; and (b) Bando has agreed that it will exercise its rights as the shareholder of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries on matters required by the Act to be approved by shareholders only as directed by Bando's shareholders. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested exemptions meet the section 6(c) standards. 2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief from section 17(a) meets these standards. Applicants' Conditions Applicants state that as a condition to the granting of the exemptive relief requested, each of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will comply with the following conditions: 1. Bando will at all times own and hold beneficially and of record all of the outstanding voting capital stock of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries. 2. The SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will have the same fundamental policies of Bando, as set forth in Bando's registration statement; the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the Act, except in each case as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the Act, except in each case as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando. 3. No person shall serve or act as investment adviser to the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries under circumstances subject to section 15 of the Act, unless the directors and shareholders of Bando shall have taken the action with respect thereto also required to be taken by the directors and shareholders of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, as the case may be. 4. No person shall serve as a director of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries who shall not have been elected as a director of Bando at its most recent annual meeting, as contemplated by section 16(a) of the Act and subject to the provision thereof relating to the filling of vacancies, provided that the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary may have two directors who are not directors of Bando as long as a majority of its board of directors consists of directors who are also directors of Bando. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the board of directors of the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will be elected by Bando as the sole shareholder of both corporations, and such board will be composed of the same persons that serve as directors of Bando and (b) the board of directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be elected by Bando as the sole shareholder of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and such board will be composed of the same persons that serve as directors of Bando except to the extent noted above.
