FR940721-1-00016 FR940721-1-00009 A. Emissions Inventory The inventory was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area ozone SIP for the Detroit/Ann Arbor area in Michigan. A detailed analysis of Michigan's 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's technical support document (TSD), dated January 27, 1994 from Jeanette Marrero to the Docket, entitled ``TSD for Proposed Revision to Michigan's Ozone SIP for the 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory for Areas Designated Nonattainment for Ozone'' (Emission Inventory TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above. I. Background Under the Act, States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing to NAAQS nonattainment, to track these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and move areas towards attainment. The Act requires ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe, and extreme to submit a plan within 3 years of 1990 to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 15 percent within 6 years after 1990. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable towards the 15 percent. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary inventory from which the periodic inventory, the reasonable further progress (RFP) projection inventory, and the modeling inventory are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purpose can be found in the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIP,'' USEPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991. The base year inventory may also serve as part of statewide inventories for purposes of regional modeling in transport areas. The base year inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as moderate and above outside transport regions. The air quality planning requirements for marginal to extreme ozone nonattainment areas are set out in section 182(a)&hyph;(e) of title I of the Act. Further, the USEPA has issued a General Preamble describing USEPA's preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including requirements for the preparation of the 1990 base year inventory (57 FR 13502, April 16, 1992 and 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992). Because USEPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the Michigan ozone base year emissions inventory, USEPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, USEPA will consider any comments submitted within the comment period before taking final action on this proposal. Those States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal to extreme are required under section 182(a)(1) of the Act to submit a final, comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone season, weekday emissions from all sources within 2 years of enactment (November 15, 1992). This inventory is for calendar year 1990 and is denoted as the base year inventory. It includes both anthropogenic and biogenic sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NO X ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The inventory is to address actual VOC, NO X , and CO emissions for the area during peak ozone season, which is generally comprised of the summer months. All stationary point and area sources, as well as highway mobile sources within the nonattainment area, are to be included in the compilation. Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992). The inventory was submitted by the State to USEPA on January 5, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The State of Michigan held a public hearing on August 2, 1993 to receive public comment on the 1990 base year emission inventory for Detroit/Ann Arbor nonattainment areas and certified the hearing to the USEPA in a submittal on November 15, 1993. Supplemental information was also submitted on November 29, 1993. The emission inventory was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51, appendix V, as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete on March 16, 1993 with the exception of evidence of a public hearing. After receiving evidence of the public hearing, a letter from David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation Division, USEPA, Region 5, dated January 7, 1994 was sent to the Governor's designee indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. II. Review of State Submittal When reviewing the final inventory, USEPA used the Level I, II, and III, ozone nonattainment inventory quality review checklists provided by the OAQPS to determine the acceptance and approvability of the final emission inventory. Level I is essentially the initial level of broad review that USEPA performs in order to determine if the inventory preparation guidance requirements found in the report ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIPs'' (EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;011) have been met. The Level II review addresses completeness, procedures and consistency for each of the four general source types in the inventory: stationary point and area sources, highway mobile sources, and non-highway mobile sources. The data quality is also evaluated. Detailed Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following document: ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,'' USEPA, OAQPS, Research Triangle Park, NC, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum from J. David Mobley, Chief, Emissions Inventory Branch, and G. T. Helms, Chief, Ozone/CO Programs Branch, to Air Branch Chiefs, Region I&hyph;X, ``1990 Ozone/CO SIP Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,'' October 7, 1992 and revised in a memorandum from John Seitz, Director, OAQPS, to Regional Air Division Directors, Region I&hyph;X, ``Emission Inventory Issues,'' June 24, 1993. The Level III review process is outlined here and consists of 10 points that the inventory must include. For a base year emission inventory to be acceptable it must pass all of the following acceptance criteria: 1. An approved Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) was provided and the Quality Assurance program contained in the IPP was performed and its implementation documented. 2. Adequate documentation was provided that enabled the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures and the data sources used to develop the inventory. 3. The point source inventory must be complete. 4. Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current USEPA guidance. 5. The area source inventory must be complete. 6. The area source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current USEPA guidance. 7. Biogenic emissions must have been prepared according to current USEPA guidance or another approved technique. 8. The method (e.g., Highway Performance Monitoring System or a network transportation planning model) used to develop Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) 1 estimates must follow USEPA guidance, which is detailed in the document, ``Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, volume IV: Mobile Sources,'' USEPA, Office of Mobile Sources and OAQPS, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, December 1992. The VMT development methods were adequately described and documented in the inventory report. 1 VMT is the number of miles traveled by vehicles of various types, preferably for each link of the highway system. The VMT is estimated using various models and/or methods.
