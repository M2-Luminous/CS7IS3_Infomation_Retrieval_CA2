Potapchenko, director of the SET limited-liability partnership: "Computerized Information Data Processing at the Service of Transport"] [Text] In order to unite the railroads' efforts to accelerate informatization and develop the infrastructure for computerized information data processing and the area of data processing services, the Association for Practical Cooperation in the Area of Establishing, Developing and Operating Computerized Systems in Rail Transport (the SET Association) was established at the beginning of 1991. Its tasks included the practical development of long-range standard planning decisions for computerized systems, the improvement of servicing systems for computers and peripheral equipment, the exchange of experience in incorporating standard developments, and the study of the world's computer market. With the assistance of the SET Association, the railroads received an opportunity to conduct an antimonopoly policy with respect to the producers of computer equipment and the developers of computerized systems. This is being achieved by analyzing the competing proposals of computer suppliers and organizations of experts and alternative research and development of computerized system hardware. In 1992, the SET Association was converted into a limited-liability partnership called "Contemporary Electronic Technology in Transport" (TOO SET). A total of 24 railroads (eight of them railroads in the countries of the near abroad), three scientific and engineering centers, and three enterprises servicing computer equipment were among the founders. A general meeting of representatives from the founding railroads elected a Council of Empowered Delegates to manage TOO SET activities. Within the TOO SET framework, this body implements technical policy in the area of establishing, incorporating, and expanding computerized systems in rail transport, which the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways has developed. TOO SET functions as an independent juridical person with complete self-financing. The profit received from providing services (basically from shipments of computer equipment) is directed toward the fund for expanding production and the special funds formed for designing computer equipment for rail transport. There have been definite successes in this, which must be mentioned. The development of a technology for transmitting operational information to the computer network of a line enterprise having remote installations, yards, stations, loading and unloading frontages, sections, and approach lines with the help of portable information recorders occupies the central place. The solution of this technical problem will permit one to obtain not only the complete work technology of the stations and sections, but also the planned effectiveness from incorporating electronic document turnover. TOO SET is developing a portable information recorder based on using the experience of the VNIIZhT [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transport] and the Scientific Research Institute for Railroad Automation. The need to supplement train and freight information in non-regular situations arises even with the availability of automatic information output. In addition, global automation for reading information is not always economically advisable and requires that it be combined with less expensive technical solutions at installations with negligible work volumes. The use of a portable information recorder will permit one to monitor the authenticity of information directly when performing freight and commercial operations and to correct a mistake on the spot when necessary. The technical specifications for the portable information recorder provide for connecting the device to the Transport series radio station and also to intra-station wire communications when possible. Standardization of design, which allows for the possibility of an electric power source, both from the radio station, using a convenience outlet, and from an independent power source, using a plug-in unit, is provided for. The portable recorder can be used by the freight car data collector and inspector during the commercial inspection of the rail cars at the checking point, container site, and permanent way division sections. For this, the personal computer for the radio channel or wire communications channel automatically installs the program for processing the information units that is appropriate for this operation in the information recorder when the user of the recorder plugs into the "type of information." A sufficiently voluminous indication area permits the portable information recorder operator to carry on a dialogue with the PEVM [stationary computer], receiving management and reference information from it in order to eliminate detected errors. The design of the portable information recorder permits one to use it under difficult climatic conditions having a large range of unfavorable temperatures and humidity; the luminescent display insures operations when there is insufficient illumination. At the present time, work on the design plans and specifications for the portable information recorder is being done. Trial operation and introduction are planned during the first quarter of 1994 at installations of the Gorkiy Railroad. Series production will begin in 1994. The subject second in importance within TOO SET plans is the development of a standard multi-task and multi-terminal computer complex based on the PEVM for the line enterprises of the railroads. This development will permit one to reduce the resulting cost of one automated worker position (ARM) by a factor of 2.5 to three, in comparison with the version that embodies a computer for individual use at each work position. This complex should be responsive to the peculiarities of the technical processes in processing train and freight information at stations, depots, and other line enterprises, and those involved in bookkeeping and accounting at the machine calculating stations of the railroad divisions. These peculiarities are characterized by standardized document forms, a regulated sequence of events and operations, and the presence of a common data base concentrated in one computer. Technical solutions that permit one to combine imported personal computers with domestic display stations and telecommunications controlled by base software that is a domestic product are being found and tested. In order to add the multi-task and multi-terminal computer complexes to the unified network for transmitting ASUZhT [automated control system for rail transport] data, the base software includes a network component that permits the user to describe the protocols of the local and global networks, within which it is planned to use these complexes. The widespread use of these computer complexes in rail transport will not only permit capital investments in the development of automated systems to be used more fully. They are completely necessary to re-equip systems preparing data for the information and computer centers of the railroads, the machine calculating stations of the railroad divisions, and the accounting groups in the locomotive depots, locomotive and railcar repair plants, material warehouses, and worker supply departments. With the massive shift to personal computers, industry has stopped producing such data preparation systems as the SPD-9000 and YeS-9003 (9005), which are used a great deal on railroad networks but which are outdated. When beginning the development of standard multi-task and multi-terminal computer complexes, TOO SET counted primarily on the machine calculating stations of the railroad divisions; however, during the work, in which specialists from the Kuybyshev and Gorkiy IVTs [information and computer centers] and the MIIT [Moscow Railroad Transport Engineers Institute] actively participated, standardized solutions, which permit the computer complexes to be adapted to a whole number of technological processes involving the massive preparation of information even in other enterprises, are being found. At the present time, test models of multi-task and multi-terminal computer complexes have been delivered to the Kemerovo, Kuybyshev, Krasnoyarsk, and West Siberian Railroads. At the initiative of TOO SET, the development of a standard system for automating the processes for processing information at freight stations is being carried out. The project is being worked on using share financing by TOO SET and the railroads. The experience from incorporating similar systems at freight stations and container sites is being considered during the development of the project. The basic difference from previously completed work is the completeness of the technological processes and the complete inclusion of all categories of workers participating in the planning of freight operations, the drawing up of transportation documents, and the carrying out of station accounting. In addition, the system provides an opportunity through automation to combine professions, expand service zones, and minimize the volume of information processed at work positions. The system provides a "friendly" interface for users with the computer and achieves the maximum clarity of the current situation at the stations. The system is based on personal computers operating in the network multi-terminal mode. This makes for a low equipment cost in comparison with similar systems and is oriented toward stations with a small rail car turnover (up to 500-600 rail cars a day). TOO SET developments with respect to the portable information recorder and the multi-terminal computer complexes will find application in the most concentrated form. At the present time, the technical specifications for a standard automated system and a detail design are being developed. Introduction will take place during 1994 on the Gorkiy Railroad. Within the TOO SET framework, a commercial computer network for rail transport (SKIT) has been established, is functioning and is being expanded. It provides for compiling and allocating information on the supply and demand for deliveries of production items, consumer goods, and agricultural products, and for supplying various types of services and other types of commercial activity to regional centers and network subscriber points. Since the SKIT computer network is mated with the RIKO [expansion not given] network, it has available on a daily cycle more than 5,000 urgent requests from more than 60 regions of the former USSR. The SKIT computer network has nine regional centers, which are based on the information and computer centers of the railroads. This permits one to give supply-demand information to the material and technical supply and worker supply agencies of the railroads, and creates favorable conditions for their rooting in the market through the establishment of their own subscriber points in the regional stock exchanges, trading houses, brokerage offices, and large enterprises in the region. In addition, the establishment of regional SKIT centers on the railroads provides an opportunity to obtain income from subsidiary and auxiliary activity, consisting of information servicing of the newly established non-transport user subscriber points. For these purposes, contracts can be concluded with enterprises in the regions to establish and operate subscriber points in the SKIT network and to rent underutilized computer resources and communications channels. The next general meeting of TOO SET founders will define ways to expand further. Relying on cooperation with the railroads and scientific and engineering centers with respect to the development and production of computer equipment and coordinating plans for the development and incorporation of automated systems with the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways, TOO SET, besides standard work in the area of transport computerized information data processing, delivers computer equipment and accessory and operating materials at the requests of the railroads. In 1993, the volume of such equipment deliveries to the railroads exceeded R200 million for a products list of more than 40 positions. When organizing deliveries, the capabilities of the regions are considered, and special research is conducted to evaluate the reliability level of the equipment being acquired, prices and the conditions for warranty servicing. The results of the cooperation with the suppliers and producers of computer equipment for actual transport needs are discussed during seminars of specialists from the information and computer centers of the railroads. Information bulletins, which help the railroads orient themselves in the computer market, are published on a regular basis. During the three years of the existence first of the association, and then of TOO SET, dependable partner contacts have been established with the suppliers and producers of computer equipment, and work has begun on establishing its own servicing service for the maintenance of computers. At the same time, it has failed to use all existing capabilities for the fuller satisfaction of the railroads' requirements for computer equipment and the expansion of computerized systems. Several reasons are not permitting this work to be conducted more actively. First, we have still not managed to establish special funds in the amount required to finance standard works. Second, from the time of the establishment of the SET Association, the charter fund was not indexed, and it acquired a purely symbolic value with inflation. Third, TOO SET does not have its own material and technical base--production premises, equipment and transport for expanding its own production. That is why the increase in work volumes takes place dependent on financial capabilities. According to its status, TOO SET is related to enterprises engaged in commercial activity. At the same time, the TOO SET general meeting of founders and the Council of Empowered Delegates have established a number of limitations on economic activity that are used in state enterprises. The production expansion fund and the special funds are expended for standard designing of computerized systems for the railroads' line enterprises. Using its own assets, TOO SET performs expert research, conducts conferences and network seminars, and publishes information bulletins. The mechanism for controlling TOO SET activity, the cooperation in carrying out the programs on an interested and mutually beneficial basis, and the established mutual settlement procedure put TOO SET completely under the control of the railroads. In turn, this has allowed for the avoidance of instances of failure to meet obligations for a long time. This has determined the railroads' trust in the measures being conducted within the TOO SET framework. TOO SET is forming special-purpose funds for carrying out NIOKR [research and scientific work] from its own production expansion fund and the payments of the railroads participating in the share financing on matters that are of interest for this or that participant. The scientific item that is created through this fund becomes the property of the participants in the share financing. The sale of the produced scientific item to the railroad network is done at contract prices that support the planned level of profitability, including the replacement of the payments of the participants in the share financing together with a percentage of the profit from the sale of the scientific item in proportion to the percentage contributed to the special-purpose fund. Under these conditions, an item that enjoys demand on the railroads "survives" and quickly pays for itself. It becomes economically beneficial for the railroads to finance such research and development work. Besides the NIOKR plan, however, the railroads' capabilities to finance a TOO SET subject are extremely limited, and this slows the rate of research and development. If the railroads and the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways, as well as the management boards of the railroads in the other countries of the former USSR, supported TOO SET initiatives more actively, everyone would win from this. Having extremely limited financing capabilities, TOO SET can select only a subject that does not require the investment of large assets and has an easily realizable technical solution and also evident effectiveness in its use. At the present time, TOO SET is mobilizing all its existing resources so that work to incorporate new equipment on the railroads will become the basis for its activity during 1994. What is this intention built upon? First, on the correctness of the fundamental design selection, confirmed by world and domestic experience. Second, the confidence that transport science should not be locked into its own research and development. TOO SET is involving new creative collectives, which previously did not have any experience in participating in the solving of transport problems, in its subject matter. Here there are costs connected with the need to adapt to rail transport's specific conditions. However, the novelty of a design solution, which is not connected with a certain stereotype of thinking, is worth this. Third, on the conviction that a mechanism for financing NIOKR on a repayable basis will find application with time and that the principle of cost recovery will also be expanded to that portion of the NIOKR subject plan controlled by the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways which concerns research work undertaken at the initiative of the railroads. Fourth, on the hope that the urgency of the selected subject will be evaluated at its true worth and attract the attention and support of the railroads. A similar situation is taking shape with the financing of capital investments in the development of computerized systems. Of the assets that have been allocated by railroads to the acquisition of computer equipment, from 5 to 40 percent are being assimilated within the TOO SET framework. The presence of numerous sources for the receipt of computer equipment and, in a number of cases, insufficiently qualified decisions in selecting suppliers, accessories, and delivery conditions are leading to a situation where equipment that is manufactured according to different standards and using a different element base is arriving in the railroad system. This is hindering the operating process and causes complications when expanding computerized systems. In addition, this situation does not permit one to conclude long-term contracts that are beneficial in a commercial respect; opportunities for selecting among competitive proposals of producers and suppliers of computer equipment are not being used; and complications arise with the delivery and safe-keeping of the delivered computer equipment and with the conducting of reclamation work during the warranty period. TOO SET has definite experience in the area of delivering personal computers, peripheral and telecommunications equipment, and operating materials; however, it does not have the capability of using it fully, due to a shortage of working capital. It seems that this experience should be used more fully, especially when the struggle for large buyers is intensifying in the world's computer market. TOO SET can ensure beneficial delivery conditions--the more so since, when working with foreign firms, the delivery of computer equipment takes place according to contract prices, and TOO SET services are paid for in accordance with the delivery and at rates regulated by the Council of Empowered Delegates. One cannot fail to point out also the opportunities which TOO SET has for organizing deliveries of computers in accordance with bank credits. Today, the practice of partial prepayment has already been introduced in TOO SET. This was done considering actual conditions where the railroads cannot accumulate within a short time significant payment assets for the purchase of large batches of computers. Naturally, it is unprofitable for the supplying firms to import unpaid-for batches of computers at their own risk. However, it is necessary to fight for a big customer. If the goods arrive at the moment of final settlement, the firm takes steps to accelerate the delivery periods and toughens the sanctions addressed to the customer for the delay in payments. Under such conditions, the requirement for bank credit to purchase large batches of computers is reduced twofold. If one considers that the interest payment for short-term credit is compensated for by losses of working capital from inflation, the trade discount for consolidating batches of purchased computers makes the alternative of purchases for bank credit and partial prepayment profitable. With the availability of guarantors in the person of the railroads, the bank is prepared to offer TOO SET short-term credit. Besides organizing deliveries of imported computer equipment to the railroads, TOO SET carefully studies the state of affairs with new works and the putting of domestic computer equipment into production in Russia and the CIS. For this purpose, cooperation with the Elektronmash Association, which is one of the TOO SET founders, is organized. Work is being performed with a whole range of scientific centers to develop computer equipment and with manufacturing plants. The railroads of neighboring states in the near abroad--the Southwest, Lvov, Odessa, Latvian, Transcaucasian, Azerbaijan, Central Asian, and Tselina--are TOO SET founders. Their interest in participating in TOO SET measures is based upon a desire to use the standard designs for computerized systems that are being used on Russia's railroads. Within the framework of its activity, TOO SET has the capability of assisting them in this direction. Without having a clear branch program for automation, however, it does not seem possible to propose a form of interested participation in the work to them and provide them with the necessary recommendations. Existing programs contain the traditional subject matter, NIOKR amounts, and the periods for introducing them into the leading installations, and can be carried out only with clear financial support. This is difficult to do under present conditions. The attempt to formulate its own program within the TOO SET framework has not been crowned with success. It is evident that only the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways can assume this work, involving qualified scientific collectives in the development of automation programs. TOO SET would like for a link between the level of automation, the capital investments to achieve the given level of automation, and the effectiveness obtained to be established as a result of this research. Having such recommendations, the railroads would be able to invest more soundly in information science considering the peculiarities of operating work, the extent of the avenues' equipment, financial situation, and so on. A general meeting of TOO SET founders will sum up the work results for the first three years of activity. A third technical conference will also be held during the second half of the year. TOO SET would like the founders to firm up their plans for participation in TOO SET measures during the preparations for the conference and provide interesting recommendations for the subject plan based on their experiences. TOO SET also hopes that the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways and the management boards of the railroads in neighboring states, on their part, will suggest ways to expand cooperation in the area of rail transport information science.
