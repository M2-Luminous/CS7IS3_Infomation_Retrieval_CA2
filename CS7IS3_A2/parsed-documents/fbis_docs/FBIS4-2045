The meeting is chiefly aimed at implementing the spirit of the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress and discussing the issue of how to further enhance industrial production and economic work in various fields in line with the province's current progress in economic development and organizational reforms so as to intensively conduct reform among the provincial level organs, to promote rapid economic development, and to maintain social stability. Gao Yan, governor of the province, delivered an important speech at the meeting, in which he emphatically cited the following three parts: 1. We should clearly discern the situation, enhance our confidence, and do a good job in conducting industrial production and economic work in various fields. The province's economic operation in the January-February period somewhat achieved development based on the rapid growth of 1993. However, we should not neglect the existing problems. The situation in industrial production is serious and the problems cropping up in the circulation funds for production are prominent. The new situation prevailing after strictly controlling the gross credits and issuing some major and important measures for reform has further exposed the province's old problems such as the structural contradiction in economic development, the poor quality of enterprises, and the lack of competitive capability of products. Industrial production is a priority and is a difficult point in the province's economic work at present. The growth of industrial production was lower judging from the situation in February. What we have to do at present is not to fear the difficulties, not to complain, to enhance understanding, to unite as one in making progress, and to bring about a change as soon as possible to the low growth of industrial production. Efforts should be made to ensure the growth of industrial production in the first half of this year, which must surpass the figure of [words indistinct]. Thus, first, we should enhance the leadership over industrial production. In particular, the mayor of cities where industrial enterprises are concentrated in should focus his efforts on grasping industries. In conducting the reform of organs, the leading bodies of the provincial level departments in various fields should define the division of work, realistically have the department assume its own responsibility, have it study the new situation and resolve the new problems, and have it conduct its work in a creative way. Second, we should adopt every possible way and means to grasp funds. Various financial departments across the province should provide necessary fund guarantee for industrial and agricultural production development, reinforce business operations and sales, curtail overstock, and do a good job in grasping saving deposits. They should also strictly enforce the business mechanism and follow the targets of [words indistinct]. Third, we should vigorously encourage enterprises to increase their economic results. Efforts should be made to grasp the production of key agricultural items, key enterprises, and key [words indistinct]. A good job should be done in boosting the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. In particularly improving enterprises in various fields, we should [words indistinct]. By adopting the method of reforms, we should concentrate our efforts on organizing enterprises to earn more profits and [words indistinct]. The current emphasis of the rural work is to do a good job in making preparations for spring farming and to provide fertilizer and diesel for farming. While enhancing the active guidance over markets and optimizing the structure to stabilize grain production, we should vigorously develop a diversified economy so as to promote the rapid development of township enterprises. We should also firmly grasp the work in foreign economic relation and trade and the economic work in other fields and strive to make progress in this regard in the first half of the year. 2. We should do a good job in conducting reform among organs and implement the system of having personnel hold responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in reform. We should make organizational reform and economic work mutually promote each other. Efforts should be made to organize all cadres to study well the documents issued by the central authorities with regard to organizational reforms and their reform plan and to orient their ideology and understanding onto the central authorities' documents and onto the decisions made by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government. First, we should stress discipline at present. In particular, leading cadres in the leading bodies of departments whose personnel transfer during the organizational reform is larger should report themselves to their new posts within the given date and plunge into the new assignment as soon as possible. Second, a good job should be done in making new work connections among the changes of organizations and striving to complete the connections within a shortest period. Third, we should firmly grasp the formulation of plans for various departments to implement the three decisions. Fourth, we should enhance the ideological and political work; organize personnel affairs and establish departments to be well coordinated in reform; enhance the leadership over reform; and conduct careful work in reform. Along with the organizational reform, a good job should be done in implementing the system of having personnel hold responsibility for the attainment of key objectives in reform. The provincial people's government has defined the work target of [words indistinct] for this year. Various departments should further discern their tasks for the target, be responsible for their subordinate units to fulfill the target, and have the target be fulfilled at all levels. In line with the key work, the responsibility assumed by various departments for fulfilling the target should be enhanced. As for the matters that have been decided by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government, various departments must earnestly implement them and ensure them to be thoroughly carried out. In meeting the demands of reform and development, we should further improve our work style. We should study more, have few social dealings, grasp practice, do practical deeds, pay attention to quality, stress efficiency, take the whole situation into consideration, and abide by discipline. Through the reform we should promote the construction of governmental organs and enable various governmental departments to create a new balance between their work and efficiency. 3. We should safeguard social stability and create a fine environment for organizational reform and economic development. Social stability is a big event that has a vital bearing on the whole situation. It is difficult for us to smoothly carry out organizational reform and economic development without a stable political or social environment. We should do a good job in grasping the following four tasks to successfully safeguard social stability: First, we should correctly discern and deeply understand the essence of contradictions. By taking education as a main measure, we should actively relieve or resolve contradictions. Second, we should uphold the correct guiding orientation of public opinions, do things in line with an objective law, and enhance our confidence in overcoming difficulties. Third, we should uphold the classified management in line with the difference of departments. Fourth, we should realize long-term social stability by upholding or depending on reform and development. Only by earnestly implementing the spirit of the three plenums of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission can we carry forward the struggle against corruption deeply and protractedly and score new periodical results in it. During the meeting Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, also delivered a speech on the issue of implementing decisions. He urged various units to further unify their thinking and understanding, to strictly enforce the law and regulations on establishment, to accelerate the progress in implementing the three decisions, to intensively straighten out relations, and to clear up or consolidate the personnel who will be the successors of other posts or be transferred. During the meeting, Wei Minxue, vice governor the province, delivered a report on the province's current situation in industrial production, in which he made specific arrangements for organizing industrial production. Among those who were invited to the meeting were leading comrades from the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, the provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee, and from the departments concerned of the province's capital.
