Education workers in the country, he said, must work hard with higher morale, explore with daring, and be brave to do practical work so that educational reform and development can reach a higher level. After recalling China's educational development in 1993 in his work report, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: While the situation was generally satisfactory, we must realize that the country is still confronted with certain educational problems: There is insufficient coordination between the reform of the educational system on the one hand and economic reform, reform of science and technology management, and reform of the political system on the other; the shortage of educational budgets has intensified, the mechanisms governing educational investment cannot keep pace with needs in educational development and needs in various social quarters; teachers' pay remains low, and problems concerning delinquent salary payments for teachers have not yet been fully resolved; in some localities and schools, the ranks of teachers are unstable and the rates of school dropouts have increased; in some localities and schools of higher education, the conditions for educational operations cannot keep pace with the rapid increase of students, giving rise to new managerial problems; and there is also the problem concerning inadequate macroscopic regulation and control for educational reform. We must deal with these problems as quickly as possible through deepening educational reform. On the 1994 assignments, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: The nation's educational development for the time to come will focus on basic education, especially the "two basic projects" -- basic universalization of the nine-year compulsory educational system and the project of basically wiping out illiteracy among growups. We must firmly implement the nine-year compulsory educational system as the law requires. On the basis of the State Education Commission's principles and objectives that there should be regional planning, difference guidance for different projects, and plans for step-by- step implementation, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government's jurisdiction must also draw up specific nine-year compulsory educational development plans that can be implemented by all counties and townships step by step. Meanwhile, we must also study and draw up policies and measures for popularizing compulsory education for specific numbers of years in remote, impoverished regions. Schools of higher education must fully implement the general policy that "their sizes must be larger, their quality must be better, their structures must be more rational, and their efficiency must be noticeably higher." The enrollment and growth of schools of higher education must be appropriate. They should give priority to improving their quality, restructuring their organization, improving their efficiency, and improving their operating conditions. We should arouse the enthusiasm of schools operated by central departments and local authorities to set up schools through forming all types of partnership programs so that significant headway can be achieved this year in reforming the system governing educational operations by government departments and the system governing educational investment. Provincial, regional, and municipal authorities should be given greater power gradually to make overall planning for the development of higher education in areas under their jurisdiction. Schools of higher education, and specialized secondary vocational training schools must energetically expedite the process of reforming their systems governing enrollment, collection of fees, and graduates' job assignment. Priority should be given to replacing the system whereby the state is responsible for students' tuitions and post-graduate assignment with a system whereby the students have to pay their own tuitions and have to find jobs themselves; and to improving the systems governing scholarships, student loans, and work-study programs. Zhu Kaixuan said: For vocational education, we must encourage all trades and professions to work with people in all social quarters to set up schools through forming partnerships; and enterprises, in particular, must fulfill their obligations in this regard. We must have stronger teacher-training projects and we must improve the system for hiring teachers on the basis of their performance. We should encourage the use of the dual credentials system [shuang zheng zhi 7175 6086 0455] and improve all services facilitating the development of vocational education. We should assign some major vocational training colleges to set up professional training classes on an experimental basis to promote reform and construction of professional universities. We should actively develop all kinds of vocational education for students that graduate from junior and senior middle schools. Meanwhile, we should continue to designate certain counties to experiment with educational reform and designate certain townships to demonstrate the "prairie fire program;" and then we should pay attention to promoting their experiences in other areas to promote "unified planning among three forms of education" [san jiao tong chou 0005 2403 4827 4693] and integration of agricultural production, scientific research, and education. We should also continue to make sure that cities and enterprises designated to carry out experimental comprehensive educational reform will accomplish their assignments. For adult education, we should continue to give priority to on-the-job training and follow-up education and encourage all trades and establishments to set up and improve their on-the-job training programs, certification programs, qualification test and evaluation programs, and follow-up training programs. Townships, towns, and villages must properly operate their literacy and technical schools offering technical training. They should implement the "green certificate" system to intensify the training for workers of township and town enterprises. Radio, television, correspondence, and other means should be used to provide follow-up post-high school education for people in society, especially those in medium and small cities and remote areas. Speaking on ensuring educational investment and raising teachers' pay, Zhu Kaixuan said: This year, the state has allotted a noticeably higher budget for educational institutions whose operations fall under the national budget. We should set up and gradually increase the special funds for central, provincial, county, and township governments for supporting compulsory education. Financial and taxation authorities should come up with, as quickly as possible, the proportion of educational fees to be collected in cities and rural areas after tax reform, as well as the measures for collecting those fees. Provincial governments and central departments and committees should work together to readjust and standardize the amounts of tuitions and miscellaneous fees to be collected in all types of schools. Based on the principle for unifying administrative and financial powers, we should study and come up with views about administrative educational departments joining governments of corresponding levels in budgeting educational funds. We should study ways to improve rural areas' measures for raising educational funds, earnestly solve the problems about investment in building middle and primary school buildings, set up educational trust and investment companies, and make preparations for setting up the "China Foundation for Educational Development." He said: We must earnestly implement the plan for reforming teachers' pay scales, central and local authorities must both take effective measures to speed up construction of teacher housing. Those areas which still have not paid teachers' salaries must be seriously handled lawfully according to their situations. Mechanisms for guarding against delinquent payment of teachers' salaries must be devised. Zhu Kaixuan said: Leading comrades of central authorities have agreed in principle to call a national educational conference during the first half of this year to mobilize the whole party and the whole society to implement the strategy of giving priority to educational development and implement the "program" [for educational development]. The conference will come up with additional views and measures for China's educational reform and development.
