FBIS4-6411 "dreas075_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Urges `Minimal' Changes in New Cabinet Hata Urges `Minimal' Changes in New Cabinet OW1904000994 Tokyo KYODO in English 2326 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1904000994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is certain to become Japan's next prime minister, said Monday [18 April] that cabinet changes must be minimal after the establishment of a new government. Hata, 58, head of key coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], told reporters late Monday night, "I think it's difficult to replace many cabinet members who worked out the fiscal 1994 budget if the present coalition agrees to establish a new government." Hata, who is also deputy prime minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said the new government must be a full- fledged one and not a provisional government, because Japan needs to meet expectations from the rest of the world. On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe indicated to have second thoughts about his plan to leave the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run in a Diet election for the premiership. Watanabe, who declared Sunday that he will quit the LDP, met LDP President Yohei Kono on Monday and conveyed his desire to run for the premiership. But Watanabe told reporters later that he has found major differences with coalition parties over security policies, indicating that he was having second thoughts about his bid for premiership. Kono and Watanabe are scheduled to hold another round of talks Tuesday, LDP officials said. Meanwhile, the chairman of the House of Representatives steering committee said Monday he wants to convene a plenary session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the premiership. Keiwa Okuda told reporters that the lower house will convene the vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the coalition parties pick the coalition's nominee for the next prime minister. Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to resume discussions Tuesday on policies for a new cabinet. In Monday's two rounds of talks, they failed to reach agreement on two issues of immediate concern, Japan's stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program and tax system reform. The forum comprised representatives at the secretaries general level of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito, Komeito [Clean Government Party], Japan New Party (JNP), Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Democratic Reform Party and Kaikaku No Kai [Reform Party]. New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that it will not take posts in a new government, stayed away from the session. The coalition executives confirmed Monday that the ruling parties will stick to a policy accord reached before the formation of the Hosokawa administration last August, said SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, chairman of the forum. They also shared the view that early Diet approval of the overdue 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 is the top priority for the next government and that the new administration should formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring spending for improving living standards, Kubo told a news conference. On basic policies, the coalition representatives ironed out differences on such key issues as political reform, economic reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. ties and administrative reform and decentralization, he said. Hosokawa, who declared on April 8 that he is resigning as prime minister, will stay in office until the Diet picks a new prime minister.
