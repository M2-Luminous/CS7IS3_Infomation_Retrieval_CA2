At present, 4.1 million incumbent workers and 660,000 retired workers across the province have participated in the social insurance program. Thus, a multilayered and integrated social insurance system has taken its initial shape. Social insurance is a social security measure and a social stability mechanism cosponsored and enforced by the state and government departments, with the purpose of providing a guarantee for the living standard of laborers during maternity, old age, illness, burial arrangements, injury, disability, and unemployment. Beginning in 1986, on the basis of universally establishing at the higher and the lower levels the social insurance management organs that are subordinate to the labor departments of various levels, our province has conducted a series of reforms of the social insurance system with old-age insurance and unemployment insurance as the priorities. In line with the principle of "fixing the amount of funds to be collected according to the amount of funds to be spent, allowing a small surplus, and keeping a portion as accumulation funds," we have implemented the method of collecting and adjusting old-age insurance funds with social efforts in state-owned enterprises and changed the long-practiced method of making enterprises assume sole responsibility for all the retirement payments. At the end of 1987, 149 counties and cities across the province took the lead in China in implementing the method of collecting old-age insurance funds of state-owned enterprises from social sectors. Beginning 1 January 1992, this method was carried out in the whole province. Starting this year, the method of fixing the percentages of old-age insurance funds to be collected from permanent workers, contract workers, and temporary workers, collecting these funds in an unified manner, and combining them for use has been implemented in state-owned enterprises across the province, thus effecting an integrated management of old-age insurance for state-owned enterprises. We have conducted the program of collecting old-age insurance funds for collective enterprise workers from the social sectors. So far, all counties and cities across the province have basically realized the goal of collecting old-age insurance funds from the social sectors in cities and counties, with more than 80 percent of incumbent workers and retired workers participating in this program. We have also established the old-age insurance system for temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprise workers, and self-employed workers. To meet the needs of the coexistence of various forms of ownership and market economic development, and while unceasingly improving the old-age insurance system for workers of state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises, our province has successively issued old-age insurance regulations and methods for various kinds of enterprise workers such as temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprises, and self-employed workers. In line with the principle of pooling old-age insurance funds from the state, enterprises and workers themselves, we have universally implemented the system of making workers themselves pay a basic amount of old-age insurance funds. Starting in 1992, we have reformed the method of calculating and distributing the basic old-age pensions for workers and selected Baoding, Handan, and Xingtai cities as pilot units. The reform plan of Baoding city had been put into trial implementation in July 1993. The whole province will promulgate the new method for calculating and distributing the basic old-age pension and put it into practice within this year. We have universally established the unemployment insurance system for enterprise workers. Over the past few years, the scope of implementing the unemployment insurance system has unceasingly expanded, 23,491 units with 3.86 million workers have joined the unemployment insurance program, and the unemployment insurance program's dual functions of providing relief for unemployed workers and helping them find jobs again have been given full play. At present, the whole province has provided jobs for 136,700 unemployed people in cities and towns and provided relief for the living of 26,000 unemployed people. We have taken active and prudent steps to conduct reform of the injury, medical, and female workers' birth insurance systems in selected units. Thirty counties and cities across the province have implemented the injury insurance reform. In reform of the medical insurance system, we have mainly implemented the method of pooling medical expenses for incumbent workers who suffer serious illness and health-care expenses for retired workers from social sectors in some selected units. In female workers' birth insurance reform, we have experimented with the method of pooling birth funds for female workers from social sectors. We have conducted social insurance program and socialized management and service work. Labor departments and social insurance organs at all levels have enhanced the sense of service and strengthened socialized management and service work for enterprise retired workers in the principle of "combining the efforts of departments and regions and the efforts of specialized organs and the masses." Almost 50 percent of the counties and cities across the province have established management organizations with the self-management of retired personnel playing a dominant role. Many counties and cities have also conducted "coordinated" service work, such as handling all sorts of social insurance procedures and providing consulting services.
