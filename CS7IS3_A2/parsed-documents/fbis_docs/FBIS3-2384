Funds started to rush into the real estate industry in Shanghai, China's large metropolis, in April 1990, when the State Council declared Pudong, part of the city, an open area. In 1991, more than 63 million dollars worth of foreign funds poured into the real estate industry in the area. In 1992, the figure soared to some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and in 1993 it further jumped to 3.4 billion U.S. dollars. It is estimated that by the end of 1995, there will be more than 100 high rise buildings in the Pudong new area alone. At the same time, more than 100 real estate companies came into being. They included state-owned, collective-owned, jointly-funded and private-run ones, sprouted into being. These companies broke away with the convention that official housing departments should monopolise housing development. However, quite a number of these companies were only money-minded and often failed to meet their clients' needs, according to local housing development agencies. The examination system aims to tighten the management of these companies and push forward the housing reform, some officials said. Under the system, Shanghai Housing Bureau will be the administrative body for the real estate industry. The system stipulates that a real estate company must possess, or be entrusted to develop an area of more than 10,000 sq m [square meters], and have a registered capital of more than 200,000 yuan, have legal management rules, have a fixed, registered company address and necessary managerial personnel. The real estate managerial personnel are required to have professional diplomas or certificates.
