Liu Chengguo held: The sustainable development of small island developing countries is an important component of global sustainable development. Small island developing countries' efforts to develop the economy and protect the environment constitute a contribution to realizing the goal of global sustained development. Speaking on how to establish such partnership relations for sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that such relations should be characterized by mutual respect and equality in treating each other. He said: Large or small and strong or weak as they may be, all countries are equal partners in international cooperation. Only in this way, can they have the foundation for cooperation. If a country criticizes others at every turn, always tries to force certain patterns or the policies and methods suitable to some countries on others, and even regards money and technical aids as political counters and puts forward unreasonable demands on the internal affairs of the aided countries, partnership relations will be out of the question. Liu Chengguo said: In such partnership relations, the endeavor to solve global environmental problems should also be closely combined with the endeavor to solve the specific problems that small island developing countries are faced with, and small island developing countries should be helped to attain the two goals of sustained economic development and environmental protection, which supplement each other. Liu Chengguo pointed out that such partnership relations should manifest the principle of "common and yet different responsibilities." He said: Changes in weather, rise of the sea level, pollution of seas and coasts, and other environmental problems are not created chiefly by small island countries, but small island countries are the first to suffer the damage. Many problems left from colonial or trusteeship periods are still restricting their social and economic development. Therefore, to effectively solve the environmental problems of small island countries and enable them to achieve sustainable development, the international community, especially developed countries, should shoulder more duties. In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: As a developing country, China has a deep understanding and sympathy toward the difficulties small island developing countries encounter. China has established friendly cooperative relations with many small island developing countries and is willing to actively probe and strengthen multiform and multi-layered South-South cooperation to realize common development and prosperity. The UN "global conference on sustainable development of small island developing countries" opened on 25 April. Government delegations from 100 member countries of the United Nations, including China, attended the conference. The conference was held particularly for the purpose of addressing the special problems regarding the environment and development of small island countries after the 1992 UN conference on environment and development.
