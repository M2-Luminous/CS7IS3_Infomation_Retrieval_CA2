According to Haavisto, the quotas are much less than what Finland has proposed. Minister Haavisto said on Saturday [29 January] that Finland is now on the verge of really difficult negotiations. In practice only 20 working days are left for thm. In Haavisto's view, the situation is very open in all respects, since the Commission has still not reached a decision on the issues which are most important to Finland -- that is, the support for northern regions. According to the EU Commission's proposal, Finland's milk quota would be 2,340 million liters and sugar production would be limited to 146,000 tonnes. The Commission's proposal means that Finland ought to cut its present milk quota by around 8 percent. The sugar quota that has been offered means that at least one sugar refinery will have to be closed, Haavisto said. In his view the cut in milk production is pretty hard, because Finland has been assuming that it might succeed in this very area. Finland's current quota-linked milk production is 2,515 million liters. In addition to this Finland has also been seeking an opportunity for those farms which have ceased producing milk to resume production in line with the system in force within the EU. This means that the quota target increases to 2,992 million liters. In Haavisto's view the EU Commission has made a clear mistake in fixing the milk quota. It has failed to understand that all farms have not fully exploited their right of production. However, Haavisto pointed out that by far the most important issue in the continued negotiations is support for northern regions. "Quotas such as these are also without importance if the economic conditions for producing them do not exist," he said. In Haavisto's view it is possible to see from the EU Commission's offers that the understanding that has been voiced at the general level for Finland's special problems is much less when the issues are discussed at expert level. Haavisto said that we must now hope that the understanding that has been expressed at head of state level spreads to the countries' negotiators and to the Commission -- that is, that there will also be understanding in practice. He added that he believes that the EU's machinery for preparing decisions has not functioned satisfactorily on this point. In his view there is still some goodwill in various quarters. However, some flexibility is needed on the Commission's part, he added. The Commission has prepared its proposal for the member countries and it is with these that Finland and the other applicant nations will negotiate the terms of membership.
