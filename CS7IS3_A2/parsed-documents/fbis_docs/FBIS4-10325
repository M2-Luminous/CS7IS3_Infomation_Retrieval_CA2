[Begin Machado Ventura recording] This year, as has been explained, workers' day will be observed in each workplace by carrying out the main tasks, those which are essential. This has begun, because the workers are not waiting for 1 May to do so. This does not mean that the commemoration will take place on that day alone. I think that 1 May must be celebrated every day in the area of production and under the current circumstances.
