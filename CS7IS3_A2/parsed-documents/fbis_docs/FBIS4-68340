In purely chronological terms, you made your proposal thereafter. At issue is the "Eurasian confederative agreement." Did Nazarbayev's pronouncements give it an impetus, or did this idea mature in parallel? [Shakhray] I take pleasure in yielding political priority to Nursultan Abishevich; I respect him as a politician who knows how to take a long-term view. As far as the legal, organizational aspect of the issue is concerned, I prepared the draft of a confederative agreement by April 1992. Everyone understood that the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in December 1991 amounted to preventing a spontaneous breakup of the USSR, which was fraught with great trouble, the beginning of integration on new principles, along new lines, rather than an act in divorce proceedings. The thrust of my draft is not to disband the CIS but rather to create a confederative nucleus of three to four countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The topic of a confederation was a component of our election platform. In April 1994 I revisited this idea, proposing this time a specific draft confederative agreement which I released and officially introduced in the State Duma. To me this topic also has a moral dimension in conjunction with the charges concerning my participation in the Belovezha negotiations. Incidentally, on the issue of breaking up the USSR. The USSR was a mighty state, was it not? Of course, it was a nuclear power, a world power. However, another question is also proper: Could a truly mighty state be broken up by three persons--Yeltsin, Shushkevich, and Kravchuk--in the woods, under KGB supervision? The answer is obvious--it could not! Two points are fundamental to me: The Belovezha agreement was not the beginning of the collapse of the USSR, but the completion of a quite protracted and tragic period of the destruction of the state; the formation of the CIS was the first stop on a long path toward economic and political integration. It is impossible to restore the Soviet Union by pushing buttons in the parliament. There is only one path toward the future--from the CIS toward the Confederation as a voluntary union on an equal footing with Eurasian states on the principles of economic integration. There is no alternative. The confederation would continue the political sovereignty and independence of the states belonging to it and would be created to achieve common goals. For the states of the former Union, this is primarily economics, our Common Market if you will, in which after a while the free movement of goods, services, and capital will be guaranteed. Collective security and the coordination of certain foreign policy actions would be the second goal of the confederation. The preservation of minimum sociocultural relations, insurance, retirement benefits, and so on would be the third goal. It appears to me that the idea of integration is even somewhat overripe now. The elections in Ukraine and Moldavia [Moldova] indicate this. [Yaroshevskiy] At present, everybody is "fixated" on the idea of reunification--national-chauvinists, fascists, and democrats alike.... Nonetheless, there are two approaches--frantic and balanced. What is your vision of the position of the democrats, of the democratic movement? [Shakhray] The destruction of the Union is a grave psychological trauma associated not only with the loss of territory or the fact that 25 million Russians have ended up beyond the borders of Russia. For many people this is also a personal tragedy because the Russian people, Russians, always perceived themselves within a specific state. This is, if you will, the sense of great statehood. It is possible to exploit the self-awareness of the Russians and restore the one and indivisible Rus within the borders of 1975, 1913, or any other year. This is the forcible and bloody path of Vladimir Volfovich. Voluntary integration on an equal footing is the second path. The confederation is precisely a legal form for such integration. [Yaroshevskiy] Your idea of a confederative structure appeals to common sense. The ideas of, say, Zhirinovskiy and his ilk are designed for emotions. Are you confident that common sense will prevail this time? Are you not afraid of major interethnic clashes? Many people have a preference for feelings; they could not care less about what the confederation is. [Shakhray] You are absolutely right; this is why I say that we are even being late with the confederation proposal because time and painstaking work are necessary for common sense to win out whereas a fraction of a second suffices for an emotional outburst. However, we should keep it in mind that an attempt at forcible integration would be yet another attempt to turn the Russian people inside out. [Yaroshevskiy] Each historical period brings forth its own political leaders. There was a parade of sovereignties, there were people who exploited this very social condition. The spontaneous craving for unification is strong at present. Are we right to surmise that the forthcoming replacement of the current political leaders is predetermined by the striving of the people toward some kind of community? [Shakhray] If upwards of 80 percent of the population are in favor of integration but politicians are against it, such politicians will not have a future. Their stubbornness is fraught with conflicts, societal breakups, and clashes. Let us conduct a referendum on unification in Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and Kazakhstan. I think that not one sober-minded person has doubts about the outcome of such a referendum. Perhaps we should not spend tens of billions to hold it, but actually solve the problem of integration. [Yaroshevskiy] Could you give us examples of those in favor of and against your proposals? [Shakhray] The response of political leaders is known in part: Nazarbayev supported it; Akayev supported it; the largest faction in the Belarussian parliament welcomes the idea of the confederation. We have proposed to establish an international group for refining our draft. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord is appealing not only to the leaders of states but also to the public, political parties, movements and deputies who come out in favor of integration on the basis of common sense, on the basis of voluntary participation and equal rights. That is to say, we are trying to create a critical mass that will prevent violence under the guise of unification from spreading like a forest fire. [Yaroshevskiy] How will the State Duma respond? [Shakhray] The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] will come out categorically against, and I will view this as proof that we have taken a very serious and timely step. I think that Russia's Choice and Apple will take a moderately favorable position. They will respond favorably because no sober-minded politician will come out against integration or civic peace. They will respond with moderation because there are objective difficulties and obstacles on the path toward integration. I think that support can be expected from a segment of the Communist faction and some agrarians, the New Regional Policy group. We hope to gain support from other associations, too. Therefore, there should be more allies than adversaries. In all of this, I am prepared to give up the authorship if the name "Shakhray" irritates someone. This is why I propose to establish a working group. Let the idea itself work.
