This is suggested by events since early this morning. The chetnik snipers, anti-aircraft weapons, and tanks have fallen silent. Under pressure from the international community and with the arrival of the first contingent of blue helmets, the murderers from the hills do not seem to live here any more. The first estimates suggest that the chetniks -- despite the considerable delay considering the NATO deadline -- have started to withdraw from the points from where they have been sowing death in Gorazde. The chetniks are scorching the earth as they pull back. The members of the Ukrainian battalion that arrived in Gorazde on Saturday evening have started to impose a buffer zone in the region. The result is obvious: There is no more blood in the streets of Gorazde, there is no more death, screams, and pain. After more than a month a UNHCR convoy with food and medicine managed to enter Gorazde late last night. Another humanitarian convoy has been announced for today for the starved and bleeding Gorazde. Still, the main concern of the people is today's resumption of the evacuation of the badly wounded from the Gorazde hospital.
