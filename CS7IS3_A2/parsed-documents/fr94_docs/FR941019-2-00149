FR941019-2-00149 FR941019-2-00081 Commenting Party is One of the New Entrants Sought by DOJ Our client (the ``Commenting Party'') is an entity formed under the laws of one of the States of the United States which now owns a Float Glass plant at which it manufactures and sells Float Glass. Commenting Party is an assignee and/or sublicensee of two License Agreements entered into between a subsidiary and/or predecessor of one of the Defendants and one of AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG or LOF (the ``named Licensees''). Under the License Agreements as to which the Commenting Party is an assignee and/or sublicensee, the ``Licensed Patents'' covered by such License Agreements are expansively defined to include all U.S. Patents issued during the ``Term'' of the relevant License Agreement, U.S. Patent applications filed during such Term and the U.S. Patents that may be issue thereunder, Patents as to which the contracting Pilkington entity has the right to grant a license or sub-license and continuations, divisions and reissues of such Patents. The Terms of License Agreements ``expire'' after 1985 but the license rights concerning the License Patents become ``paid up'' and remain vital. This vitality extends for the life of each of the License Patents and reaches into the 21st century. The Commenting Party regarded and still regards these acquired and/or sublicensed rights to be essential to its continued operation of its Float Glass plant. It would not have expended the tens of millions of dollars it did for its Float Glass plant in the absence of its rights under such License Agreements. The Final Judgment Does Not Adequately Protect New Entrants In obtaining these valuable license rights by assignment and/or sublicensing, Commenting Party in effect stepped into the shoes of its assignor/sublicensor and may have inherited certain other features of the License Agreements that DOJ has described as characteristic of Defendents' allegedly unlawful activities. These features include: 1. Purported limitations on assignment and/or sublicensing. 2. Restrictive confidentiality provisions respecting allegedly confidential information i.e. know-how (confidentiality provisions do not apply to technology disclosed in Patents laws restrict competitive uses). 3. Choice of law provisions invoking the laws of England. (All Agreements deriving important rights from the Defendants, their predecessors or subsidiaries presumably invoke the laws of England as the ``applicable law.''). 4. Arbitration provisions requiring arbitration venued in England for all disputes. (All Agreements deriving important rights from the Defendants, their predecessors or subsidiaries presumably require arbitration in England.) Commenting Party believes that other prospective entrants into the Float Glass industry will conclude, as Commenting Party did, that the construction and operation of a competitive Float Glass plant requires such entrant to become an assignee and/or sublicensee of Patent and other rights under a License Agreement derived from the Defendants, their predesessors or subsidiaries (the ``Pilkington Group''). When they do so they may become subject to restrictive provisions like those described above. The Final Judgment appears to permit the enforcement of these allegedly anti-competitive provisions. If a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry requires institutional financing in order to construct a Float Glass plant having a cost, according to DOJ, of between $100 and $150 million dollars, will the protections allegedly afforded by the Final Judgment resolve the issues that institutional lenders, institutional lawyers and borrower's counsel will find in the License Agreements as modified by the Final Judgment? The answer simply stated is no . Commenting Party believes the flawed assumptions have led to a flawed result. This conclusion is illuminated by the application of the elements of the Final Judgment to the facts of Commenting Party's case. What Is Commenting Party's Assignor's/Sublicensor's Status? Does the Final Judgment classify the Named Licensee with whom Commenty Party contracted (``Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor'') as a ``U.S. Licensee''? To be a U.S. Licensee, one must first be a person, company or entity who is a ``Licensee.'' A person, company or entity is not a Licensee unless they have `` *␣*␣* entered into a License Agreement with Pilkington.'' (Emphasis added''). The phrase ``*␣*␣* entered into *␣*␣* with Pilkington *␣*␣*'' appears to require privity of contract. This privity is restricted, apparently, to persons, companies or entities in privity with ``Pilkington.'' Since ``Pilkington'' is only Pilkington plc, this privity must be with the Defendant Pilkington plc.
