An NDS statement given to CTK says that the growing attacks on the minister, who is also NDS deputy chairman, from the Democratic Left Party (SDL), an NDS coalition partner, were unjustified and contradicted the ethics of coalition cooperation. Statements by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, Chairman of the SDL deputies' group Milan Ftacnik and some other deputies about Janicina's giving unjustified preference to the coupon method of privatization compared with other methods are not qualified and substantiated, the statement says. The NDS considers it "natural and moral that citizens, through coupon privatization, receive their share in the property which they have been creating in the past," the statement says. The NDS Executive Committee believes that "the coalition government will meet its commitments and offer citizens property worth at least 88 billion Slovak crowns (some 3 billion USD)," it adds. Following unsuccessful attempts by the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to dismiss Janicina there have been calls for a change of privatization minister. It is primarily the coalition SDL which raises objections towards Janicina's performance. There has long been speculation about controversies between Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi concerning the concept of privatization.
