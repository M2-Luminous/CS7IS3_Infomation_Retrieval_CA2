He said that this year is important year for our efforts to speed up the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, a year which will see overall progress on all fronts in reform, breakthroughs at key links, and the most vigorous enforcement of the coordinated reform package, and it is also a crucial year for our efforts to fulfill the goals set by the Eighth Five-Year Plan. The main targets of our economic work this year are for GDP to increase by 10 percent over last year, gross agricultural output value to increase by 3.5 percent, gross industrial output value to increase by 18 percent, foreign trade and exports to increase by 11 percent, local financial revenue to increase by 6.5 percent, the margin of increase in the volume of retail sales to be kept around 10 percent, and the natural rate of population growth to be kept below 11 per thousand, with the target set at 10 per thousand. Governor Ma Zhongchen said: As far as the general planning of economic work this year is concerned, we are to promote development with reform, and the general program of reform is to strive for progress on all fronts with breakthroughs at key links. He particularly mentioned eight tasks: 1) Speeding up the establishment of a modern enterprise system and striving hard to improve the economic returns of industrial enterprises; 2) comprehensively carrying out reform of the finance and taxation system and making great efforts to explore more financial sources; 3) carrying out in-depth reform of the banking system and striving hard to raise funds and use funds in a more cost-effective way; 4) doing a good job in reform of the planning and investment system and strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control; 5) speeding up reform of the foreign trade structure and expanding the process of opening up to the outside world more boldly; 6) speeding up the growth of a market system with the development of production factors markets as the key link; 7) establishing and perfecting the income distribution and social security system and ensuring a satisfactory living standard for the people; and 8) actively, steadily, and properly advancing price reform and keeping the general price level under strict control. To conclude, Governor Ma Zhongchen asserted that as far as economic work this year is concerned, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability; the relationship between overall progress on all fronts and breakthroughs at key links; the relationship between the effort to bring the market's functions into play and the improvement of macroeconomic regulation and control; the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual; and the relationship between the development of the two civilizations. By doing so, we will make new contributions to ensure good and rapid economic development in this province.
