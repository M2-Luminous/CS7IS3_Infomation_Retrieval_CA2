Representatives of the private sector have asked the Foreign Trade Commission (Cocex) to apply Rule 8 of Chapter 98 of the General Importation Tax Tariff (TIGI), which creates entire tariff brackets which eliminate tariff irregularities [desfasamientos arancelarios] on similar products. According to foreign trade experts, mainly small- and medium-sized businessmen -- specifically those who did not see tariffs reduced to zero on products they import within the framework of NAFTA -- have filed complaints with the authorities. Up until mid-February, at least 20 cases of tax irregularities had been filed with Cocex, which comprises officials from Secofi, the Finance Secretariat, and the Bank of Mexico. Among those products facing open-market competition while encountering disadvantages in the cost of their component imports are: Padlocks, tools, movable iron pipes, agriculture transport or milk storage tanks, fish meal, sausages, refrigerators, leather belts, and others. For example, in the NAFTA tariff brackets for machinery and equipment, the reduction rates rates are greater than those for similar products under the TIGI, which is used by third-party countries. The inconsistencies for the aforementioned products translate into a tariff reduction rate that is slower than the one for imports from which these final products are made. Therefore, the raw materials for iron products face a 10-percent tariff, while the final product -- say, a padlock -- has been exempted from tariffs altogether since the day the trade agreement went into effect. According to sources, some of the cases that have been brought before Cocex are not always similar to the above-mentioned cases -- those involving compact disk or bag manufacturers, for example -- because these industries never participated in the negotiations. Meanwhile, some small- and medium-sized businessmen charge their interests were not defended by the Coordinator for Foreign Trade Business Organizations (COECE) and were sacrificed to obtain concessions in favor of large Mexican businessmen. To correct the situation, Cocex has suggested that Rule 8 of Chapter 98 of the TIGI be applied, eliminating all tariffs at the same time for each and every component of a production network. Rule 8 is not a new option, because it has been discussed at the legislature for more than 10 years. Nevertheless, in general, no new brackets have been added using Rule 8 over the past five years. Sources said Secofi officials have refused to resort to this provision, because it would only represent temporary solutions for some products. It is not a matter of creating a new tariff bracket under Chapter 98. The bottom line is this: The cards have already been dealt, and NAFTA legislation prohibits "recanting" negotiated concessions; only negotiations to further reduce tariffs for products under the terms of Article 302.2 are expected to be held. The seriousness of this situation, according to warnings from foreign trade experts, is that, if the final product pays less taxes that its component parts, there will be trade imbalances that favor imported goods. Additionally, they noted that if this matter is not settled promptly -- already, more than 30 days have passed since the notification -- domestic producers of goods facing competitive disadvantages with regard to foreign goods will tend to disappear or become product marketers. Foreign trade experts warn that the effects of this must not be underestimated, especially in advance of new tariff negotiations with the United States and Canada.
