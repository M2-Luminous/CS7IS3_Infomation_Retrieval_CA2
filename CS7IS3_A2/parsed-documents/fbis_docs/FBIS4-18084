The trial of another four defendants, two Britons and two Iraqis, is scheduled for November 8. One of the two British engineers, Christopher Cowley, 55, has testified to the Italian parliament's commerce and industry committee that he designed the cannon according to specifications provided by Canadian ballistics expert Gerald Bull, killed in mysterious circumstances in Brussels on March 22, 1990. Cowley says Bull was murdered by the Israeli secret service, Mossad. The other Briton to be tried on November 8 is John Heath, 58. Both worked for Ati, a Belgian company that allegedly sub-contracted parts of the project to firms around Europe. One of the three Italians sentenced today is an engineer from the northern city of Brescia, Aldo Savegnago, 71, appointed by Ati to monitor Societa' delle Fucine's execution of its part of the work. The other two are the company's attorneys Paolo Castellazzi, 51, from Milan, and Umberto Varazi, 51, from Terni, who allegedly negotiated the sub-contract with Iraqi officials. All three received sentences of less than two years in prison (with Savegnano also fined 800,000 lire, or 485 dollars) after plea-bargaining on charges of "aiding and abetting the construction of unlicensed weapons of war." The two Iraqis are Al Mishedani Shakir, 39, and A.K. Azzawi [names as received], Iraqi industry ministry officials on secondment to the Iraqi embassy in Rome to draw up the contract and follow its execution. Italian authorities have been unable to trace them. The seven defendants were indicted last July after months of investigations in Spain, Greece, Belgium, Britain and Switzerland. The case broke in May 1990 when Carabinieri police seized the 75 tonnes of parts in the port of Naples just before they were shipped to Iraq. The Iraqi government maintained they were to be used for an oil pipeline, but Italian investigators pointed to a match with similar cannon parts, posing as heavy machinery or tubes, seized elsewhere in Europe including Britain. Before the trial, Societa' delle Fucine had consistently maintained that it acted in good faith, saying it had "no idea" that the parts could be used to make a huge-caliber long-range cannon.
