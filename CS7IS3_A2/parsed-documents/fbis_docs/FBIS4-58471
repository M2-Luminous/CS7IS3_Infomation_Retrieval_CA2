The three-day talks are to be attended by 43 countries, including the Zionist regime, most of the Arab countries, and representatives from the United Nations and the European Union. The topics to be discussed at the session will be the limitation of arms in the Middle East and freeing this area of mass destruction weapons. The Middle East is one of the areas where a large volume of conventional and nonconventional arms are being stored. A large part of these arms, which are mainly nonconventional, are in the Persian Gulf countries, while another part--consisting of both conventional and nonconventional arms--are stored in Israel. These arms are produced by Western countries, especially the United States, which is creating threats in the region and is thus flooding its arms into this area to free itself from economic bankruptcy and create regional tensions. What is noteworthy in this session is the Zionist regime's participation. It is said that this regime has more than 200 nuclear warheads plus advanced non-nuclear weapons. Also, the Zionist regime has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and the Disarmament Pact, which most countries have accepted. The Arab countries in the Persian Gulf also carry out one-fifth of the world's arms transactions, and one-fourth of their oil income goes to buy these arms. Thus, even though disarmament is a favorable issue in principle, speaking about disarmament will be meaningless in view of the increasing trend of arms production and arms purchases, both by the Arab countries and by Israel, and one cannot speak of disarmament while increasing arms purchases. Meanwhile, the non-Middle East countries participating in this conference are countries who enjoy large incomes from arms sales. Thus, in drawing a logical conclusion it is impossible to have a positive outcome from two negative points. Thus, the convening of the Middle East peace conference [as heard], which has caused heated arguments in the Arab and Western mass media, can only be a mask covering the illogical steps made by the participants in the arms conference. Israel is benefiting from all this both by covering up the arms it manufactures and by portraying its participation as a gesture of goodwill toward the Arab countries to consolidate the Middle East peace process.
