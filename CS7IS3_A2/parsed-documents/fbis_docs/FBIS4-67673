The centres would also provide rehabilitation programmes to help them change their lifestyle and dissuade them from returning to their trade. At present, 140 prostitutes, including 100 foreigners, have been detained and found to be infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, he told reporters in Seremban, about 60 km south of here. Lee said all the foreign prostitutes would be repatriated to their country of origin while the 40 local prostitutes would be sent to the centres.

There were now 7,000 HIV carriers in Malaysia, 85 per cent of whom were drug addicts, who formed the majority of the 150-200 HIV carriers detected monthly. He said the most prominent problem in the AIDS prevention campaign in the country was to convince the high risk groups to change their habit and lifestyle. Lee also said that the country's infant mortality rate had been reduced from 13 per 1,000 during the Fifth Malaysia Plan period (1985-1990) to 11 per 1,000 at present.
