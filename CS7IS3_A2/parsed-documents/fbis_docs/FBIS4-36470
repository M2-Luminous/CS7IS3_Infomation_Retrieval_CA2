He said that the PLO chairman was lying when he spoke about the issue in Johannesburg. Rabin told our correspondent Gadi Sukenik a short time ago that no attempt was made to conceal anything in the Jerusalem letter issue. Rabin says that 'Arafat's remarks constituted a fallacious attempt to create a link between the interim arrangement in the territories and East Jerusalem. Rabin added that whatever is taking place in Jerusalem at the present time is none of the PLO's concern. Rabin added that if Faysal al-Husayni resides in Jerusalem and occupies Orient House he will not be a member of the Palestinian Authority, because a total separation will be preserved between the autonomy areas and East Jerusalem: [Begin Rabin recording] Wherein did 'Arafat lie? He said he received a letter from us, but no letter was addressed to him regarding Israel's policy in East Jerusalem during the interim arrangement period. Two, he said this issue was linked to the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. This issue was not raised in any form or shape in the negotiations we held with 'Arafat during my visit to Cairo. Three, 'Arafat tried -- with the Likud's help -- to link the letter sent to the Norwegian foreign minister explaining our policy -- as publicly described by the foreign minister in the Knesset -- to the Gaza-Jericho First agreement or to the interim arrangement. This is all a lie, and this is what Minister Shahal said. [end recording]
