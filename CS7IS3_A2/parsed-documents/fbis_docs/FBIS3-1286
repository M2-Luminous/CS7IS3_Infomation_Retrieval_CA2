The officer commanding the far north command, Major General Faan Grobbelaar, says the step had followed reports that people were planning to damage key points. General Grobbelaar said that the sites to be guarded included the Lebowa police magazine, to prevent the theft of arms and ammunition. The government building and petrol depot would also be guarded. Other defense force units were being deployed at strategic places to ensure the maintenance of law and order. He said their task was being made difficult by striking Lebowa policemen.
