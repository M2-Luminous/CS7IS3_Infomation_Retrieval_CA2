The Belgian general's departure "is absolutely not linked with any disciplinary measure," said UNPROFOR's Sarajevo sector spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Guy de Battista. UNPROFOR spokesman Major Idesbald van Biesebroeck said Briquemont would leave Sarajevo at the end of January. "He is tired. I can understand his feeling of tiredness, because it's quite clear that he is not so young anymore. "After seven months of this difficult mission he should be tired," he told a press conference. De Battista added: "General Briquemont's return is happening under normal conditions and at his request," describing as "completely unfounded" rumours about the reasons for Briquemont's departure. Van Biesebroeck said Briquemont had asked to leave via the normal channels. "He asked his minister of defense, who goes to the minister of foreign affairs who goes to secretary general. It is an ordinary diplomatic procedure," he said. Belgian Defence Minister Leo Delcroix confirmed on Tuesday that Briquemont was leaving ahead of his mandate, which was due to last until July. Meanwhile the British Defence Ministry said Wednesday that British General Michael Rose will replace Briquemont. Rose is currently British Army chief of staff.
