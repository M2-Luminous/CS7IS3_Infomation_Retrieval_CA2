For instance, Secretary of State Spallow [name, title as published] formally announced on 21 January that the United States is "not asking to set targets for market shares (of foreign products)." This may be interpreted as a move to probe for a point to bring the talks to a conclusion. Several factors may have contributed to the change in the U.S. Government's attitude -- such as U.S. President Clinton's unswerving economic policy of "giving priority to getting results even at the cost of making concessions," and his consideration for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is in a difficult position over such issues as political reform. The economic talks started with a not-too-clear agreement on "setting objective criteria to measure progress of market liberalization" at the Japan-U.S. summit in July. In the course of the talks, Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative (USTR), demanded that Japan "improve the market shares of foreign products to the level practiced in the seven major industrial nations (G-7) within a few years. Japan reacted negatively toward the demand, insisting that "setting numerical targets goes against Japan-U.S. agreements." In attempting to understand the reason for the U.S. softening its attitude, a parliamentarian concerned said: "Making concessions, striving for substance rather than agreements in name only, is the usual routine of the Clinton economic policy." Concerning the rice issue, the United States abandoned its stand on "tariffication without exception" but succeeded in drawing concessions from Japan by presenting a compromise to it in the form of a "special measure." Consequently, it succeeded in securing for itself the "substance" of assured participation in the Japanese rice market and stepped-up liberalization of beef and citrus products markets. A senior USTR official said: "Judgments on whether Japan has made progress in opening up its market will be reached by taking into account several factors in a comprehensive manner -- not by whether or not certain numerical targets have been reached." However, he also added: "If there are gaps in judgment between Japan and the United States, the United States will take action based on its own judgment." In other words, the United States can decide to put the U.S. Trade Act into motion, depending on its judgment. This would mean that "the United States could compromise on the question of numerical targets, but there is no change in the effect of putting pressure on Japan." Another factor is the consideration given for the difficult position Prime Minister Hosokawa is now facing. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the President, is said to have spent much time when he was in Japan recently gathering information relating to the future of the Hosokawa government. In the White House, there are many who view positively the market liberalization and deregulation policies advocated by Prime Minister Hosokawa -- regardless of whether he has real power or not. In a news conference on 20 December, Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, made a remark supporting the prime minister in an indirect way, saying bureaucrats should be sensitive to what the prime minister seeks to achieve. Undersecretary of State Spallow [name, title as published] has also viewed Prime Minister Hosokawa's policies in a positive light. The official's concern was apparent when he said: "It is not good to press Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is in a difficult position over the issues of budget formulation and political reform bills." Another point to note is that there has been a gap of views between the Office of the USTR on one hand and the White House and the Department of State on the other from the beginning. Under Secretary of State Spallow has said, "the United States has never talked about numerical targets," and White House officials have also been conspicuously cautious. But people like Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, have demanded setting the numerical targets, going so far as to assert, for instance, that "Japanese bureaucrats function better when they have concrete targets." It is highly possible that the United States is employing in the economic talks the strategy of Trade Representative Kantor, who was a lawyer formerly, of "making as many demands as possible in the beginning, and then conducting negotiations on them later." However, while attitudes may have changed superficially, it does not mean that the Clinton government has given up its intention of including in the agreement figures of market shares held by foreign products of companies from the G-7 nations. The White House has suggested that "standard G-7 market share figures should be included."
