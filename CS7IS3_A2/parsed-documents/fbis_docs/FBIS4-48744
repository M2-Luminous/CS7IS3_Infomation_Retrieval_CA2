In an interview en route to Addis Ababa, he said possible military intervention in Rwanda by the South African troops would have to be carefully considered by the government. "There is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to assist and desire to help is there." Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity headquarters. South Africa became the 53rd member of the OAU on Monday. Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the United Nations. He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU. "Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign debt and must do everything possible to end that debt." The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the OAU was "the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of Africa". South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself in international politics and there was an increased potential for trade links with other African states. He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South Africans. "We are not going to foster big brother relations with the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help uplift the other countries of Africa." The flag-raising ceremony, which would be attended by the OAU Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, is scheduled to take place at 3PM SA [South African] time.
