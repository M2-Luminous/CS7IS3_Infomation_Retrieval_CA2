(SBI), Located in New York, NY AGENCY: Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. ACTION: Grant of individual exemption to modify and replace prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 92&hyph;77 involving Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Shearson Lehman). SUMMARY: This document contains an individual exemption which supersedes PTE 92&hyph;77 (57 FR 45833, October 5, 1992). 1 This exemption permits the replacement of Shearson Lehman with an entity known as ``Smith Barney Inc.'' 2 It also allows SBI to adopt a daily-traded collective investment fund (the GIC Fund) for Plans investing in the Consulting Group Capital Markets Funds (the Trust). The exemption provides conditional relief that is identical to that provided by PTE 92&hyph;77 and it will affect participants and beneficiaries of, and fiduciaries with respect to, Plans participating in the Trust. 1 PTE 92&hyph;77 provides exemptive relief from section 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, with respect to the purchase or redemption of shares in the Trust for TRAK Investments (which has been redesignated as the ``Consulting Group Capital Markets Funds'' and is referred to herein as the Trust) by Plans investing therein. In addition, PTE 92&hyph;77 provides exemptive relief from the restrictions of section 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code, with respect to the provision, by the Consulting Group of Shearson Lehman, of investment advisory services to an Independent Plan Fiduciary of a Plan participating in the TRAK Personalized Investment Advisory Service (the TRAK Program) which may result in such fiduciary's selection of a Portfolio in the TRAK Program for the investment of Plan assets. 2 Effective June 1, 1994, Smith Barney Shearson, Inc. (SBS) was renamed ``Smith Barney Inc.'' Hereinafter, SBS is referred to in this grant notice as either ``Smith Barney Inc.'' or ``SBI.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: This exemption is effective July 31, 1993 for transactions that are covered by PTE 92&hyph;77. With respect to transactions involving the GIC Fund, the exemption is effective March 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Jan D. Broady, Office of Exemption Determinations, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8881. (This is not a toll-free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 29, 1994, the Department of Labor (the Department) published a notice of proposed exemption (the Notice) in the Federal Register (59 FR 14680) that would replace PTE 92&hyph;77. PTE 92&hyph;77 provides an exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and from the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), as amended, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application filed by SBI pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures (the Procedures) set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). Effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type requested to the Secretary of Labor. Accordingly, this replacement exemption is being issued solely by the Department. The Notice gave interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed exemption and to request a public hearing. The only written comments submitted to the Department during the comment period were made by SBI. These comments expressed SBI's substantive concerns about the Notice and offered suggestions for clarifying certain language of the Notice. Discussed below are SBI's comments and the Department's responses thereto. Also discussed is a comment made by the Department. SBI's Comments SBI notes that there is an ambiguity regarding the effective date of the GIC Fund. SBI represents that the Notice provides in the last paragraph under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' that with respect to transactions involving the GIC Fund, the exemption ``would become effective as of the date of the grant of the notice of pendency.'' However, under the captions Effective Dates and Dates , SBI explains that the Notice states that the exemption will be effective ``upon its grant,'' or ``as of the date the grant notice is published.'' Because it was the intention of the parties that the effective date for transactions involving the GIC Fund would be March 29, 1994, the date of publication of the Notice in the Federal Register , SBI requests that the Department make the exemption retroactive to this date for the GIC Fund. The Department has considered SBI's comment and has made the requested modification. SBI wishes to modify the exemption in order that it may offer the GIC Fund to both fiduciary-directed Plans as well as Plans providing for participant-directed investments (the Section 404(c) Plans). The Department believes this comment has merit and that it would be potentially beneficial to participants and beneficiaries since it provides different types of Plans participating in the TRAK Program with the opportunity to invest in the GIC Fund. SBI explains that in the preamble to the Notice there is a statement to the effect that it will ``describe the GIC Fund in a prospectus (the Prospectus) and promotional materials that will be furnished to Section 404(c) Plan participants.'' SBI represents that interests in the GIC Fund are not subject to the registration and Prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Also, SBI points out that the conditions of PTE 92&hyph;77 require it to deliver copies of the Trust Prospectus only to the Plan administrator and not to the individual participants. Because it has no practical means of delivering Prospectuses or other disclosures to participants, SBI indicates that the responsibility for providing these materials to participants rests with the Plan administrator. In this regard, SBI represents that the disclosure information it will make available to all Plans proposing to invest in the GIC Fund will include copies of the Trust Prospectus and a separate description of the GIC Fund's investment objectives, policies and processes. SBI explains that its description of the GIC Fund will be designed to provide a participant with sufficient information in order that the participant can make an informed investment decision. The Department concurs with these comments. In addition to principal comments discussed above, SBI has made certain technical clarifications and updates to the Notice in the following areas: (1) General. a. Redesignations. SBI explains that effective December 31, 1993, Primerica Corporation changed its name to ``The Travelers Inc.'' and that effective May 9, 1994, the ``Trust for TRAK Investments'' was renamed ``Consulting Group Capital Markets Funds.'' Also effective June 1, 1994, ``Smith Barney Shearson Inc.'' was renamed ``Smith Barney Inc.''
