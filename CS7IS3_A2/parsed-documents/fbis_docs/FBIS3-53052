He further announced the posting of a Kenyan ambassador to Israel will be done in the next few months. The president made the announcement while addressing a session of the Israeli parliament this afternoon in Jerusalem. President Moi said that parliamentary democracy remains the only form of government in which the two ideals of a democratic society are protected. The president added that although there are some fundamental principles in any society such as the right to freedom, justice, property and protection of life, every society has its own specific homegrown characteristics and principles. He explained that it was in a mixture of these principles that a true democratic society could evolve. Describing the Israeli parliamentary institution as one of the most well developed in the world, the president said those Kenyan members of parliament with him will no doubt learn from the Israeli practice of parliamentary democracy. President Moi said that Kenya had benefited immensely from the business activities of the Jewish people and companies, particularly in civil engineering and trade. He hoped his visit will consolidate those ties for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries. And on the situation in this region, President Moi told the Israeli parliamentarians that today Kenya hosts the seventh largest refugee population in the world mainly from Somalia. He added that apart from being a strain on Kenya's limited resources there was also serious insecurity in many parts of the country as some of the refugees carry with them sophisticated weapons as they flee their country into Kenya. The Israeli prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, said in a speech read on his behalf by the Israeli minister for foreign affairs, Mr. Shim'on Peres, that Kenya and Israel shared a common history of struggle to liberate their peoples from oppression. Mr. Rabin praised Kenya for the role it had played in support of Israel in many issues that are of interest to the country. The Knesset session was also addressed by the leader of the opposition in parliament who is also the chairman of the Likud party Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu. [passage omitted] Other reports say that President Moi this evening held discussions with the leader of the opposition in Israel, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, at the King David Hotel.
