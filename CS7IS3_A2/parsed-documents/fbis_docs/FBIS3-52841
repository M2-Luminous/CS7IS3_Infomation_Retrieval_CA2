While the world looks to this summit and its outcome with hope and confidence, only Israel seems to hope that the Geneva summit will not achieve any results that might advance the peace process. Israel, which was forced to join the peace process under international pressure and did so with the hope of disrupting it from within, does not wish the summit success because such success will undoubtedly reflect positively on the peace process and give a strong push toward the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. It is only natural to expect that Israel might do anything in order to confuse the picture and sabotage the expected results of the summit in advance. The Tel Aviv rulers, who tried to delude the world into believing, after the Gaza-Jericho agreement, that peace has been established in the Middle East, are only seeking to strike separate and partial deals and avoid a comprehensive solution as stipulated by the initiative undertaken by the two cosponsors and on whose basis the Madrid conference was held. Israel's adherence to partial solutions, its continued occupation of Arab territories, and its establishment of settlements on these territories are considered obstacles hampering the peace process and preventing any progress in talks. The international community, led by the American sponsor, stressed the need to find a comprehensive solution and noted that settlements are an obstacle to peace. It also welcomed Syria's position and the paper it presented during the sixth round of Washington's bilateral talks, considering it an objective paper based on the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. Nevertheless, Israel stood against the resolutions of international legitimacy and evaded the Madrid formula and work for a comprehensive solution. It publicly states that it will not withdraw from the Arab territories it occupies and that it is ready for a withdrawal in the Golan and not from the Golan. All this clearly indicates that Israel is not serious in its quest for peace. One who wants peace should unequivocally announce his readiness to restore rights to their owners and to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. It is neither reasonable nor logical for Israel to ask for land and peace together because no one in the world would approve of this. Syria and the Arabs are not ready to cede an inch of the occupied Syrian Golan or any usurped Arab right. There is no doubt that the U.S. Administration is fully aware of the Syrian position, which is based on the principles of history, geography, right, and justice. U.S. President Bill Clinton may have something new to energize the peace process on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace. Syria is ready to listen to the ideas of the U.S. President and his convictions, but not on the basis of ceding what we struggle for and believe in. The anticipated Syrian- American summit is an historic opportunity to advance the peace process. Upon his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, President Clinton will be reassured about Syria's desire for a just and comprehensive peace to which the region's peoples aspire. He will also make sure of the Syrian desire to open all avenues leading to this peace. What remains to be seen is the actions of the U.S. Administration, which declared itself a fair and honest partner in the peace process, toward the party that placed hurdles and set ambushes along the path of peace. Only then can one talk about a new and serious trend toward establishing the aspired peace in the Middle East.
