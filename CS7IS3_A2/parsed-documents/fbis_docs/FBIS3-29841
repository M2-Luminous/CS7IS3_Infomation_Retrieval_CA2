But Yutaka Kume, chairman of the association, said the industry has no plan to introduce "objective criteria," which the U.S. has been demanding. Kume said some auto companies in Japan can provide figures each year for auto parts purchases, but they should not announce how much they will buy in the future as it will be regarded by the U.S. as a "promise." Kume made the remarks at a press conference in Tokyo concerning the failure in the bilateral economic "framework" trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Autos and auto parts are one of three priority areas of the talks. As for marketing of imported cars in Japan, Kume said the Japanese industry should launch a public relations project concerning Japan's auto sales "to make the U.S. understand that Japanese automakers don't control dealers."
