This is a consequence of the success achieved by Indonesia during the first 25-year long-term development master plan. We agree with the PPP chairman's claim that the people's increasing maturity in political affairs has led them to demand for greater democracy and further encourage them to fight for their rights and to protect their interests. These are the products of the political development that has been continuously implemented by the new order government. Likewise, the fact that the people have higher aspirations and are becoming more critical is inseparable from the development progress. Many highly intellectual younger Indonesians, who have been educated overseas, and their counterparts, who have been growing up under the new order government over the last 25 years, did not face the rebellion by the G-30-S/PKI [30 September Movement/Indonesian Communist Party] at all. They did not experience the struggle for national independence and the physical revolution from 1945 to the 1950's. They only know about these facts through reading material. This means that even the current young generation, who are under 25 years old, was not born yet when the country was struggling for independence. They too are ignorant of the G-30-S/PKI uprising in 1965. In view of this, we can expect the Indonesian young generation, who returned to their homeland after completing their studies overseas, and other youths growing up during the new order's development program and those who were born after the G-30-S/PKI uprising to have a dynamism, aspirations, and visions that are different from those of the pre-G-30-S/PKI uprising generation. Basically, we can understand that it is difficult for the youths, who are currently below 25 years old, to understand why the government still fears danger from the leftist and rightist extremists in the country. We are highlighting these reasons to reaffirm Metareum's statement on the current need for greater political openess and greater democracy. Relatively speaking, when our current young generation becomes more daring and expresses their ideas and criticisms against government officials, this should be accepted as something normal and as the outcome of the development achievements in various fields. In this case, the dynamism, aspirations, and visions that are spreading now would, perhaps, be different from those of the older generation. This in turn should be considered fair, frank, and constructive. It is hoped that our government officials can be more accomodating of the dynamism and development of political awareness in the country. They should be tactful in promoting openess by holding dialogues with the people without over-emphasizing approaches to national security. [passage omitted] There is a possibility that the selection of the PPP leadership is based on the figures' political affiliations, rather than on true qualifications. Factional differences, however, could bridge together by considering the cadreization system implemented by the figures running in the party election. Even though we are a little late in sending our greetings to the PPP on the occassion of its 21st anniversary, we hope that the PPP will always be one of our successful socio-political forces and is able to implement development programs as desired by the new order government.
