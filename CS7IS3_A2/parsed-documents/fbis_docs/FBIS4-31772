Meciar's people pay visits to Slovak Social Democratic Party Democratic (SDSS) [as received] leaders and try to create an impression among the general public that the Green Party is also breaking down because its leadership has entered into a coalition with the SDL, Weiss says, adding that these are "rumours." The isolation of Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and not only internationally but currently also on the internal political scene is growing, Weiss says. "HZDS leader has done everything in human strength to insult the other politicians, other political parties. He has interfered in their internal affairs and has thus broken down the basis for serious cooperation," Weiss says. "Our problem is not our relation towards the HZDS and least so towards the person of the HZDS chairman but rather our relationship with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), Weiss says. He stressed that the KDH unlike the HZDS is a transparent partner with whom the SDL has managed to come to an agreement on fundamental principles such as respecting democratic principles, the stability of the constitutional system and further steps in the economic reform process. "We do not cherish illusions about the KDH since it is a right-orientated party while we are a left-wing one. But we both are capable of respecting each other and of complying with agreements," Weiss says.
