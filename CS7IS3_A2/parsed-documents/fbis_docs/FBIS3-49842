Thus, the mayor has decided to finalize work on the equestrian statue of King Matthias Corvinus in the center of the city by replacing the [Latin] inscription [on the pedestal] Mathias Rex with a new [Romanian] one, Matei Corvinul. According to reliable sources, Funar regards the old inscription as a compromise solution arrived at by the communists and Horthysts [Hungarian fascists during World War II], and, therefore, it has to be eliminated right away so that it will not overshadow the great festivities to celebrate the anniversary of the 1859 Union [of Wallachia with Moldavia] that are to take place in Cluj on 24 January. It should be noted that, on 6 December 1992, the measure [taken by Funar] to modify the equestrian statue of King Matthias [by adding a plaque belittling the personality of the king and hoisting the national colors all around the statute] triggered off unprecedented protests on behalf of the ethnic Hungarians living in the city.
