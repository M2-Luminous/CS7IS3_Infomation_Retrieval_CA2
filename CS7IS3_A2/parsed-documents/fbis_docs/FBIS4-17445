It said the delegation, headed by Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian Pan-National Union, planned to make a report on the situation in the war zone to the Russian parliament. Baburin said in Baku on Saturday that he did not support Russia's official position on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. He said the aggressor was easy to identify, "must be curbed" and leave the occupied lands. "The side which has seized the lands is the aggressor," he said, meaning Armenia, at a meeting with representatives of Azerbaijan's Russian-speaking community, who said both the Azerbaijani government and the country's society at large were friendly towards them. But they accused Moscow of pursuing a pro-Armenian policy, which, they complained, cast a shadow on that friendliness. Baburin plans to return to Moscow on Monday.
