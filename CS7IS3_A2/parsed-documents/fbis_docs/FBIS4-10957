Pernia] [Text] Ministry of Finance adviser Jose Igancio Moreno Leon said yesterday that 3 percent of the revenues from the new taxes will be devoted to financing a new autonomous tax collection agency, with the aim of curbing the serious tax evasion problem, since with current taxes the treasury could obtain double the resources if a "new tax consciousness" is created. Moreno Leon participated in a conversation, organized by the Central Information Office, with the economic editors of the different media outlets in order to explain the basic lines of the economic policy of President Caldera's administration. The official pointed out that the center of the growth strategy is achieving a voluntary consensus agreement in which all sectors would agree on establishing voluntary controls on prices, the exchange rate, and business profit margins. This agreement includes changing the system of workers' benefits to adopt the Chilean model; that is, creating pension funds administered by their own financial system. This will permit the state to pay the 350-billion-bolivar debt it owes the Pension and Retirement Fund. "The idea is that the workers should have savings with good earnings, but without generating cash-flow problems for the companies due to the retroactive nature of the benefits," Moreno Leon explained. According to the government's financial adviser, the administration's major effort is focused on trying to reduce the 400-billion-bolivar deficit which is expected for this year as a result of overestimating oil income by 105 billion bolivars; oil prices were calculated at $15.50 per barrel and are now very unlikely to reach $12. This is the justification for the tax on bank transactions and the reform of the Income Tax Law. "We really are not creating new taxes, except in the case of the bank transactions, because the sales tax replaces the VAT [value-added tax]. However, by modernizing the management of spending, we will achieve that goal." According to what Moreno Leon said, tax administration is really in a bad way, since Venezuela is among the 10 countries with the lowest collection of taxes in the world, at the level of Uganda, due to the evasion associated with corruption. Thus, he stressed that the salaries of finance officials should be increased, the laws should be "ironclad" so that there would be no room for evasion, and those who do not pay taxes should be harshly punished with prison terms, "since that attitude is comparable to a crime against the public patrimony." He announced the creation of an Institute of Advanced Studies that will make it possible to train professional officials in tax management with a true awareness of the role they fulfill. The proposed modification of the Tax Code states, for example, that if a taxpayer is challenged and his guilt is shown, he should serve a prison term and pay the tax, a fine, and additional interest for the delay. On this point, Moreno denounced as unheard of the decision of the National Racetrack Institute executives not to turn over to the treasury more than 3 billion bolivars resulting from a tax on bettors' winnings, "in order to continue to finance their administration which has been inefficient and possibly corrupt." With respect to the position of COPEI [Social Christian Party] on the Special Powers Law proposed by AD [Democratic Action], on not authorizing the approval by the executive branch of the income tax reform due to the elimination of exemptions, Moreno Leon replied that meetings have been held to explain the matter to the COPEI technical experts. "I have arguments to show that the elimination of the exemptions is just, because those who benefitted from that indiscriminate system were the large taxpayers and not the small ones. That is why we have set a minimum exoneration limit of up to 750,000 bolivars in income," Moreno Leon explained. In sum, the government's aim is to lower inflation to 30 percent, and this would bring a reduction in the interest rates and stabilization of the exchange rate, based on a general agreement that would not be like the Mexican one, imposed by one party, but would come from the necessary consensus of everyone in the face of the crisis, one would hope.
