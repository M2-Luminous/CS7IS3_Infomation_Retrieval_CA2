SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As part of the on-going regulatory review of its rules and guides, the Commission on May 6, 1994 published requests for public comments concerning three related sets of regulations: (1) Rules and Regulations under the Wool Products Labeling Act, (2) Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling Act, and (3) Rules and Regulations under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. The comments were to be accepted until June 6, 1994. The Commission has received letters seeking extension of these comment periods from the American Textile Manufacturers Institute and the National Knitwear & Sportswear Association. Both trade associations represent large numbers of interested members subject to the marking requirements of the Textile, Wool, and Fur Acts. In addition to these formal requests for extension, Commission staff has been contacted by other trade associations, individual companies, and interested entities who intend to comment or would like to comment and have stated that, because of the widespread coverage and complexity of these regulations, the comment periods should be extended. To allow all interested persons the opportunity to supply information to the Commission, the Commission hereby extends the period within which to comment on its Rules and Regulations under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act until September 6, 1994.
