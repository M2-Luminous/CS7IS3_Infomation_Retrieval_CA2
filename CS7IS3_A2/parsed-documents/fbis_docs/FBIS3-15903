[Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Anatoliy Maksymovych, what can you say about the foreign policy results of the visit to the United States by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk? [Zlenko] Summing up this visit, I would like to say first of all that in general a positive atmosphere preceded this visit. This positive atmosphere was created by the signing of the trilateral statement on 14 January between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia. Naturally, to a certain extent this too affected both the course of the visit itself and the results of this visit. However, if one is to speak about the main foreign policy results of this visit, then it seems to me that, first of all this visit made it possible to convince ourselves that a noticeable change has occurred in Ukrainian-U.S. relations, a change in relations on the part of the United States toward Ukraine being a friendly state, one capable of playing a stabilizing role in the region -- I would even say that according to some publications of the U.S. press, a state that could play a significant role at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. I would like to say that one may view as another main result of this visit the fact that the United States unambiguously stated its support for Ukraine's political and economic independence. The violation of this, say, important principle of support, as was said, could affect the strategic balance of the dislocation of forces in Europe. This visit and its outcome, its important or significant political results, were reached not at the expense of and not to the detriment of any state. [end recording]
