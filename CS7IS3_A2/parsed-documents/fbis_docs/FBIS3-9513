The festive occasion was opened by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase, who emphasized the fact that our countries have a long joint history and today they have found each other again in [words indistinct] turning it into a joint source of further development. Nastase also said that the visit to Romania of the head of the Turkish state and of the delegation he is heading has a special significance both for the two countries and for our neighbors. In his speech Turkish President Suleyman Demirel recognized the road left behind by our country after December 1989 on its way to pluralist democracy and market economy, a road which, as is only natural, is also full of obstacles; to overcome them one needs determination, patience, understanding, effort and time, Demirel said. Talking about the evolution of cooperative relations between Romania and Turkey, Demirel said that it is characterized by mutual respect, the will to know each other better and increase efforts to further cooperation, and the sentiment of solidarity in difficult moments. In that context he mentioned the fact that Turkey currently ranks sixth in Romania's total trade dealings, and in fourth place in relation to the number of foreign companies investing in our country. Reviewing the principal events in current international affairs, the head of the Turkish state noted that the peace process budding in the Middle East represents a hope that will influence the future of the entire area, after which he asserted that in the southern parts of Turkey there are possibilities for new cooperation. Concerning the transformation currently occurring in the central and eastern parts of Europe, Demirel pointed out that the projected Partnership for Peace ensures the security and stability of Europe and adjacent areas, adding that his country learned with satisfaction about the fact that Romania was the first state to sign that accord. On relations in the Balkans, the Turkish president said that some of the countries in that region are facing difficulties created by their transition to democracy and a free market economy and by certain ethnic problems that cause tension among the countries in that area. After mentioning the fact that last week in Washington an accord was signed by Bosnian Muslims and Croatians, who decided to live together, Demirel appealed to the Serbs to join that process to contribute to the reestablishment of peace and cooperation on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. He also requested that the nations in the Balkans support this opportunity that has been created and ensure a growing hope for peace, so that it can spread throughout the region. In concluding his speech, referring again to our bilateral cooperation, the Turkish president pointed out that his country and Romania are two large countries in this area and they are developing their cooperation in a way that can be seen as an example for the entire region.
