I would like to point out that, for me, this signifies an appreciation of the remarkable course our country has taken since 1945. I also think this recognizes our political and social stability as well as the achievements of our country. I think this vote also appreciates Austria's role and implies an obligation for Austria regarding its historical relations with the countries of Central and East Europe. Last but not least, it also shows that Austria is a valuable and natural partner for the EU. With today's vote, the nations of Europe that are members of the EU have invited the Austrian people to contribute their share as partners in a peaceful future. I am convinced that the Austrian people will give a positive answer on 12 June.
