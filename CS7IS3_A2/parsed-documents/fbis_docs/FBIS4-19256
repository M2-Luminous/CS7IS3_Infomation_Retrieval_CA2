During his meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and in the news conference held after the meeting, Butrus-Ghali said he does not have any regrets about it and that he will again request NATO air strikes in the former Yugoslav republic if the circumstances warrant it, as they seem to now. Over to our correspondent, Maria Jesus Castejon. [Castejon] Today in Madrid the UN secretary general will start diplomatic moves to stop the serious deterioration of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When asked about Russia's criticism of NATO air strikes in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, Butrus-Ghali recalled that Moscow, as well as the other members of the [Security] Council, approved the use of force to defend the peacekeeping troops. Ghali stressed that that kind of action will be repeated if need be. [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording in English fading to Spanish translation] I want to confirm that we will not hesitate to ask for NATO air support as long as we have this mandate from the [UN Security] Council and as long as we believe that this could help the search for peace in former Yugoslavia. [end recording] [Castejon] The UN secretary general informed the Security Council about the bloody conflict in the central African country of Rwanda. Foreign Minister Javier Solana was very pessimistic, because he fears an escalation of the bloodbath over the next few hours. [Begin Solana recording] Consider for a moment that in a very few hours, very few hours, hundreds of thousands of deaths took place, hundreds of thousands of deaths, which means something absolutely terrible for any conscience of the least, the very least sensibility. [end recording] [Castejon] Solana said our country does not plan to send blue helmets to Rwanda. It is waiting for the Security Council to decide what to do with the 400 blue helmets already deployed, or whether it will send another peacekeeping force.
