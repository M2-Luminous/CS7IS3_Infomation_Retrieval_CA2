Now Russia will apparently join this prestigious organization, bringing together 32 states, at the very beginning of 1995. This was stated in Strasbourg by Miguel Martinez, president of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. Observers present at the Russian parliamentary elections deemed them "free and democratic." The holding of elections, together with the adoption of the new Constitution, removed any doubts and objections concerning Russia's admission. Moscow has signed a number of key agreements and conventions of the Council of Europe and has become actively involved in its activities. Full membership of the organization, Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko said at a Parliamentary Assembly session, will help improve Russian legislation and will provide powerful support in the building of democracy. It will give Russia access to European programs in the spheres of human rights, culture, education, information, and ecology. Finally, by joining the Council, V. Shumeyko stressed, our country will be able to participate effectively in the shaping of European policy in all these areas.
