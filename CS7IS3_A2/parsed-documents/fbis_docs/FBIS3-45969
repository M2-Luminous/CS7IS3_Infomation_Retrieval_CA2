Both sides described the meeting as "positive and constructive" and Qian said China hopes bilateral relations will continue to develop steadily. During the meeting, the French foreign minister said that "France is pleased to see that the two governments have resumed their traditional friendly relations by following the policies set by (former French President) General Charles de Gaulle in 1964." He said Qian's current visit to France demonstrates the normalization of relations between the two countries and that French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's forthcoming visit to China will be a major milestone in bilateral relations. The French prime minister is expected to arrive in China on January 27, marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French relations. Juppe also expressed satisfaction over the signing earlier this month of a joint Sino-French communique on promoting bilateral relations, saying that France will adhere to and implement the principles set out in the communique. He expressed the hope that French enterprises will be able to participate in the economic construction of China, and said the two countries should strengthen exchanges and cooperation in cultural, scientific-technological, and other fields. The Chinese foreign minister said the signing of the joint communique, and his meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand earlier in the day, show that a new page has been turned in bilateral relations after a difficult period. Qian said China agrees with the proposal that the foreign ministers of the two countries hold regular political consultations, and that his meeting with Juppe served as a good beginning to such consultations. The French prime minister's forthcoming visit to China will be a major event, and will help bring exchanges between the two countries to a new level. Foreign Minister Juppe also accepted Qian's invitation to visit China.
