The firm was involved in a deal whereby a decommissioned Russian submarine was exported to North Korea. Since the deal was revealed early this month, the ministry has suggested that the firm might have acted as a mediator to provide arms to North Korea. The submarine was sold by Russia to North Korea. NHK took this footage last May when a salvage operation was underway. [video shows Russian submarines -- including a worn-out "Golf II" class submarine -- being salvaged] Ruskiy Island in Vladivostok Bay is the graveyard for decommissioned ships from the Russian Fleet. The submarine in question was towed from the island to Najin, a port in the north of North Korea. THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States reported 40 submarines have been sold by Russia to North Korea through Japanese trading companies. The report has caused considerable concern since the international community increasingly suspects that North Korea is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. How was this recent deal concluded? It was a salvage company in Vladivostok which refloated the submarine and towed it to North Korea. (Boyko), managing director of the submarine salvage company, said they towed only one submarine to North Korea. Asked if this was disassembled, he said they salvaged it as it was. He added he heard the North Koreans would scrap the submarine. Admiral (Gromov), commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, has confirmed the deal. He said the Russian Defense Ministry entered into a direct business contract with a Japanese company. The trading company in Tokyo which arranged the submarine deal was set up three years ago. The company has four employees, and has a factory which is a joint venture with North Korea. About one year ago the company began buying up Russian locomotives and rails to sell as scrap iron. The company said the submarine deal this time was proposed by its North Korean partner last September, and it was asked to guarantee payment to Russia. The company said it had been asked by a Russian firm if it would buy submarines for scrap iron. This being the situation, the company said it believed the submarine deal had nothing to do with armaments. The president of the trading company said the submarines and warships are purchased for use as scrap iron. He said he does not understand why this has become such a big issue. If North Korea had intended to use it for military purposes, it could have made a direct request to Russia to sell a submarine. He said Russia would be willing to do this for the right price. NHK has learned more about this scrap iron business which involves four countries in the Far East -- over decommissioned submarines from the days of the arms race in the Cold War. Old submarines are purchased for $60 per ton (by the Japanese company). The submarines are dismantled and turned into scrap iron in North Korea. The scrap iron is then sold back to the Japanese trading company for $130 per ton, including labor costs and other expenses. The company then sells the scrap to China for around $170 a ton -- the international market price. The company makes a profit of $40 a ton, and North Korea obtains about $70 per ton in hard currency. The people involved said this was a straight-forward deal in scrap iron. Was it true of the submarine which was delivered to North Korea? The submarine in question was commissioned by the Russian Pacific Fleet in the 1960's, and was decommissioned six years ago. Russia says the old weapons and equipment were removed. Military commentator Kensuke Obata said the submarine has been underwater for more than five years, and, as such, should be almost impossible to put it back into use as a submarine. He said because it is made up of top quality iron, it could be a source of earning hard currency from third countries -- if the submarine is dismantled by cheap labor. Obata said this is the only way for the submarine to be of any value in his opinion. The collapse of the Soviet Union has forced North Korea to depend for its crude oil supply on China. Iron has become the only metal that can be exported to China in return. Labor is cheap in North Korea, and there is a large number of obsolete submarines in Russia. The economic boom in China has sharply increased the demand for iron there. The deal was made possible by the domestic situation in each of these three countries. Meanwhile, MITI's Export Division said it is now looking into the matter because it is possible the deal violated the Foreign Exchange Law and the Foreign Trade Control Law which prohibit mediation in arms deals.
