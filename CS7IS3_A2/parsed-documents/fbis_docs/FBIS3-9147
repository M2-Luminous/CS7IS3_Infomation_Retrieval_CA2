The OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy], ASO [Alternative Socialist Association], "Marxist Alternative," and "Road to Europe" groups expressed their views on the draft political document prepared by the Center for Strategic Analyses and Studies. Only the OSD presented its own program in written form. It will be disseminated in the same way as the draft document proposed by the "strategist Lilov." Lilov reprimanded those who unthinkingly reject the "Chinese model" of socialism. The BSP is a party of the poor, not of the destitute, he said. We are also defenders of the emerging "middle class," he added at the end of his speech. According to him, the transition in Bulgaria should take 20 years. First, he said, the country has to emerge from the grave economic and social crisis; second, it must adapt to the new "postindustrial" trends in the world. Today we are discussing a party document, not state policies, his opponent [OSD leader] Chavdar Kyuranov pointed out. According to the OSD social democrats, the BSP center's program rediscovered the ideas of Khrushchev, Ataturk, and Mao, and the document's philosophy ignored the problem of property ownership. According to them, Lilov deliberately used the word "failure" instead of "collapse" with reference to the fate of the societies of real socialism. An OSD expert told STANDART NEWS that he predicts that the BSP will tolerate the postcommunist thinking of its present strategist for another five years at the very most, adding that time alone will turn the Socialists into Social Democrats. The next plenum is to appoint a commission to work on all the draft versions of the party program and will also fix the date of the 41st BSP Congress.
