Paramilitary police and firemen went Tuesday to rescue survivors from the disaster, who were thought to be of West African origin, but the precise number and nationalities of the victims was not clear. Early in February, 67 illegal immigrants, mainly Ghanaians and Nigerians, died in their crowded cell at a paramilitary police base in Libreville, sparking an international protest and a Gabonese government enquiry. People from other West African countries are attracted by the relative prosperity of Gabon, which until last year had the highest income per head in the region. The minimum wage is still higher than in other countries. For clandestine travellers, the sea trip is the most perilous part of the journey. They travel in pirogues, generally owned by Nigerians, which can carry up to 80 people. The voyage from Nigeria to Gabon takes five or six days, with port calls in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where the ferrymen engage in more or less shady trading activities. It is not uncommon for the boats to be caught in storms and shipwrecks are frequent in the Gulf of Guinea. Already weakened by the journey and by the lack of food, according to some survivors, the hopeful immigrants sometimes find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers. One oft-used trick is deliberately to ground the pirogue on a bank not far offshore, where the ferrymen rob their charges of their luggage. Some of the passengers are themselves smugglers, carrying objects of value. Over the years, the growth of illegal immigration and smuggling has led to the founding of illegal ports, tucked away on isolated shores or islands, particularly in Equatorial Guinea.
