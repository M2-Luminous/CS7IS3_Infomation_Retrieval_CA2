FR941110-0-00099 FR941110-0-00016 However, the FFP reduction formula specified at section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act and at §488.170(c) of the proposed rule has certain limitations: it cannot be used to sanction a State when it has cited unfounded deficiencies or when its survey findings are appropriate but its survey scheduling, team composition or other practices are unacceptable. However, these survey defects are no less serious than a failure to identify deficiencies, and it is unlikely that the Congress intended for us to disregard them. HCFA does have the authority to provide for the training of survey teams in these instances. We are revising §488.320(b)(2) to provide that when the State's survey performance in Medicaid facilities is inadequate but the inadequacy is not accommodated by the FFP reduction formula, HCFA will provide for the training of State survey teams. In addition, HCFA has the authority to consider the Medicaid provider agreement to be invalid for failure to follow proper survey procedures, and may invoke the FFP disallowance provision at §442.30, Agreement as evidence of certification. We are unable to make the sanctions for inadequate survey performance parallel across facility type as commenters suggested. As discussed above, the Act does not permit us to eliminate FFP reduction as a sanction for inadequate survey performance in Medicaid facilities, and neither does it allow us to expand the application of this sanction to inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities. The conspicuous absence of Federal payment reduction in section 1819(g)(3)(C) of the Act, which lists sanctions for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, as opposed to the inclusion of FFP reduction in section 1919(g)(3)(C), which specifies sanctions for inadequate performance in Medicaid facilities, is a clear indication that the Congress intended to restrict Federal payment reduction for inadequate survey performance in Medicaid facilities alone. Likewise, section 1819(g)(3)(C) gives us the flexibility to devise our own sanctions for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, but no comparable authority exists in section 1919(g)(3)(C). Therefore, we must assume that the Congress did not intend for us to impose sanctions other than the two specified in the statute for inadequate survey performance in Medicaid facilities. Comment: One commenter asked that we convene a technical advisory group composed of State agency and HCFA regional office personnel to explore the possibility of a legislative amendment to the Act's FFP reduction requirement. Response: We do not see the necessity of requesting a legislative amendment, but will not discourage the States if they choose to pursue one. Comment: A question was asked regarding whether the reduction of FFP would be by audit exception or through a reduction in the amounts of future budget approvals. Response: Procedures for such actions will be written following existing procedures found in section 3165, ``Non-audit Medicaid Disallowances'', of the Regional Office Manual. As noted above, such procedures will be in accordance with section 1116 of the Act. Section 488.325␣Disclosure of Results of Surveys and Activities Comment: A few commenters suggested that §488.325(a)(1) be expanded to require that the scope and severity levels of all deficiencies, including those deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1, be recorded on and, therefore disclosable as part of, the official deficiency statement, in an effort to promote facility competition and quality. Some of these commenters argue that we must disclose notice of all deficiencies, regardless of scope and severity level, if we are to provide the public with a complete and accurate report of a facility's current compliance status. Some propose that another requirement be added under §488.325(a) to read: ``(9) The summary of 1&hyph;1 deficiencies.''
