"This means recognition for Dostam by the Afghans themselves and now all parties and forces inside Afghanistan are represented", the sources added. The delegation which represented parties opposed to President Rabbani continued to insist that it would be only after the resignation of President Rabbani that Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar also leave his office. Source said, "government seems determined to continue to keep borders closed as this will give it some leverage against the Afghans. The Afghan leaders must realise that they cannot keep on fighting and sending their women and children here. Now the foreign donors are not helping and Pakistan still has the refugees for the last thirteen years." The sources said that there have been repeated suggestions by the foreign office to the government to open up the borders. Meanwhile, the Afghan leaders discussed with the foreign office the different formulas they have to bring about a lasting ceasefire inside Afghanistan. Some of these steps include 1) resignations of the President and Prime Minister, 2) evacuation of all military groups from Kabul, 3) security of Kabul to be given to commanders of Kabul, 4) the leaders should meet to form an interim government, 5) the interim government should call a Shoora.
