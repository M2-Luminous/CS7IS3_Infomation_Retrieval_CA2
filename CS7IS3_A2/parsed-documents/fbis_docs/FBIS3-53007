On this occasion a second meeting between the opposition forces was scheduled in order to take a further step forward in their common action. This is probably why al-Qadhdhafi had him abducted." And why Mrs. Baha al-Amry, wife of Tripoli's former foreign minister and leader of the "Libyan Patriotic Alliance," who disappeared in Cairo on 10 December last, made this revelation. Al-Qadhdhafi was probably not wanting so much to hit al-Kikhya, with whom he had been in dialogue at a distance for some time, nor the opposition forces as a whole, who have never constituted a serious threat to his power, rather he was probably aiming to give a serious warning to Algeria not to get involved in Libya's domestic affairs. On its side, Algeria has taken the initiative in unifying the Libyan opposition in reaction to al-Qadhdhafi's support for the Algerian fundamentalists of the outlawed "Islamic Salvation Front." In short, al-Kikhya's abduction should be seen as part of the settlement of accounts between Libya and Algeria in what is a pretty critical phase for both regimes in power. It is significant that al-Kikhya, aged 63 and holder of an Algerian diplomatic passport, had obtained political asylum in France and had asked to be granted American citizenship as his wife, of Syrian origin, is a U.S. citizen. And now Mrs. al-Amry has written to President Clinton requesting that her husband be granted U.S. citizenship, in the hope that the seriousness and risks of a direct encounter with Washington will induce al-Qadhdhafi to take a softer approach. "Al-Qadhdhafi is behaving like someone who is desperate, he has been squeezed by sanctions, driven into a corner by the international community, and is reacting in an irrational manner, shouting as loud as he can to make himself heard, " Mrs. al-Amry commented. "It is true that there are no concrete proof that my husband has been abducted by al-Qadhdhafi," she said, with one eye on the masters of the house who are interested in maintaining a low profile on the matter so as not to jeopardize the jobs of one million Egyptian emigrants in Libya. But she added that al-Qadhdhafi's thesis that her husband's disappearance was due to "a settlement of accounts between two opposition groups" was improbable. "The opposition is not involved," Mrs. al-Amry cut us short, in particular as "after al-Kikhya's disappearance they are now all united as he would have wished." The other strange aspect of this intricate thriller story on the Nile relates to the personal relationships between al-Kikhya and al-Qadhdhafi. "My husband was in favor of dialogue with everyone, even with al-Qadhdhafi's emissaries," Mrs. al-Amry said, not hiding her own disapproval. "He placed conditions only on the repeated request to return and live in Libya." In particular al-Kikhya, in meetings in Paris with Ahmad Gheddaf Eddaru, al-Qadhdhafi's cousin and head of the civil service, and with others of the Libyan leader's emissaries, had placed four conditions: recognition of the opposition forces, their involvement in the management of power, the liberation of political detainees, and the introduction of a democratic system. "Obviously al-Qadhdhafi's reply was negative," Mrs. al-Amry maintained. "He cannot live with democracy." The proofs of al-Qadhdhafi's responsibility in this abduction are listed in a communique circulated in Cairo by the "Libyan Patriotic Alliance," led by al-Kikhya. First of all it reminds readers, and in particular the Egyptian authorities who are accused of not carrying out an adequate investigation, that a Libyan agent, whose mediation al-Kikhya had refused for contacting members of the regime, also disappeared from Cairo on 10 December and reappeared two days later at Benghazi's Tibesti hotel. Moreover, on 11 December, at 1130, three automobiles with Libyan diplomatic plates crossed the Al-Salum frontier post heading for Tobruk, without being subjected to any inspection. There is a strong suspicion that one of these automobiles contained al-Kikhya. Will he now come to the same end as Imam Moussa Al Sadr, the Lebanese Shiite religious dignitary, who disappeared mysteriously in Libya in August 1980? Then al-Qadhdhafi tried to unload the blame onto Italy, sending a look-alike of the imam to Rome who then disappeared without trace. "I will not give anyone any respite until I have my husband back," his wife assured us.
