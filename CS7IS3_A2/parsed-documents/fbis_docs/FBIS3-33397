During the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Commission, the Cuban diplomat gave the example of the exposure to radiation on unsuspecting subjects. Over a decade ago experiments were conducted on retarded individuals. This was only made known last month. Perez Novoa stressed that there are no guarantees that other human rights violations cases are kept quiet within the so-called freedom of speech of the United States. The UN Human Rights Commission has yet to vote on racism and xenophobia, increasing phenomenons in Europe.
