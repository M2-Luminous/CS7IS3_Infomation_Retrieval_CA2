Commission chairman Mr Justice D A Melamet said at a press conference in Pretoria the report also recommended that all allowances, other than car allowances, be abolished. Free housing would be given only to the president and the two executive deputy presidents and no other housing allowances would be allowed for any other grades. According to the report, "if any person occupies a state house, a market-related rental is to be paid to the state to cover such occupation". "The committee has worked on the premise that all elected membe ay income tax on their income as is the case with members of the public. It, however, believes and recommends that the right in relation to the pensions of an ex-state or ex-vice-president and their spouses should continue to exist and should not be taxed," Mr Justice Melamet said. The new state president will receive R575,000 [rand] (R409,000 after deductions) a year, and his deputies R500,000 (R338,247). The figures do not include allowances. Asked if the amount was in line with what President-elect Nelson Mandela had been preaching, that his salary would not be excessive, Mr Justice Melamet said Mr Mandela and the present cabinet had approved the salary scale. "In fact Mr Mandela was happy with the recommendations of the commission because he would be taxed and treated like any other member of the public," Mr Justice Melamet said. He said the scale was in line with that of international countries and his committee, which was made up of people from various sectors, was sure the scale was comparable with that of the private sector. According to Mr Justice Melamet the committee, in its recommendations, used a number of principles to provide a basis for remuneration in the parliamentary system. These included that the system should attract the best people available for parliamentary duty; encourage individual growth and participation in work teams and parliamentary committees; encourage parliamentary work as a career; and provide for transparency of the principles and pay involved. The committee recommended a grading structure of the various offices in the national legislature and for the new offices provided for in the Constitution Act of 1993. It recommended that all allowances where applicable, other than car allowances, be abolished and incorporated in the basic salary attributed to each post in the grading system. Parliamentarians, other than the state president and executive deputy president, are to be entitled to two free journeys a month for private use during a parliamentary session between their home base and back. Each incumbent is entitled to an allowance in respect of a private motor car (which can also be used for official purposes) of 20 per cent of the basic salary of the incumbent. The committee also recommended that a pension fund along the lines of those existing in the private sector be established for politicians and had made further recommendations on the envisaged pension dispensation. It was, however, pointed out that certain provisions of the 1993 Constitution had to be amended to enable the introduction of the pension arrangement recommended. According to the commission it was also noted that the present medical benefit scheme was operating successfully and, although the contributions were high, the benefits were generous. The committee recommended that the medical scheme be continued and made a number of recommendations for the consideration of the scheme's management committee to bring costs more in line with commercial schemes. According to Mr Justice Melamet, the commission has also drafted a bill for the establishment of a permanent commission on remuneration of representatives envisaged in sections of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa. "More specifically the bill deals with matters relating to the objects of the (permanent) commission, its constitution, remuneration, powers, duties and functions as well as meetings of the commission, the funding of its activities and the powers of the president," Mr Justice Melamet said.
