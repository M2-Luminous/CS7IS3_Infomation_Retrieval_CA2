As you know, Marshal Mobutu announced the dissolution of his own government, that of Faustin Birindwa, and summoned the members of the former National Assembly and of the High Council of the Republic on Wednesday [19 January], so that they can elect a new prime minister. The opposition has already announced that it regards this decision as a coup. Tshisekedi broke his silence today. He spoke to Monique Mas: [Begin recording] [Tshisekedi] The real reason behind the deadlock is that I was elected prime minister by the sovereign National Conference, whereas Mr. Mobutu does not know [as heard] this conference; he is going back to his own Constitution, and this is dictatorship. This is why cohabitation is impossible, because we do not have the same source of power. This is why there were negotiations, so that we could define a common framework of power. Cohabitation is necessary because the law makes provisions for it. But since this law does not exist as far as Mr. Mobutu is concerned, this is why we cannot cohabit. [Mas] During this long-lasting crisis, don't you have the feeling that the Zairean people may get tired of everyone, including the opposition and yourself? [Tshisekedi] Just the opposite. If you were here, you would know that the people are more determined. It is [political] circles -- certain political circles, especially those who supported Mr. Mobutu's dictatorship not too long ago -- who are saying such things, that people may get tired. People cannot get tired in their struggle for liberation. People are dealing with a dictator who enslaved them for years. They cannot get tired of struggling to break free from slavery. We have not chosen the [word indistinct] of arms, but we have chosen nonviolence, and this is also the price that has to be paid. [Mas] Very recently, the French Minister of Cooperation Mr. Roussin was saying that a third way between you, Mr. Tshisekedi, and the government of the parties close to the president, would be a solution for Zaire. What do you think of that? [Tshisekedi] Yes, but we have got used to the position of the French Government lately. So, we attribute to the French Government putting pressure on the Togolese prime minister to put him on the side of the dictator, because for them, they think that when you have a dictator, you should be loyal to him rather than put yourself on the side of the people. The Zairean people, (?and) we who are following all this maneuvering by the French Government, you can count on us: Mr. Roussin can speak, he has the right to speak like anyone else, but in this country we will ignore both Mr. Roussin and everything he says. [Mas] How do you imagine the immediate future of Zaire? How do you expect to act in the immediate future? [Tshisekedi] Next Wednesday, 19 January, is the day Mr. Mobutu intends to establish his new puppet government. We have just called on all our people, both in Kinshasa and up country, to hold a ghost town day that day, to show him our opposition and our discontent, and we will also use a huge number of other strategies -- mass demonstrations, civil disobedience, and so on -- so that Mr. Mobutu will get involved, and we know that he will do so.
