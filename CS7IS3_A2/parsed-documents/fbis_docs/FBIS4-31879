This year has seen a rise in the number of trade licences, the paper says. Gregr's department, dealing with imports and exports of arms, processes licence applications which are required for each individual deal. The ministry issued 258 licences in 1993 for exports valued at $167 million and 108 licences for imports worth $42 million involving 52 trading partners from across the world. Thirty five Czech companies trade arms at present. Almost three-quarters of the trade last year were made up of aircraft, including spare parts, and one-tenth of the total was made up by surplus army vehicles. Guns accounted for about three percent of the trade, with pistols for the Turkish police being the largest single delivery. Imports consisted largely of spare parts, while special small arms for the Interior Ministry were also an important purchase. This year the ministry has issued more licences than in the same period a year ago but this is no indication of a growing volume of trade since some of the deals may fall through. But expectations are that export will grow this year with aircraft, aircraft spare parts and surplus army vehicles remaining the main contributors. Licencing is subject to approval by the Foreign Ministry.
