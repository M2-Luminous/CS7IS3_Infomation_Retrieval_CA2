Subpart F_Testing Requirements for Registration §79.50 Definitions. The definitions listed in this section apply only to subpart F of this part. Additive/base fuel mixture means the mixture resulting when a fuel additive is added in specified proportion to the base fuel of the fuel family to which the additive belongs. Aerosol additive means a chemical mixture in aerosol form generally used as a motor vehicle engine starting aid or carburetor cleaner and not recommended to be placed in the fuel tank. Aftermarket fuel additive means a product which is added by the end-user directly to fuel in a motor vehicle or engine to modify the performance or other characteristics of the fuel, the engine, or its emissions. Atypical element means any chemical element found in a fuel or additive product which is not allowed in the baseline category of the associated fuel family, and an ``atypical fuel or fuel additive'' is a product which contains such an atypical element. Base fuel means a generic fuel formulated from a set of specifications to be representative of a particular fuel family. Basic emissions means the total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates occurring in motor vehicle or engine emissions. Bulk fuel additive means a product which is added to fuel at the refinery as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery but before the fuel is purchased for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. Emission characterization means the determination of the chemical composition of emissions. Emission generation means the operation of a vehicle or engine or the vaporization of a fuel or additive/fuel mixture under controlled conditions for the purpose of creating emissions to be used for testing purposes. Emission sampling means the removal of a fraction of collected emissions for testing purposes. Emission speciation means the analysis of vehicle or engine emissions to determine the individual chemical compounds which comprise those emissions. Engine Dynamometer Schedule (EDS) means the transient engine speed versus torque time sequence commonly used in heavy-duty engine evaluation. The EDS for heavy-duty diesel engines is specified in 40 CFR part 86, appendix I(f)(2).
