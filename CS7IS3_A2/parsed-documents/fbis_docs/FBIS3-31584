On the rare occasions when I participated alongside of you in certain events devoted to various historical commemorations, several earnest Romanian women called out to us: "Take care of our president, do not allow him to be overthrown by the opposition!" If you remember well, Mr. Iliescu, we took care of you as much as we could. We punished your unfair adversaries, massively supported you in your election campaign, and contributed our share to the country's stability. (...) Unfortunately, while we took good care of you, Mr. President, and ourselves became the targets of many arrows meant for you, you did not take too much care of the country, since if you had done, one would have been able to see some results after four years of experimentation. So far, in your opinion and the opinion of certain profiteers you have surrounded yourself with, everybody is guilty for the country's disaster, except you, who are clean as Snow White. Is is possible to show such a lack of responsibility? When you were dreaming, from the wings, to become Ceausescu's successor, what did you think that the tasks of a Romanian head of state are? To be photographed together with singer Michael Jackson, to partake in artistic happenings and drinking bouts in various Bucharest establishments, or to go to theater shows and attend musical soirees, where you could indulge in your own reveries? Do you not think that while you fall in musical ecstasies amidst the dressing gowns of famous ladies, we are all living through the last moments of the Titanic, which sank while the band was playing? Mr. President, the country is crying, in desperation the workers of Grivita Workshops are attacking the headquarters of the Ministry of Transport. The situation is as explosive as during the February 1933 strikes, let alone the strike wave that has hit the entire country -- and it would be a mistake to think that all these actions are politically motivated. (...) Mr. President, although you are a hydraulics and energy engineer by profession, I am sure you have heard of the great Roman orator Cato, who said, I quote: "The thieves who steal from individuals end up in chains, while those who thieve from the people live in wealth and splendor," end of quote. Aside from having done nothing in the past four years to curb corruption and thievery, you have now begun to openly take the side of certain proven criminals. What kind of hold do the likes of Petre Roman [president of the Democratic Party National Salvation Front], Niculae Spiroiu, and so forth have on you? As straightforward people, who clearly and openly state what they think, allow us to point out another sad story: Against the background of certain preconceived ideas of yours, which make you punish the Romanians, while embracing the minority members, certain appalling manifestations have acquired an ever greater scope, such as the conceitedness of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, the impertinence of Rabbi Moses Rosen and of other Jews who blame the Romanians for the Holocaust, and the magnitude of the Gypsy crime rate, all of which are making Romanians to feel like strangers in their own home, which is to feel uncertain, threatened, and blamed by these minority members, who are abusing our traditional humanity. At this dramatic time for the country, the Greater Romania Party [PRM] informs the electorate that it is suspending all negotiations begun with the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] on a possible participation in the government. We ask the government first to establish order in its own backyard, institute the rule of law, and dismiss and sue the thieves, after which we can talk again. We are not seeking public status and positions; we have been and remain a party of the many, simple, and poor people. (...) The country is on fire, Mr. Iliescu. Hard times are ahead of us all and so far you have given no indication that you can feel the true pulse of events. We think that a possible outbreak of popular despair would be much more ravaging than the December 1989 revolt, on whose wings you came to power. (...) Wake up, Mr. Iliescu, if not out of patriotism or pity for the many oppressed and dispossessed, then out of an instinct of preservation. We are not afraid of early elections, but why are those around you afraid of them? We conclude this letter by assuring you of our full regard for your real qualities and high position. We inform all Romanians who love their country that the National Bloc awaits them with open arms and the tricolor national flag in our hearts! The letter is signed by the entire PRM Steering Committee.
