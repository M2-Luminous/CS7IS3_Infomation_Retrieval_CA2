The contents of their statements are already known from the press. During a [5 February] meeting organized within the current electoral campaign by the Civic Alliance, an organization that supports, both in its political and cultural activity, the president of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, stated that one should distinguish between what is Romanian and what is Moldovan. Elaborating further on that idea, the leader of the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM], Dumitru Motpan, at an electoral meeting held in the locality of Cantemir, pleaded against the Republic of Moldova's union with Romania, suggesting that the union should rather be accomplished merely with a part of Romania, namely with Moldavia [Romania's north-eastern region, bordering the Republic of Moldova]. The two statements came as a surprise from many points of view. First, because since that republic has gained its independence, in August 1991, this has been the first time that the Chisinau leaders have categorically rejected unification with Romania. However, one cannot say that before there have been no signs warning of the anti-unification stance of these politicians, and, generally, the representatives of the state power in the Republic of Moldova. Those signals have actually intensified lately, parallel to the increasing pressure from Moscow, intended to resurrect the former USSR. Although the substantial economic, cultural, and moral support granted by Romania was entirely accepted, the Chisinau authorities were quite prudent, not to say awkward, in their public statements made when receiving the gifts. One could clearly see that both the president and the government were trying hard not to irritate Moscow by advocating too extensive ties with Romania. Even the "brotherly" meetings of Snegur and [Romanian President] Iliescu were treated with a certain distance by the Chisinau leaders. While the pro-presidential Romanian press commented with lyrical enthusiasm, offering full-page reports about the two presidents' bearhugs and kisses, the Chisinau press and television viewed the same events with much more coolness. This is how, lately, a kind of feeling was created, a quite embarrassing one for us, Romanians, that the open acknowledgment of our brotherhood is inconvenient for the people across the Prut River, and that the process of tightening Romania's ties with the Republic of Moldova is progressing owing to our insistence, rather than that of the Chisinau leaders. Nevertheless, this has been the first time that the union with Romania has been rejected publicly in such an imperative tone, and, especially, betraying an inexplicable anger against the Romanians living in Romania. Second, Snegur's and Motpan's statements are also shocking because they reproduce, almost word by word, the Soviet stance regarding the relations between Moldova and Romania. The thesis according to which a Moldovan nation does exist, and that, besides the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, it also comprises the people that live in Romania's Moldavia, was one of the theses that were most insisted upon by Moscow during the time of the Ceausescu regime. Moscow used it as an instrument not merely to discourage any tendencies favoring the unification, but also as means to exert political and military pressure [upon Romania]. Both the way in which it was formulated and its logic indicated that the official Soviet propaganda was using that thesis as a reason justifying a possible military attack against rebel Romania. Bucharest made great fuss about the statements of the two Moldovan leaders. Political leaders representing all colors expressed their indignation and engaged in fiery polemics with Snegur and Motpan. They referred to [shared] culture and history and they tried to find the real reasons behind the statements of the Moldovan politicians. According to certain opinions, we have to deal with two traitors who betrayed the Romanian cause and sold their souls to Moscow from the very beginning. According to others, the authors of the statements are heroes who are willing to play this anti-unification role precisely to safeguard the chances of unification, assuming the risk of being considered traitors. As with so many other complicated cases in history, we will probably learn much later about the real reasons behind the statements made in the Republic of Moldova. Until then, however, one thing remains certain. The statements in question were made under the circumstances of the electoral campaign in progress in the Republic of Moldova. Unfortunately, that is a detail that passed totally unnoticed by Romanian journalists and politicians. Had they discovered its importance, the reasons why Snegur and Motpan declared that they reject unification would have faded to a fact of secondary importance. Because what matters primarily is the fact that the statements were made for electoral purposes. As is well known, all electoral campaigns in political systems that allow for free ballots are dominated by the candidates' efforts to anticipate the frame of mind of the electorate. That is why all statements made during electoral campaigns have a specific character. Intended to gain as many electors as possible, they usually exaggerate the assumed expectations of the electorate. That is why many of the things stated during electoral campaigns are never implemented after the elections are over. Thus, the stance adopted by the two Chisinau leaders actually reflects the current public frame of mind in the Republic of Moldova. Obviously, if the great majority of the population would have favored unification with Romania, no one could have afforded to make statements clearly rejecting unification. Even the two politicians in question, even if they had been bitter enemies of unification, would not have merely avoided publicly rejecting it, but rather, they would have even pleaded in favor of unification. Even if that would have meant acting against their inner convictions, they would have still been compelled to do so to gain more votes. The fact that, at the peak of the electoral campaign, Snegur and Motpan insisted on distancing themselves from the cause of unification proves that, in reality, the current public mind in the Republic of Moldova is against the unification. Regardless of their private convictions regarding the reunion of the country, the two politicians considered it necessary to speak up against it in order to please the electorate. Actually this is the most grave significance of the statements made by Snegur and Motpan. In spite of the illusions nurtured in Bucharest, they come to demonstrate that the great majority of the population in the Republic of Moldova opposes the unification. Many people living on our side of the Prut River will probably be astonished by such a frame of mind in Bessarabia. Their astonishment is absolutely understandable. The issue of Bessarabia has been preoccupying the Romanians not only recently, but rather over the last several decades. Since 1944, when Bessarabia was lost again [to the benefit of USSR], none of the politicians or journalists has seriously examined the psychological and moral state of the Romanians living across the Prut River. During the communist regime, even in the Ceausescu era, it was impossible to publicly approach that issue. News about the state of mind of the Romanians over the Prut River could merely be conveyed to the Romanians living in Romania through underground channels. However, the use of that channel inevitably led to the creation of a false image. During the [Gheorghe] Gheorghiu-Dej era [late fifties, early sixties], that image was influenced by the Soviet occupation [of Romania]. Hating that occupation, the Romanians had the impression that the Russians prevented the Bessarabian Romanians from uniting with us. Whoever dared talk about the fact that Bessarabia is an ancient Romanian territory and that some day it might join the mother country was exposing himself to deadly danger. Under such circumstances, the fact that the discussion of the issue was prohibited led to the following reasoning: The Soviet occupation punishes the discourse on Bessarabia because the Romanians on the other bank of the Prut River want to unite with the mother country. That is absolutely false reasoning, because it ignores the specific nature of the communist dictatorship, namely that it always feels imperiled, even there where there is no peril whatsoever. Actually, their prohibiting all discussions on Bessarabia was not necessarily caused by the fact that Moscow considered this the sole way to prevent the unification of the Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova with the mother nation. During the Ceausescu era, the false image about the frame of mind of the Romanians across the Prut River was nourished, as paradoxical as it may seem, by the [Romanian] officials. Bucharest turned its conflict with Moscow into a substantial political capital. Therefore it was quite simple for it to hint at the fact that one of the reasons of that conflict was precisely the issue of Bessarabia. As a matter of fact, using the method of spreading misleading information, the Securitate made enormous efforts to convince the population that Nicolae Ceausescu would have liked to achieve the unification, but could not because of the existence of the Soviet power. It is no accident that after December 1989 the forces that feel nostalgic about Ceausescu began to circulate the thesis according to which the fall of the dictator was caused by the fact that, by the end of 1989, he had pointed the issue of Bessarabia at Gorbachev. Unfortunately, in spite of the past four years' climate favoring the freedom of opinion, the position of the Romanians across the Prut River could not be approached with sufficient lucidity either. Once a prohibited subject, the issue of Bessarabia has become the favorite issue of journalists and politicians. Under such circumstances, as a reaction to the preceding situation, it was absolutely normal that they would exaggerate certain facts in the Republic of Moldova. In that sense, it is more than significant that thousands of pages of minor lyrical writings have been dedicated to the brethren across the Prut River and to their impetuous struggle to reunite with the mother country. At the same time, the issue of Bessarabia has also become the object of intense political demagogy. The issue of unification has been used in every conceivable way by all our political parties. While doing so, no one seemed to care whether they really wish to unite with us. As in the preceding period, it was inferred that the Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova were impatiently looking forward to their unification with the mother country, but, alas, the realization of their dream was blocked by Moscow's imperial policy. However, a more lucid analysis would reveal clearly the fact that current reality in Moldova is much more bitter than the illusory things believed by Romanian public opinion and the image offered by our political and journalistic demagogy. As demonstrated by Snegur's and Motpan's recent statements made during the electoral campaign, the Romanians across the Prut River are not at all impatient to reunite with us. The causes of that frame of mind are complex and profound. Their exhaustive analysis would exceed 100 pages. That is why we will briefly mention just a few of them, hoping that the day will come when our journalists and politicians will approach the reality in the Republic of Moldova with much less sentimentality than they have until now. One of the causes is doubtlessly the frightening Russification process the Romanian population across the Prut River has been submitted to. That process did not confine itself, as might be thought, merely to a communist-type propaganda, pounding the people's heads, day in, day out, with ideas about the existence of a separate Moldovan nation and the Romanians having invaded their land. Russification was also carried out by using more subtle propaganda methods. Thus, using manifold channels, they nourished their sentiment of belonging to a superpower. As paradoxical as it may seem, over many years Russian imperial vanity did matter a great deal to many Romanians. The fact that the Red Army posed a threat to all of Europe and the Soviet Union was a superpower made them believe that they could be as proud of it as the Russians. After all, the Republic of Moldova was part of the superpower called the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Russification was also carried out by turning pro-Russian gestures into criteria for deciding on an individuals' political and professional ascent. It was enormously important, not just for one to become a boss, but also to be admitted to university, to be married to a Russian or to be able to speak Russian and know the Russian culture perfectly. In the beginning, the Romanians complied with these things with a certain duplicity. Little by little, however, they adopted, without really meaning to, many elements of Russian spirituality. Under such circumstances, in spite of the odes written and recited in Chisinau or the statements made by a handful of people belonging to the minority of intellectuals, many Romanians living in Bessarabia view Romanian spirituality, that is, actually their own spirituality, as something that is strange to them. They consider reunification with Romania not just as an act that is difficult to achieve politically, but also psychologically and intellectually. Normally, the statements made by the two personalities should have awakened us to reality. Unfortunately, as anyone can see from the stances adopted by our journalists and politicians, they did not manage to do so. Our illusions regarding the frame of mind of the Romanians in Bessarabia still persist. And this might have extremely grave consequences, even for the great cause of our reunification.
