The first type is the one being imposed on us by the evil enemies, which is still continuing due to a declared U.S. decision. The second type is an internal blockade being imposed on us by a handful of brazen, capricious, and parasitic retailers and illegal profiteers. Four years of external blockade have proven beyond any doubt that we can resist this type of blockade and confront it with more patience, unity, and creative, productive work. We have rejected every morsel, no matter how tasty, that has been dipped in the poison of humiliation and degradation. In fact, we have proven that we are stronger than the plan of starvation, impoverishment, and blockade despite its pressure and harshness. Since the pressure of the internal blockade is greater than that of the external blockade, we call for government intervention to protect us from these savage beasts that keep gnawing at our flesh, sucking our blood, and breaking our bones without so much as a batted eyelid or feeling any sense of remorse over national patriotism and responsibility. We are not being unfair to these illegal profiteers when we say that what they are doing complements the feverish U.S.-Zionist efforts against the freedom, dignity, unity, and will power of our people. It is sufficient to see the clear harmony between the hike in local prices and the reports being broadcast by the Voice of America and the BBC on the blockade. I cannot claim that I have an idea about the measures that should be taken by the government to protect the people from these greedy merchants, but it has become essential and urgent for the government to intervene in order to deter these merchants and put an end to their activities. We do not doubt for one single moment that its intervention will be the best means to block enemy wagers and evil designs.
