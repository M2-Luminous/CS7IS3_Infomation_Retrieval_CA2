Why is the United Nations committing itself here, of all countries, with a reconstruction plan totaling 6 billion schillings? [Akashi] Sarajevo was a symbol of coexistence between nations with different religions and ethnic backgrounds. This symbol was destroyed in the last two years with incredible pain. It is therefore of particular importance for Europe to reconstruct the city. [Szyszkowitz] The central point of the reconstruction plan is free access to the city. As long as the roads to Sarajevo are blocked by the Serbs, basic materials cannot be supplied. [Akashi] The traffic route from Metkovic on the coast to Sarajevo and Tuzla is improving constantly. It is not perfect, but there are certain successes. We must rebuild bridges and repair roads. If we show the people that peace pays off, they will eventually not wish to fight any more. They will exert pressure on their leaders to negotiate more seriously. [Szyszkowitz] Are the three warring parties not negotiating seriously enough? [Akashi] We will never achieve a solution if every side calls for peace on their terms. Everyone wants 100 percent. There must be compromises. [Szyszkowitz] Could you imagine that the Bosnian Serbs will return 20 percent of the conquered territory? [Akashi] That will be difficult, but I do not rule it out. The plan to divide the territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51 percent for the Muslim-Croat federation -- was developed in long, tough negotiations with the three parties. The UN delegates believe it is feasible. In the future, the negotiations will be on the quality of the territories rather than on percentages. [Szyszkowitz] In Mostar last week, Croat women stopped a UN relief convoy for Muslim refugees. Do you not think that the Muslim-Croat cooperation could fail in reality once again? [Akashi] Is there any federation that has been peaceful from the start? Think of the United States, Switzerland, Canada -- they are all federations. They were not perfect at the beginning. We must give the Muslims and Croats time to win confidence in one another. Do not be so pessimistic! [Szyszkowitz] Even if you are optimistic regarding the Muslim-Croat friendship -- could not this federation also lead to an escalation of war against the common enemy, the Serbs? [Akashi] You could interpret it this way. I hope, however, that this federation will be an element of peace in all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Szyszkowitz] Bosnian Government troops are currently fighting for the reconquest of territories. Will the political leadership be satisfied with 51 percent of the former state territory? [Akashi] One needs the spirit of concession and the feeling that every side will win more by making peace than by continuing the war. Of course, for small territories a war could be continued for another 100 years. However, the peoples' prosperity depends not only on the size of their countries. Germany and Japan are good examples of this. They were reduced by World War II and are now richer than they were before the war. [Szyszkowitz] Do you also have such philosophical debates with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic? [Akashi] I am very often philosophical -- with all parties. They cannot be convinced easily, but all these talks are useful. Do you like boxing fights? I watch them often on television. Then I tell myself that, granted, I cannot defeat my opponent, but I have staying power. In the twelfth round, it is not I who is exhausted, but my opponent. The same holds true for the negotiations. We must continue, even though there are no prompt, striking successes. The media only report on our defeats and setbacks. I already had such a critical world media in my last job in Cambodia. However, I won in the end. [Szyszkowitz] You were sharply criticized in the Balkans because you were allegedly too pro-Serb. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told me a few days ago that he will not speak with you any more. How do you negotiate in such a climate? [Akashi] We have all types of contacts. As you have seen in our news conference, I do speak with Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian representative on the Sarajevo committee. [Szyszkowitz] Mr. Muratovic apparently wanted to apologize to you for his government. [Akashi] Well, the mood has improved a bit. I am trying to do my best to remain unbiased. We will never be able to fully satisfy everyone. The warring parties must see the necessities to which we are subjected. Being an impartial international organization, we cannot become the fourth warring party. We must be above it. This is of course not always pleasant for the people concerned. Some weeks ago, the Serbs did not want to talk to us any more, because we called for NATO air raids for the liberation of Gorazde. Now we are having a similar problem with the Bosnian Government. [Szyszkowitz] The West Europeans are also threatening to strike and withdraw their UN soldiers. Granted, during the NATO defense ministers' spring meeting in Brussels last week, the participants corroborated their commitment. But France, which has threatened more vociferously than the others to withdraw its troops, is not present at these meetings. [Akashi] To a certain extent, I can understand that the French and other governments are frustrated and impatient. After all, we cannot stay in the former Yugoslavia for ever. There are 16 other UN operations, and we only have limited resources. If the parties to the conflict continue to be unwilling to make peace, we can only go. I hope the three sides see this.
