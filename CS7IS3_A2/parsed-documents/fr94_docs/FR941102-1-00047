Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830, pesticide petition (PP) 4F4387 on July 14, 1994, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the biological pesticide Pasteuria penetrans in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used as a nematicide in producing fruits and vegetables (other than vegetables whose roots or tubers are considered to be food items) in greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World. This petition is not associated with an application for pesticide registration. The establishment of this tolerance exemption would not relieve manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of this pesticide of any obligation they may have under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. Pasteuria penetrans is a naturally occurring soil microbe that is a parasite of species of the nematode genus Meloidogyne . Pasteuria penetrans reproduces by means of endospores which remain dormant in the soil until contacted by a migrating juvenile nematode. The spore attaches itself to the nematode and is carried by the nematode into a plant root. The endospore germinates and invades the body of the nematode where it eventually produces new endospores that are released into the soil following the death of the nematode and decomposition of root tissue. The infected nematodes do not produce eggs and therefore do not reproduce. The information submitted in support of this petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. Literature citations regarding the nature of this organism were considered adequate to support an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for the limited use of this biological pesticide. Additionally, since Pasteuria penetrans can only be grown in association with the host nematode, it is not possible to conduct standard toxicological tests with this organism. Pasteuria penetrans is not known to be pathogenic, infective, or toxic to humans. The specificity of the organism as a parasite only on nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne would make it extremely unlikely to infect any other unrelated organism. Pasteuria penetrans is a common inhabitant of soils in areas infested with nematodes, including the area of Florida where the organism will be used. The microorganism will only be applied to the soil in greenhouses, and use in this manner would result in its presence only in the soil and roots of plants grown in the greenhouses. The proposed exemption excludes plant roots which will be used for food purposes since the nematode and the associated parasite will be contained in the root portion of such plants. Since there are no data available regarding any possible effects from the consumption of elevated levels of either nematodes or their parasites, roots and tubers which may contain these organisms have been excluded from this exemption from tolerance requirements. Above-ground parts of plants harvested from treated soil would not be expected to contain levels of Pasteuria penetrans above that normally found in crops harvested under natural conditions and consumed on a daily basis. The information submitted is adequate to show that there are no forseeable human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the use of the product as a nematicide in connection with the production of fruits and vegetables in greenhouses. Although the submitted petition for an exemption from tolerance requirements for Pasteuria penetrans limited the use of the organism to greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World, the Agency believes that this limitation is overly restrictive. Based on the lack of any known hazards from the use of this organism in the manner described, the Agency has elected not to impose a geographic restriction for the use of this biological nematicide. Pasteuria penetrans is considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of the exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [PP 4F4387/P592]. All written comments filed in response to these petitions will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements, or establishing or raising food additive regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: October 14, 1994. Steven L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. In subpart D, by adding new ยง180.1135, to read as follows: ยง180.1135 Pasteuria penetrans; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. The biological nematicide Pasteuria penetrans is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on all raw agricultural commodities, except roots and tubers, when used as a nematicide in the production of fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.
