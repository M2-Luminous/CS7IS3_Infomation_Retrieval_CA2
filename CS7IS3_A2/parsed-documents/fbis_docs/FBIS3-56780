Yesterday parliamentarians and government officials expressed their opinion of that. The opposition, including Nodar Natadze, the leader of the National Front, considers Georgia's entrance to the rouble zone as a loss of independence. Vice-Premier Amiran Kadagishvili in his statement doubted that Russia would accept Georgia to the rouble zone. In the opinion of the Georgian Finance Minister David Jakobidze, the concurrent introduction of the Russian rouble and the Georgian coupon is necessary. In the interview to the SNARK reporter Nodar Djavakhishvili said that Russia proposes unacceptable terms. He is of the opinion that monetary and credit emission is to be cut down, the budget deficit should be minimal and crediting has to be stopped.
