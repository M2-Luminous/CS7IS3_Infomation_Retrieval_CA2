I have invited you to this meeting, President Berisha addressed Vollers, as a representative of the EU troika. We will send the same report to the Foreign Ministry of Belgium with the request that you inform the governments of the EU member countries as follows: Albania has the necessary documentation to prove that the Greek terrorist unit came from Greece and that after the crime -- the massacre in the recruits' barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme in the early hours of 10 April, which resulted in the killing of 33-year-old Captain Fatmir Shehu, born in Tepelene, and 20-year-old soldier Arsen Gjini, born in Seman, as well as the wounding of several other soldiers, three of whom are in serious condition -- turned back toward Greece in the direction of the Argjirohor border post. The Greek military uniforms that the criminals were wearing, the professionalism of the crime, and the objects that were found, which are all part of the special units' equipment, speak in favor of the argument that the Greek unit belongs to Greece's special units and is subject to special treatment. In its note dated 10 April addressed to the Greek Government -- in which the Greek Government is held responsible, since the terrorist unit came from Greece -- the Albanian Government asked the Greek Government to find and convict the culprits, as it may not be directly responsible for the event. However, from the press statements of the Greek Government, we have not only heard about its regret over the event, but we have learned that this responsibility of the Greek Government was interpreted as a contradiction of the Albanian note by the Athens government. As in the cases of the Greek warship firing on an Albanian motorboat in our territorial waters in Sarande Bay on 4 January 1994, the violation by the Greek minesweeper of our waters near the Qefal Cape on 10 March, the entrance on 12 March of two armed Greek soldiers in Vidohov, who threatened the Albanian citizens, or the murder of 20-year-old Alfred Muco by a Greek patrol on 21 March, Greece has followed the path of denying the facts and washing its hands of it by giving no official response. As revenge against the departure of the person appointed by Athens as a consul general in Gjirokaster, who was not only exerting indecent behavior that was incompatible with that of a diplomat but was also carrying out the duties of a consul without having the documentation [ekzakuature] accorded by the receiving country, which is in flagrant violation of Article 12 of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our consul in Athens but rather the first secretary of our embassy in Athens. Under these conditions, Albania does not intend to seek revenge by expelling Greek diplomats from Tirana. However, based on Article 11 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, which states that due to the lack of a clear agreement on the mission's staff, the receiving state can request that this staff be kept at a limit it considers reasonable by considering the circumstances and conditions that exist in this state and the needs of the mission in question, Albania therefore asks the Greek Government to take all measures so that within 10 days, it will have the same number of diplomats in Albania as Albania has in Athens -- that is, six diplomats. This number could also be defined on the basis of a bilateral agreement. Albania requests the EU Council of Ministers to ask Greece to provide an official response to this event. Albania is for dialogue, but it will not accept the meetings offered without having an official response by the Greek Government on this Greek terrorist act. Albania asks the EU Council of Ministers to set up a commission to verify all the aforementioned terrorist acts and expresses its readiness for full cooperation with this commission. We add that we have no objection to trust this duty to the existing commission of the EU monitors who are supervising our northeast border, but as the commission chairman for this six-month period is a Greek official, according to a known principle of the right, he cannot represent a party in the judgment. We also ask the EU Council of Ministers to demand from Greece to put an end to these acts condemned by the UN Charter and which fully violate the Maastricht principles, which Greece has committed to keep and develop. We want to assure it that Albania is determined to cooperate with the European Union and the member countries, the regional countries, and Greece, as well as all the other countries who are interested in decreasing tension and contributing to peace and stability in the region.
