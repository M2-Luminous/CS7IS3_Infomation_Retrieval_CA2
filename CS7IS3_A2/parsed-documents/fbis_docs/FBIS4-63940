He also predicted that even harsher language would be used at his meeting with the Russian speakers in Tallinn. The foreign minister told the listeners in the Slavic Culture Centre that Russia is developing a government programme for the aid and protection of the compatriots living abroad. A special commission will be formed, which could operate more efficiently than the Foreign Ministry with its diplomatic protocol. Kozyrev added that Russia is particularly interested in the pensioners' issue and problems of privatisation and enterprise. He declared that the border issues will not be discussed and demanded that all retired military, including former KGB and GRU intelligence officers, must receive social guarantees as well as automatic citizenship. Describing the situation in Estonia, Kozyrev commented that, speaking as a private individual rather than a diplomat, he would have to ask for the ladies to leave the hall.
