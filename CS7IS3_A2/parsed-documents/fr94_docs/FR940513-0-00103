FR940513-0-00103 FR940513-0-00029 4. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) 8 added a new Section 309(j) to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), 9 to permit the Commission to employ competitive bidding procedures to choose from among two or more mutually exclusive accepted applications for initial license. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this proceeding, we stated that ``the principal use of IVDS-allocated spectrum is reasonably likely to involve the licensee receiving compensation from subscribers for communications services,'' and therefore proposed to subject IVDS to competitive bidding. 10 Following our subsequent review of comments and reply comments, we concluded that IVDS should be subject to auctions. 11 In this Fourth Report and Order we have attempted to design IVDS auction rules and procedures that meet Congressional objectives. 12 We believe that these objectives are embodied in two basic Commission policy goals: promoting economic growth, and enhancing access to telecommunications service offerings for consumers, procedures, and new entrants. 13 8 Pub.

III. Competitive Bidding Design 5. As noted, we have determined that mutually exclusive IVDS applications are subject to auctions. We must, therefore, identify the methodology and procedure we will use to auction the licenses. We do so in the paragraphs below, pursuant to Section 309(j)(3) of the Communications Act and based on the record in this proceeding. 14 As described below, some further details about specific competitive bidding procedures will be provided later by Public Notice(s). 15 14 We received comments or reply comments on auctioning licenses in the IVDS from the following: American Group (American); Quentin L. Breen (Breen); Chase McNulty Group, Inc. (Chase); EON Corporation (EON) ( ex parte filings); Independent Cellular Consultants (ICC); Andrea L. Johnson (Johnson); Kingswood Associates (Kingswood); NYNEX Corporation (NYNEX); Radio Telecom and Technology, Inc. (RTT); Harry Stevens, Jr. (Stevens); and Richard L. Vega Group (RLV). Of these, five_American (reply comment at 23&hyph;25), Kingswood (reply comment at 23&hyph;25), NYNEX (comment at 11), Stevens (reply comment at 1), and RLV (comment at 11&hyph;14)_commented in this context only on whether IVDS should be subject to auctions, an issue we addressed in the Second Report and Order. See ¶3, supra. 15 The Public Notice(s) will be issued by either the Commission or the Private Radio Bureau. A. General Competitive Bidding Designs 6. The Second Report and Order established the criteria to be used in selecting the auction design method for each auctionable service. Generally, we concluded that awarding licenses to those parties that value them most highly will foster Congress' policy objectives. In this regard, we noted that because a bidder's ability to introduce valuable new services and to deploy them quickly, intensively, and efficiently increases the value of the license to that bidder, an auction design that awards licenses to those bidders who are willing to pay the highest bid tends to promote the development and rapid deployment of new services and the efficient and intensive use of the spectrum. 7. We concluded that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent (that is, either substitutes for, or complements to, each other) and their value is expected to be high, ``simultaneous multiple round'' auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals for competitive bidding. 16 We also noted that simultaneous multiple round bidding is more complex for bidders and may be administratively more expensive than other auction methods we may select, and indicated that we would use this design only in instances where the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is high relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction. 17 16 See Second Report and Order at ¶¶106&hyph;111. With this method, all licenses or classes of licenses are auctioned at once, using multiple rounds, and the bidding continues until bidding activity subsides. Thus, bidders may repeatedly ``top'' the previously high bids. See id . at ¶¶82, 86. 17 Id. at ¶111.
