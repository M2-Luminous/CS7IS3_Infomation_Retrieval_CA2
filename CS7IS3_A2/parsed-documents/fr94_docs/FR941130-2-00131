FR941130-2-00131 FR941130-2-00074 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice 2119] Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs; U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program: Request for Proposals for the Tropical Ecosystems Directorate The Tropical Ecosystems Directorate (TED) of the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program (U.S. MAB) announces a call for research and activity proposals addressing the theme of sustainable use of tropical forest resources. A total of $60,000 is available to support a small number of research and activity grants, in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 which will be awarded in the summer of 1995. Preference will be given to proposals which focus on the Tri-National Region of Belize, Guatemala, and/or Mexico and complement the core project activities of the TED. Persons interested in applying for these grants are encouraged to first obtain a copy of the TED core project, ``A Regional Approach for Sustainable Development and the Conservation of Natural Resources in the Maya Tri-National Region of Belize, Guatemala and Mexico,'' from the U.S. MAB Secretariat. Funding Objectives The U.S. MAB/TED small grant program is intended to directly foster cross-border cooperation, research, and exchange of information to promote the sustainable management of tropical forests in the Tri-National Region. Given limited available funding and the purpose of the program, U.S. MAB/TED places highest priority on activities that are bi- or tri-national in nature. In addition, U.S. MAB/TED funding can assist research teams and/or activity projects to: add a national researcher to their effort; better integrate conservation and sustainable development; add a particular discipline to an ongoing research project; explore the application of ongoing site-specific research to an additional site in the Maya Tri-National region; or carry out activities complementary to the TED project in the region. U.S. MAB/TED funding will not be provided for planning purposes. Focal Issues Within the broad thematic focus of sustainable use of tropical forest resources in the Maya Tri-National Region, U.S. MAB/TED encourages research projects and activities addressing focal issues such as community-based production systems, tropical forest management for timber and/or non-timber products, economic valuation and accounting of tropical forest products and services, benefits and costs of low impact uses such as ecotourism, or integration of biodiversity conservation with production forestry. Proposals which focus on other issues should be consistent with and complementary to the U.S. MAB/TED core project activities. Proposal Content Each proposal should have a title page, a one-page synopsis of the proponent's existing research project if any, a one-page synopsis of the proposed activities, and up to five pages detailing the proposed use of U.S. MAB/TED funds that would be complementary of the TED core program, and a one-page itemized budget including personnel, travel, operations, equipment/supplies, and justification. All sources of income for the project must be included in the budget. No funds are available for institutional overhead; only direct costs can be supported. Evaluation and Review Process A review panel of the U.S. MAB Tropical Ecosystems Directorate will evaluate the proposals based on the following criteria:
