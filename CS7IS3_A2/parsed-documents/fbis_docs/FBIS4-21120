The number of people using drugs (primarily youths) or entering the narcotics business is increasing. The directive "On the Program of Combating Drug Abuse and Illegal Circulation of Drugs in the Oblast for 1994-1997" issued by Vasyl Pavlyk, the president's representative in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, is intended to counter this vice. In particular, the program provides for the regular holding of prevention operations code-named "Poppy" and "Doping," which are designed to detect and stem channels through which drugs and psychotropic substances are entering illegal circulation. Considerable attention is being attached to procedures to prevent young people from getting involved with narcotics. In addition to awareness programs, it is also planned to ensure proper opportunities for young people to utilize their leisure time. The question of returning education and training facilities rented to private enterprises and organizations will be considered. It is also expected that the sore problem of isolating drug addicts will be resolved. A specialized facility will be established this year in Ivano-Frankovsk, and it will have separate wards for compulsory confinement of drug addicts and minors using drugs.
