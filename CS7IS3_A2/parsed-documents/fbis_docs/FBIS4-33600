This information was relayed to the Foreign Ministry by the Belgian diplomats in Havana. Regarding this event, Alfonso stated that the Cuban Government as well as the Belgian Government are in complete agreement regarding key principles in connection with this situation. He added that no negotiations per se are being conducted except talks on how to implement commonly accepted principles, and that everyone understands that this is an illegal action which has nothing to do with international laws. On the other hand, Alfonso pointed out that for the Belgian Government, which subscribes to a traditional policy, diplomatic asylum does not exist, in the sense that it is not recognized because this is a purely Latin American tradition. [Alfonso] "Everyone agrees, Cuba and Belgium, that this is no way to circumvent the normal requirements for emigrating from Cuba. The Cuban Government has reiterated several highly important issues. Cuba recognizes the inviolability of the Belgian Embassy in Havana. Cuba has international obligations that commit Cuba, on one hand, to ensure that that inviolability is not impaired. Once violated, however, the Cuban authorities have of course historically abstained -- you might remember, for example, the case of the Peruvian Embassy -- from taking any action to further impair the inviolability of that embassy that has been violated. This must be stressed to the people who entered it illegally, not by Cuban authorities. "The Cuban Government reiterates that this method of forcibly gaining entrance to an embassy cannot be a way to circumvent the normal emigration procedures available to every Cuban citizen." Alfonso also announced that the Cuban Government has extended the necessary resources, if required by the Belgian Embassy, in terms of health services. Regarding food needs, several possibilities have been proposed to solve the crisis that the Embassy is currently facing, with the cooperation of other embassies from the European Union. The Cuban Red Cross, a nongovernmental organization, has stated that this type of event is beyond their field of operations. The government had already extended the public health services that every Cuban citizen is entitled to, hwever. The Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that the Cuban Government has stated and reiterated that independent of the illegal character of the event, reprisals will not be taken against these people once they leave the Embassy. He added that if any of them has any prior charges pending with Cuban justice, a completely different issue, they will not be considered an aggravating element in the illegal entry to the Embassy. [Alfonso] "Everyone knows that independent of the basic illegality of this action, other illegalities have been committed. In other words, even if someone should see this as a diplomatic asylum issue, it is a fact that activities of a political nature from inside the Embassy are not permissible. Communiques have been released and disseminated in a completely startling manner to the media. You know that only authorized personnel enter and leave that Embassy. We know that political communiques drafted inside the Embassy have been disseminated abroad after these people entered the Embassy." Miguel Alfonso added that currently, two Belgian diplomats are in Havana to help Embassy personnel, given the altogether abnormal situation that has ensued, and that talks continue between the Belgian Foreign Ministry and Embassy and the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
