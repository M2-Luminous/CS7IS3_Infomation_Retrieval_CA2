He announced that the process of transformation of dinars into foreign currency in our financial institutions will be simplified very quickly. According to Professor Avramovic, the third phase of the program of economic stabilization, that is to say, the commencement of investments, could be expected in the fall. Exclusively for this newscast, the governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia also speaks about today's latest decisions of the Council of Governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia: [Begin recording] [Reporter Dusko Petrovic] Mr. Governor, today's session of the Council of the National Bank of Yugoslavia was brief and efficient. Several important decisions aimed at the revitalization of banks, the continued monitoring of the economy, and the preservation of the growth of economic activities, were passed. What were these decisions? [Avramovic] We have reduced the mandatory reserve that the banks have with the National Bank by a third, which will add to the credit potential of the banks and thus alleviate or perhaps even eliminate the shortage of funds that the economy has been experiencing in its efforts to increase production. One of the members of the council, Mr. Perucic from Beobanka, today reiterated how acute this shortage of cash was precisely because of this lucky circumstance, that is, the increase in production. We hope that we will overcome this shortage with the measures that have been taken last week and this week. If need be, we shall proceed further in the coming week. [Petrovic] Mr. Governor, please comment on the decision to form 10 coordinating groups for the recovery of the economy with the Serbian Government, whose initiator was Minister [without portfolio] Dragan Tomic? [Avramovic] Well, this is an extraordinary initiative. We have been thinking about it, but not in terms of such concentrated and extensive efforts that he had undertaken. We expect all the best from it as the key to our future recovery lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big companies. There could not have been a better initiative than the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care of the reanimation of production, the marketing of products, further investments, and the resolution of all problems that some of our companies face. [Petrovic] The Federal Government has recently released bonds with an 11 percent interest rate onto the financial market. You have assailed this measure as an attack on the program. [Avramovic] Yes. You know, we managed to agree with the banks to keep the basic interest rate down to 9 percent so that the economy would be able to obtain relatively cheap credits, I mean, these are not cheap credits anyway. The situation was particularly critical in agriculture. Then it came as a surprise that the Federal Government had appeared on the market with bonds of the highest value -- as the state bonds always are -- and with such a high interest rate. However, I have heard that they have suspended further emissions now. I hope that we will resolve all this in a satisfactory manner. [Petrovic] You were also resolute in your demands toward the Federal Government to release state commodities and corn as soon as possible. You have even said that the federal state will not get a single dinar in credits unless it does this. [Avramovic] Directly or indirectly -- through the federal, republican, and local authorities -- the state has huge stocks. All this will be spoiled if it is not put on the market as soon as possible. The first consequence of this would be a drop in prices, the second consequence a replenishment of the budget, and the third consequence the making of an economic space for the forthcoming harvest, which will be very good, as it seems. [Petrovic] Thank you very much. [Avramovic] Thank you. [end recording]
