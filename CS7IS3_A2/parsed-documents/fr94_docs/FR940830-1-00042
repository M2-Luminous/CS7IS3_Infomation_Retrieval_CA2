FR940830-1-00042 FR940830-1-00006 For the reasons set out in the preamble, we are proposing to amend subpart M of part 404 and subpart B of part 422 of 20 CFR chapter III as follows: PART 404_FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950&hyph;␣␣) 1. The authority citation for subpart M of part 404 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 205, 210, 218, and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405, 410, 418, and 1302; sec. 12110 of Public Law 99&hyph;272, 100 Stat. 287; sec. 9002 of Public Law 99&hyph;509, 100 Stat. 1970. 2. Section 404.1220 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (e) to read as follows: §404.1220 Identification numbers. (a) State and local government . When a State submits a modification to its agreement with the Secretary under section 218 of the Act, SSA will assign a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will inform the State of the special identification number(s) by sending a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD, ``Notice of Identifying Number,'' to the State. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA will send a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned. * * * * * (e) Use . For wages paid prior to 1987, the employer shall show the appropriate SSA-issued identifying number, including any coverage group or payroll record unit number, on records, reports, returns, and claims to report wages, adjustments, and contributions. PART 422_ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES 1. The authority citation for subpart B of part 422 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Secs, 205, 232, 1102, 1131, and 1143 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405, 432, 1302, 1320b&hyph;1, and 1320b&hyph;13. 2. Section 422.112 is revised to read as follows: §422.112 Employer identification numbers. (a) General . Most employers are required by §6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109) and by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)&hyph;1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) and to include it on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required to file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form SS&hyph;4, ``Application for Employer Identification Number,'' with the IRS. For the convenience of employers, Form SS&hyph;4 is available at all SSA and IRS offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents of the U.S. may be assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS&hyph;4.
