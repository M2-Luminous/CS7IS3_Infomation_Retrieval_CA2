Radovan Karadzic is offering to negotiate the demilitarization of Sarajevo. Jacques Merlino spoke to him this evening: [Karadzic] Yes, we plan, within the framework of the overall arrangement for finding peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular in Sarajevo, to place Sarajevo itself under the jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of 30 years. But only Sarajevo itself, because what is most important for us is to guarantee the security of the Serbian areas of the town so that they are not attacked, and also to avoid the kind of massacres which have already been suffered in other Serb-populated areas. We intend to do everything possible to ensure that peace is found first in Sarajevo and then throughout Bosnia. [Merlino] Do you accept the order to pull back your heavy artillery and to place it under UN control? [Karadzic] If peace comes to Sarajevo, Serbian artillery, just as Muslim artillery, will effectively be controlled by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at locations decided upon by UNPROFOR. Having said this, without signing an overall peace, it is impossible for us to completely withdraw our artillery. We are for peace but the Muslims are not. They want to continue the war, and we therefore need the guarantee that the Muslims will also withdraw their heavy weaponry.
