The amendments were adopted as a counterbalance to the value-added tax that comes into effect May 1. Experts suppose that the individual income tax will drop by an average of 7 to 8 lits, while annual budget receipts should decrease by around 100,000 lits. Smaller income taxes should compensate for the price-leap that is expected after the value-added tax is introduced. Prices are expected to jump by around 6 to 10 percent. The amended law provides not only for the reduction of the individual income tax, but also for a higher nontaxable income minimum. The amendments are temporary because a law on the general income tax has already been submitted to the parliament for consideration. The new tax will presumably come into effect next year. On Tuesday, the parliament also fully approved the law on excises. The lawmakers changed their earlier decision not to impose excises on coffee and electricity.
