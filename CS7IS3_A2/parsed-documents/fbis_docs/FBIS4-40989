Viktor Chernomyrdin Addresses World Gas Congress"] [Excerpt] Milan, 20 June -- [passage omitted] "Two-and-a-half years of reforms have not been wasted," the Russian premier stated. "I can say with complete confidence that the foundations of economic recovery have been laid and the first signs of changes for the better have already started to appear. We have achieved steady results through our moderately tough financial policy. The inflation rate has been halved, during the period February through May it held steady at 8-10 percent, and by the end of the year we have set ourselves the task of smoothly reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 percent a month." The head of the Russian Government announced that in 1995 the country will introduce a new tax system which will be clearer and more comprehensible to investors. "It is not impossible, however, that we will be able to achieve a significant easing of the tax burden in the second half of next year," V. Chernomyrdin said, "and right now we are preparing a package of decisions to attract foreign investments. In addition to easing the tax regime and the mechanisms for granting government guarantees, these also comprise a number of legislative acts regulating the procedures for concluding contracts on concessions and the division of output, and also acts designed to stimulate activity by foreign investors in 'free economic zones' on Russian territory."
