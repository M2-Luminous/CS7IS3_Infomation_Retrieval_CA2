Former left-wing presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora has said the opposition is willing to work with the ruling party to seek mechanisms that will lead to complete democracy. The deployment of the PNC [National Civilian Police], the concurrent demobilization of the National Police, and the transference of lands are points in the peace agreement that are still pending and should be resolved through a broad, national, concerted effort, Ruben Zamora has said during an interview for the "Up-to-Date" newscast. The former coalition candidate has said it is essential for the Calderon Sol administration to seek a concerted effort. [Begin Zamora recording] We are proposing a six-point agenda through which to achieve a concerted effort. I believe we must reach an agreement on the peace agreements or, rather, on the mechanisms to implement the peace agreements. [end recording] The politician has said other points in the agenda presented to the ARENA president-elect, are: constitutional amendments to the judicial system; electoral reform; alternatives for environmental protection; consumer protection; and a social pact that will ensure governability. [Begin Zamora recording] In order to succeed, the country needs a concerted effort, the most tangible proof of which is that the only way we could end the war was through a concerted effort. [end recording] Zamora has said the parties in the coalition will develop an opposition that will seek a concerted effort based on three points. [Begin Zamora recording] Supervision first; proposals and alternatives second; and a concerted effort fourth. This will be difficult, because these three roles are not homogeneous and can even be contradictory, but it must be done. [end recording] The former presidential candidate has said that as of this week all the political parties will begin their postelection reorganizations. According to Zamora, power struggles will develop within ARENA as well as in the left-wing parties, although he expressed assurance it is not a matter of engaging in political cannibalism.
