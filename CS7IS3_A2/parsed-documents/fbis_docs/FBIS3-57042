She was number two in the republic. But her unexpected decision last November to leave the "New Azerbaijan" party, whose chairman is Aliyev, and found her own, liberal democratic, party, was a sure sign of the divergence of positions among the president's inner circle. And this is the result -- Gadzhiyeva is on her way to New York, while parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliyev moves into second place in the republic's political hierarchy. Among the numerous contenders for the vacant post of secretary of state people are mentioning the names of Gasan Gasanov, the republic's current foreign minister, Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow, and Arif Ragimzad, adviser on territorial administration. Most observers are inclined to think that the president will settle on Gasanov as his choice and that the new secretary of state's sphere of activity will be limited to foreign policy. The Azerbaijani president has set about forming his team in earnest. "I did not have one when I returned to Baku," Aliyev admitted to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. "The first appointments were made merely with the aim of preventing a total collapse of leadership at local level. My aim is to attract capable and talented young people into governing the republic."
