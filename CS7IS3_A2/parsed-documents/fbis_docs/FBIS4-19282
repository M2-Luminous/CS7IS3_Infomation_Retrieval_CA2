Russia's deployment of troops in the Caucasus, particularly over the past three months, has made Ankara uneasy. Turkey has reportedly cautioned its allies several times about the presence of Russian troops in the region, who are violating the CFE limits on the presence of military units in the southern region. Officials who have been closely following Russia's efforts to revise the CFE limits in the southern region say that Russia's military buildup in the northern Caucasus and its moves to strengthen its military presence in Georgia and Armenia have caused concern. The officials said: "Russia's military presence in the Caucasus will significantly exceed the CFE limits if the present trend is allowed to continue." Meanwhile, Georgia and Armenia, who have allowed Russia to establish military bases on their territory, reportedly have been cautioned both bilaterally and multilaterally on the problems they may confront if their military presence exceeds the CFE limits. Stressing that Georgia and Armenia must view the presence of Russian forces on their territory within the framework of the CFE limits on their own military forces, the officials said: "That means that Georgia and Armenia will have to reduce their own military forces, which would have a negative impact on their independence and sovereignty."
