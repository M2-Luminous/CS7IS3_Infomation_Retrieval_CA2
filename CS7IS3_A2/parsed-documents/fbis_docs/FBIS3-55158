(3)"] [Excerpts] What Links "Celebrities" of Kaunas Mafia With Former and Current National Defense Ministry Leadership Last Tuesday [21 December], the Russian daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reported that in early summer, the KGB division in Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military helicopters MI-8MTB-1 had to be transferred to Lithuania through the Russian air company "Vityaz" and the Kaunas association "Selma." The newspaper claimed that the first two helicopters had to fly from Yaroslavl to Kaunas, where their "duplicates" with the same numbers were waiting. The latter would have flown to Kaliningrad in order to return later to Lithuania legally. The helicopters from Yaroslavl would have remained in Lithuania. According to the newspaper, the operation failed in the first stage, when its executors landed at the Vitebsk military airport for refueling. This big shady deal, as the Moscow newspaper reported, is linked with the Baltic Fleet leadership and other officials. V. Kravchenko, acting Russian Baltic Fleet commander, told a BNS correspondent that the results of the investigation proved that no one from the Baltic Fleet leadership or the fleet's air force command had any link with this deal. The fleet does not have any agreements with the Russian air company "Vityaz." In addition, Vice Admiral V. Kravchenko confirmed to BNS that the Baltic Fleet collaborates closely with the Kaunas association "Selma" which is building military housing in Kaliningrad Oblast. As V. Kravchenko stressed, however, "cooperation is conducted according to the program drafted by the Russian government." [passage omitted] The National Defense Ministry [KAM] bought two frigates from the Baltic Fleet through "Selma." V. Laurinavicius [the firm's president] received 417 million rubles [R] in cash for them. While law enforcement officials are investigating the circumstances of the origin of these and other contracts between KAM and "Selma," RESPUBLIKA is conducting its own investigation into this scandal. The ships which the KAM leadership chose (or which the Baltic Fleet leadership offered for sale) were assessed for the first time in July of last year in Liepaja. A preliminary agreement was reached with the Baltic Fleet command on the purchase of two torpedo boats, one hydrographic ship, and one vessel of another sort. Last summer, the meeting in Liepaja was attended by KAM commanders Lieutenants E. Miliauskas, V. Mockus, and R. Baltuska. An agreement was reached with the Baltic Fleet leadership and stated in a special document that one frigate will cost Lithuania R94 million. This price seemed acceptable to the Lithuanian Fleet commanders, because prices for used ships on the world market are higher. They felt happy that they had found a common language with the Baltic Fleet command. Shortly after this, about two weeks later, Lieutenant E. Miliauskas was called to the office of Commander E. Nazelskis, first deputy national defense minister. Arriving there, E. Miliauskas also found "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius. E. Nazelskis, who had previously received the document concluded in Liepaja with the prices of the ships, ordered E. Miliauskas to rewrite the first page bearing the prices. "I did this because I could not ignore my chief's order," said E. Miliauskas to RESPUBLIKA recalling those days. The KAM leaders began to persuade their subordinates immediately that inflation forced them to review the prices of ships. The subordinates found out later that the ministry was already paying R240 million instead of R94 million to "Selma." How? What does "Selma" have to do with this? There were no mediators in the Liepaja talks. An agreement on the sale of ships was reached. Was a mediator necessary to "launder" millions from the state's pocket? On 21 October 1992, while Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov and Minister A. Butkevicius were confirming the statement of transfer of the ships to Lithuania, a meeting was held in Kaliningrad, which was attended by R. Baltuska, commander of the coast guard unit, and the aforementioned V. Mockus and E. Miliauskas. They discussed with the Baltic Fleet leadership that the ships be sailed to the wharf in Klaipeda in 10 days. Apart from the three KAM officials, the talks were also attended by "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius and his companions. [passage omitted] Yesterday, we tried to talk to Mr. E. Nazelskis whom Prime Minister A. Slezevicius is sending for training to the Czech Republic. Sensing the topic of our conversation, E. Nazelskis categorically refused to speak with us. Who armed Lithuania's national defense and how? Why Minister A. Butkevicius, who comes from Kaunas, chose "Selma" and its convicted president as a partner in buying arms, ships, and helicopters? What links Commander E. Nazelskis with the leaders of the Kaunas Mafia?...
