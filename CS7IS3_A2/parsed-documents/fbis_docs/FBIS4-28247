The North Korean Foreign Ministry, in a statement condemning Tokyo's "hostile policy" toward pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan, reiterated that sanctions would be considered a declaration of war. The statement was reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY in a dispatch monitored in Tokyo. "If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past, should join force in any sanctions against us, we would regard it as a declaration of war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment for it," the statement said. The statement condemned Monday's mistaken police raid on the offices of the Kyoto chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) and a search of Chongryun offices in Osaka in April. It charged that Japanese authorities are "taking advantage of U.S. attempts to isolate and stifle our republic over the nuclear issue" in order to suppress Chongryun and Koreans in Japan. The statement also said Koreans "can hardly repress resentment" over the "immeasurable misfortunes and hardships" inflicted upon korea during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial period and that Japan "is still suppressing and persecuting Koreans in Japan." Kyoto police searched Chongryun offices and its affiliate school on the mistaken assumption that the group had failed to submit a report, required under the national land utilization law, on the intended use of land acquired in 1990 and 1991. City officials later discovered their oversight and apologized Tuesday. In April, Osaka police searched Chongryun offices after a melee erupted during a demonstration by a rival group of Korean residents demanding the release of political prisoners in North Korea. The protest was disrupted by men thought to be associated with Chongryun.
