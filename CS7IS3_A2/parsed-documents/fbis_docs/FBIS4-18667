The FRG Economics Ministry has announced that the processing industry experienced 0.3 percent growth. This is primarily due to production in the basic materials and producer goods industry, which was 4.3 percent. In contrast, the output of investment and consumer goods was lower than during the same period last year. The construction sector reported an increase of 3.3 percent. A two-month comparison between January-February 1994 and November-December 1993 also shows that the activities of the producing industry remained generally constant. There were, however, different developments of output in individual sectors: The construction sector reported an increase of 7.5 percent; the production volume in mining went up slightly by 0.5 percent. In contrast, the processing industry experienced an 0.5-percent decline in output. In February 1994, west German industrial output went up by 1 percent in real and seasonally adjusted terms. In this connection, it must be taken into account that the January result was revised downward by 1.5 index points. The February increase was supported by mining and the processing industry. The ministry accounts for the production decline in the construction sector of 7 percent compared with the previous month, primarily with reference to the extremely cold weather.
