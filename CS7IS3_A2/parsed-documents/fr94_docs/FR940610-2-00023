FR940610-2-00023 FR940610-2-00019 Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Grant to the American Statistical Association AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the American Statistical Association (ASA), Alexandria, Virginia, under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94EH89458. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award. The purpose of the proposed grant is to support a conference entitled, ``Eleventh Conference on Radiation and Health.'' This effort will have a total estimated cost of $92,000, which is currently allocated as follows: $0 (0.0%) from the ASA, $50,000 (54.4%) from the DOE, $20,000 (21.7%) from other Federal agencies, and $22,000 (23.9%) from non-Federal sources. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: Jeffrey R. Dulberg, HR&hyph;531.24, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed grant will provide funding to the ASA to organize and conduct its ``Eleventh Conference on Radiation and Health.'' The theme of the conference is ``Radiation Dosimetry and Risk Assessment.'' The conference is scheduled to be held from June 26 through July 1, 1994, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The conference is planned to be a forum for direct and efficient information transfer, both within the United States and internationally, among biostatisticians, health physicists, epidemiologists, public health researchers, the general public, and to governmental entities. The project will allow internationally recognized researchers to review and consider methods and information about radiation and health in a multidisciplinary approach. The primary benefit to be derived from this conference is to bring a broader and more complete understanding of state-of-the-art research to both established investigators and those new to the research area. It is hoped that from this understanding will come new research initiatives and collaborations and that new researchers will be recruited to the field. The requested DOE support will enhance the public benefit to be derived by expanding the ASA's current efforts to obtain the widest range of worldwide expertise for the conference. The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing an international forum for the dissemination of the latest information on radiation dosimetry and risk assessment. Issues related to human health effects and exposure to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation generate intense public concern. Some of these concerns include the risk of cancer in nuclear workers, the risk of disease in children due to parental exposure to radiation, and the risks associated to electric and magnetic fields (from power lines and everyday electric appliances). Nuclear workers, the public, and Federal, State, and local government officials constantly seek out information concerning cancer risk as it relates to nuclear energy and technology. The proposed conference will review current issues related to the potential health risks associated with these exposures. It is anticipated that there would be several significant scientific and technical advancements from such a meeting which would be shared not only with the participants but also with the scientific community and the interested public through publication of the proceedings. This information can be used by epidemiologists, health physicists, and other public health officials to estimate radiation exposure and potential health risks. As a supplement to other Federal assistance in the amount of $20,000 plus $22,000 in non-Federal funding, the $50,000 requested from the DOE will enhance the public benefit to be derived by expanding the ASA's current efforts to obtain the widest range of worldwide expertise for the conference. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity. Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the proposal represents a beneficial method and approach to publicly disseminate information on radiation dosimetry and risk assessment. Issued in Washington, DC, on June 2, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director, Headquarters Operations Division B, Office of Placement and Administration.
