He told reporters prior to his departure for Paris that he hoped that the conference would start a process "leading to greater understanding between the states in central and Eastern Europe, and also in their relation to the EU." Zieleniec said he did not expect any document to be signed in Paris, as the conference, he said, would rather be a political event. Zieleniec expressed satisfaction with all the texts prepared for the conference, as they now reflect consensus in France, the EU but also in the associated countries. The stability pact will not lead to the creation of new international institutions, but will start a process which will (naturally) become part of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) process, Zieleniec said.
