Chatterjee said on Thursday. Mr. Chatterjee told news persons that this would be the first experiment of partly using the indigenous fuel to operate the Tarapur Atomic Power Plant in view of the uncertainty about renewal of supply of enriched uranium from France under the India-U.S.- France tripartite agreement which ended in October. He said that to begin with, two bundles of mixed oxide fuel along uranium stock from the previous contract was over, would start using a mix of low-enriched uranium and MOX at the TAPS. Mr. Chatterjee said "We are [word as published] no fuel problem till the end of 2,000 AD." However, he said the options for procuring enriched uranium would continue to be explored. "We would buy it from whosoever was willing to give it to us," he said while asserting that "enriched uranium or no enriched uranium, we have to, and will run TAPS and have uninterrupted power generation." Mr. Chatterjee said the Atomic Energy Commission chairman had already said that India had the capacity to run the two units of TAPS project -- one indigenously -- and also had the capability to produce enriched uranium. Indian scientists had fully perfected the art of producing MOX and using it as a substitute to enriched uranium for operation TAPS. Mr. Chatterjee said TAPS would complete successful operation of 25 years on April 1, 1994 and enter into the 26th year. "We will run it for another 14 years." He said the safety assessment for renewal of operations had already been completed by SARRA [expansion unknown] after inspection.
