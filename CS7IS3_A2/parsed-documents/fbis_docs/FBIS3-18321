Material worth DM60 million, including, for example, a field hospital and communications equipment, can be used in the future, too, and has, thus, to be regarded as "long-term investment." This was stated by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. The budget funds used by the Bundeswehr in Somalia are an "investment in humanitarianism and the future of the Bundeswehr," the minister stressed. According to Ruehe, the mission of the German Armed Forces within the framework of the United Nations saved tens of thousands of people from sure starvation and illness. "The commitment of our soldiers was an act of humanitarianism, which, due to the special conditions in Somalia, could only have been provided by soldiers," Ruehe said. The funds used for it are "an investment in humanitarianism." The largest single amount (DM102 million) of the almost 10-month mission of a total of approximately 3,000 German blue helmets, which started in May 1993, went to transportation. Of that, a total of DM48.5 million was spent on civilian transport, above all charter flights. The military transports cost DM53.5 million. [passage omitted] According to a paper issued by the Defense Ministry, the United Nations already last year transferred DM13.4 million of the total refund of DM70 million.
