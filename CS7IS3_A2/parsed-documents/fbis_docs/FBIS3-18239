The Chinese economy may become the engine of the world economy in the next century. Flavio Cotti does not want to encourage a throng of small and medium-sized Swiss businesses to look for salvation in China, but Swiss companies should look into the matter. They still have time to hop aboard the "Chinese train," even if it has already gotten under way. On Friday [25 February], the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) addressed members of the Swiss-Chinese Economic Chamber who were holding their general meeting in Zurich. China is currently one of the three leading economic powers in the world. With $195.7 billion in direct foreign trade, it became the world's eleventh largest trading country in 1993. China is regionalizing its economy, the federal councillor continued. At the same time, the Chinese economy has become internationalized. The government intends to increase direct exports to $230 billion in the year 2000 and $700 billion in 2010. The OECD estimates that by 2030 the country will account for some 20 percent of world trade. Global Concept Bern is currently working on a global concept for its relations with China. This will primarily consist of lending increased political support to the activities of the private economy. Greater account will also have to be taken of the phenomenon of regionalization and regular links will have to be established with the provincial and local authorities in regions experiencing outright growth. Major efforts will have to be undertaken to make the Chinese market more accessible to Swiss firms. The information regarding this market should be updated, Flavio Cotti stressed. The idea of reactivating cooperation between existing bodies -- Swiss-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, OSEC [Swiss Office of Trade Expansion], etc. -- should also be considered. Accent on Southern China Swiss representations in China will be able to activate the support provided on site. The Hong Kong consulate general will be able to play a more active role in prospecting the southern market. Sixteen Swiss companies have already been installed in Shanghai, not including those in the region which manufacture light industrial products for export. The creation of a consulate general on site would be justified. Switzerland wants to work on protecting intellectual property in China, on reducing tariff barriers, and on eliminating non-tariff obstacles to trade. It also intends to promote China's rapid integration into GATT. It would also be desirable "that privileged relations between Swiss and Chinese authorities take root and prosper." Politically speaking, Bern wants to have more regular and in- depth talks with Beijing on "all" major issues of mutual interest. The head of the DFAE alluded to human rights, an issue which should be discussed in greater depth. Swiss investments made or planned in China total some 1.5 billion Swiss francs. Some 60 mergers already exist and some 70 businesses are directly present on the Chinese market.
