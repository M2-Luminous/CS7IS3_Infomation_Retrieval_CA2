EU officials said only 22 of 116 countries involved in the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks had submitted their final tariff-cutting offers, which were supposed to reach the GATT secretariat by February 15. Member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreed last December 15 on the principle of significant cuts in import tariffs under the Uruguay Round, which is due to be signed formally in Marrakesh on April 15. The GATT members were supposed to translate their general tariff-cutting commitments into detailed product-by-product reductions. The EU has done so but many other countries have not. The EU spokesman said: "Our offers are based on the condition that the offers of the other parties are not diminished from what was approved on December 15 in Geneva." EU officials say they are worried by Washington's apparent intention to reduce U.S. offers -- notably for utility vehicles, electronics and non-ferrous metals -- in reprisal against Japan's refusal to increase imports of U.S. goods. They have warned that the Union might reduce its own tariff offers if it is disadvantaged by any shrinking in cuts offered by other countries.
