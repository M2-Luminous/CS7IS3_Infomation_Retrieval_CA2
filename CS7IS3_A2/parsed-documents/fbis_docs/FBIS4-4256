This is one of the important strategic moves for readjusting Shandong's industrial product mix determined by the provincial technological transformation leading group. The 16 competitive products to be developed on a priority basis are motorcycles, vehicle parts, engineering machinery, microcomputers, telecommunications equipment, household electric appliances, garments, beverage, ceramics, numerical-controlled machine tools, electric cables, communications electric cables, medicines, radial tires, elevators, ships for special use, and petrochemical products. It is planned that 9.3 billion yuan will be invested in the technological transformation projects for cultivating and developing competitive products and that over 60 enterprises will undertake these projects. Upon completion, these projects may form a production capacity of 1 million motorcycles, spare parts for 300,000 cars, 10,000 engineering machines, 100,000 microcomputers, 200,000 fax machines, 1.5 million shirts, 3,000 numerical-controlled machine tools and some processing centers, and 20,000 sanitary wares. By that time, the largest antibiotics and febrifuge producing enterprise, the largest engineering machinery group, and the largest brewery and sanitary ceramic wares manufacturing plant of China will emerge in the vast land of Shandong. Because the production capacity of these products are mainly concentrated on key enterprises, the annual sales income of 15 enterprises producing these products will exceed 1 billion yuan and 11 will reach 500 million yuan. In order to successfully carry out the technological transformation items of these 16 competitive products, the provincial authorities have decided to attach prime importance to arranging for the development of technological items of competitive products while determining the province's 100 key transformation projects every year, give priority to making investments in this aspect, and regard some supporting projects as the major items of various cities and prefectures. At present, the relevant provincial departments are stepping up their efforts to formulate implementation plans and supporting preferential policies for developing competitive products. Thirty-eight items have been arranged in the province's 100 major technological transformation projects, and have been initiated.
