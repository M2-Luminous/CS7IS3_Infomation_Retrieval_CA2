A sober building bedecked with bright red bougainvilleas. This is the home of Shaykh Hasan al-Turaybi, general secretary of the Arab Islamic People's Conference. The man the Western chancelleries, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia accuse of "leading a veritable Islamic International from the Middle East to the Maghreb," led us into a drawing room with walls covered with verses from the Koran. His slender figure was wrapped in a wide white galabiyah, his bronzed face framed with a neatly trimmed gray beard, his head covered with a silky turban, his smile was dazzling and his eyes sparkling with intelligence. During three hours of conversation, this linguist who is regarded as an authority among well-read people in the Muslim world, spoke in excellent French interspersed with unexpected signs of humor. It is difficult to imagine that this affable, erudite person, holder of a masters' degree from Oxford University and a doctorate in law from the Sorbonne [Paris university], should be regarded as one of the most dangerous men in the world, the leader of a "new empire of Evil" in Washington's eyes. [Darcourt] Who are you, Shaykh al-Turaybi? [Al-Turaybi] It is for you to choose. For my enemies I am the "green devil," the "guru" of Islamic extremism. For my friends, I am Shaykh al-Turaybi, a title which the Sudanese confer on a man of age and knowledge, a man of religion. To understand better who I am, I must talk about my background. I was born on 1 February 1932 in Kassala in northeast Sudan, a village close to the Ethiopian border, by a whim of the itinerant career of my father, who for 30 years had the job of qadi, or Muslim judge. My father had graduated from the faculty of religious sciences in Omdurman, which explains my attraction to Koranic and legal studies. Our family is descended from a famous line of religious dignitaries. My ancestor Daf'allah, a renowned sufi, created a Koranic school in the center of the country, frequented by many disciples, and founded the village of Turaybi which has born his name for 300 years. My wife Wisal al-Madi is the direct descendant of Muhammad Ahmad, the Great Madi, who swept the British troops from Khartoum in 1885. It was during those terrible assaults that Gordon, British governor-general of Sudan, was killed. The Madi had called on his faithful, the al-Ansar, to fight against "the foreign infidels and the impious Turks" to establish in Sudan the kingdom of God based on the precepts of the Koran. The first Sudanese nationalism was born with him. [Darcourt] You studied abroad for seven years. Which impressed you most, Britain or France? [Al-Turaybi] France, without any doubt. I spent two years in Britain. Long enough to complete a master's degree and no more. And I continued my studies in Paris. At that time, going to France was already an act of independence in opposition to the British colonialists. The whole Sudanese elite was then focused on London. English was still the official state language. I stayed in France from 1959 to 1964. My wife was with me and speaks excellent French. We have six children and our first son was born in Paris. During my stay, I was struck by the courtesy of the teachers and the comradeship of the students. There was no segregation. I was excited by the richness and precision of the French language, the culture, the history of the Revolution, the relations between Church and state, and the study of the different Constitutions. I was not focused exclusively on my law studies. I went to the National Library, I visited museums. During the university vacations, I went to Strasbourg, Toulouse, and Albi, to Germany, and Italy. I think that the world is like a book of which you have only read the first page until you have left your own country. [Darcourt] How did you enter politics? [Al-Turaybi] My first public engagement was to launch a campaign for the emancipation of Sudanese women and to give them the right to vote. I thought that they should play a full part in building a new Islamic society, well-anchored in this century. They also needed to be taken from the exclusive confinement of domestic tasks. It was a difficult enterprise, but those reforms succeeded. [Darcourt] You are the founder of the Arab-Islamic People's Conference, which holds its congress in Khartoum each year. Are you satisfied with its work? [Al-Turaybi] The scale of this meeting is a unique event in history. More than 500 delegates representing 56 countries from four continents -- Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America -- took part in it. Nobody was excluded. Among the delegates were around 20 leaders of the Sunni clergy; muftis from Bosnia, Greece, and Albania; the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris; German imams; several mullahs; imams from the United States, and others -- Belgians, Spanish, French -- many women; and even 12 American bishops in the framework of the Church-Islam dialogue which we launched last year. This conference primarily aimed to mobilize the largest number of groups and prominent individuals to reconcile the Muslims divided among the four corners of the world and unite them in the face of those who are relentlessly hostile to them. Consensus was reached on a firm will: To raise the idea of God in the face of American society in which the supremacy of commercial materialism backed by an overwhelming military power leaves room for no faith in divine law. [Darcourt] During the conference, the United States was clearly named as "Islam's mortal enemy..." [Al-Turaybi] The arrogance of the United States which has become the only world superpower offends us. It subjects countries which refuse to bow to its diktats to a harsh economic blockade. This is true of Sudan, which is deprived of all development aid, and blacklisted for "violation of human rights and collaboration with terrorist organizations." [Darcourt] This is also true of Libya... [Al-Turaybi] The situation is different. Nobody is accusing us of having blown up airplanes and we respect the embargo. Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has been in power for a quarter of a century. He started his national socialist revolution inspired by al-Nasir, then he launched his revolution of the Little Green Book. He apparently no longer believes in it. His current preoccupation is to unite the tribes. But the Americans are stepping up the pressure on his entourage and will continue to stifle Libya. This is only a remark, but al-Qadhdhafi is likely to end up in the next cell to General Noriega, the former dictator of Panama. [Darcourt] Sudan is regarded as one of the hubs of international terrorism... [Al-Turaybi] These accusations are unfounded. Sudan, devastated by a civil war which has been going on for 10 years and which is costing it $1 million per day, does not have the money or material resources to maintain guerrillas abroad in Egypt or Algeria. On the other hand, where American interests lie, attacks on democracy are never condemned. Take the example of Saudi Arabia: It is a country without a Constitution in which nobody votes, governed for more than 60 years by an absolute monarchy, the king and...3,500 princes of the blood covered with dollars. For the Americans, Saudi Arabia, the main holder of the world's crude oil reserves, is an untouchable preserve. [Darcourt] France was not attacked once during the Conference... [Al-Turaybi] We have no complexes about France. It did not colonize Sudan. France has major assets for becoming the preferred interlocutor of the Muslim peoples once again -- its feeling for law, its influence in Africa, its knowledge of the Arab world, and its advanced technology. We are happy that our government chose Air France, and not British Airways, to serve Khartoum; Paris, and not London, as the main stop; and that Sudan Airways, our national company, bought Airbus planes and not Boeings. [Darcourt] Among the delegations invited to the Conference were several members of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], of whom Abdallah Hannas was the spokesman. The FIS's armed groups are stepping up summary executions of foreigners on Algerian territory... [Al-Turaybi] This conflict is starting in the same way as the FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algerian war, by assassinations, outbreaks of violence, and very harsh police repression. Every time I met a member of the FIS I always said to him: "Have you spoken with France?" He replied: "Out of the question." I insisted: "You must talk, open a dialogue. Your country is in danger of breaking up. If you come to power by force, 3 million or even 4 million Algerians will probably flee like boat people to the French coast." France, already disturbed by the problem of immigrants, will not be able to receive them. This chaos must be avoided, a compromise must be found, and an agreement reached. For the time being, you see, these armed groups are not controlled, the FIS is a passionate movement without a precise program and not yet structured. The first line is harsh. The second line is intelligent. After two years of discussion, I have been able to persuade them to talk with France and the FLN. Serious contacts have taken place in Germany, in the United States, and in Sudan. The civil war is a bad fever which must be brought down at all costs.
