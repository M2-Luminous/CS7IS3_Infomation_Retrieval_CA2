This developed as Southern Command chief Major General Thelmo Cunanan endorsed an investigation of the relatives of the victims in the 26 December bombing of the cathedral to find out if they have knowledge in the "retaliatory" attacks on the mosques. "Let us join together to identify (those involved) and bring them into the open to expose their evil agenda and let them answer their ungodly and barbaric acts," MILF spokesman Mohagher Iqbal said in a press statement on Tuesday. But Iqbal warned the government to avoid "witchhunting as what had happened in the Buluan massacre," an incident that also almost sparked a Muslim-Christian conflict. Iqbal was referring to the 13 December ambush-massacre in which 10 bus passengers were killed and 10 others wounded in Buluan, Maguindanao which the military blamed to a certain MILF Kumander [Commander] Ustadz Dua Mantio. "Kumander Dua was made the sacrificial lamb for a crime he was never involved in," Iqbal said, adding that Dua was found innocent of the charges in an MILF initiated investigation. Iqbal said the Davao City bombings were "befitting only to barbarians, ungodly and bloodthirsty" who "deserve the highest condemnation of every sane, upright and God-believing individual or group." The MILF spokesman also appealed to the people of Davao City and nearby areas to "observe sobriety, patience and perseverance in the face of this machination to drive a wedge between our peoples." In the same statement, Iqbal reaffirmed the MILF support to the on-going peace talks between its rival Moro National Liberation Front and the government, which he considered a hope leading to the implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. "If any group cannot contribute to this forward move (peace talks), at least it must stop rocking the boat of peace and autonomy," Iqbal said.
