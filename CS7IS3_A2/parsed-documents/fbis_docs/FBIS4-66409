In his presentation on international relations, PNC Assistant Chairman of the Board Mitsuo Taguchi made the following statement: "Last year PNC underwent 17 percent of the total amount of inspections worldwide by the IAEA, which added up to 1400 man-days." Needless to say, this is the kind of strict international scrutiny that results from Japan's plutonium utilization. The number of man-days works out to four inspectors from foreign countries conducting international inspections at PNC facilities every day of the year. In fact, the IAEA's "eyes of non-proliferation" are focused more sharply on Japan than anywhere else in the world. In his introductory greeting, Chairman of the Board Takao Ishiwatari touched on the international situation, including increasing concern over the problem of excess plutonium resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons accompanying the end of the Cold War. He said, "The FBR, fuel recycling, and plutonium utilization put us on a radical path of atomic energy development and use. We must respond to concerns raised by the international community." He also revealed a plan to proceed with international cooperative research with the U.S. and France on mixing and burning minor actinide series transuranium elements (neptunium, americium, etc.) with plutonium. In a sense, as a response to foreign concern over Japan's use of plutonium, this research will lead to utilization of "nuclear proliferation resistant" enhanced plutonium that is blended so nuclear outlaws will leave it alone. Moreover, because this technology also burns up the minor actinides that are normally present in high level waste, it may kill two birds with one stone by easing the burden of high level waste disposal, which is the greatest problem the nuclear power industry must confront. As a backdrop for all this, the U.S. Department of Energy's budget proposal in April authorized the burning of actinides in the experimental breeder reactor (EBR II), and funding for the IFR (Integral Fast Reactor), which had been eliminated, was restored by a House-Senate conference committee in Congress on 14 October. In the spring of 1977, President Carter essentially put a halt to breeder reactor development, and although both are Democrats and President Clinton's non-proliferation policy must cope with the problem of plutonium from dismantled weapons, after 16 years this is, in essence, welcome news. France, on the other hand, remains silent. In Japan, however, informed persons have been deeply distressed because the Atomic Energy Commission has been holding hearings to revise the Long Term Plan for one year and three months, but the long-awaited report on FBR commercialization, which includes plans for the first FBR demonstration reactor, is still not ready for submission because of "evasion tactics" by some in the electric power industry. Fuel Facility Automated, Remote Control Plant Returning to the main topic, PNC also revealed issues to be addressed and future prospects for technical progress through the cooperative development of this advanced plutonium recycling technology by Japan, France, and the U.S. Yoshiro Takahashi (Assistant Director, Development Promotion Division, PNC) appealed that we should change our concept of plutonium recycling as merely technological development intended to clean up the leftovers of LWR power generation and stated, "The ratio of isotopes in which nuclear fission occurs (fissile quantity) drops off only slightly even when the number of recycling passes is increased." "We can utilize minor actinides, which are elements we have thrown away in the past, as a source of fuel and reduce the burden on the back end (disposal of high level waste)," and "We must look at this from the standpoint of a comprehensive technology from LWR to FBR to recycling." From the standpoint of fuels, Shojio Kawada (Assistant Director, Reprocessing Technology Development Division, PNC) stated, "In reprocessing we must first develop technology for isolating and recovering transuranium elements, and because we will no longer need a purification process, the overall process will be shortened." Because of the intense radioactivity, however, operation of the plant must be automated, and maintenance must be performed by remote control. Construction of this Recycling Equipment Testing Facility (RETF) will begin next spring.
