Before German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe disbanded the unit, he praised the "masterly performance" of all those involved in the operation. The German armed forces had "opened up a new chapter in their readiness for deployment and aid." Ruehe stressed the soldiers' humanitarian aid, in particular. Schools, roads, and bridges had been rebuilt, and the infrastructure of the region had been considerably improved. He said the German soldiers had "turned the Beledweynne region into a model UN area for the rebuilding of Somalia." Ruehe said the public supported such missions and expected them of the Bundeswehr. This acceptance would not, however, have been reached without its participation in Somalia and earlier in Cambodia, as well as in the aid flights to Bosnia and the AWACS missions. Ruehe, however, admitted to shortcomings in the Somalia mission, for which he primarily blamed the United Nations. He referred to the interaction between Mogadishu and New York, which was less than ideal, as well as the lack of a viable political concept for Somalia. Arising out of this is the task of strengthening the United Nations' ability to act.
