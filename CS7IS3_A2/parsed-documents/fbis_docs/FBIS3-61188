The Kuban: Typical Characteristics in Typical Circumstances"] [Text] The Territories The broad (about 30 cm wide) and deep (three stories) crack in the wall of the KUBANSKIY KURYER building has been gaping there for a month already. The reasons, the objective, and the perpetrators of the terrorist act are still unknown, but the result is known: At that time a 20-year-old proofreader at the newspaper died on the spot under debris falling from above. Local authorities expressed alarm and sympathy, law enforcement organs swore to find the perpetrators and punish them, and democrats added one more item to their list of communist crimes. The unpoliticized majority of Krasnodar residents recalled this apotheosis of the election campaign with sarcasm and cynicism: "Even the Decembrists were unable to blow up the newspaper properly: For some reason they placed the bomb in the men's john...." Personalities The elections in Kuban were a competition among three individuals, and they were by no means Gaydar, Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy. Vying for places in the senate were titans of local significance, each of whom had managed to be the master of Krasnodar Kray and become a symbol of a certain epoch. The decades of socialism and kolkhoz construction in the Kuban--Nikolay Kondratenko, chairman of the kray executive committee, and then chairman of the kray soviet, who was overthrown in August 1991 for supporting the State Committee for the State of Emergency. The troubled present of "gradual reforms" and quiet privatization without unnecessary competitions--the present head of the kray administration, Nikolay Yegorov. The unrealized romantic dreams of members of Democratic Russia from the "living circle" of the times of the 1991 putsch--Vasiliy Dyakonov, who became governor after the fall of Governor Kondratenko but who remained in the post little longer than a year. Mr. Dyakonov remained in the people's memory because of his mass farmerization (17 farmers appeared in the kray and there was stiff resistance to decollectivization on the part of the rest of the population) and his attempt to maintain the minimum prices of bread in 1992--by collecting fees from tobacco and alcohol trade in the Kuban. The management blunders for which Mr. Dyakonov was removed are a material fact, but it is no less of a fact that his dismissal was persistently achieved by the kolkhoz leaders and the tobacco and vodka directorate. Nonetheless, according to the assessment of the current head of the kray soviet, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy (who ran on the Yabloka ticket), the contest for senate seats included "not so much ideologists as clans." Once united into a single party-economic elite, the chiefs now--with the disappearance of the oblast committee supervision--have recognized the differences in their branch interests. And they have not yet been able to achieve an awareness of their common regional interests which would join the local elite together with a new glue in a subsidized, slowly privatized Krasnodar Kray. Nikolay Kondratenko ran in the elections as a representative of the "agrarian clan" of kolkhoz chiefs. Nikolay Yegorov was supported by another part of the agrarians, managers, and those who had their eyes on the ports, borders, and other transit capabilities of the kray. Among his assets were long-standing ties with Vladimir Shumeyko and Viktor Chernomyrdin and more recent ties with Sergey Shakhray. Having gained the sympathy of the president's administration, the head of a powerful construction trust Vasiliy Dyakonov competed with the mayor of Krasnodar, Yevgeniy Samoylenko. The Fight Mr. Kondratenko and Mr. Yegorov became members of the Council of the Federation. The first winner was clear long before the elections: The rating of "Ataman Kondrat," who seemed to have retired from politics, had not dropped below 40 percent among Kuban residents during the past year. Mr. Kondratenko contemptuously rejected a proposal to withdraw in exchange for the position of head of the tobacco joint venture with the Philip Morris firm: A senator's position guarantees more magnificent prospects. The main contest was for the second position--because of it a scandal broke out throughout all of Russia when the local election committee refused to register Mr. Dyakonov as a candidate, and it ended with the dismissal of the election committee chief Yuriy Lapkin. The opposing teams accused one another of gaining signatures through pressure on their subordinates, direct falsification of signatures, and forgery when they were being verified.... The position of the local Russia's Choice candidates was explained most clearly by the activist Lyudmila Belova, who up to this point was grateful to Vasiliy Dyakonov for the fact that it was during his governorship that her family was granted its own farm with 100 hogs: "All leadership is playing dishonestly. But the higher the leadership, the greater possibilities it has of doing this. Dyakonov has the least." Indeed, on 12 December (after campaigning had already been prohibited) at the doors of the electoral precinct of the kray hospital I encountered only two placards--of Governor Yegorov and Mayor Samoylenko. On the other hand, there is also a particle of truth in the words of the press secretary of the kray soviet, Galina Kravchenko: "If Dyakonov were from another bloc and not from 'Choice,' would Moscow really have raised such a stink?" Zhirinovskiy Predictions have persistently given the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] second place in Krasnodar Kray. "It will get no higher: Unlike 'Choice' and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, they actually have no organizations here," the Krasnodar sociologist Viktor Kritskiy assured me. In the end the party outdid both the Communists (twofold) and the members of Russia's Choice (fourfold). As discussions with local residents showed, most of those who voted for the LDPR did it "out of spite"; before 12 December few people even thought about the party slates: The elections remained elections from local families. "I just found out about all of these parties--at the precinct," a 40-year-old housewife, Tatyana Boyko, confided to us. Local journalists doubt that Zhirinovskiy's victory in points really means an increase in his influence in the party in the kray: LDPR activists have nothing to do with the local elite. In conservative Kuban up to this point--and in the foreseeable future--things will be decided by the leadership. And up to now no one political force really has the required reserve. Cossacks More than a million of the kray's population of 5 million consider themselves to be Cossacks. In the Cossack villages (and essentially more than half of the Kuban residents live in rural Cossack villages) they still distinguish Cossacks from "foreigners." "If a person could really rely on the Cossacks he would undoubtedly become a leader in the Kuban," thinks Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy. There is no question of the authority of the current Cossack structures. Homegrown politicians with Cossack striped trousers, the majority of whom are city residents ("a real Cossack tills the soil"), have already managed to split into "red" and "white" Cossack troops. One group contains several thousand and the other--several hundred. The "whites" were openly in favor of Dyakonov, and the "reds" were cautiously in favor of Kondratenko. But both of them demanded "purging the Kuban of unwanted guests." The traditional Kuban anti-Semitism is more of a theoretical nature: Barely 3,000 Jews live in the kray. The main "foreign enemy" is from the Caucasian Mountains. Since the beginning of the war in Transcaucasia the 350,000 local Armenians living here since Potemkin's times have been augmented by more than 100,000 refugees from Armenia. The Russians, of whom there were twice as many among the refugees, have somehow been able to blend in with the local population. Armenians, the majority of whom have set up successful businesses, constantly feel the hostility of their neighbors and attacks from politicians. The latter, naturally, never miss a chance to gratify their supporters loudly and freely. During the last campaign the triumphant Nikolay Kondratenko attacked the "outsiders" especially openly. "In the neighboring Stavropol Kray it has already started: The Cossacks have been beating up Armenians at the bazaars and kicking them out of their homes. Let me tell you--the Kuban is on the brink," a chap standing in front of the main Krasnodar market admitted. Incidentally, Konstantin Zatulin built his entire campaign in the south of the kray on the demand to set up a strong border between the Caucasian republics. In the opinion of the sociologist Kritskiy he would inevitably have won on this if the well-known Communist, the cosmonaut Sevastyanov, had not ended up as his opponent. Prospects Head of the kray administration Nikolay Yegorov gives himself special credit for "achieving political stability," by which he means mainly elimination of the conflict with the Council. After coming to the Council of the Federation Mr. Yegorov still retains the governor's post, but the prospects for "stability" are still not so clear. Elections to the new kray parliament have been scheduled for 6 March. The current leader, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy thinks that "the party will be, to put it mildly, much more progressive than the Council," and Nikolay Kondratenko is sure to occupy the position of its chairman. Incidentally, one of Mr. Yegorov's closest advisers, the head of the Kuban innovation fund, Konstantin Vlasyuk, states that this will not mean a change in the politics in the kray: "Kondratenko's influence was greatly affected by the fact that he had been out of office for three years." The administration has no way out other than to localize the activity of the new local legislators: In the first place, the openly subsidized Kuban, whose budget "could not be saved even by a single-channel system," is in no position to spoil relations with the Kremlin. In the second place, in the words of Mr. Vlasyuk, "the kray has attracted the attention of serious investors": for example, the main buyer at the auction in the Novorossiysk port (with its oil transfer terminal) was the Lukoyl Company. Many are also attracted by the stand of valuable redwood in the Caucasian foothills. "The problem of the agrarians is that their sphere of influence remains within the kray. Ours is arising anew," asserts Konstantin Vlasyuk. "Our current task is somehow to convince the people close to the president of the Russian Federation that if Kondratenko and Yegorov win in the elections, the kray would not become a Russian Vendee. We can agree on everything to everyone's satisfaction."
