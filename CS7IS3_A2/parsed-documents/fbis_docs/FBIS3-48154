Australia is encouraged by the approach, but it is insisting there be firm progress on the nuclear issue before ties could be resumed. Linda Mottram reports from Canberra: [Begin Mottram recording] Australian officials have confirmed a report in the national newspaper THE AUSTRALIAN about the approach made in recent weeks by a senior North Korean diplomat to the Australian Embassy in Bangkok. An Australian Government spokesperson says Australian diplomats have returned the sounding-out. The spokesperson said the approach is being seen as encouraging, but says Pyongyang has been told any further development depends on North Korea allowing full international inspection of its nuclear facilities where nuclear weapons development is feared, and on progress in talks between North and South Korea and North Korea and the United States. The spokesperson described the situation as talks about talks and very, very preliminary. Australia has informed South Korea of the approach which appeared to have been made to Australia only.
