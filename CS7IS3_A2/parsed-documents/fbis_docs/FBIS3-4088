Speaking at a rally today marking the Second Annual World Day for Water, the minister said that China's per capita share of water reserves has been decreasing. In China it amounts to 2,400 cubic meters per head, only about one fourth of the world's average and ranking 88th in the world, said the minister. He attributed the booming economic and social development, population growth and pollution to the decrease. According to the minister, China took the lead in the world by mapping out "China's Agenda 21", a national strategy for sustainable social and economic development, which gives priority to protection and efficient use of water. The strategy was drafted in response to the call made by the United Nations Environment and Development Conference held in Brazil, which stressed protection of natural resources and sustainable development. China has been investing heavily, and will continue to do so, in water conservancy projects, he added. Work on preparatory projects for the huge Three Gorges Water Conservancy Dam on the Chang Jiang River is in full swing. The scheme will create the world's most powerful hydro-electric plant and a huge reservoir. Work on other large water conservancy projects, such as Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai, which it is estimated will cost billions of U.S. dollars, has begun or is soon to start. Another costly diversion project has been listed on the agenda of the Chinese Government. It is designed to divert water from the Chang Jiang River northward to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province and Henan Province, which are suffering from water shortages. Romulo Garcia, acting resident representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Beijing, said that in recent years UNDP had been involved in a number of initiatives to assist the government in its water related programs. The programs include the northern China water management project, the rural water supply and sanitation in poor and remote areas project, and the assessment of China's water sector in Guizhou Province and master plan for the development of water resources in northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The United Nations General Assembly resolved last year to have March 22 observed every year as the world day for water. The United Nations estimates that 1.2 billion people still do not have access to safe water, he said. Niu Maosheng added that over 50 countries or regions have a shortage of water, and water shortage has become a universal problem for cities all over the world.
