France and the United States want to act against low-wage countries which distort free trade and competition by their products, which they are able to keep cheap thanks to low wages and poor working conditions. GATT Director Peter Sutherland is warning against "simplistic arguments, which look very much like the old protectionist rhetoric." Everything points to the already very tense North-South trading relations coming under even greater pressure thanks to the new Franco-U.S. initiative. Washington and Paris want drastic action to be taken against countries which ignore international labor law and trade union rights. The arguments between the United States and Beijing about the link between the two countries' trade relations and the respect of human rights by China have not yet subsided before new trouble has broken out, this time with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. In these low-wage countries there is no such thing as trade union rights; workers there work for starvation wages and children are still massively exploited. After France and the United States made life difficult for one another for years during the GATT's Uruguay Round, it is striking how much they agree today on the low-wage countries. Both countries have a virtually identical position on the matter, and they want action to be taken -- if necessary with economic sanctions -- against countries which do not respect labor legislation recognized under international law. The subject is on the agenda in the European Union (EU) as well. Yesterday European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan presented a report dealing with the question. Brittan is pushing the EU governments to take a joint position in Marrakesh. The European commissioner believes the EU must demand that the World Trade Organization, which will shortly replace the GATT, should pay considerable attention in the future to violations of trade union rights throughout the world and problems like child labor, mass forced labor by prisoners and other social issues. Nevertheless Brittan does not want go as far as the French and Americans. He wants nothing to do with a crusade to impose economic sanctions against low-wage countries. That is also the opinion of GATT Director General Peter Sutherland. In a speech last week in Toronto, Canada, he warned against "simplistic demands for drastic trade remedies which show a great similarity to more conventional forms of protectionist rhetoric." The new Franco-U.S. eagerness in social matters is arousing considerable resentment in international trade union circles. Dennis McShane, spokesman of the International Metal Workers Union in Geneva, pointed out that, at present, Asia was the "low-wage paradise par excellence -- without trade unions and with unacceptable social conditions -- for every European company which wants to avoid its social responsibilities and put every job in European industry at jeopardy." McShane pointed out how his federation had been campaigning in vain for years against the terrible social conditions in a country like Malaysia, where trade unions are not even recognized and where a company like France's Thomson presently employs more workers for very low wages than in its own country.
