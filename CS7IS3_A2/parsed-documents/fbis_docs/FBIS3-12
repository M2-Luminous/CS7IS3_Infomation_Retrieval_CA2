Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09MAR94-VIETNAM Hanoi Reports Success in Fight Against Malaria A 26 February VNA report on a conference on the anti-malarial effort in Vietnam's northern provinces suggests that Hanoi has made considerable progress in overcoming what the media two years ago had indicated was a serious malaria problem. According to VNA, all three targets of Vietnam's anti-malaria program for 1993 were met as the death rate dropped by 30 percent, the number of malaria sufferers fell by nearly 20 percent, and the number of malaria epidemics decreased by 84 percent compared to 1992. VNA reported particular progress in combatting malaria in Vietnam's central highlands--which the report said was "one of the worst affected areas " --noting that the death rate in that region had fallen by "50 percent." Despite the progress, VNA noted that Hanoi is planning to intensify its efforts in combatting malaria in 1994. According to VNA, the government will allot 60 billion dong for the 1994 anti-malaria campaign--an increase of 10 billion dong over 1993- -in hopes of reducing the mortality rate by 30 percent and the number of malaria outbreaks by 20 percent in comparison to 1993.
