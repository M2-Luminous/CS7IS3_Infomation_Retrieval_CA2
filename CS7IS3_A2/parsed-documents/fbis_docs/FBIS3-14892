Opening it, speaker of the Crimean parliament Nikolay Bagrov said that the situation on the peninsula is complex and that "we need to create normal conditions for the president's work." Bagrov negatively assessed Ukraine's Supreme Council's decision to hold elections to local state authorities on 26 June, the same date as the [Ukrainian] presidential elections. Bagrov proposed that this question be raised at the session of the Crimean parliament. The proposal by Viktor Bobylev, a member of the Presidium, that the moratorium on holding a referendum on the Crimean Republic's independence be lifted did not meet with support. The Crimean parliament's speaker touched upon the discussion at the session of the question of forming the Crimean Republic's budget. "If, today, the city [as published] must receive an income of 700 billion karbovantsi, the question of the budget will not be at all simple," Bagrov pointed out. "I very much fear that once Ukraine has given us the chance to form our own budget independently and does not give us anything, we will not be able to survive." Asked by journalists whether the Crimea will be able to become a subject of international law, Bagrov replied: "This topic must be removed from the agenda. Economic relations are one thing, but political relations are something entirely different." Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov took part in the work of the Crimean Supreme Council Presidium.
