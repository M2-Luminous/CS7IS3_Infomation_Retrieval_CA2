FBIS4-5497 "dreas070_a_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan New Document: Hosokawa Refunded Some of Loan New Document: Hosokawa Refunded Some of Loan OW0904024694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0233 GMT 9 Apr 94 OW0904024694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has refunded some of a loan extended by Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking company, according to a newly-found document obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Hosokawa, who on Friday [8 April] abruptly announced his intention to resign, has come under attack over a 100 million yen loan he took from Sagawa Kyubin, as well as another financial deal related to the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). Although Hosokawa has told the Diet he paid back the 100 million yen to Sagawa Kyubin, the opposition has alleged that he failed to do so, making the loan a de facto secret donation. The newly found document is apparently a photocopy of part of Sagawa Kyubin's accounting data. It seemed to be copied from printed computer data of the company's accounts between 1986 and 1988. It says the data are the item of loans extended by Sagawa Kyubin from the firm's balance sheet book. According to the data, Hosokawa refunded 10 million yen respectively on May 28, 1986, February 10, 1987 and February 17, 1988. The dates and the amounts of money are the same as previous data submitted last December by Sagawa Kyubin to the Diet. However, the new document suggests the money was paid back through a bank, contrary to Hosokawa's explanation to the Diet that he had his secretary carry cash to refund Sagawa Kyubin. Minao Hattori of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party said the loan which Hosokawa had his secretary refund may be a different loan from that stated in the new document. The document was kept by a former Sagawa Kyubin employee who has entrusted it to an acquaintance. A former Sagawa Kyubin executive said the document apparently is of Sagawa Kyubin.
