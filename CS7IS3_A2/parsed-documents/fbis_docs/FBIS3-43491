[passage omitted] Meanwhile, UN Captain Rudolfo Dulce says a truck with food supplies for 1,000 men was scheduled to arrive at Namialo this evening. The food will last 30 days, but the soldiers have complained about the quality of meals served at the assembly point. [passage omitted] In Cabo Delgado, 1,207 government soldiers had already been accommodated at the Montepuez Assembly Point by 3 January, despite logistical problems like a lack of food, household utensils, water, and medicines. [passage omitted] In a press release, the provincial government's representative at the Cabo Delgado branch of the Supervision and Control Commission says it is extremely worried about continued violations of the peace accord by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. The press release says Renamo has not yet sent its guerrillas to assembly points, and that armed members of that organization are moving in most districts of Cabo Delgado. The document adds that in Montepuez District on 22 December, Renamo elements arrested the president of the (Napapo) village, allegedly because he was carrying a firearm. He was released two days later. Renamo is also accused of having deployed armed men in the (Napala) village of Chiure District. The presence of Renamo members from various bases, including the Maringue headquarters have been reported in Pemba. In Niassa Province, Renamo says the peace accord is being battered. Renamo Foreign Relations chief Jose de Castro said in Lichinga today that many aspects of the accord are not being fulfilled, notably Protocols 3 and 4 which deal with logistics. He said the government is not adhering to the protocols. Castro said Renamo delegates have no houses in various provinces, and that the government's repressive apparatus is being used to intimidate the people. Castro said many people fear joining Renamo because the government prevents them from doing so, although 100 per cent of the country's population favors his movement. He said the people have grown tired of Frelimo and want a change. [Begin Castro recording] In Mavago and other assembly points our forces are facing hardships because of logistical problems. The peace accord is not being applied evenly. Our troops have not been defeated or amnestied, but have actually won the war against several foreign armies and the Frelimo army. The government should take that into account and review the logistical situation in Mavago. [end recording] Jose de Castro arrived in Lichinga today to deal with the appointment of Renamo representatives to the electoral commissions.
