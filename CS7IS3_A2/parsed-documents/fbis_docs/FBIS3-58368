[Mentese] According to our information, Apo is currently in Syria. Our intelligence indicates that he is going and coming in various places in Syria. The Syrian authorities, in turn, claim the opposite. They say that Apo is not in Syria. According to our intelligence reports, Apo is currently in Syria. [Muhtar] Did the Syrian interior minister state that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is a terrorist organization? [Mentese] Naturally, they also accept this. We say he is there, and they say no. They invited me to visit Syria. I wanted our working groups to meet first. They sent their working groups twice. The second delegation returned a few days ago and our working group went to Syria. I have not met with them yet; I believe they only returned yesterday. Now, the Foreign Ministry wants me to go. I think that I will visit Syria during this month. [Muhtar] Press reports note that when you are in Syria you will be shown the al-Biqa' Valley [as heard] and you will be allowed to tour the area. Is this correct? [Mentese] I do not know. Syria, of course, has sovereignty within its borders. [Muhtar] What are your demands? [Mentese] My demands will be determined in line with the conditions. I do not want to say anything at the moment. I may or may not go to the area, but our main goal is to prevent this leadership from taking refuge in Syria. If we are neighbors and friends with Syria and we want to cooperate and develop our economic, social, and cultural relations with it, then it is our right to demand that this leadership cadre not be harbored in Syria. [Muhtar] It is a widely held opinion that the leadership cadres of a terrorist organization are very important and that terrorist organizations will collapse if these cadres are eliminated. Do you share this view? [Mentese] Leadership cadres are naturally important, as in every field. If the leaders are weakened or destroyed, then the terrorist organization tends to disperse. There may be resistance in places, but [word indistinct] will happen. [Muhtar] Within this context, does the government strategy for 1994 include crushing the leadership cadres of the PKK? [Mentese] Naturally; from all aspects. It is our state's aim to crush this terrorist organization, which is disturbing Turkey and our people. [Muhtar] How will this be achieved? [Mentese] As you can see, our security forces are continuously conducting operations. Our intelligence organizations are working and we are assessing this information. The state has various intelligence organizations and we are fighting the terrorist organization in line with the information supplied by these sources. [Muhtar] In the past, there was an organization named Black September and Israel eliminated its leaders. Later, Israel was described as a terrorist country. Would Turkey consider undertaking such an operation abroad against the leadership cadres of the PKK? [Mentese] This would be possible only through cooperation. If that country would allow it, we would naturally go there. If they say come because we are unable to deal with this, then we would go immediately. [Muhtar] Has Syria not accepted yet that Apo has been in Syria? Turkish journalists met with him. [Mentese] No, they do not accept it. They say that they do not know. We do tell them about journalists' meetings with him. [Muhtar] He even held a news conference. He has a residence in Damascus. What is the reaction to all this? [Mentese] They do not say much. They ask us to come and see. [Muhtar] Is there any question of launching an operation into Syria? [Mentese] Such an operation can only be conducted in cooperation with Syria. [Muhtar] Have they submitted such a request? [Mentese] They may. We may reach that point at the end of talks. We do not want to obtain results by fighting with our neighbors. [Muhtar] Is this possible in the near future? [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Things could suddenly develop. [Muhtar] When we ask you questions, you say that this matter will be resolved. Do you know something that we do not? [Mentese] I said this is possible. We asked Syrian authorities to expel, extradite, or punish him. We told them that he is a bandit and he orders people killed. [Muhtar] Does Syria comply with this approach? [Mentese] I do not know. There is a certain amount of temperance. I believe Syria, too, will say yes at some point. [Muhtar] Is there anything you have failed to tell us with regard to contacts with Syria? [Mentese] No. I told you everything. Our aim is to cooperate with them on these issues, on narcotics. [Muhtar] I mean with regard to the Syrians' attitude? [Mentese] We find their attitude warm and sincere. I hope and estimate that we will be able to cooperate soon. [Muhtar] Is this possible in the next few months? [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Our visits are not for tourism purposes. I will go there to obtain results, not for tourism. We will appeal to their common sense and try to obtain results. We want to conclude this matter by spring. [Muhtar] Do you mean the leaders as well? [Mentese] Yes. We want to shatter them totally.
