FR941003-0-00052 FR941003-0-00013 59. One comment argued that proposed §314.95(b) creates a delay that is detrimental to ANDA applicants and is contrary to the 1984 amendments and the legislative history. The comment said that proposed §314.95(b) would deprive ANDA applicants of ``statutory rights'' associated with the 45-day period and the 30-month period for the effective date of an ANDA approval and could present problems among competing ANDA applicants. The comment said FDA should permit ANDA applicants to provide notice upon submission of an application or have ANDA applicants await an initial FDA determination (presumably as to whether the application is received) before providing notice. FDA disagrees with the comment. As stated above, the legislative history expressly states that notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent must be given simultaneously with the submission of an ANDA and that the ANDA cannot be a ``sham'' ANDA or one that is substantially incomplete (see H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 24 (1984)). As written, §314.95(b) is consistent with the legislative history because it requires the ANDA applicant to provide notice once FDA has determined that the ANDA is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. To permit an ANDA applicant to provide notice before FDA has determined whether the ANDA is sufficiently complete would be contrary to the legislative history because it would only encourage ANDA applicants to file incomplete or ``sham'' ANDA's and to supplement them later to secure a place in the review queue in an attempt to secure the first ANDA approval. 60. FDA received five comments regarding the exact contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Two comments would revise the rule to require applicants to disclose all components, including active and inactive ingredients, in the applicant's prospective formulation, the proportions of those components, and all grounds supporting the applicant's assertion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Three comments opposed disclosure of the applicant's formulation or composition information or a detailed statement of the applicant's legal reasoning. These comments explained that such information and statements might compromise the applicant's trade secrets and adversely affect the applicant's ability to engage in litigation. As noted above in comment 18, the agency did not anticipate that the list in proposed §314.95(c) would generate the debate reflected in the comments and, again, reiterates that the agency does not have the expertise or the desire to become involved in issues concerning patent law and sufficiency of notice. Therefore, FDA has revised §314.95 to require that the detailed statement of the factual and legal basis behind the applicant's opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed include the following: (1) For each claim of a patent alleged not to be infringed, a full and detailed explanation why the claim is not infringed; and (2) for each claim of a patent alleged to be invalid or unenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds supporting the allegation (see §§314.52(c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) and 314.95(c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(ii)). Disputes involving the sufficiency of the notice must be resolved by the applicant, patent owner, and holder of the approved application rather than by action on the part of FDA. 61. FDA also received five comments opposing the use of a referee or designated intermediary under proposed §314.95(c)(6)(iii). The proposal would have required an ANDA applicant to describe a mechanism for disclosing the formulation or composition of the proposed drug product to the patent owner or to a ``designated intermediary who will act as a referee'' on the subject of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The comments said that the concept was legally unauthorized and interfered with the traditional judicial process for resolving patent disputes. FDA agrees that traditional processes for resolving patent disputes, which do not involve the agency's regulations, are appropriate under these circumstances. Therefore, the agency has deleted the provision in its entirety. 62. Proposed §314.95(f) would presume a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement to be complete and sufficient if the ANDA applicant complied with the regulatory requirements under §314.95(a) through (e) and would start the 45-day clock for filing a patent infringement suit on the date following receipt of the notice. One comment challenged the presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to permit the statutory 45-day period to begin. The comment would revise the rule to require applicants to file a complete copy of the certification and notice of service with FDA and delay the start of the 45-day period if any dispute over the certification's sufficiency arose. A second comment argued that an approved application holder who is also an exclusive patent licensee might have different interests than the patent owner. The comment would revise the rule to require notice to both the patent owner and to the licensee or approved application holder. With respect to FDA's presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to begin the 45-day period, §314.95(c), as amended, paraphrases the statutory language concerning notices and does not attempt to establish more detailed requirements for ``sufficiency'' of a notice. FDA has revised §314.95(f) to state that it will begin the 45-day period on the first day after the documented date of receipt by the person(s) receiving the notice. FDA will be able to determine this date because §314.95(e) requires applicants to submit documentation of receipt of notice. FDA may, if the applicant amends its ANDA with a written statement that a later date should be used, count from the later date. FDA also agrees that an exclusive patent licensee's interests may differ from those of the patent owner. Therefore, FDA has revised §§314.52(f) and 314.95(f) to start the 45-day period on the day following the date of receipt of the notice by the patent owner or its representative and by the approved application holder.
