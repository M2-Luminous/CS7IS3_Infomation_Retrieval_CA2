FR941003-1-00032 FR941003-1-00003 In §1.673, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing the time for service of evidence to be relied on at an oral deposition from ``at least three days'' prior to the conference required by §1.673(g) when service is by hand or by Express Mail to ``at least three working days'' prior to the conference. It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) to change the time for service by any other means from 10 days to 14 days prior to the conference. It is proposed to amend paragraph (d) of §1.673 by deleting the second sentence as unnecessary, since all depositions for a case-in-chief would have to be approved by an administrative patent judge. It is also proposed to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail'' in paragraph (b). Also in §1.673, it is proposed to clarify paragraph (e) by changing ``party electing to present testimony by affidavit'' to ``party who has presented testimony by affidavit.'' In paragraph (a) of §1.674, which specifies before whom depositions may be taken, it is proposed to delete the reference to ``United States or a territory or insular possession of the United States'' in order to make this paragraph applicable to depositions for testimony compelled in foreign countries. In §1.675, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d), which concerns reading and signing of a transcript by the witness, to take into account that the witness might refuse to read and/or sign the transcript of the deposition, in which case the circumstances under which the witness refused to sign must be noted on the certificate by the officer who prepared the certified transcript (§1.676(c)). In §1.676, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(4) by changing ``opposing party'' to ``opponent.'' Section 1.677, which in its current form specifies the required form for transcripts of depositions, is proposed to be amended to also apply to affidavits. Furthermore, it is proposed to delete the reference to ``typewritten'' matter, to change ``pica-type'' to ``11 point type'' and to change ``81/2 × 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 × 11 inches).'' In §1.678, it is proposed to change the section heading from ``Transcript of deposition must be filed'' to ``Time for filing transcript of deposition'' for clarity and to amend the text by changing the time for filing the certified transcript from 45 days to 30 days. In §1.679, it is proposed to change ``transcript'' to ``transcript of a deposition'' for clarity and also to delete ``for printing (§1.653(g))'' as unnecessary. In §1.682, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above under the heading ``service of a `developing record,''' it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``identified during the taking of testimony of a witness'' to ``identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral deposition of a witness'' for clarity. It is also proposed to delete and reserve paragraph (a)(4) (``where appropriate, be accompanied by a certified copy of the official record or a copy of the printed publication (§1.671(d))'') as superfluous in view of Rules 901 and 902 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply to interference proceedings (§1.671(b)) and require authentication of evidence that is not self-authenticating. Finally, it is proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4). In §1.685, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d) for clarification. In §1.687, it is proposed to amend paragraph (c) to refer to §1.647 concerning translations of documents in a foreign language. Other Considerations These proposed rules conform with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these proposed rules are not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. The Assistant Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the changes clarify existing rules setting forth the procedures used in patent appeals and interferences. The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et.seq., since no record keeping or reporting requirements within the coverage of the Act are placed upon the public.
