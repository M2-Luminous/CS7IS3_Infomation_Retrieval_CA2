The idea is seen as a "fair" alternative to a proposed European Community energy tax, which has caused alarm in oil-producing states on the grounds it would slow down demand for crude and depress their earnings. "There are several more effective and fair alternatives to the taxes on oil products," Arab states said in their 1993 joint economic report, prepared by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and two other regional organisations. "The first is the imposition of a worldwide income tax of 0.25 percent, which could fetch around four billion dollars a year in the industrial countries and 750 million dollars in developing nations." "The sum could be used to clean and protect the environment." It is the latest in a series of Arab proposals to persuade the 12-nation E.C. to steer away from its planned tax, which the community says is designed to protect the environment by containing the emission of carbon dioxide. But Arab and other oil producers charge the E.C.'s real aim is to secure extra revenue to tackle domestic budget deficits. Reservations from Britain and other E.C. nations have held up enforcement of the tax, which will levy three dollars on every imported barrel of oil, to rise to 10 dollars by the year 2000. "Imposing taxes on oil products will not protect the environment nor will it curb crude imports," said the Arab report, part of which was carried by the official Kuwaiti news agency KUNA. "They will only achieve large increases in government revenues in industrial countries at the expense of oil producers." Gulf Arab states have strongly attacked the tax on the grounds it would affect them most as oil accounts for nearly 90 percent of their income. Around four million barrels per day (b/d) of their oil output goes to the E.C., while 2.8 million b/d are exported to Japan and two million b/d to the United States. One of the scenarios on the effects of the carbon tax on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is that it will depress their earnings by 14 billion dollars a year, hurting their development plans. The revenues of GCC states--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates--are already under pressure from a sharp decline in oil prices. Since 1981, their earnings have been slashed nearly threefold to 70 billion dollars in 1992. "Definitely, Arab oil and gas exports will be hurt by the policies of the industrial nations," said the Arab report, also prepared by the Arab Monetary Fund and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. "Imposing taxes on oil products will also boost consumption of coal and burning of wood, which will cause further damage to the environment." It said Arab oil exports stood at 38.3 percent of the total world crude exports of 39.7 million b/d in 1992, while natural gas exports accounted for 12.1 percent of the total world gas supplies.
