FBIS4-190 "drafr064_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC Denies Mandela To Hand Over Weapons ANC Denies Mandela To Hand Over Weapons MB0204150894 Pretoria Radio Pretoria in Afrikaans 0500 GMT 31 Mar 94 MB0204150894 Pretoria Radio Pretoria Afrikaans BFN [Text] An ANC [African National Congress] spokesman, Mr. Ronnie Mamoepa, has denied a statement in a report by police commissioner, General Johan van der Merwe, that ANC President, Mr. Nelson Mandela, has undertaken to hand over weapons used in this week's slaughter of Zulus in Johannesburg. Mr. Mamoepa told Radio Pretoria's news desk that he was not aware of this agreement and that the ANC would not issue a statement. Mr. Mamoepa confirmed that no weapons or ammunition were handed to the police by the ANC. This development follows a denial by the NP [National Party] leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, that he and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel ordered Witwatersrand regional police commissioner, General Koos Calitz, not to carry out a search warrant at ANC headquarters, Shell House. This warrant was issued shortly after snipers shot at marchers from Shell House during a peaceful Zulu protest march in which several Zulus were killed. A police liaison officer, Colonel Dave Bruce, declared that he is not surprised at Mr. Mamoepa's reaction. In reply to a question on whether Gen. Calitz did not act too lightly by just accepting Mr. Mandela's word, Colonel Bruce replied, and we quote: You must remember that the undertaking was given in a discussion between the regional police commissioner and the future state president of the country. I do not know what Mr. Mandela's agreement is with his personnel. Radio Pretoria put to Colonel Bruce that everything points to a situation where the ANC will simply deny the existence of possible murder weapons. The following question was put to Mr. Bruce: Why do the police not act in terms of the search warrant, since Mr. Mandela probably tricked the police. Colonel Bruce replied that the police were meeting to decide on a course of action.
