For the first time in years, one is optimistic again, Danish EU Commission Vice President Henning Christophersen, who is responsible for economic policy, said. A good upswing is just around the corner, Christophersen stated, pointing to his authority's forecasts, which are usually more pessimistic than those of other international organizations. Even if the predicted positive development does not continue, Brussels sees good prospects that a considerable number of member states will fulfill the most important criterion of the Maastricht Treaty for entering the final state of the Economic and Monetary Union in 1997- 98: current new state debts of no more than 3 percent of GNP. The EU economic forecast now proceeds from an EU-wide real growth of 1.6 percent for this year and of 2.5 percent for 1995. The upswing is primarily supported by exports and by investments. Inflation continues to decline. Already in 1995 -- and thus one year earlier than recommended -- it could be 2-3 percent on average in the EU. Prospects on the labor market remain somber, however. According to Christophersen, the increase in the unemployment rate may come to a standstill during the first half of 1995, but it will remain at the high level of 11.75 percent.
