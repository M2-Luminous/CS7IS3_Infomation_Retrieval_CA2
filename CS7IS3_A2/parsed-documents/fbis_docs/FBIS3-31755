Kresimir Cosic, minister plenipotentiary at the Croatian Embassy in the United States, delivered President Tudjman's letter to Mr. Kent Schiner on 14 February at the Croatian Embassy. The letter reads as follows: Dear Mr. Schiner, In the early 1980's, I wrote an extensive dissertation on the history of evil and violence entitled The Enormity of Historical Reality. At the time, I could not publish my work, for I was a political prisoner and I criticized the authorities. Only when former Yugoslavia started to disintegrate, when the communist society fell apart, when new democracies were founded and republics gained independence -- only then could I publish that work, this time as the president of the first internationally recognized Republic of Croatia. Since it was first published in 1989, The Enormity of Historical Reality triggered strong and, unfortunately, negative reactions by some members of the international Jewish community. I was deeply hurt by those reactions and they made me reexamine my statements and reevaluate parts of the book in which I quoted documents and personal views of some writers or of people who participated in those events. Since The Enormity of Historical Reality was published, about four years ago, I had the opportunity or, better yet, I have been trying to get to know, as thoroughly as possible, and become involved in the Croatian and international Jewish community, in order to gain an insight into its needs, culture, and history, its hopes and fears. That lasting contact broadened my horizons and I now know much more than I did years ago when I was writing the book as a persecuted dissident. I greatly admire the Jewish people, their strength and fight for independence and freedom, which equals that of the Croatian people. Especially regarding our developing relations and my increasingly better understanding of the Jewish people, I appreciate the harm that certain parts of the book could cause and the misunderstanding it could cause. I would, therefore, like to offer my apology, both as the president of the new, independent state that wants to develop a solid and lasting friendship with the Jewish people, but also as a man who wants to contribute to that by means of this apology. Consequently, I have decided to delete those controversial parts from my book, which is soon to be published in English. This particularly refers to wording that I now consider inappropriate, whether because it indicates a lack of sensibility, because it is based on sources that were later proved unreliable, or because their overall impression arouses prejudice against the Jewish people, and that has never been my intention. I shall continue to take into account the needs of the Croatian Jewish community and work toward a better understanding of the Jewish communities and the Republic of Croatia, as I have been doing since I was elected president of the Republic of Croatia.
