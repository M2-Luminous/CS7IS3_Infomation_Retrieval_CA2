The morning news bulletins were broadcast, and then all central channels went off the air. Until the issue is settled, the oblast's Yaroslavia company and City Television, which have no debts, will be the only companies to broadcast without restrictions. "The central and the Petersburg companies owe us more than 200 million rubles, and this causes us problems in paying for electricity and spare parts". This is how Boris Belyayev, deputy head of the Yaroslavl Radio and Television Broadcasting Center commented on its participation in the action. He acknowledged that "this action is not the best measure to take, but it is a serious warning that attention must be paid to the critical situation in which communications workers are finding themselves."
