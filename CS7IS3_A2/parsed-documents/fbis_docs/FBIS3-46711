It will also accelerate deregulation in many financial sectors, including abolishing the Foreign Exchange Control Act in five years' time, Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong said yesterday. Meeting with reporters, Minister Hong said that inducements for more foreign direct investments are quintessential for advancing Korea's technological level and "to this end, the government is willing to offer various incentives now offered by other Asian nations to would-be investors." "Some areas, like providing factory land at cheap prices, may be beyond the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry," Hong said. "But in financial and taxational matters, we will work hard." He said the efficiency ratings of financial attaches stationed at major international economic centers, including Tokyo, London and some European capitals, will be based on their ability to attract foreign investments. The dwindling amount of foreign direct investment here, which many analysts say is due to steep rises in labor, land and capital prices compared with other Asian countries, has hindered Korea's economic recovery, largely dependent on imported capital and technology. In a major departure from its stringent control on the business plans of major state-run banks, the ministry will this year let banks work out their own business plans and implement them under their own responsibility, the finance minister said. The restrictive foreign exchange sector will be drastically deregulated for the complete abolition of control in five years, he said. Various restraints in the banking, securities and insurance sectors, some of which have been relegated to umbrella organizations, including the Bank of Korea, will be further "shaken away," Hong said. "Even if the ministry is reduced to a mere policy research organization, we will continue to do away with unnecessary regulations," the top financial policy-maker said. Asked whether and when the government plans to permit the introduction of foreign commercial loans, however, Hong made it clear that the ministry will not allow them for the time being. Between the two types of foreign commercial loans, cash loans are out of the question, he said, adding that if businesses want such loans to help finance facility imports, then they should use the government's foreign currency loans. Instead, the ministry is considering exempting foreign currency loans from the combined credit ceiling imposed on large industrial conglomerates, a measure to help them use more foreign exchange loans for facility investments, the finance minister said.
