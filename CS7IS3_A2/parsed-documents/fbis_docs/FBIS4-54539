FBIS4-54539 "dreeu084_p_94015" FBIS-EEU-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 POLAND Digital Telecommunications System Developed Digital Telecommunications System Developed 94P20677A 94P20677A CSO [Editorial Report] Modernizing Poland's outdated telephone network, the DGT digital telecommunications firm has developed a telecommunications system that should be able to compete with foreign-built equivalents. A page 1 article in the 29 March-5 April Warsaw weekly GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA T HANDLOWA, "a paper for entrepreneurs and employers," described the production of the DGT3450 system by the firm, which was cofounded by a group of graduate students from the Gdansk Institute of Technology (Politechnika Gdanska). According to the article, the firm is competing on the market with "such giants as Siemens, Alcatel, Ericsson, and AT&T," a competition that Waldemar Frenkel, Warsaw representative of DGT, compares with "domestic car production competing with Mercedes or Volvo." The need for digital systems in telecommunications coincided with a similar need to modernize the public telephone network, and it became clear that this modernization can be achieved by putting modern electronic exchanges into service. According to the article, disclosure by the state of its needs in this regard produced great interest among the above-mentioned Western firms. Competing with these firms, DGT also constructed, after several years of research, its own telecommunications system, called DGT3450, which is now ready for series production. The DGT3450 system resembles a simple metal cabinet filled with complete and highly integrated systems, computer processors, and a microcomputer equipped with at least 640 kilobytes of random access memory, a hard disk (with at least 40 megabytes), and a remote control system. For professionals employed in this field, "construction of the telephone exchange in the size and shape of a narrow cabinet was some kind of a revelation." Also proving to be a revelation, according to the article, was the high technical and quality level this design offers. One of its features is a modern switching system that uses integrated circuits, demonstrating the ability to work together with the outdated (10-, 20-, 30-, and 50-year-old) equipment of the Polish telephone network. The new DGT exchange that would replace an old analog exchange could seamlessly operate with any foreign electronic or electromechanical exchange. Another important feature of the DGT3450 is its modular design and open architecture that allow practically endless expansion. DGT has flexibility with regard to the number and type of customer circuits and interexchanges. Last, the system meets the needs of customers and, by employing energy-efficient technology, is close to 50-percent cheaper than those produced by foreign companies. The designers emphasize the versatility of this "DGT3450 system, which could be seriously considered for providing telephone services in the countryside as well as serving middle-sized and large enterprises." In fact, DGT exchanges are already installed in many hospitals, schools, and central and government offices. Because of its economic and reliable nature, the system has also been introduced in some mining operations, power plants, police stations, the railway system, and the Army.
