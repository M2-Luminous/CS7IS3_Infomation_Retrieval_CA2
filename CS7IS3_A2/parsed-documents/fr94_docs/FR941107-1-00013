Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Limited, Avro International Aerospace Division (Formerly British Aerospace, PLC; British Aerospace Commercial Aircraft Limited): Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;163&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model British Aerospace BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, &hyph;300A and Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A, &hyph;RJ85A, and &hyph;RJ100A series airplanes; equipped with Air Cruisers Company evacuation slides, as listed in British Aerospace Service Bulletin S.B. 25&hyph;328, Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically, which necessitates the flight crew to manually deploy the slide and subsequently could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency, accomplish the following: (a) Within 3 months after the effective date of this AD, perform an inspection to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, in accordance with British Aerospace Service Bulletin S.B. 25&hyph;328, Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993. (1) If the slide deploys properly, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 6 months. (2) If any slide fails to deploy properly, prior to further flight, conduct the actions specified in paragraphs 2.A.3 through 2.A.6 of the Accomplishment Instructions of the service bulletin. (b) Within 8 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the inflation valves of the evacuation slide, in accordance with Air Cruisers Company Service Bulletin S.B. 201&hyph;25&hyph;17, dated June 4, 1992. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirements of this AD. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
