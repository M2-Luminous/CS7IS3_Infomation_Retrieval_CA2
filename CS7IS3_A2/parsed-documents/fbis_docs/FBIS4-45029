This was announced by 'Abbas Ahmad-Akhundi, minister of housing and urban development, at the first one-day gathering of chiefs and officials of offices of representatives of the vice regent and managers of the organizations throughout the country affiliated with the Islamic Republic Housing Foundation. He added: These units, which are small in area, will be appropriate for young married couples and small families. The minister of housing and urban development added: This year construction of 25,000 housing units is planned with the necessary budget. He said the average area of these kinds of units will be less than 50 meters. He said: The price of these kinds of units is less than 10 million rials [R], and the budget for it will be close to R1 million. Akhundi added: The remaining funds for these units will be collected over 15 to 20 years as monthly rentals, which will be between R50,000 and R60,000. He noted: The price of the land is a factor in setting the price of these units, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development will oversee the procedure for setting prices and deposits. Akhundi cited rural emigration to the cities, especially Tehran, as a great problem. He said: If the Housing Foundation, in cooperation with the Documents and Deeds Registry Organization, can distribute deeds among the rural people, it will be doing them the greatest service.
