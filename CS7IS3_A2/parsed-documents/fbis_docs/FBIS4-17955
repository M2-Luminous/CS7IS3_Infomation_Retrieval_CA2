In particular, France opposes the proposal that nuclear fuel be included in the list of commodities mentioned in the framework agreement between Russia and the EC. The French side is intent on having a restricting quota imposed on natural and enriched uranium exports and setting the minimum price for these commodities. At the same time, the French do not object to Russia's exports of uranium-enrichment services. Russia, for its part, insists that nuclear fuel should be included in the agreement, the source said.
