Melissa Himes, 25, from California, was abducted with eight Cambodian colleagues Thursday in southern Kampot province when they went to try to retrieve their truck that had been stolen at gunpoint from a work site near the Khmer Rouge zone, FHI country director Alan Haslett said. Five Cambodians were let go on Friday with the demand that FHI agree to dig wells in their zone, he said. Himes and three colleagues remained captive through the weekend, he said. "They have not asked for any money. I think they want wells put in specific villages," Haslett said. "They are holding our truck as well." The released Cambodians said they had been well-treated but that they "had to pay for their dinner" with their captors, he said. FHI had sent a message agreeing to discuss ways to meet the demand, but had not heard back yet from the Khmer Rouge, Haslett said. "We're a Christian organization and we're here to help everyone" including people living under Khmer Rouge control, Haslett said. "We would like to find ways to help them (Cambodians) equally." Himes has lived in Cambodia since January 1993, speaks the Khmer language well and has a good relationship with Cambodians living in the area, Haslett said. Kampot, bordering the sea 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Phnom Penh, is traversed by a mountain range harboring the Khmer Rouge guerrillas at the very end of the organization's supply lines. Guerrilla sorties to steal food in government-controlled valleys are common, and villagers are sometimes taken hostage in exchange for rice or cows. The Khmer Rouge stole a number of UN cars during the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, which ended in late 1993, and several UN peacekeepers were held hostage during the incidents. All were treated relatively well and later set free after negotiations. The Food for the Hungry International (FHI) project in Kampot focuses on improving rural water supplies and on agricultural development. FHI is a Christian organization headquartered in Geneva and operates in 16 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
