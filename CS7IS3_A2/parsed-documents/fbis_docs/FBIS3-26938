Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the report meeting. Members of the theoretical study central group of the provincial party committee and responsible comrade of provincial organs attended the report meeting. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech on studying the concept of development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and on upgrading the leadership work concerning the construction of a developed border province near the sea to a first-rate level. Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In essence, Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as the Marxism of the contemporary China, is the theory of development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping or even all the works of Comrade Xiaoping, we should pay close attention to the issue of development and regard it as a basic task to study and uphold the concept of development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Judging from the current practice, this has very important and urgent immediate significance on studying and upholding the concept of developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. With the deepening of reform and acceleration of development, the inherent contradictions in development, especially the problems in coordination between the three major factors of economy, politics, and culture, have become more and more conspicuous in front of leading persons at all levels. Only when we master the scientific concept of development, can we become qualified and capable of leading development, can we easily resolve the numerous contradictions in development, and can we ensure that development continues smoothly along the right track. He Zhukang said: The purpose for us to study and uphold the concept of developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to enhance our understanding and to improve our ability for organization, for coping with changes, and for implementing policies in our effort to lead reform and development in line with the reality in leadership work so that our socialist cause can develop in a faster and better manner. Based on the reality in the endeavor of building a developed border province near the sea, He Zhukang gave four profound expositions on the theory and practice of accelerating development. First -- to understand development as a socialist historical task in order to enhance the sense of leadership toward accelerating development. He Zhukang said: In the final analysis, leadership work is designed to take the lead in development. Whether we can firmly embrace the concept of accelerating development is a key factor determining whether leadership activities are correct and whether work is effective. The most important point in the concept of development in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to emphasize the important significance in development and regard development as the essential criterion for guiding all our work. In studying and upholding the concept of developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should, above all, achieve a good command of this essential criterion, continuously enhance our sense of strategy toward the leadership over development, and strive to study and promote development with utmost efforts. In the process of building a developed border province near the sea, we should firmly grasp development, the lifeline determining the future of China's socialism, attach importance to the development of our own province, cities, and counties from the perspective of the overall situation, include localities under our own leadership in the systems engineering project for the overall development with a strong sense of historical responsibility and mission, strengthen and improve leadership over development, and attain our respective development targets so as to contribute to overall development. Second -- with the guidance of the concept of development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to establish and form new ideas and mechanisms for development. He Zhukang pointed out: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has not only clearly pointed out the strategic position and strategic significance of the issue of development, but it has also provided systematic answers to the several questions concerning the theory and practice of development under the conditions of contemporary China, thus forming a fairly complete development concept in the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This concept of development is a scientific summary of experiences in China's socialist construction, especially the experiences in development achieved since reform and opening up started. It profoundly promulgates basic changes in the pattern of development in socialism and indicates an orientation for us to establish new ideas and mechanisms for development. With the guidance of this Marxist and scientific concept of development, we should make the pattern of development compatible with the transformation from the planned economy into the market economy and change the reliance on the arrangements by higher levels into pursuit of development geared to market demand. In accordance with new situations in agriculture, rural areas, and peasants under a market economy, we should shift the focus of rural work to increasing the income of peasants; meeting the challenges presented by the new scientific and technological revolution and enterprise revolution, change the structure of the essential elements of production from one dominated by natural resources into one dominated by science and technology; suiting the needs for continuously raising the level in systematic and overall economic and social development, we should change unbalanced development of just one sector into coordinated development of all sectors; and in accordance with the new tendency to institutionalize economic and social development, we should put development on a legal footing. Third is to resolve the conspicuous contradictions in economic development and channel the implementation of the strategic target of building a developed border province near the sea onto a track characterized by high speed and high efficiency. He Zhukang said: The new ideas for development have set new and still higher demands on the leadership work of party committees and governments at all levels. On the one hand, we should accelerate reform and cultivate new mechanisms for development and, on the other, lose no time in strengthening leadership over development. At present, we should make earnest efforts to do practical work, achieve success in implementing the strategic target in a creative manner, deepen reform, strengthen management, create momentum for development, adjust the structure, better organize industries, further improve the distribution of resources, step up efforts to standardize and supervise economic activities, and protect development with effective measures. Fourth is to have the ability to observe and handle issues from a political viewpoint and firmly hold the initiative in leading development. He Zhukang said: To better unify the thinking and action of the vast number of party members, cadres, and ordinary people in line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and its concept of development and with the grand practice in building a developed border province near the sea and to promote Jilin's development in a down-to-earth manner, we should also have the ability to observe and handle the issues on development from a political viewpoint, comprehensively consider the numerous political, economic, and social issues from the political angle of view, and note their relations. We should correctly analyze and handle the contradiction among the people in the new historical period, trust and rely on the masses, and fully boost their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity. In particular, we should solve the problems for the workers of enterprises who have suspended production and of rural areas who are having a difficult time. We should strengthen army-government unity, army-civilian unity, and national unity. We should educate the masses with patriotism, collectivism, and socialist ideas and enhance the unity of party organizations. During the Spring Festival period, leaders at all levels should go deep into the grass-roots level to visit the poor and people who are having difficulty making ends meet. In conclusion, Comrade He Zhukang said: Promoting reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive is a sacred mission entrusted to us by our era, our nation, and our people. With the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, let us unite as one to brave the way forward, pioneer new causes through hard work, work in a down-to-earth manner, accelerate development, and strive to fulfill the grand target of building a developed border province near the sea. After the report meeting, the provincial party committee held at its party school a forum of the city and autonomous prefectural party committee secretaries who had attended the study and discussion session. Comrade He Zhukang chaired the forum, and Comrades Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan, Liu Xilin, and Feng Ximing attended.
