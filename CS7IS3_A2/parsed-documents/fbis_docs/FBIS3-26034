After inspecting Qingdao's harbor, technology development zone and bonded zone, economists agreed that the time was ripe for the construction of a free port in the city. According to the initial scheme drafted by the local government, three steps will be taken, including improvement of the existing harbor-front in the coming decade, improvement of facilities in the technology development zone and bonded zone at the beginning of the next century and final establishment of a multi-functional free port by the year 2020. Qingdao city is among the country's earliest to have been opened up to foreign investors and also one of the five largest port cities of China. It is always in the forefront of the reform and opening-up of Shandong, a coastal province where the estuary of the Yellow River is located. A switch to a free port will bring Qingdao port into full play and best exploit its geographic, historic and economic advantages in trade with neighboring Japan and the Republic of Korea, Germany as well as Taiwan. Enormous economic profits and political benefits are expected to inland provinces along the Yellow River from the completion of the project. It will also play a positive role in helping China to attain an active position in trade and economic cooperation in Northeast Asia, even in the whole Asia-Pacific region. The scheme aims to further enlarge the opening-up of the Yellow River valley to match that of Zhujiang River valley in south China led by special economic zones such as Shenzhen, and the Chang Jiang river valley led by Pudong area in Shanghai, thus readjusting reform patterns of the country and promoting its all-around opening-up.
