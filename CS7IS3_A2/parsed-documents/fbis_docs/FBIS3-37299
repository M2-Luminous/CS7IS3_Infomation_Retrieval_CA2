It was founded on the initiative of Hryhoriy Rychahov, chairman of the regional branch of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine; Andriy Krupnyk, city council deputy; Yuriy Zaporozhchenko, regional council deputy; and Viktor Tymofeyenko, chairman of the local branch of the New Ukraine association. The latter is notorious for the statement he made at last year's regional council session. He said he could prove that "it is Ukraine that is an empire which for 30 years has been sending its politicians to lead the Soviet Union, in which time these politicians ruined Russia". The reform bloc regional branch's two latter founding members also coauthored the Odessa Oblast Council's ultimatum statement on the immediate signature by Ukraine of the CIS Charter. The initiative founders have now been nominated as candidates for people's deputies of Ukraine. The director of OdessaInform enterprise, Vitaliy Voskoboynykov, was elected coordinator of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms' branch in Odessa. The aim of its activity is backing the Kuchma-Hrynyov tandem in the forthcoming elections.
