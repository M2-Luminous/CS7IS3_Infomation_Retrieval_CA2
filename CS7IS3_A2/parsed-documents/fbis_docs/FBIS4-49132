In one of its 10 recommendations to the Chinese government, the party urged that "normal contacts" to be maintained between Chinese and Hong Kong officials "at all levels...to enable continuous and efficient cooperation over transition matters." Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. The recommendations were made as Lu Ping, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was expected to arrive here Sunday [1 May] to attend a meeting of sub-groups under the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC). The PWC, which is appointed by Beijing, was set up by China to prepare for the 1997 hand over. Lu however has decided not to meet Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten while in the territory. Patten, who has irked Beijing by going ahead with controversial electoral reforms, expressed disappointment at Lu's refusal to meet him but reiterated his willingness to meet Lu at the Chinese official's convenience. The party also pointed out that "disruption caused by the lack of convergence (on political issues) should be minimised as far as possible," and urged the PWC to work "with more transparency." In a statement, the party said that "the people of Hong Kong need to learn more about China, while the Chinese government must attend to the hopes and fears of Hong Kong, so that mutual trust can be built up between the two sides."
