According to statistics, Shandong's three types of foreign-funded enterprises had totaled 14,000 by the end of June this year, instilling new vigor into Shandong's economy and becoming the choice of more and more job seekers thanks to their special charm. As has been shown in the survey conducted by pertinent departments, however, many of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, especially the enterprises exclusively funded by foreign firms and the three types of foreign-funded enterprises located in towns and townships, have infringed on the legal rights and interests of their staff members and workers to a rather serious extent. For this reason, people say that the three types of foreign-funded enterprises are no longer the "paradise" of the choice of job seekers. --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises do not sign labor contracts with their staff members and workers. The survey of labor departments showed that about 70 to 80 percent of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises did not sign labor contracts with their staff members and workers, so that they could dismiss staff members and workers any time they wanted. Once disputes occurred, labor arbitration departments also had difficulty in handling them, making it difficult to duly protect the legal rights and interests of staff members and workers. --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises adopt various means to embezzle the wages of staff members of workers and default payment. The three types of foreign-funded enterprises were once a favorite among job seekers due to their excellent pay. Many such enterprises, however, no longer offer "higher pay." According to relevant state stipulations, the basic wages of staff members and workers of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises should be at least 20 percent higher than that of the state-owned enterprises of the same trades in the same localities. "Doing one thing under the cover of another," however, some three types of foreign-funded enterprises included numerous subsidies of enterprises with basic wages and compared it with basic wages of other enterprises. In appearance, the basic wage of these three types of foreign-funded enterprises was higher, but the actual income of their staff members and workers was much lower. Some enterprises even defied state stipulations to withhold overtime pay. --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises are wanton in their administration and meting out of physical punishment to workers. The bosses of some enterprises scolded or beat staff members and workers at every turn and ordered those who had violated plant regulations to face the wall or run around the plants as punishment. --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises provide poor labor protection. According to the survey of the labor department of a certain city, 33 percent of the local three types of foreign-funded enterprises developed production in a very poor environment, 95 percent of them lacked necessary labor protection facilities, and one recorded lead poisoning levels dozens of times higher than the standard in their workshops. At some enterprises, the overtime hours of their staff members and workers exceeded the state-stipulated amount by over 100 hours. A joint venture in a certain city even asked pregnant workers and workers at nursing period to work overtime or regarded them as being absent without leave and dealt with them accordingly if they refused. --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises adopt harsh terms in labor management. The rules and regulations of many of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises go against China's labor laws and regulations. For example, some enterprises dismissed their workers for absence without leave for even a single day or banned their workers from going to restroom during work hours. In view of the infringement on the legal rights and interests of staff members and workers by some three types of foreign-funded enterprises, responsible persons of the provincial labor department called for accelerating legislation so that there will be laws to abide by in labor protection. They also called for improving the trade unions of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises so that staff members and workers will have a place to turn to when they have something to say. Meanwhile, they also urged the staff members and workers of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises to enhance awareness of laws to protect their own legal rights and interests.
