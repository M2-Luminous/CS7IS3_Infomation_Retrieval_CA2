Preparatory talks between Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel were unsuccessful, state secretary in the Economics Ministry Reinhard Goehner (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) told CDU members. According to Goehner, above all, Foreign Minister Kinkel has objections. The foreign minister fears that Bonn's restrictive guidelines on arms exports, which were adopted in 1982, could be undermined by a more liberal cooperation arrangement of German firms with foreign companies. However, in the Economics Ministry and the Bundestag group of Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union [CSU] the readiness is growing to yield to the pressure of the German arms industry, which argues by referring to jobs and the possible use of military know-how for civilian purposes.
