The experience that Ukraine has accrued in relation to small nuclear power plant-based district home-heating systems in such areas as Zaporozhye and the Yuzhno-Ukrainsk area has conformed that such systems are reliable and safe and that it is technically feasible to create high-performance nuclear power plant-based centralized heat supply systems. The institute Ukraine Power Industry [Ukrenergoprom] has conducted technical and economic, planning and design, and exploratory studies regarding the use of existing, as-yet incomplete, and planned nuclear power plants in all regions of the former USSR and member countries of the former CEMA for purposes of district heating of cities and population centers within a 150-km radius around the said nuclear power plants. The studies confirmed the economic and technical feasibility of such a plan over a wide range of thermal loads. Studies have also indicated that the series-produced and modified condensation turbines that have been developed for nuclear power plants at the Turboatom Scientific Production Association in Kharkov make it possible to provide the thermal loads required in all nuclear power plant-based central heating systems. In Ukraine, the most realistic scenario for heating the cities of Nikopol, Marganets, and Zaporozhye is that of creating central heating systems based on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Toward that end, the Ukrenergoprom is collaborating with the institute Atomenergoproyekt in Kharkov and the Turboatom Scientific Production Association to conduct detailed technical and economic studies this year. The said studies will be followed by design and exploratory studies to substantiate the economic and ecological feasibility and technical possibility of creating Ukraine's first large-scale nuclear power plant-based district home-heating system. According to calculations already performed, by 2000-2005, the six units of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant can, even if only bled of 230 MW (200 Gcal/h) heat, cover the thermal load calculated for a central heating system to meet the home-heating needs of Nikopol, Marganets, and Zaporozhye. The projected central heating system will replace more than 2.2 million metric tons of fossil fuel per year and reduce toxic stack gas emissions in the three cities by 60-70 percent.
