FBIS4-55958 "dreeu101_r_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 ROMANIA _O_ Reaction to Death of Chief Rabbi Rosen Noted _O_ Reaction to Death of Chief Rabbi Rosen Noted 94P20797A 94P20797A CSO [Editorial Report] Several Romanian papers carried reports and commentary on the death of Moses Rosen, chief rabbi and president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCE) and leader of the Romanian Jewish community since 1948, on 6 May at the age of 81, as well as speculation about his possible successor. The independent daily Bucharest ADEVARUL on 7 May published the FCE announcement of the death and a photo of Rosen on page 1 of its 7 May edition, and on 9 May published two photographs and a brief report on the funeral. The main opposition paper ROMANIA LIBERA, on the other hand, reported the death in a brief factual account on page 9 of its 7 May edition. Possible Succession ADEVARUL speculated in an article on 9 May that a layman would probably be selected for the position of FCE president but that it would be "difficult to predict" who would succeed Rosen as chief rabbi, since there are "very few rabbis in Romania, and they are all quite old." ROMANIA LIBERA on 9 May opined that the president of the Jewish Community of Timisoara, Rabbi Dr. Ernest Neumann, would succeed Rosen as chief rabbi and that Sorin Iulian, former head of the General Inspectorate of the Militia in Bucharest, would be named president of the FCE. TINERETUL LIBER on 9 May reported that it had learned from "unauthorized sources" that Academician Dr. Nicolae Cajal had the best chance of taking over the leadership of this community. President Iliescu Condemns Anti-Semitic Acts An article in the 9 May issue of the popular daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, which is consistently critical of Iliescu, reported on Rosen's funeral and on President Iliescu's reaction. In an article headlined "President Ion Iliescu Said That Thousands of Jews and Innocent Persons Were Massacred by the Romanian Fascists," the paper noted that Iliescu gave a "surprising" address at the funeral, "condemning in unequivocal terms, from his `position as head of state,' the years of the Iron Guard rebellion," referring to the fascist organization of the 30's and 40's. According to the article, Iliescu recalled a 1976 ceremony in Iasi at which he and Rabbi Rosen unveiled a monument dedicated to the memory of persons "massacred" in 1941 by "Romanian fascists under the protection of the state." Iliescu called it a "disgrace" that there are forces today which are "attempting to rehabilitate actions of inhuman cruelty committed against a population, not only against Jews, but against all peoples and against the Romanian people." He said that he had "lived through the horrible days and nights of the Iron Guard rebellion in 1941" and "knew the families which suffered the losses" and "all the atrocities Romanian Jews and Jews in other parts of Europe experienced and the sufferings the Romanian people endured under oppressive regimes." EVENIMENTUL ZILEI adds that, concluding this veritable confession and personal testimony," Iliescu expressed the hope that such moments "would never be repeated in the history of the Romanian people and of humanity" and stated that "public opposition to the new attempts to `regenerate' such trends is the common duty of all." Other Reaction A condolence message to the FCE from the Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party, published in the party's paper, AZI, on 9 May, praised Rosen, saying that "his prominent personality, which has a permanent place in contemporary history, will be, for the members of our party, an example of a brilliant scholar, a servant of God, a fighter for the defense of the interests of his community against extremism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism and for the promotion of the values of humanity." The youth newspaper TINERETUL LIBER of 9 May lauded Rabbi Rosen for "completely transforming the recent history of Judaism in Romania, fighting for freedom of religion for Jews and obtaining the emigration of more than 300,000 Jews to Israel in exchange for the payment of sums of money to Ceausescu. After the collapse of the Iron Curtain, Moses Rosen protested vehemently against attempts to rehabilitate [World War II-era dictator] Marshal Antonescu and against the anti-Semitic tendencies of some parties and publications in our country." In contrast, Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor, one of Rabbi Rosen's strongest critics and owner and chief editor of the ultra-nationalist weekly ROMANIA MARE, presented a different picture of Rosen in the paper's 13 May issue. After introducing his article with the Latin saying "De mortuis nil nisi bene [bonum]" (Let nothing be said of the dead but good), Tudor admitted that he had a "strange feeling" when someone brought him the "good news" of Rabbi Rosen's death: "My greatest enemy was dead, and I was suffering as one would suffer after the death of a friend." While he praised Rosen for participating in the 1 December 1993 Alba Iulia National Day festivities celebrating the anniversary of the Union of the Principalities, much of his 6,000-word article consisted of a denunciation of actions Rosen allegedly took against Tudor and against certain "respected Romanian writers" during the past 15 years. These actions, according to Tudor, included "falsifications of the truth," the removal of books from bookstores and libraries, and "defamatory statements" to the world press. Tudor also reported receiving critical telephone calls from "ordinary Romanians" who "were exasperated" because Radio Bucharest devoted two hours to the Rosen funeral services in Bucharest. Other commments Tudor says he heard were: "It's a wonder that Iliescu did not proclaim a national day of mourning!" "The richest man in Romania has died. Who got his money?" "Who is paying for the charter flight to Israel [where Rosen was buried]?" Continuing, Tudor said: "This is not the time or the place to judge the rabbi's sins against the Romanian people. Who knows, perhaps they can be compensated for by his very great service to his people, Israel, helping about 400,000 Jews to leave Romania for the Promised Land, the land of their ancestors, which is quite admirable and to his credit! As for me, I have the courage and honesty to forgive him for the days and nights of nightmares he caused for my parents and for me. To forgive and forget is Christian. This is the difference between Christianity and Zionism, which does not forgive, does not forget, and even invents, constantly, other plagues, other holocausts, and other hunters of men." In conclusion, Tudor wrote: "Moses Rosen was a person of international caliber, an educated man, a brilliant scholar of the Bible and the Torah, a character from a novel, a devoted husband, a distinguished pastor of Jewish souls. I think that all these qualities will carry a lot of weight at the Last Judgement. May God forgive him his sins, value his merits, and give rest to his tormented soul. Lord have mercy on him! I forgave him long ago."
