In the annual report to President Kim Yong-sam on 20 January, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported: North Korea internally completed war preparations last year. As North Korea has designated 1995 as the year of reunification, it is making every effort to achieve this end. Therefore, in the event that the nuclear issue--its meaningful card--faces a deadlock and that North Korea comes to a crisis in its political system, there is a great possibility that North Korea will attempt armed provocations in order to overcome the crisis. It is indeed a matter of interest if the moves of the North Korean Army are so alarming that the situation on the Korean peninsula can be described as a crisis, as reflected in the intensified armament by U.S. Forces in the ROK and by Defense Minister Yi in his report, even indirectly. Meanwhile, North Korea on 28 January denounced the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, stating that "the reckless attempt of South Korea and the United States to bring North Korea under their military control has passed beyond the dangerous level" and that this plan is "a grave intolerable military challenge." In fact, many experts on North Korean affairs observe that as long as North Korea is under international pressure -- including that of the United States -- concerning the nuclear issue, there is nearly no possibility that North Korea will commit provocations or start a war against the South unless there is a specific change in the situation. This is because North Korea is well aware that such a provocative act will give a justification to the United States for a military attack and thus North Korea will suffer military retaliation, like Iraq. The Defense Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] also revealed that "preparations are always indispensable for one to commit a provocation. However, military activities of the North Korean Army regarding provocation against the South have not been detected." Nevertheless, military experts view that although there is no direct sign of provocation in view of recent movements of the North Korean Army, North Korea is consistently maintaining the policy of reinforcing its military power to safeguard its internal system and to enhance the authority of Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il as the military leader. The North Korean Army has been constantly reinforcing its fire power, including deployment of 170-mm self-propelled guns and 240-mm multiple rocket launchers, in frontline areas south of Pyongyang and Wonsan, including the Armistice Line. In addition, it is continually building missile bases, air fields, and military industry plants, as well as supplementary underground facilities. In other words, 65 percent of ground forces, 60 percent of military vessels and ships, and 40 percent of fighters have been deployed in the advanced areas. Relevant military officials said that, in particular, ground forces are actively conducting field tactical exercises for division-level units and general tactical training for special troops during the winter training period. The JCS also noted that training activities, which have been decreasing since 1989, have recently been restored completely. Besides, 16 battle squadrons were organized under the command of the East and West Sea Fleets. Thus, the North Korean Navy now has a total of 770 ships and vessels, including 26 submarines, 460 combat ships, and 310 landing ships and rubber rafts. However, its exercise is inactive facing a winter maintenance season. On the other hand, the North Korean Air Force, composed of three combat air force commands, has 850 tactical aircraft including 60 ultramodern MiG-23 and MiG-24, and 480 supporting aircraft including AN-2 [as published]. The number of aircraft totals up to 1,620. By taking advantage of fine weather conditions, the North Korean Air Force is actively conducting exercises, and by mobilizing quasi-military units, it is also actively staging mobilization training during the farmers' slack season. Military experts pointed out that the North Korean authorities constantly reinforced conventional weapons and conducted military exercises this year in a bid to increase their military power, and that they will direct great efforts to the development of mass lethal weapons, including biochemical weapons and missiles, according to their political purpose. The relevant military officials said: Although no sign of direct and concrete provocations by North Korea has been detected up to now, in the event that economic sanctions and limited military sanctions are visible against North Korea after nuclear negotiation is ruptured and that North Korea faces a crisis in its system with internal discord to be erupted in the course of establishing Kim Chong-il's hereditary system, the danger of war on the Korean peninsula will certainly be heightened.
