FBIS3-34171 "drnes024_v_94004" FBIS-NES-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 Pakistan JANG Reports on Moves To Sue U.S. for Plane Deliveries BK0302150994 Rawalpindi JANG in Urdu 3 Feb 94 pp 8,6 BK0302150994 Rawalpindi JANG Language: Urdu Article Type:BFN [By special reporter] [Text] Islamabad -- According to responsible sources, it has been decided after high-level consultations to file a case in the U.S. court through Pakistan's American legal adviser if the F-16 fighter planes, P3C and N [as published] fighter planes, and other defense equipment manufactured [for Pakistan] and being stored in the United Sates are not supplied to Pakistan by April. Pakistan has so far paid the United States $1.01 billion for the defense equipment. If the equipment is not supplied by April, then Pakistan's American legal adviser will be directed to take this legitimate case to the court to seek a clarification as to why the equipment was not sent to Pakistan despite the fact that Pakistan already paid for them. The sources said that the legal adviser whose services were sought by Pakistan in the United States has completed preparation of documents on the U.S. failure to supply the defense equipment on schedule despite Pakistan fulfilling all the obligations under the deal. The U.S. legal expert has informed the Government of Pakistan that despite the existence of the Pressler Amendment, Pakistan's case in relation to the defense items is very strong. If this case is filed at a U.S. court, then it can easily be proven that agreements -- liabilities of which Pakistan had been fulfilling even after the implementation of the Pressler Amendment in October 1990 -- are not covered by the amendment. The sources said that when the opinion of the U.S. legal adviser was ignored by the United States and the proposal for an intergovernmental group to sort out the relevant legal issues was rejected, Pakistani policymakers then decided to wait until April to allow fulfillment of the U.S. promise of taking political steps to do away with the discriminatory nature of the Pressler Amendment. The sources said that Pakistan paid a total of $1.01 billion to the United States for these defense items. The funds were not taken as a loan, but were paid to the United States in installments from the Pakistani exchequer. According to the deal, Pakistan should have received 12 F-16 planes for its Air Force, three P3C planes for its Navy, and other defense equipment produced for Pakistan by now. The United States, however, is consistently saying that the U.S. military aid to Pakistan has been suspended under the Pressler Amendment and that the equipment will be supplied to Pakistan after the Pressler Amendment issue is resolved. The sources said that Pakistan has informed the United States at the diplomatic level that it is being questioned by Pakistani public opinion as to why the defense equipment cannot be obtained from the United States even after Pakistan paid $1.01 billion for them.
