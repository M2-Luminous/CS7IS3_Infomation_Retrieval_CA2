Kim Yong-nam who arrived in Berlin on 9 June without giving any explanation claimed that since North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it has no duty to implement the nuclear inspection. Kim Yong-nam said that North Korea will receive nuclear inspection only when a package settlement is reached regarding the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. talks and when North Korea's special status is dissolved. During the news conference held at the second North Korean mission in Berlin, Kim Yong-nam emphasized that since the United States is the ringleader and offender who introduced the nuclear issue to the Korean peninsula and since North Korea is the victim, the nuclear issue can be resolved only through talks with the United States.
