"The Army believes that it is inefficient to constantly keep the so-called positional defense of objects in a state of alert," Vladimir Novak, commander of the Air Defense Department said. "This is why the Army wants to replace this defense system with a concept that would include the defense of important regions. Important regions would be designated as such depending on where the threat would be coming from." The air defense missiles deployed in the vicinity of Prague, Brno, and Ostrava, which can be immediately launched at any time, would not be in a state of combat alert in the future. The Defense Ministry proposes that the air defense emergency system should be secured only by communication troops and fighter aircraft troops. Air defense missiles would be put in a state of alert only in case of a military conflict. Air defense is being secured by the Air Defense Brigade and the Air Defense Regiment--the exact deployment of which the Army declined to reveal--communication troops, and other units. An elite fighter aircraft regiment is in Ceske Budejovice, an independent fighter aircraft troop in Prerov, and a communication brigade in Klecany. The Air Defense Command is based in Stara Boleslav. The first stage of air defense transformation began this year and will continue in the next year. Another two stages are planned for 1996 to 2000, and 2001 to 2005.
