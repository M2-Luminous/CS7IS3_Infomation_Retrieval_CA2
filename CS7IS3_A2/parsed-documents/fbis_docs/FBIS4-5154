The 702 delegates to the convention, which first met in January 1993, are drafting a document that will ensure continued military rule, the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) said in a statement. "Such a constitution is merely backbone for the continued existence of military rule and the political system (being drawn up) is no more than a military-dominated one," said the statement by the ABSDF Central Committee. It noted the 93 delegates from the main opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) had submitted a 47-page proposal to the convention on May 26, 1993, and it had been ignored. The NLD camp is split between those who want to continue attending the convention and those who want to pull out, it said. Last December, the NLD leadership ruled its delegates should remain. Since then, "there has been high tension between the NLD delegates to the NC (national convention) who believe in attending the NC and others ... who object to the NC," the statement said. The anti-convention group has since proposed standing by the NLD's 47-page proposal and has said that if the pro-convention group is not "courageous" enough to do so, the anti-convention delegates will resign from the drafting body, it said. The majority of NLD delegates have said that if the convention does not adopt the party's proposal, they will send a written objection to the international community, it said. No NLD spokesman could be reached Thursday for comment, but another dissident spokesman told AFP it was proper for the ABSDF to comment on the NLD's actions because the two groups have "many connections." The NLD delegates essentially represent all dissident groups at the constitutional convention. The other delegates represent other sectors of Burmese society. The NLD overwhelmingly won the May 1990 national elections in Burma, but the ruling junta [word indistinct] to turn over power and instead cracked down on the opposition.
