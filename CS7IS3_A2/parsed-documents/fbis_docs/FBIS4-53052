Applications for licenses will be accepted for processing before yearend and, if all goes well, PHS services will begin in fiscal year 1995. They estimate that PHS unit installations will reach 10 million units in the 21st century, but the question is, will the industry develop as anticipated by communications operators, manufacturers, and government officials? The second installment of this article will examine the issues which must be overcome in the commercialization of PHS by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of PHS. The Communication Equipment Industry Council-sponsored "Communication Tokyo 94" opened on 5 April at the International Exhibition Center at Harumi, Tokyo. The event was attended by about 120,000 visitors during the four-day event ending on 8 April, but elaborately designed manufacturer display booths were disregarded as crowds thronged to see demonstrations of PHS. A total of 23 PHS units supplied by 20 different firms was made available by the Feasibility Study Council, the sponsoring agency, but interested parties swarmed the loan booth and there was a 30-minute wait throughout the event in order to get to a PHS unit for personal testing, and units on display could be reached only by navigating one's way through the crowds. During the event, PHS units were loaned out a total of 2,702 times, meaning that each unit was checked out an average of 120 times. Council sources say, "Conspicuous among the interested parties were individuals who are not communication specialists." "PHS fever" is expanding in breadth. All the enthusiasm currently displayed in PHS is being stimulated by news on feasibility studies underway in Tokyo. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT[ and Dainidenden Inc. (DDI), which initially ran experiments in Sapporo, started tests in Tokyo in April and the Tokyo Electric Power Company group started tests in Tokyo about the same time. However, it appears that individuals visiting the displays and using the PHS units on loan did not grasp their difference from cellular units. Although they say the quality of voice communication is better with the PHS, the basic telephone functions are the same. The units are supposed to be smaller and lighter than cellulars, but the advent of the outright sales system in April was accompanied by the release of smaller and lighter versions of cellulars, and differences between the two types of telephones are hardly noticeable and difficult to distinguish. The foremost attraction of PHS is that user rates can be set at a much lower level than that for cellulars. Industry sources estimate the basic charge will be set at around 3,000-5,000 yen compared to 7,000-9,000 yen for cellulars, and call charges will be 20-30 yen per minute compared to 60-70 yen per minute for cellulars. You might say that the foremost distinguishing factor for PHS is that both basic charges and call rates are expected to be 33 percent to 50 percent cheaper than for cellulars. The low costs are attributable to the estimated cost for installation of communication infrastructure for PHS, which, for the 23 wards in Tokyo, is estimated to be one-sixth of that for cellular systems on a per subscriber basis. The cost for installing an operating station runs about three times that for cellular for the same service areas, but a 20-fold increase in subscriber capacity provides for a structure wherein an increase in subscribers allows lower service rates. Because of the high rates, cellulars are used primarily for commercial purposes, but PHS provides conditions which make it conducive for household use. Feasibility studies are underway in Takamatsu city which have focused on that particular quality. Principles involved in the feasibility study include six electrical power company-affiliated communications firms such as the Shikoku Telecommunication Network (STNet). Takamatsu city has a population of about 400,000 and the feasibility study covers an area of about five square kilometers including commercial, retail and residential areas, thus enabling an examination of use by household units. Tests in the Tokyo and Sapporo areas did not include residential zones. President Hajime Mizuguchi of STNet displays much enthusiasm as he says, "The telephone business is indispensable in expanding the operational scope of our firm. We hope to deal in PHS systems on an independent basis to reduce the time it takes for the exchange of information with Tokyo." The STNet test will involve 132 stations, 500 PHS units, and 1 billion yen in feasibility study costs. An advantage for electrical power company-affiliated communications firms is that they can use optical fiber networks installed jointly with the electrical power companies. PHS requires a digital network for location marking, but services can be provided without using public digital networks, because of the availability of an independent network. Of the nine electrical power company-affiliated communications firms, only the Tokyo Telecommunications Network (TTNet) provides telephone services, but the systems is such that a call cannot be made from the NTT side to the TTNet side. In contrast, PHS is a two-way system and has the potential of growing into a system separate from that of the NTT system. Electric power company-affiliated communication firms show an interest in PHS for this very reason. Needless to say, a boost in the variety of services provided would translate into an increase in service fee revenues for NTT. Even in the case of DDI, which plans to use NTT circuits, President Takamura Okuyama states there is the advantage of "providing integrated telephone services based on wireless communication." Common among the interested firms is the strong determination to realize corporate growth through the creation of new demand. All of the primary communications firms are participating in feasibility studies because unlimited potential rests with PHS systems which are expected to represent a huge market. The battle to realize those dreams still lies ahead.
