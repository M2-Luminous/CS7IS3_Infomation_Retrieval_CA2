The Ministry of Public Security, State Tourism Administration and Zhejiang Province have surveyed the site and searched for the remains of the victims. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland has passed on reports from Zhejiang Province to the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan. At present, the cause of the fire is still under investigation. The office believes that Taiwan compatriots understand the mainland's efforts and measures in handling the accident.
