One of the candidates standing on behalf of the Democratic Bloc, Stanislav Shushkevich, said in an interview to the Segodnya program: [Begin Shushkevich recording] There is massive pressure on local authorities that they have to say that Vyacheslav Kebich is the most intelligent and talented. They have to be quiet about the fact that he has, on the whole, brought the Republic to economic collapse. [end recording] [Ivanova] A special Monitoring Council made up of famous journalists and lawyers has been set up in the Central Electoral Commission for the first presidential elections in order to ensure equal opportunities for candidates to use the mass media. Inter alia this council has noted three unplanned appearances by presidential candidate Vyacheslav Kebich on 2, 3, and 4 June. These were not just appearances by the prime minister, but also contained elements of his election campaign. Other candidates did not have this opportunity, an official statement from the Monitoring Council says. Apart from this, in certain parts of the Republic on 11 June, an appearance by Stanislav Shushkevich live on national radio was unexpectedly disrupted. Instead of a dialogue with the former parliament speaker, the listeners had to listen to a monotonous reading of provincial news. Another scandal has broken out around Aleksandr Lukashenko. A truck from Latvia was detained by Belarus customs in the town of Braslav. The truck contained printed material supporting Lukashenko's candidature--65,000 color posters and 250,000 pamphlets produced by the German firm of Supra from Hanover. The customs officers put the value of the load at 100 million rubles, although the documents said just nine million. The law on presidential elections forbids any direct or indirect participation by foreign firms or individuals in the organization or conducting of the elections. All financial provisions come from the state budget. Marina Ivanova, Igor Stanov, Dmitriy Semenov, Minsk, exclusivly for NTV.
