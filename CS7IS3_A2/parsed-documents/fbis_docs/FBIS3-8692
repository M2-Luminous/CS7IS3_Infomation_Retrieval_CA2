Good evening, Mr. Granic. You landed in Zagreb a few minutes ago, if I am not wrong. [Granic] That's right. I'm still in the car. [Announcer] We have managed to get hold of you as soon as you arrived in Zagreb. Would you please comment on these 10 days, especially today, when we impatiently waited for a long time for the agreement to be reached. [Granic] As you can see, after persistent and serious negotiations which lasted for 10 days, the draft constitution of the federation has finally been completed. We also agreed on all basic principles of the confederation, but the final form and content will be agreed only after the negotiations with the Serb side, and when the final set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina is determined. In addition, we discussed interim measures and the interim functioning of authorities. We also discussed the maps, borders, certain basic principles, but no final agreement has been reached on this issue. But that was not our aim. A much more important goal was finally to draw up a constitution of the federation. As you know, that had to be done by 15 March, and we completed it today. [Announcer] We have learned from various sources that the problem in the Muslim delegation this afternoon and this evening was the authority of the president of the federation and the prime minister of the federal government. Can you tell us, if that is not a diplomatic secret, how that problem has been solved? [Granic] It has been solved well. There have been consultations; we also had consultations with Zagreb, with President Tudjman. However, the consultations between Vienna and Sarajevo were somewhat longer, and finally at around 1900 or 2000 that problem was also solved. As far as the Croatian side is concerned, the problem was solved in a very satisfactory way. [Announcer] Does that mean that the president has greater authority? [Granic] It is more or less so. But, the president and vice president rotate every year and are elected for a four-year period, and one year it is a Bosniak and the next a Croat. [Announcer] You have probably also decided whether the first president will be a Muslim or a Croat, and who will be the first prime minister. [Granic] The constitution does not specify that. It is a matter of political agreement. [Announcer] Such an agreement was or was not reached over the past ten days? [Granic] No, we did not even discuss that. [Announcer] You said that the most interesting point now is that both Croat and Muslim representatives, as well as Redman, are stressing that a joint platform for talks with the Serbs has been agreed on. Can we hear at least the basic principles of that platform? [Granic] It was agreed that after the agreement is signed, which is to happen at the end of next week in Washington [changes thought], it means that President Tudjman will go to Washington at the end of the week and sign the agreement in the White House. The negotiations with the third side will then begin. We agreed on proposals for the constitutional set-up and on certain basic principles of territorial division--not all of it, but we still have enough time to agree on it completely. [Announcer] I must insist, was it agreed how much territory--what percentage--will be demanded from the Bosnian Serbs, seeing that they have said that they cannot give more than 15 percent. [Granic] That was also discussed and certain proposals for the maps have been put forward, but that is an issue of the strategy of negotiations. The information about 15 percent is not true. They are now ready to give about 20 percent. [Announcer] There is something that you have probably not heard yet. I will try to tell you what it is about because we have already shown this report to our viewers. Today Momcilo Krajisnik made a statement following his meeting with Vitaliy Churkin, saying that the Bosnian Serbs had been offered something which is, to say the least, very interesting. The offer is for them to enter into a confederal relationship with the Muslim-Croat federation, and to enter into a confederal relationship with the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Will that be possible, and how do you comment on that possibility? [Granic] That is absolutely impossible. Mr. Churkin had such ideas, but that was energetically refuted when we had talks in Moscow. Also, under no circumstances will Croatia enter any kind of relationship linking it directly or indirectly with Yugoslavia. That was very firmly stated to Mr. Churkin, Kozyrev, and also to the Bosniak side. [Announcer] What is the position of the Bosniak side on such a relationship? [Granic] As far as the main negotiator, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, is concerned, he agrees with our stands. [Announcer] When you say the main negotiator, are you hinting in a way at certain disagreements among the Muslim leadership? [Granic] I cannot say that. As far as that stand is concerned, I cannot say that there are any disagreements in the Muslim side. We talked a lot about it today. Croatia is not ready to enter any direct or indirect relationship with Yugoslavia or Serbia, and everyone knows this. [Announcer] I would like to ask you something in the end. It seems that the presence--at America's invitation--of the delegation of the Bosnian Posavina area at the negotiations in Vienna passed unnoticed. What was their role, and does it indicate that the demands the Muslim-Croat federation will make to the Bosnian Serbs will be strongest in that area, in Bosnian Posavina? [Granic] Everyone knows who the negotiators are: Mr Kresimir Zubak on behalf of the Bosnian Croats, and Messrs Martinovic and Akmadzic were also present. The Croatian delegation is also known. As far as the presence of Messrs Pandzic, Kovacevic and Markesic is concerned, they were in the embassy and mainly expressed firm support for everything that went on, that is, the Washington agreement and everything else. I believe that this was their role. [Announcer] And the final question is about Krajina. Momcilo Krajisnik said in the same statement that the Bosnian Serbs would insist on linking the so-called Serb Republic with the so-called Krajina. Can you comment on that? Was there any talk over the past ten days about the guarantees the U.S. gave to Croatia for the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas? [Granic] The guarantees are being discussed all the time--both with the United States, the Security Council, the UN secretary-general, and the European Union. No link at all can be considered. That is the sovereign territory of the Republic of Croatia, and Croatia is ready to negotiate in the framework of Security Council resolutions, the Constitution and the constitutional law. [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr Granic. Good night.
