The children were reportedly taken from the Sainte-Famille Church in Kigali, where they had been sheltered. The radio says that, upon hearing of the abduction, UNAMIR (UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda) -- which was mediating talks between government forces and Rwanda Patriotic Army representatives -- sent government soldiers to investigate the incident. "Upon their return, they lied that the abductors had returned their victims," the radio said. "The truth is that after the abduction, the children were taken to a swamp. There were some shots. Not one child survived. They were killed because they were Tutsis."
