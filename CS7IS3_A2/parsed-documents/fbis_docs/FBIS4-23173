A statement issued by Mr Mufamadi said the delegation, which included legal adviser to the state president's office Prof Fink Haysom, held discussions in Durban with the South African Police Services, the South African National Defence Force and local peace structure leaders. "As a result of these discussions, certain recommendations regarding the emergency and the general maintenance of safety and security in the province will be made to the cabinet soon", the statement said. A state of emergency was declared in the region ahead of the April election to ensure free and fair polling. Monday's visit came a day after six partygoers were massacred in the Midlands. Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the six were killed at about 3.30PM in Gulube location, mid-Illovo, about 100km north-west of Durban in the Umbumbulu area. "We believe the motive for the killing was related to faction fighting in the Umbumbulu area," Maj Naidoo said. Police were investigating a possible link between the slaying and the weekend murder of Mr Jabulani Mnyandi, 24, also in Gulube. The names of the six killed are Mfayo Ndlovu, Mzayisini Ndlovu, Mtholoselwa Ndlovu, Gizi Luthuli, Eric Luthuli and Msongelwa Mgcongo. The deaths bring to 28 the number killed in violence in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, more than half of them on the north coast. Among those killed were four people slain in the Matholamnyama area, north of Durban, early on Saturday in an attack by the Maqadini tribe. Spent cartridges from automatic weapons were found at the scene. Police attributed the killings to a faction fight. Murders were also reported from the north coast areas of Ubombo, KwaMbonambi, Mtubatuba, Esikhawini, Nyoni, Stanger and Umhlali. There were also killings in Durban and its surrounding townships of KwaMashu, Ntuzuma, Umlazi, and KwaMakutha on the south coast. Mr Mufamadi said although there had been a general drop in violence countrywide, the situation in KwaZulu/Natal was "far from normal". He urged all political organisations and their leaders to co-operate fully to normalise the situation in the province. On the role of security forces, Mr Mufamadi said: "I wish to make it perfectly clear that, to be effective, policing must be implemented without fear or favour. Furthermore, in the execution of their duty, it is expected that the security forces will maintain the highest possible standard of impartiality". He said for normality to return to KwaZulu/Natal it was essential that all its citizens -- regardless of their political affiliations -- have confidence in the new SAPS. Another issue raised during discussions was the perception that perpetrators of violence went unpunished. "Therefore, an indispensable condition for normalising the situation in the province was effective policing", the statement said.
