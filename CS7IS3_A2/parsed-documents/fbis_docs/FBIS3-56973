This country will observe the conditions and deadlines for payments of foreign debt that were agreed upon with the IMF, the World Bank, and other western financial organizations." In an exclusive interview he gave Interfax Friday [21 January] he said that "this was also true of our commitments to foreign countries. Our partners have nothing to worry about. The policy of Russia remains unchanged and will not be dependent on individual cabinet members. President Yeltsin is the guarantor of this." He thought that the plunge of the ruble against the dollar in the currency exchange had nothing to do with the actual economic situation in the country or government activities. The noticeable decline of the dollar in the currency exchange Thursday suggested, he thinks, that the anxiety caused by changes in the Russian government was subsiding. In his view, "the activities of banks in the currency market confirm that the panic was man-made, especially by not very responsible remarks of certain civil servants." Answering an Interfax question, Chernomyrdin emphasized that his negotiations with the president on changes in the government "were not always easy," but that both men wanted to set up an "able team of leaders intent on rejuvenating the country through reforms." "Some observers make a mistake saying that Chernomyrdin has formed a government of 'tacit agreement.' I hope that the country will see that this is not so in the first months of this year," the premier said. He thought that the public tended to exaggerate "the role played by personalities" in the reform. "Everybody can see now that the country is firmly on the reform course. What we want above all is to carry these reforms out with the least amount of damage to society, the individual, the family. I do not think that replacement of a minister is a tragedy. I believe this is a natural process. If we had not been confident of our ability to halt production decline, we would not have started this job. There is no shortage of critics. It is people who are prepared to do the hard work that are in short supply. We are willing to do it," Chernomyrdin said. The exclusive interview is published in the January 21 edition of Interfax's Presidential Bulletin.
