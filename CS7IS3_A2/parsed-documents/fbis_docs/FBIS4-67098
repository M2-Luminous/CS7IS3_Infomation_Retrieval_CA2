As a result, his assets in the United States have been seized and his name blacklisted as persona non grata by the United States. It has become major news in view of the current political situation in Thailand. It can be said that this sort of notoriety is nothing new. In the past, several MP's have faced similar charges in Australia and Hong Kong; some were even imprisoned abroad based on those convictions. An MP who was a former political party leader and a one-time candidate for prime minister lost any chance of becoming a national political leader because the United States accused him of involvement in narcotics trafficking and declared him persona non grata. No details were ever given about his alleged activities. It became a big story after a report citing a Foreign Ministry official or an official of the embassy concerned was made public. The story gradually faded away, and whoever was concerned with the issue--whether Thai or foreigner--never provided any details to clear up the resulting confusion. In the latest case, a USIS release claims that the DEA provided the Thai Government with a chronology of the Thai MP's trafficking activities dating back to 1977 and sought assistance in gathering information on the MP's background and assets. This was to facilitate the DEA's appeal in a California district court to seize the MP's assets. The release also noted that a house in Los Angeles and a Mercedes 560 SL were assets the MP acquired with profits made by smuggling narcotics into the United States beginning in 1977, when the MP started smuggling shipments of one or two tons. In mid-1987, U.S. Customs officials seized a shipment. Although it is merely an accusation, we believe many people feel this causes great damage to Thailand. In particular, the honor and prestige of the House of Representatives--which is a major institution in Thai society--have been damaged because one of its members has been accused of conduct that international society and the United States have been trying to suppress. Therefore, we appeal to the president of the House and the leader of the party the MP in question belongs to: Take responsibility in this notorious issue by undertaking an inquiry with the DEA and bringing the MP in person to clarify the matter. In this way the people's skepticism can be cleared up.
