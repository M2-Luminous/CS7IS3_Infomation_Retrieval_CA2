The Abu-Nidal [group], formally calling itself Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC), renewed its bid to join the alliance after the coalition named a 20-member leadership council on Jan. 19, the sources said. An earlier FRC bid to join the alliance, when it was first created as a loose umbrella in September 1992, was turned down. According to the sources, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) of Nayif Hawatimah oppose any membership for the Abu-Nidal group in the alliance. It is citing the numerous attacks on PLO officials claimed or attributed to the Abu-Nidal group and objecting its entry into the alliance, they said. "Abu-Nidal's hands are stained with Palestinian blood, and he has no place in a Palestinian nationalist group," according to a senior DFLP official. The DFLP also argues that the presence of the FRC in the alliance would be insignificant in view of the small size of the group. It is estimated that the Abu-Nidal group has less than 200 members scattered around in the Arab World, but mainly in Lebanon. The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, believes tht the FRC should be given a chance to enter the coalition if it publicly accepts the principles of the alliance and pledges to abide by them, according to the sources. Hamas, which claims to be the largest faction in the 10-group alliance, also believes that any decision on the FRC bid for membership should be decided by the leadership council, which is scheduled to meet in early February in Damascus to elect a president, they said. Other leading groups in the alliance include the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); dissident wings of Fatah, the main-stream group of Mr. 'Arafat; the Communist Party and the Palestine Liberation Front are also members in addition to Lebanon-based factions such as Islamic Jihad-Palestine and Hizballah- Palestine. Their views on the FRC bid were not known immediately. The leadership council is made up of two members each from the 10 groups. Abu-Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is one of the most wanted men in the world. His group has been blamed for a series of violent attacks in the Middle East and Europe, including the 1986 attacks at Rome and Vienna airports which killed more than 20 people. Abu-Nidal was expelled from Syria in the late 80s. His group was believed to have moved to Libya and stayed there for a few years before the Tripoli government launched a crackdown on the group in 1990-91. Several leading activists of the group were reported to have been killed in a bitter power struggle while it was based in Libya.
