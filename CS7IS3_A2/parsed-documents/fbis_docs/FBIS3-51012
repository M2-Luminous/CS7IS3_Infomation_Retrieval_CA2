The incident occurred in the Norwegian port of (Aldratagen), where the (Brothers) arrived carrying a shipment of aluminum powder for a factory located there. For several days, they were beseiged by the gentlemen from the ITF, who tried to make the Cubans out to be strikers demanding salaries. The staunch unity of the vessel's 28 crew members and their powerful response was not long in coming, and by means of placards and statements to the press and to television -- means that were also used by the ITF people to coerce them -- the Cubans denied the fib. The (Brothers) returned victorious, and is now in the port of Cienfuegos unloading 22,000 tons of rice from Indonesia. There we spoke with officers and crew members as well as with the vessel's captain, Rogelio Rivero, who gave us this information for the National Radio Newscast.
