This is North Korea's affirmative response [as published] to the 24 November U.S. demand that North Korea allow nuclear inspections in the first place, as agreed upon by the ROK and the United States in their Washington summit. This affirmative response of North Korea could represent a significant step forward toward resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. The unofficial North Korea-U.S. contact on 3 December was attended by Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs; Kenneth Quinones, official in charge of North Korean affairs of the State Department; and Ho Chong, deputy head of North Korea's UN mission. The contact lasted about two hours. THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the U.S.-North Korean contact in New York was a very positive one and that significant progress was made regarding the IAEA inspection and the nuclear inspection monitoring cameras installed in the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The paper reported that a U.S. official said that further discussions with the North Korean side are necessary as to the specific points. The paper reported that the U.S. State Department officials proposed that President Bill Clinton and the IAEA closely discuss the North Korean proposal contained in the 3 December response. The paper reported that the U.S. officials said that a more specific review ought to be made as to the technical matters connected with the appropriateness of the new inspection and that the United States will discuss the overall situation with the ROK before it sends an official reply to North Korea. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Shelley, in a routine briefing on that day, said that an unofficial contact was made between the United States and North Korea based on the latter's 2 December request for a contact in New York. She added that the U.S. Government will first discuss the response with its allies before it makes a decision on the next step toward North Korea. It has been learned that the U.S. State Department's decision on the next step means the resumption of the New York contact next week. The ROK Embassy in Washington hinted that although the North Korean response in the North Korea-U.S. contact was far short of U.S. expectations, it was not totally pessimistic.
