FR940104-1-00008 FR940104-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;174&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI). This action would require the inclusion of additional airplanes to the candidate fleet. This proposal is prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, Model 747 Structures Working Group. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. DATES: Comments must be received by March 1, 1994.
