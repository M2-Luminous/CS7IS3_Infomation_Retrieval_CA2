FR940323-0-00108 FR940323-0-00025 In addition, provisions on incentives in newly revised §512.11(e) have been clarified to allow for reasonable recompense for time and effort to be offered to research subjects no longer in Bureau custody. The intent of restrictions on incentives within the institution is to ensure that participation of current inmates is voluntary. The Bureau believes that there is no compelling need to extend such precautionary restriction to subjects who are not in the Bureau's custody. As revised, the regulations no longer contain a separate section on definitions. The terms contained in former §512.11 are now either defined in 28 CFR 46.102 or are explained in the regulations where necessary. Because these amendments are either administrative or conforming in nature and pose no additional restraints on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking and delay in effective date. While the Bureau believes it is necessary to implement these changes immediately, the Bureau is publishing the procedures as an interim rule in order to invite public comment. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered before the rule is finalized. The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to E.O. 12866. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 512 Prisoners. Kathleen M. Hawk, Director, Bureau of Prisons.
