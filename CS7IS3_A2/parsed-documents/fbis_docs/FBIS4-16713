It Waits for Subsidies and Purges"] [Text] A State Duma commission that went to Kalmykia to inspect the situation there had to state upon its return that this Republic, a component of Russia, is nearly the Federation's most stable region. No major political disturbances connected with the adoption of a new fundamental law of Kalmykia --the Great Steppe Code [Velikoye Stepnoye Ulozheniye] -- have been recorded. The sense of the innovation, which the Constitutional Conference, partly formed by Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov himself, actually copied from the Russian Federation Constitution, consists in the Republic's foregoing its sovereignty in order to receive subsidies from the federal budget. In the opinion of Duma Deputy Vladimir Lysenko, "all attempts by Mr. Ilyumzhinov to reform Kalmykia's economy boiled down to an international airport project and promises to give each resident a Mercedes. In Africa, too, every leader tries to build an airport the first thing," Mr. Lysenko pointed out. The Republic's economy has really been destroyed down to its foundations. Its basis -- sheep breeding -- has run into the severest crisis caused by the absence of demand for Kalmykia oil. Even the introduction of new customs duties, actively lobbied for by Kalmykia and Tuva, have failed to revive the Republic's economy. Subsidies remain the only way out of the situation that has taken shape. Thus, as members of the Duma commission pointed out, Mr. Ilyumzhinov has restrained his arrogance and finally decided to "get down to real business." The opposition, which hampered the passing of the Steppe Code, is small. It is centered in Kalmykia's capital, Elista, and pertains to the sections of top civil servants. The Duma commission recorded "antidemocratic" moods in Kirsan Ilyumzhinov and his supporters, who are going to conduct purges in the Republic's power structures.
