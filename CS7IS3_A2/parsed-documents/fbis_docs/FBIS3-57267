Kama told BNS today that construction and repair work on the facilities of a former prison guards' military unit base at Rummu would cost about 20 million kroons. The project currently is in its initial stages. "The Police Department says the camp must be designed for at least 500 persons," the minister said. He said it was still not clear whether the camp really needed to be as large as this. The government on Sept. 14 ruled that the internment camp was to be located at Rummu, some 35 km to the southwest of Tallinn. Other possible locations discussed before that date included a former Soviet Army disciplinary correction unit camp at Paldiski, the Harku detention camp on the outskirts of Tallinn, and a former Communist Pioneer youth organization camp near the Tallinn.
