Oxman had two consecutive meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou this afternoon. They met at the U.S. Embassy building first and then at the Foreign Ministry. During his talks with the Greek political leadership, Oxman will mainly discuss Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], but will also cover the entire spectrum of Balkan problems. He will also discuss Cyprus, because Washington is particularly interested in promoting the confidence-building measures. In statements made a short time ago at the Foreign Ministry, Papandreou and Oxman noted that the upcoming meeting between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and international mediator Cyrus Vance is particularly critical. They both said that this meeting will determine the course of developments. It was indicative that when referring to the Greek measures against Skopje, Oxman exuded an atmosphere that was completely different from the European Union, which intensely pressures Athens. Oxman said that Washington is really interested in a swift lifting of the Greek measures, but that he had received explanations of the reasons that led to the adoption of these measures. He said Washington is interested helping to restore communications between Athens and Skopje and meeting the prerequisites leading to a preliminary agreement to resume the talks. Arriving at Ellinikon Airport at noon today, Oxman made it clear that Washington has no prepared solutions, but wants to facilitate talks between the two sides. Oxman said: [Begin Oxman recording in English] We will certainly be discussing that issue, and I look forward to it. Our role is to try to be helpful in this situation. I am not bringing some made-in-American solution. We want to be helpful; we want to support the efforts of the United Nations, of Cyrus Vance. We would like to see the situation resolved as promptly as possible in the interest of regional stability, so that will be one of the topics among others that we will be discussing. [end recording] Oxman will leave for Ankara tomorrow morning, where he said he will discuss many issues, including the Balkans, Greek-Turkish relations, and the operation for assisting Kurdistan that is organized jointly by the United States, Britain, and France. It will be a visit of particular interest.
