The program, presented by Ewa Michalska, opened with a video report showing people in the streets being asked whether they know who Rosati is. Many do. The video is followed by a profile on Rosati. Afterwards Rosati answers journalists' questions concerning his decision to withdraw as the candidate for the above-mentioned posts. The first question is whether Rosati has definitely made up his mind. Rosati replies: "Today the situation is clear. I am not a candidate for the post of finance minister because of well-known circumstances." Rosati says he could not accept the post in a situation when President Walesa was opposed to his appointment. Rosati now intends to return to Geneva and resume his work for the UN European Economic Commission. However, he does not completely rule out the possibility that he may accept the job of finance minister in the future. He says he does regret having gotten involved in the controversy concerning his appointment. Rosati explains that he never met President Walesa and did not have a chance to discuss his proposals with him. During the course of the discussion, the issue of Rosati's work for the foreign-debt-servicing fund, FOZZ, is mentioned. He says the FOZZ supervisory board, of which he is a member, does not have much influence on the day-to-day running of the fund, so he cannot be personally responsible for the FOZZ shortcomings. When asked to name his own possible recommendations for the job of finance minister, he avoids mentioning any names. Another question concerns the nature of his work in Geneva. Rosati says that it was a research and analysis job. Rosati also comments on a number of economic issues. He says he is against state control over wages. He also thinks President Walesa should not delay the signing of the budget. One of the journalists asks him about the state of Rosati's financial affairs. He does not hesitate to disclose that he owns a house in Warsaw and two cars, and that he has $30,000 to $40,000 in his bank account. Rosati is asked about his possible priorities had he been appointed finance minister. He says the most important things are a proper medium-term economic policy, speeding up the privatization process, restructuring the economy, and getting rid of inflationary pressures. At the end of the program, Rosati is traditionally invited to leave his signature on the program board, among many other signatures left there previously by well-known personalities.
