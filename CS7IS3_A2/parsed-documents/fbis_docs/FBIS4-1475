FBIS4-1475 "drafr083_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Terreblanche: More Explosions If Afrikaners Ignored Terreblanche: More Explosions If Afrikaners Ignored MB2804155794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1450 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804155794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Rustenburg April 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche said on Thursday he thought there would be more explosions if the government ignored the Afrikaner's claim to land. Speaking at a house where Transvaal Republic President Paul Kruger once resided outside Rustenburg in the Western Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche said South Africa was heading for revolution and war, but from this chaos would rise a "third Boer republic". "Long live the third Boer republic which is already emerging!" he exclaimed in front of about 200 AWB supporters. The group was escorted to the venue by security forces, and defence force Ratel panzer vehicles lined the route. About 50 armed awb members gathered around a sole black journalist at the rally in front of the house and racially abused and forcibly expelled him, fists flying in the melee. Reacting to reports that some Ystergarde [Iron Guard] members had been arrested in connection with bomb blasts on the reef, Mr Terreblanche said that while AWB executive had not given instructions for the placement of bombs, he would never turn his back on the suspects and would support them in court. Speaking on the stoep of the house while his followers sought shade beneath thorn trees, Mr Terreblanche made a vow, asking God to protect his nation and saying: "The struggle our fathers have started will continue until we died or won." Once the Zulu nation had lost the elections and then realised they were "the biggest nation" in South Africa, the "hell and terror will go on where it left off a day or two ago". Afrikaners would not be crushed in this struggle, but would emerge as the third, civilised, stronger force. From next week the awb would resist the radical black communist government "whom we know are trying to destroy us". AWB spokesman Fred Rundle called on the media at the rally not to perpetuate the "farce" of there being free and fair elections.
