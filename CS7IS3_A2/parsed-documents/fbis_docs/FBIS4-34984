The letter sent in the name of the Democratic Unity Confederation (KID), presided over by the Port-au-Prince mayor, requests that the relatives of military personnel intervene to explain to the military that the Armed Forces does not have a Charlemagne Peralte or a Pierre Sully at this time. Peralte was a hero of the resistance against the 1915 U.S. invasion and Sully was a soldier who defended his position during the U.S. landing in July 1915. "They cannot continue to threaten a tiger with a pin," Paul said in reference to the "de facto" government's threats to the United States through which it has warned against military intervention. The KID letter says, "The lives of most members of the military are in danger," adding, "The personal interests of a few people are to blame for this." KID is linked to the National Front for Change and Democracy, the coalition that led President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. President Aristide was ousted by a group of military officers headed by General Raoul Cedras in September 1991. The letter adds that there is no democracy within the Armed Forces, and it tells the mothers, wives, and sons of military personnel that Gen. Cedras should explain to them why he is endangering the lives of their relatives. "Ask him what good the coup d'etat has done for the people, the Army, and the country over the past 33 months," Paul says in his letter. In it, he also asks Cedras to present evidence in connection with the alleged deaths of military personnel during the seven months of Aristide's administration. He also suggests that the relatives ask about the number of military personnel who have been "murdered, disappeared, exiled, imprisoned, or expelled from the ranks of the Army simply because they were accused of favoring the lavalas after the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat." Paul urges the relatives of military personnel to explain to their kin that they are part of the Haitian people and must not obey those who are ordering them to repress the people. He also notes that they should ignore those who pit them against the defenders of the people's rights. In the letter, Paul says they should ask Cedras to respect the commitment made when he signed the Governors Island Agreement in New York; to resign from his post; and, in turn, to help avert foreign military intervention. Paul sent a similar letter to Gen. Cedras last week.
