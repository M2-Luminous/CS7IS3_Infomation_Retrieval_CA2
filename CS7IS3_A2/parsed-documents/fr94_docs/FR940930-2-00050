FR940930-2-00050 FR940930-2-00030 (e) The Commission may permit small businesses (including small business owned by women, minorities, or rural telephone companies that qualify as small businesses) and other entities determined to be eligible on a service-specific basis, which are high bidders for licenses specified by the Commission, to pay the full amount of their high bids in installments over the term of their licenses pursuant to the following: (1) Unless otherwise specified, each eligible applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit by wire transfer or cashier's check in the manner specified in ยง1.2107(b) sufficient additional funds as are necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to ยง1.2104(g)(2). (2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to ยง1.2104(g)(2). (3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment plan. Unless other terms are specified in the rules of particular services, such plans will: (i) Impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations (with maturities closest to the duration of the license term) at the time of licensing; (ii) Allow installment payments for the full license term; (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the license. (4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment payments shall be conditioned upon the full and timely performance of the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan. (i) If an eligible entity making installment payments is more than ninety (90) days delinquent in any payment, it shall be in default. (ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license. (iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to Part 1, Subpart O of the Commission's Rules. (e) The Commission may award bidding credits ( et seq., payments discounts) to eligible designated entities. Competitive bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures. (f) The Commission may establish different upfront payment requirement for categories of designated entities in competitive bidding rules of particular auctionable services. (g) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of the available preferences or additional preferences. (h) Designated entities must describe on their long-form applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility for designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form applications all agreements that effect designated entity status, such as partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish that the designated entity will have both de facto and de jure control of the entity. Such information must be maintained at the licensees' facilities or by their designated agents for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
