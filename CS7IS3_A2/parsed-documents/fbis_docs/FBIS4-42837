The OECD, which has just completed its annual review of the British economy, is confident that the April rise in taxes will fail to dent the recovery. It believes that consumers will dip into their savings to maintain spending with higher exports and a revival in investment helping to broaden the base of the recovery The OECD report includes a marginal downward revision from 2.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the forecast for economic growth this year, but an upward revision to 3.25 per cent in its forecast for 1995. Unlike the European Commission which recently warned that the British economy would lose momentum, the OECD believes that the recovery will gather pace through this year and into 1995. It is also sanguine about the outlook for inflation, which is expected to remain comfortably below the 4 per cent ceiling set by the government for both this year and next. However, senior officials are concerned about the recent shakeout in the gilts market and believe a modest rise in bank base rates should be delivered "quite soon" to prevent the deterioration in inflation expectations from feeding through into wage setting behaviour. Draft copies of the OECD's assessment of British economic prospects have been seen by the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, who was in Paris on Tuesday for the organisation's annual ministerial meeting. He returned to London early yesterday to discuss interest rate policy with Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. The OECD dismisses fears that the brisker than expected recovery will create capacity problems which could rekindle inflationary pressures. To the delight of Treasury ministers, the forthcoming report will argue that the performance of the economy has been transformed by the reforms of the 1980's and that Britain is now highly competitive and well placed to take advantage of the recovery currently under way in Europe. While talk of a miracle is seen as exaggerated, officials in Paris note that "something positive has definitely taken place." Next month's reports will include graphs showing that while Britain used to be able to achieve higher levels of productivity only during periods of cyclical expansion, efficiency gains were made right through the 1990's recession. Since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, the British economy has achieved an unusual combination of reasonably rapid growth low inflation and a net improvement in its trade position, something that the OECD describes as a "hat-trick." The Treasury is also in the process of revising up its forecasts of 2.5 per cent growth this year and next but is likely to take a slightly more cautious view. The OECD's upbeat assessment of the British economy will be accompanied by a special section in which the government's health service reforms will receive enthusiastic approval.
