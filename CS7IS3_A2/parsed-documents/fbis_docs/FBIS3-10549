The 3-80 Northern Front is on its way to demobilization and being reincorporated into the country's social and civic life. 2. All RN leaders should be concerned about the desperate plight of the RN demobilized. 3. At this very moment, our people are conducting a civic protest through a hunger strike at the following radio stations: Radio Corporacion, El Pensamiento, and Radio Catolica. The government, however, has given no indications of desiring to resolve this situation. Therefore, we have decided the following: 1. We unconditionally support the fair demands of our brothers on a hunger strike. 2. We strongly condemn the government's failure to give any serious indications of willingness to talk with the strikers' negotiating commission, a failure that could worsen the situation or lead to the death of one of the strikers for lack of food. 3. The 3-80 Northern Front has been incorporated into the RN Higher Council, thus proclaiming tight RN unity. [Issued] Caulatu, Quiulali, Nueva Segovia Department, at 1730 on 6 March 1994.
