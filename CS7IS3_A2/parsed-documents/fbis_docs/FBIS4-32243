Sejm deputies and senators of the Constitutional Commission familiarized themselves yesterday with three of the six constitutional drafts. Today the commission will debate the remaining three drafts: a joint draft coming from the Polish Peasant Party and the Union of Labor, one from the Democratic Left Alliance, and one introduced by the Freedom Union. Belvedere Draft Lech Walesa wants a strong presidency -- the president would be able to dissolve the Sejm at almost any time. He would only not be able to do so if the Sejm were less than one year old (unless during that time, the Sejm deputies fail to adopt a budget) or within six months of the end of the presidential term. The president would be entitled to issue decrees, but only with consent from the Sejm. In case parliament is dissolved, the president would be able to issue decrees as he pleases. The president would lead the government, he would appoint and dismiss the prime minister, and he would appoint and dismiss ministers on the prime minister's motion. The Sejm would not be empowered to do a lot regarding the government's composition -- all it would be able to do is hold a confidence vote in the government. The president would be commander in chief of the Armed Forces; among other posts, he would appoint the chief of the General Staff. He would also "supervise" the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry. The president is full of energy but he is not empowered to do much -- argued Lech Falandysz, a minister at the Belvedere. Draft of Senate and KPN These drafts also provide that it would be the president who would be playing a decisive role in appointing the prime minister, whom members of the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] call a chancellor [kanclerz]. Both drafts endow the president with the right to issue decrees. According to Alicja Grzeskowiak of the Center Accord, the Senate draft refers to a "coherent system of values based on Christianity." The draft begins with the words: "In the name of God Almighty," it envisions a Concordat with the Vatican, it guarantees the right to life from the moment of conception, religious lessons in schools ("every legally recognized religion may be the subject of school teaching"), and it prohibits the death penalty. The KPN draft creates privileges for the Roman Catholic Church: "The Roman Catholic religion, being the religion of an overwhelming majority of the nation, occupies a leading position among religions having equal rights in the Republic of Poland." KPN members want Sejm terms to be numbered, beginning with the general Sejm session held in Piotrkow in 1493. Sejm deputies and senators would not be allowed to read their speeches from notes, but they would be entitled to free travel on public transportation. All presidential candidates born after 1990 would have to have higher education, while candidates for Sejm deputies, mayors of towns and cities, and chief officers of groups of villages would have to have at least a high school diploma.
