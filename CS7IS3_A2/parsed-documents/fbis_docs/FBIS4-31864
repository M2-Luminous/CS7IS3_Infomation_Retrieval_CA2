Meeting a delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.E.), Simic said that the deployment of a C.S.C.E. mission to Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) might be considered only under precisely defined conditions, with full respect for the sovereignty of Yugoslavia as an independent state and consideration of its reincorporation into the C.S.C.E., of which it was a founding member, the information ministry said. Simic explained that the previous C.S.C.E. mission had not been expelled from Yugoslavia, as alleged by the Western media, but that its term had expired last summer and that Belgrade had expressed a readiness to renew it if Yugoslavia were permitted to take part in the work of the C.S.C.E. as a full and equal member. Yugoslavia's membership in the C.S.C.E. was suspended in July 1992 because of its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, too, is willing to receive C.S.C.E. observers on its territory, and the main condition for this is again Yugoslavia's participation in the forum, because mutual respect is a precondition for dialogue, Slobodan Jovanovic, chairman of the Serbian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told the C.S.C.E. delegation. The talk brought to light the shared view that the U.N. Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia have not produced the desired effect and that this is the time to lift them, said the Serbian Parliament's press service. The draconic comprehensive and mandatory sanctions were voted in place on May 30, 1992, because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in the Bosnian civil war. In the context of Serbia's southern province of Kosovo-Metohija, Jovanovic and his colleagues informed the C.S.C.E. delegation that government had several times offered dialogue to the ethnic Albanian hardline leaders, who had rejected it every time, and explained that the biggest problem in the province was that the minority's political parties were striving for the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians have boycotted the country's all multi-party elections and are refusing to recognise the legitimate authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia, the Serbian parliamentary officials said. Kosovo-Metohija has for decades been torn apart by a strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement, which is striving for the province's annexation to neighbouring Albania. Yugoslav Minister of Human and Minority Rights Margit Savovic told the C.S.C.E. delegation it was necessary that ethnic Albanians should be made to realise that the international community does not support their separatist aspirations. She explained that the human rights situation in Yugoslavia was no different from that in other countries. There are no massive human rights abuses, because each individual such case is dealt with under the law, the Yugoslav Information Ministry quotes Savovic as saying.
