After the meeting, the minister informed the journalists that he was speaking about the problems of coordinating the activities of Polish diplomacy and the ministry's new cadre policy. In the law on foreign service, the draft of which is already prepared, there is mention of the Diplomatic Service Corps and the political leadership of the ministry. The latter is to be made up of the minister and his deputy, representing the groups that form the government. The minister believes they should have influence on the shaping of the state's foreign policy. Olechowski stated that the road to bringing coalition deputy ministers into the MSZ has been opened up in this way. When asked by TRYBUNA when, therefore, the shaping of an MSZ political leadership could be expected, he replied that this will be one of the more important elements in the first stage of modernization, which will be completed no later than 1 July 1994. The commission, for the first time in the present term, pronounced its opinion on candidates for ambassadorships. It approved Jerzy Kozminski (deputy minister of foreign affairs) to the post of ambassador in one of the countries on the American continent. Favorable opinions were also passed on Ryszard Stemplowski (former chief of the Sejm Chancellery) and Wictor Ross (diplomat in the Polish Embassy in Moscow), also being considered for ambassadorships in European countries. There was no agreement (one vote was lacking) on extending the work of the subcommittee on cadre evaluation in the MSZ, but, as one of the deputies told us, this motion will shortly return to the commission for deliberation. In Line to Diplomatic Corps Personnel matters in Polish diplomacy have always been a hot topic. The diplomatic service was the "jar of goodies" many people in authority were eager to reach for. It was charged that the diplomacy of real socialism was a stepping-stone for the party aktiv. The diplomacy of the new capitalism, on the other hand, is being accused of allowing entry only to its "friends who are on the list." It is not surprising, therefore, that Minister Andrzej Olechowski suggested, as one of the first tasks, that new rules of selection for the diplomatic service be prepared. Let us mention that, during the first six months of the MSZ's work under new leadership, a concept of broad and accelerated entry into the Western structures (the European Union, on the one hand, and NATO and WEU on the other) and the assumptions of Eastern policy were developed. The plan for modernizing the ministry, whose cadre matters constitute an important element, is another stage in the formulation of a concept of Polish foreign policy and how it is to be implemented. As learned from people participating in the closed meeting of the Sejm Committee on Foreign Affairs and in the corridors of the MSZ building, a four-person group worked on this concept, enhanced by 17 task forces that prepared five basic courses of change, covering: - External coordination of foreign policy (relationships: president, MSZ, government, parliament, etc.). - The organizational structure of the Foreign Affairs Ministry (it seems that a completely new system of departments is being proposed). - Internal coordination (in the MSZ home office, home office and foreign posts). - The shaping of professional cadres in the ministry. - Technical and material infrastructure. The basis for cadre reform will be the law on foreign service, the draft of which will shortly be sent to the government for deliberation and, if accepted, sent to the Sejm. Therefore, we should soon have a diplomatic service corps, a group of people who are well trained, suitably prepared, and proven in practice. It is they who will constitute the main (some say 90 percent, others 70 percent) group of ministry employees and diplomats in foreign posts. For this to happen, clearly defined rules for the acceptance of employees must be established (e.g., competitive examinations), employees who will pass a one-year preparatory training and practice course and then be subjected to a diplomatic-consular examination at the ministry. In attaining successive levels (grades) of service (six) and occupying a position appropriate to the grade, the employee will know what awaits him tomorrow and in a few years, and not only will he know where he may be sent abroad, but he will also know what kind of career he can make for himself in the home office, what kind of positions are waiting for him when he returns, with what kind of salary and with what scope of duties. Furthermore, the position he occupies in Poland will have an influence on the position assigned abroad, and the reverse. Rules of rotation (i.e., the filling of foreign posts) will be clear, taking into account the employee's expectations and the needs of the ministry. It is said in the MSZ that each year open positions in the consulates and embassies will be announced. Every candidate who meets the criteria will be able to compete for the openings, and the decisions will be made by a special commission. Furthermore, this will not be a closed system. The MSZ always made use of people from the outside, whether they were specialists (on Iran, for example) or to fill specific posts--e.g., cultural or press counselors. If such a need arises, the decision will be made by a qualification commission and the person employed on the basis of a contract for a specific period of time to perform a clearly defined task. In this way, in addition to the foreign service corps concept, another will appear: numbers of foreign service workers. Thus, the diplomatic cadre will be professional and--permit me a little idealism here--apolitical. But, along with this, will be a definition of political positions that are subject to replacement when the government changes. In first place, of course, is the minister, followed by the deputy ministers, who form something on the order of a ministerial political council because the current work of the diplomatic service will be conducted by a professional--secretary of state, secretary general of the ministry, or something on that order. Certain ambassadorial positions would also be political. The practice of Western countries varies in this respect: from a 100-percent professional ambassador corps in Great Britain to a mixed system in the United States. In Poland, this will be determined by practice. People from the MSZ and deputies with whom I have spoken talk about a two-thirds to one-third ratio. But, although in the MSZ they would like to put the professionals in the first figure, the deputies would like to see the reverse, which, of course, is understandable. At present, Poland employs a total of 3,213 people in its MSZ, 1,831 of whom are in tenured positions. The home office has 917 employees and the outposts 2,226, of whom 904 are tenured. There are a total of 904 "merit" employees, 383 of whom are in the home office and 521 in the outposts. This entire construction would include clearly defined criteria for selection (higher education, Polish citizenship, ability to perform legal duties, high moral qualities) and the scope of duties and responsibilities. There would be a suitable training system to improve the qualifications of the cadre, the basis of which would be a national public administration school and a new State Institute for International Relations (PISM). The old PISM, as we know, has been made part of the ministry structure. The new one would be a center for professional reports and reflections on international relations, as well as a place of postgraduate education and training. Consideration is also being given in the MSZ to a return to the proposal for an International School of Diplomacy, which was abandoned in 1992. * * * This, of course, is not a full concept. The necessary documents, including the draft law, are still deeply hidden in the desk drawers of the chiefs of the ministry. But what we already know appears to be extremely attractive. We would be closer to a situation never previously encountered in the MSZ, one in which an employee would owe his position not to behind-the-scenes intrigues and shenanigans, but to his own knowledge and experience. Furthermore, clear rules of promotion and an open decisionmaking process should help to overcome the atmosphere of suspicion and jealousy now present in this ministry. In this sense, these rules can be used as a kind of model for other ministries. I realize that the method of thinking presented in this concept is somewhat idealistic and that it will be extremely difficult to push it through parliament. But I think it is finally time to rise above parochial, party, and other interests so as to once and for all introduce some hardfast rules of operation. These words apply equally to the deputies on the subcommittee of the Sejm Commission of Foreign Affairs for cadre review in the MSZ. If they really want to improve the ministry's cadre policy, they will end, I hope, their disputes about the past and become the chief advocates of the new concept.
