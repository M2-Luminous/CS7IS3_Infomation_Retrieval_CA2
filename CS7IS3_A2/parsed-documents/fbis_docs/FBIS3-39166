Addressing crowds in Karaman, Erbakan said that the country has been going through a bitter experiment over the past 50 years and now wants to return to a national party. Nobody can prevent us from coming to power, he said, or from establishing a great Turkey. Erbakan alleged that certain circles are nervous because the Prosperity Party will come to power soon. Our correspondent Omer Kebapcioglu reports that Erbakan said: Those circles are those who brought the country to the brink of collapse with their inefficiency. Addressing a ceremony in Konya, Erbakan recalled that the Prosperity Party was in power for four years as the partner of a coalition. He added: We carried out the great leap of heavy industry. We raised wheat production from 10 million tonnes to 18 million tonnes. We raised meat production from 125,000 tonnes to 625,000 tonnes. We set up factories in all corners of the country. That is what the Prosperity Party did. We did not take a single cent in foreign loans in four years. We did not raise taxes by a single kurus. We kept the value of our money stable by keeping it at 16.5 Turkish lira per U.S. dollar. Naturally, we pursued a dignified foreign policy. When the United States placed an arms embargo on our peace operation in Cyprus, we closed down its bases. Therefore, we manufactured our own weapons. That is what the Prosperity Party did, and that is what it will do.
