Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey Province, at a meeting with rural leaders expressed the opinion that every Basic Cooperative Production Unit in cane agriculture should have a tractor and a plow with which to prepare the land. He explained that he defends this idea because plowing must be done rapidly for cane recovery.
