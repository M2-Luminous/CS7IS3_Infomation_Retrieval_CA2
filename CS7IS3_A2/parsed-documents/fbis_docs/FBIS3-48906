May the year 1994 bring joy, happiness, harmony and great prosperity for your families, and your children and friends. The year which is going out was a good year for us. It was a year of efforts, challenges and successes for the whole Albanian nation. At the age of a nation every minute, hour and day is of great importance. But I would distinguish among all ages that democracy is the most important and it itself has its most significant and decisive moments. The year 1993 was determinant to the reforms program in Albania. By the end year let us think for a moment of the position of the Albanian society in the past, the troubled waters it was in two or five years ago. If we do this we will all feel a great joy that our ship was able to come to anchor towards freedom. Thus we joyfully celebrate the new year being sure and optimistic for the future of free Albania. Tonight let us recall Albania of some years ago and if we do this we will never forget the price of freedom we enjoy today. However bitter Albania's past history, we can see the progress we have made. If we throw a glance on the road we have traversed in such a time we will see that the progress of Albanian people during a year of work and efforts is enormous. Albania of 1993, despite the great troubles and hardships has quite completely changed its view and sees to the new year with a higher standard than 1993. We rightfully call the year 1993 as the year of great turning point on the road of all-sided consolidation of reforms in Albania. During this year we were able to transform Albania, the country of chaos, anarchy, organized state corruption, poverty and hunger, gallopant inflation and paralyzed economy into a country of free citizens, private farmer, free enterprise, free creators. Albania is now a country where political legislative, institutional and economic reforms are successfully carried out. So Albania is moving towards the establishment of a genuine civilized society. Brothers and sisters, During 1993 harmony and understanding among people have increased. Both of them were an empty notion without freedom. The human rights and freedoms charter was endorsed and these rights and freedoms are developing constantly. The necessary legislation for the transition into a market economy was drafted, the institutions of the rule of law were consolidated, economic reform marked a great turning point. A paralysed Albanian economy was replaced by free market economy, inflation was put under complete control, lands, houses and hundreds of enterprises were privatized. The growth of gross production is the greatest achievement of the reform. Compared to a year ago, goods turnover is several times higher, export and import increased by 3-5 times. Albania which two years ago counted its witch-hunters has now its rich men. Human dimension of Albanian society have increased and will continue to increase in the future due to the social component of market economy, social assistance and economic support, the reduction of work days and several other achievements. Spiritual and cultural life, the genius of Albanian creators recorded a great development and their talent was in blossom during 1993. But I would say that what has changed more is our psychology. In this way the psychology of totalitarian society was replaced by psychology of free market. Tolerance, respect for man and his freedoms, understanding and optimism characterize the individual and national psychology. During 1993 Albania and Albanians, through efforts, pains, sacrifices and achievements for the establishment of the rule of law and market economy, moved closer to Europe and the civilized world, deserved their generous aid, support and respect. Albania's image in the world at present is quite different. Historic progress was made in cooperation with our neighbours, member countries of the European Union, the United States, Islamic countries and international institutions. Albanians proved to be serious partners and displayed their determination for building a free and democratic society. They are determined to follow a foreign policy which intends to integrate Albania into Europe, to prevent conflict in the region, and resolve correctly the issue of Albanians in former Yugoslavia. The year 1993 was another year of terror for Albanians in Kosova. Police violence, savage dictatorship, poverty, and persecution kept growing. In front of this barbarous stand, which relies on the ideology of crime, massacre and annihilation of another nation, is the civilized, determined and wise attitude of self-controlled Albanians who know that freedom is eternal while violence and terror have their days numbered. The just issue of Albanians in Kosova and former Yugoslavia was presented to the UN. The European Union and international community appreciate more and more the role of Albanians as a factor of stability in the region and today it is clear to them that without the correct solution of Kosova issue, without guaranteeing the human rights and national freedoms of Albanians in former Yugoslavia, the resolution of Balkan crisis is impossible. In spite of our great and incontestible achievements during 1993 we are aware of the great problems and difficulties lying in store for 1994. Priority will be given to reduction of unemployment, construction of infrastructure, attraction of investors, privatization of mid and large-sized enterprises and the establishment of vouchers' market. In regard to foreign policy Albania will give priority to its integration into Europe and international community, the correct solution of the Albanian nationality issue. Ladies and gentlemen, Great challenges lie in store during 1994. But our capabilities to solve them are several times greater. The new year will be a year of the vigor of freedom because a great vigor has burst out today among all Albanian citizens wherever they work and live. The year 1994 will be a touch stone for us. Success will depend on how wise and capable we will be to make use of constant vigour of freedom to step up the development of Albania and make for the lost time. In fact we have a long way to go through in order to get there where we wish to. But Albania is a young nation and young nations have great energies, they progress quickly in freedom. I am optimistic and sure that in 1994 we will fulfil our hopes and will meet the established goals. Let us make use of the vigor of freedom to be closer each other, and be more united than ever, as brothers of blood, spirit and freedom to build a more prosperous present and future for our children and outselves. Let us use the vigor of freedom to raise high the name and honour of Albanians and Albania, and to integrate Albania more and more into Europe and the world. I appeal to all your brothers and sisters, to toast and wish Albanians in Albania, Kosova, emigration, diaspora, wherever they are, in city or countryside, in their homes,in military units, in navigation, in hospitals, prisons or in the border, as well as their friends in the Balkans, Europe and the world : A happy new year! I also wish them all good health, happiness and prosperity. God bless Albania and the year 1994.
