FR940822-1-00002 FR940822-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 301 [GL&hyph;549&hyph;87] RIN 1545&hyph;AI24 Payment of Internal Revenue Tax by Check or Money Order and Liability of Financial Institutions for Unpaid Taxes AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains a proposed regulatory amendment regarding payments with respect to internal revenue taxes and internal revenue stamps by check or money order. Changes to the applicable tax law were made by the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA). These amendments, which are intended to conform the regulations to the change in the statute, apply to persons making payments with respect to internal revenue taxes or stamps by check or money order, and to financial institutions that issue or guarantee payment of checks or money orders. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: Internal Revenue Service, Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (GL&hyph;549&hyph;87), room 5228, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20044. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Walker 202&hyph;622&hyph; 4208 (not a toll-free call). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed changes to §301.6311&hyph;1, to reflect amendments made to section 6311 by section 448(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98&hyph;369 (TRA). Explanation of Provisions Section 6311(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the IRS may receive for internal revenue taxes, or in payment for internal revenue stamps, checks or money orders, to the extent and under the conditions specified in the regulations. If money orders or certain kinds of checks tendered in payment are not duly paid, then section 6311(b)(2) provides the United States with a lien against all the assets of the drawee or issuer for the amount of the check or money order. Before its amendment, this rule applied, in the case of checks, only with respect to certified, treasurer's, or cashier's checks drawn on a bank or trust company. Section 448(a) of TRA expanded section 6311(b)(2) to include guaranteed drafts drawn on financial institutions other than banks and trust companies. The amendments to the regulations reflect these changes in the statute and permit payment by guaranteed draft in any case in which the regulations under prior law permitted payment by certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check. In addition, the regulations provide a definition of ``financial institution.'' Since the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms now has its own separate regulations governing the receipt of payment for certain taxes by check or money order, which appear in 27 CFR, provisions of these regulations referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms have been removed. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Comments on Proposed Regulations Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time and place for the hearing will be published in the Federal Register . Drafting Information The proposed regulations were developed in the General Litigation Division of the Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury participated in their development.
