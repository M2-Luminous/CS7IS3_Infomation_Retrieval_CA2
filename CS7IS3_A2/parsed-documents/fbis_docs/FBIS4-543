The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], dominated by Tutsis, has taken up firm positions between the airport and the town center. According to some reports, a group of RPF fighters -- perhaps a few dozen soldiers -- has infiltrated to the south of the town and established itself at the top of a hill. To the north, the Front took up positions about 20 km from the capital several days ago. Add to that the battalion of 600 Front soldiers which has been in Kigali for several months as a result of the peace agreements. It seems this evening that the three groups have started to join up. We are getting contradictory reports on the way in which the regular troops are resisting the Front's advance. One hundred and fifty French legionnaires have started for home, leaving 350 French troops on the ground. All the Belgians from the interior of the country have already left. There are about 50 Europeans still in Kigali, including five Belgians. Canadian and Italian planes have been announced as coming to speed up the departures. The end of the evacuations and the departure of French and Belgian troops could be the signal for battle in Kigali. The Belgian Embassy in Rwanda is closed this evening. The ambassador is at the airport. All the Belgian UN peacekeeping troops are concentrated at the airport. They will be given the task of taking over from the French in protecting the airport.
