As one of China's five biggest animal husbandry regions, Xinjiang has vast grasslands with over 100,000 herders leading nomadic lives. As they are scattered over a wide area, it used to be difficult to transmit information about snow, drought and insect pests to them. In the past local herdsmen usually carried the information by horse or on foot and that caused losses to animals and property because of the time wasted. In 1985 Xinjiang started construction of an animal husbandry telecommunications network. A total of of 260 wireless radio stations have been set up, with a total range covering over 48,000 km. Centered on Urumqi, capital of the region, the four-level network covers 51 counties and cities in 12 prefectures and part of townships and farms. The network plays an important role in reducing natural disasters and the death rate of animals. The network also broadcasts economic information, and knowledge of state policies and regulations.
