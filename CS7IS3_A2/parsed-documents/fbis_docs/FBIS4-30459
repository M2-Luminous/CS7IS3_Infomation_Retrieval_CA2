He emphasised that the Government was not involved and would not give its blessings to the organisers. "Our stand on the East Timor issue is clear. It is an Indonesian problem and it is up to the Indonesian authorities to resolve it," he said. Abdullah was talking to reporters after attending the Bertam UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch meeting which he heads. He said the move to initiate such a forum was bound to occur as Malaysia practiced a democratic system that allowed freedom of speech. "But we are hopeful it will not complicate the strong relationship between the two countries," he added. According to the ANTARA news agency from Jakarta yesterday, Indonesia had expressed displeasure over the forum planned by the Malaysian Action Front.
