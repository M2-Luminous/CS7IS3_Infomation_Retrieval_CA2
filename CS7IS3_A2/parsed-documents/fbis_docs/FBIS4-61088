This machine, which is still shrouded in secrecy, has already managed to acquire a nickname -- "tank buster." [Donald Duck-type voice] Thanks for the warning. [Correspondent] It does not hurt to know that, as regards combat equipment, the Mi-28 helicopter is without parallel in the world. [Donald Duck-type voice] The U.S. Apache helicopter in comparison with ours does not do very much. [Correspondent] The powerful 30-mm gun with which the Mi-28 is fitted can turn 220 degrees and destroy armored targets over a distance of 3 km with ease. [Donald Duck-type voice] Quite right. Don't let anyone get closer. Moscow is right behind us. [Correspondent] In addition it would not be fair to withhold from potential enemies that the helicopter is equipped with top class Shturm and Ataka guided missiles. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred there is no getting away from them. In addition there is also a variety of other projectiles, 500-kg bombs, and also a device for laying mines. [Donald Duck-type voice] Armed to its teeth, you might say. [Correspondent] It is no accident that, in line with its image, the Mi-28 is listed in the British Jane's Defense Data reference book under the code name Havoc [in English as heard], which in Russian would be destroyer [razrushitel]. [Donald Duck-voice] Just as well it is not the Ripper [potrashitel]. [Correspondent] On the other hand, this top class helicopter is very difficult to destroy in combat. The crew is protected against the enemy by an armored cockpit and armored glass. [Donald Duck-voice] Quite right, look after your own, let the others be frightened. [Correspondent] Should someone nonetheless succeed in downing our falcons, special gear will enable them to crash-land from the height of a five-storey building without a parachute and without contracting a headache. However the greatest cause of joy for our enemies will be the Mi-28 helicopter's sensational flight performance. It appears that it can fly sideways, back to front, and even elegantly loop the loop. [Donald Duck-type voice] Could the pilot be Nesterov's grandson? [Correspondent] Quite possible. Who else could withstand loads of around three g's? [Donald Duck-type voice] What does that mean? [Correspondent] I have no idea, but I was told that it is very steep. [Donald Duck-type voice] And the instruments? [as heard] [Correspondent] Six. [as heard] [Donald Duck-type voice] What six? [as heard] [Correspondent] What instruments? [as heard]
