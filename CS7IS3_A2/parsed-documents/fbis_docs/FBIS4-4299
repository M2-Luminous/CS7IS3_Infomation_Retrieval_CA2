Some 54 ADB member countries are expected to attend the May 3-5 meeting in Nice. An annual report will be released at the meeting and participants will discuss economic prospects in Asia, common problems Asian countries are facing, and problems funding infrastructure development in Southeast Asia. During the meeting, Li will report on Taiwan's overseas investment and economic development as well as express the island's strong desire to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Li said before departure that delegation members will also explain Taiwan's "southern strategy," which encourages investment in Southeast Asia, as well as Taiwan's financial situation. In addition, Taiwan delegation members will attend a meeting of the procedures committee. This will be the first time since 1970 that the ROC, a founding member of the ADB, has been allowed into the 12-member committee. During the meeting, Li will protest the ADB's unilateral decision to change the ROC's designation at the international banking institute to "Taipei, China." The ADB changed the ROC's representative name after Beijing joined the group in 1986. Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in protest of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. Participation resumed in 1988. The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei May 8.
