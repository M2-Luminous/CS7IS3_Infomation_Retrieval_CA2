FR940630-0-00025 FR940630-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 48 [TD 8550] RIN 1545&hyph;AP48; 1545&hyph;AS32 Diesel Fuel Excise Tax; Dye Color and Concentration AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations relating to dye color and concentration requirements for tax-exempt diesel fuel. These regulations implement changes made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and affect refiners, importers, terminal operators, and throughputters. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Boland, (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4081 was amended to apply to diesel fuel by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Temporary regulations relating to the diesel fuel excise tax imposed by section 4081 were published in the Federal Register on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63069) along with a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;52&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary regulations (58 FR 63131). Amendments to these temporary regulations (relating to dye color and concentration) were published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1993, (58 FR 68304) along with a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;76&hyph;93) cross-referencing those amendments (58 FR 68338). Written comments responding to these notices were received and a public hearing was held on March 22, 1994. After consideration of the comments relating to the exemption from the diesel fuel tax imposed by section 4081, ยง48.4082&hyph;1 (as proposed in PS&hyph;52&hyph;93 and PS&hyph;76&hyph;93) is adopted as revised by this Treasury decision and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. The comments and revisions are discussed below. Other sections of the proposed and temporary regulations remain in force until final regulations on those topics are issued. Existing IRS and EPA Regulations Effective October 1, 1993, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations (40 CFR 80.29) make it unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, supply, offer for sale or supply, dispense, transport, or introduce into commerce diesel fuel that contains a concentration of sulfur in excess of 0.05 percent (by weight) (high-sulfur diesel fuel) unless the fuel contains visible evidence of the blue dye 1,4 dialkylamino-anthraquinone. A substantial penalty applies to the use of high-sulfur diesel fuel in motor vehicles. Effective January 1, 1994, the Federal excise tax on diesel fuel imposed by section 4081 does not apply to removals of diesel fuel that is indelibly dyed (or dyed and marked) in accordance with IRS regulations. Section 48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of the Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Tax Regulations and a transitional rule in Notice 94&hyph;21, 1994&hyph;11 Internal Revenue Bulletin 32, provide that diesel fuel that is required to be dyed blue pursuant to EPA's high-sulfur diesel fuel program satisfies the IRS dyeing requirement only if it contains blue dye of the prescribed concentration level. Diesel fuel that is not required to be dyed blue pursuant to EPA's high-sulfur diesel fuel program satisfies the IRS dyeing requirement only if it contains a red dye of a prescribed type and concentration. In addition, the Commissioner is given authority to modify the dyeing requirements by approving the use of other dyes. Safety Issues Regarding Aviation Gasoline No Federal regulations require the dyeing of aviation gasoline (avgas). However, avgas is dyed by refiners to differentiate various grades of the fuel and to distinguish avgas from clear, kerosene-based jet fuel. As a result of this practice, more than 90 percent of domestic avgas is dyed blue or green. Extensive training has been conducted within the aviation community to assure that pilots, mechanics, fuel service personnel, and vendors are thoroughly familiar with the meaning and use of color in fuels. This training is important because contamination of avgas by even small amounts of other fuel can cause an engine failure. The Federal Aviation Administration, EPA, and IRS are concerned that blue-dyed diesel fuel might be mistaken for blue or green avgas. Of particular concern is the possibility of misfuelings in remote locations where fuels are dispensed into nonstandard containers or where different fuels are stored in similar containers in close proximity to each other. Public Comments The IRS received comments from refiners, pipeline and terminal operators, and others in the diesel fuel distribution system concerning the dye color and concentration requirements of the temporary and proposed regulations. In general, these comments suggested that the blue dye concentration level should be lower than that scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 1994, and the red dye concentration should be lower than the current requirement (3.9 pounds per thousand barrels (ptb) when expressed as a solid dye standard). The comments expressed concern that the required concentration level might cause sedimentation in pipelines and engines and make the petroleum industry's tests for cloud point and haze more difficult to conduct. A comment from a dye manufacturer indicated, however, that the required red dye is completely soluble in fuel and noted that an independent laboratory had no difficulty in conducting the cloud point and haze test. The IRS carefully considered these public comments in developing the final regulations.
