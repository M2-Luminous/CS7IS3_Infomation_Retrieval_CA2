The controversial British rebate on payments to the EU budget will, however, not be discussed during the summit, the Federal Government said. Bonn is extremely interested in the European Parliament's approval of EU enlargement by Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland on 4 May. That is why Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will be going to Brussels in the evening following talks in London and Chequers to discuss the matter with German members of parliament. In his talks with Prime Minister John Major, Chancellor Helmut Kohl also wants to address "the consistent moving toward the EU" of the Central and East European states. This was also the topic that Kohl put at the center of his working lunch with Jaques Delors in Bonn yesterday. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt will have comprehensive talks with British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine in London. Rexrodt is planning to visit the European capitals in the near future in preparation for the German [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994. London is considered the first and most important destination; a second visit by Rexrodt is scheduled for 9 July. The economics minister is mainly seeking Britain's support for the deregulation offensive that he wants to make the focus of the second half of 1994. Competitiveness of European industry will be the central issue of the London talks. Rexrodt and Heseltine also want to discuss aviation, telecommunications, and steel. In the field of aviation, the so-called future large aircraft, the joint production of a transport aircraft, will be discussed. Another item on the agenda is the joint development and production of aeroengines. This includes a comprehensive harmonization of export controls for dual use products that has been demanded by German industry. German-British trade declined last year due to recession (- 3.9 percent in imports, - 0.3 percent in exports). In 1992, German imports amounted to 43.57 billion German marks [DM], and exports were DM51.95, while the relevant figures were DM33.16 billion and DM46.61 billion in 1993. As in previous years, Germany was Britain's major trading partner in 1993 (14.0 percent of foreign trade). Great Britain is one of the most important trading partners for the FRG as well (6.9 percent of foreign trade). The Finance Ministry said yesterday that the German side wants to discuss the 1995 EU budget and financial implications of EU enlargement with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. Another issue to be discussed is EU-wide measures against fraud. Bonn denies that the EU rebate of DM6 billion per year, which Great Britain was granted in 1985, will be discussed in the London talks. Yet, it is not only the coalition parties and the finance minister, but also the Social Democratic opposition that wants to reshuffle EU finances in Germany's favor. The rebate for Great Britain is no longer justified, the Social Democratic Party's deputy chairwoman Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said only recently.
