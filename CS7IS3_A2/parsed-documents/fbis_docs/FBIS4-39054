Rashitov: "Defense Industry Problems at the Center of Attention"] [Text] Topical questions regarding joint measures for stabilization of the situation at defense industry enterprises, worked out by the Governments of the Russian Federation and Republic of Tatarstan, were discussed during the consultations held in Kazan by O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Government of Russia, and Tatarstan Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov. The participants in the consultations--directors of a number of military-industrial complex large industrial enterprises--discussed the problems of preservation and improvement of the defense industry's scientific and technological potential, and speeding up the production of civilian goods at these enterprises that would be both competitive and affordable for the population. An agreement was reached to provide conversion credits, tax preferences, placing long-term orders, and gradual transfer of housing and social-cultural facilities into the ownership of, and maintenance by, local bodies of executive authority. It was pointed out to defense industry enterprise directors that they have to boost their commercial activities aimed at selling the products they produce, including exporting them. O.N. Soskovets and M.G. Sabirov visited production shops and sections of aviation and motor-building production associations, where they were shown samples of output, and talked to workers and technical-engineering personnel.
