He added that a date had been given for the first kw to be supplied by Cernavoda, namely December 24, 1994. Unit one will have 700 kw installed power, of which 660 kw for the national network and 40 kw for its own consumption. Dragomirescu mentioned that according to foreign partners the Cernavoda Nuclear Station met all the IAEA requirements, so that a Chernobyl-like accident is out of question. The whole complex at Cernavoda, the biggest investment in Romania so far, will finally have five groups of reactors of Candu-type (Canada Deuterium Uranium), apt to yield about 30 percent of Romania's energy necessities. Official demarches were made in Romania as early as 1965 for the construction of an atomic station. Economic-technical studies were drafted starting 1968 and offers compared from the Soviet Union, Germany and Canada. Political "reasons" and especially the shortage of funds made the conclusion of a contract with the atomic energy of Canada, AEC, possible only in 1978. The Canadians were chosen as Romania could produce Uranium-based fuel at Pitesti and heavy water at Drobeta Turnu Severin. In addition, Candu reactors have proved a high security level in keeping with international requirements. According to schedule, the power station should have started production in 1985, but it was again the shortage of funds that was responsible for the delay. The contract with AECL and ANSALDO -- an Italian partner for the installation of the classical parts of the station -- expired. The investment was halted soon after December 1989. A new contract between the power utility RENEL and the AECL-ANSALDO consortium was concluded in 1991, stipulating supervision of the building of reactor one, re-building of reactor two, preservation of units 3,4 and 5. A new stage will be December 1994 when unit one starts operation, to be followed by the commercial exploitation of the station for 18 months. All this is going to be paralleled by the training of Romanian personnel in Canada. The contract was accompanied by two credits, by a Canadian Bank and an Italian one respectively, totalling $410 million. It is worth mentioning that a change has been made in the atomic programme, with efforts concentrated on unit one, with unit two scheduled to be completed in 1995 and the other three between 1997 and 1999, while the groups under operation supply money necessary for construction.
