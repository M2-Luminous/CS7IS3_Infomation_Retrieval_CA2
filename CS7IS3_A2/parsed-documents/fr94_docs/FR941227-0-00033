FR941227-0-00033 FR941227-0-00007 Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;9100 to read as follows: 94&hyph;26&hyph;04 Jetstream Aircraft Limited: Amendment 39&hyph;9100. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849. Applicability: Model 4101 airplanes having constructors numbers 41004 and subsequent; on which Modification JM41307A or JM41307B has not been installed previously; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (e) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), perform a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994. (1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. (2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. Note 2: Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections contained in paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. Therefore, for operators that have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection in accordance with AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, paragraph (a) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 7 days after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. (b) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), adjust the aileron secondary stop in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control system in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994.
