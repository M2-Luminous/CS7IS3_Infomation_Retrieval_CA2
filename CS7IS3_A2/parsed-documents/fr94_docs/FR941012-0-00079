FR941012-0-00079 FR941012-0-00011 One hearing participant said that manufacturers do provide instructions with new equipment, but used machines that are sold may have no instructions (Tr. OR 31). However, two hearing participants said that replacement instructions are available either from the manufacturer or the dealer, and therefore, they have had no more difficulty in obtaining instructions than in acquiring any machine replacement part (Tr. W1 201, OR 197). OSHA therefore believes that the requirement that instructions for machine be maintained will not be burdensome for employers, even where employers must obtain replacement copies from the manufacturer. 8. Riders. In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether trainers should be permitted to ride on machines to observe operator performance. The pulpwood logging standard prohibited riders or observers from riding on machines unless seating and other protection were provided. The proposed standard continued that prohibition. Many commenters supported the current and proposed prohibition of riders on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 202, 205, 235, W2 227, OR 155, 169). These commenters said riders should be prohibited, unless protection is provided since they are exposed to the same hazards as machine operators, for whom seating, seat belts and other protection is required. NIOSH, for example, supported the prohibition for the following reasons: Many logging operations occur on rough terrain which would expose any rider to a high risk of injury or death. Serious errors made by a trainer or trainee under these conditions endangers both people; it must be recognized that logging equipment is not designed for training purposes (i.e., the trainer cannot take control of the equipment from the trainee in a safe, orderly fashion) (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH therefore recommended that training be conducted and completed in pre-worksite training where the environment can be ``controlled'' instead of the employer conducting ``on- the-job'' training with machines that are not designed to carry passengers safely. Another commenter agreed that the necessary operator training should be given, and the operator should be afforded the opportunity to practice on level ground, before the operator moves into work areas. This training and practice would allow operators to become proficient without requiring trainers to ride on the machines (Tr. OR 155). Two commenters, including one who supported the exemption for trainers, stated that it was not absolutely necessary to have the trainer riding on the machine in order to maintain communication with the machine operator (Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. W2 227). They said communication could be accomplished through radio contact (one-way or two-way radios), thus allowing the trainer to remain in a safe location on the ground. One of the commenters pointed out that this method is currently used in logging operations in Scandinavian countries (Tr. W2 227).
