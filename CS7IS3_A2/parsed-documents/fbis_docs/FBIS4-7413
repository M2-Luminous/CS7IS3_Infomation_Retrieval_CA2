FBIS4-7413 "dreas083_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S.-DPRK Working-Level Contact Reported U.S.-DPRK Working-Level Contact Reported SK2904001194 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2200 GMT 28 Apr 94 SK2904001194 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [YONHAP report from New York] [Text] The United States and North Korea held a working-level contact in New York early this morning and intensively discussed the presence of an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team when North Korea replaces nuclear fuel rods, the additional inspection of a radiochemical experimental power station in Yongbyon, and the creation of conditions for holding a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Kim Chong-so, deputy ambassador at the North Korean mission to the United Nations, said that a contact with the U.S. side will be held today, and confirmed that dialogue between the United States and North Korea has been resumed. Today's working contact is to be held after two months since the last U.S.-North Korean contact was held on 25 February, when the two sides agreed on the principle of inspecting declared nuclear facilities in North Korea. Tom Hubbard, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state, and other officials attended the contact for the U.S. side, and Kim Chong-so, deputy ambassador, and Han Song-yol, political councilor, represented the North Korean side. At the contact, the U.S. side urged North Korea to allow an additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental power station and to create conditions for a third round of talks, stressing that the ROK side already withdrew the demand for the exchange of North-South special envoys--a condition for the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks--and showed flexibility. The United States also pointed out that North Korean nuclear activities should be frozen while the U.S.-North Korean dialogue is ongoing, and asked the North Korean side not to load [changchak] fuel rods again in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The United States requested that the presence and inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team be sufficiently guaranteed. The North Korean side, however, claimed that it kept all of the promises it made previously, including allowing all inspections to ensure continuity of safeguards of nuclear facilities. Thus, North Korea showed the position of resolving the issue of additional inspections, the issue of supporting the work of turning North Korean nuclear facilities into light-water reactors, and the issue of improving U.S.-North Korean relations, in a package, by convening the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks at an early date.
