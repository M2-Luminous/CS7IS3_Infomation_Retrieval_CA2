Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul called on General Raoul Cedras to step down because, otherwise, "the sanctions will be very, very hard on us.... It would be the end of the country.... And worse, we are threatened by a military invasion." Because of the repression and precarious security situation prevailing in Haiti, the Revolutionary Front for the Advance and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH], a paramilitary organization identified with the Army, has turned against its sponsors. FRAPH leader Louis Jodel Chamblain reported he was the victim of an attack two days ago. "If I, Chamblain, am not safe, then no Haitian can feel safe. No one can speak up in the country. It is time to put an end to all this." For this reason, he requested the international community's support in guaranteeing the safety of all political leaders in the country. The OAS-UN civilian delegation and other international organizations blame FRAPH for much of the violence and repression against popular organizations and Aristide's followers. FRAPH has also been blamed for setting up a demonstration in October 1993 to protest the arrival of the USS Harlan County, which was carrying the first contingent of UN Mission for Haiti military technicians. Wednesday night, the Army demonstrated it is powerless to ensure even its own security, when 10 men broke into Army Headquarters and staged a shoot-out with the soldiers on duty. The individuals succeeded in escaping from the military installation, and none of them were arrested. A report of the incident said the men "displayed military training and knowledge." According to unofficial reports, most of the soldiers fled from the police quarters across the street from Army Headquarters as soon as they heard about the incident. One source said: "All of the policemen fled in civilian clothing and without weapons. They had no intention of defending either their quarters or their posts." Several observers on the island noted that, if the military cannot keep a small group of men from attacking its own installations, "what could it possibly do against the Marines?"
