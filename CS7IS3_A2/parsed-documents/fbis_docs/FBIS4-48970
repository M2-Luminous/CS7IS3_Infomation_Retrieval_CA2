Like Taiwan people, we were shocked and grief-stricken when the bad news arrived. We hoped sincerely that there would be full cooperation between authorities on both sides of the strait in handling this unfortunate incident and dealing properly with its aftermath, making sure that this tourist misadventure would not affect relations across the straits. After the incident, from what information I could gather, I think that concerned mainland authorities are handling this matter seriously. The State Council persons-in-charge, its Taiwan Affairs Office, National Tourism Administration, and Zhejiang Provincial Government and concerned departments, have taken the tourist accident very seriously. Luo Gan, State Council General Office secretary general, instructed Zhejiang Province officials on the morning of 2 April to quickly find out the cause of the fire, ascertain the number of deaths, organize salvage operations, and deal with the aftermath of the fire. The Zhejiang Province officials put together a top team to direct the rescue effort and begin investigations at the scene, search for bodies, and provide every possible convenience for relatives of the victims. Concerned mainland departments are continuing their work to settle problems arising from the incident, and their work has won the understanding of relatives of the victims. Now, the bodies of victims have all gone through funeral rites and have been cremated and the ashes brought back to Taiwan by victims' relatives. Concerned departments are investigating causes behind the Qiandao pleasure boat fire incident and will release the results as soon as possible. Concerned departments will learn from the experience of this extraordinarily serious incident, heighten safety awareness, tighten safety measures, plug all loopholes, take preventive measures, and create good tourist conditions and environment in order to better serve overseas and domestic tourists. Taiwan people were grieved by the unfortunate incident befalling on the 24 Taiwan compatriots. Media on the island over the last few days have given extensive coverage to the responses by Taiwan society, the strong objections of the island's ruling force, and speculations on the causes of the incident. Many Taiwan newspapers ran dispatches sent by reporters from the scene of the incident. I think Taiwan's enormous reaction to the serious incident was perfectly understandable. Human lives are a serious matter; and mainland tourist, transport, public security departments should listen seriously to criticisms and views and meet the reasonable demands of victims's relatives in order to ease their minds. The Qiandao pleasure boat fire was a tourist accident of rarely seen seriousness and complication. This is precisely the reason we should remain objective and calm in our approach and should not be emotional, much less politicize the incident and make moves detrimental to cross-strait relations. Recent speeches and actions by some leaders of Taiwan have caused concern among people on the island. A Taiwanese writer pointed out in a newspaper article that tourist accidents are social, not political matters. If both officials and society wanted to cut down cross-strait mutual help because of the incident, it would be like refraining from eating for fear of choking and would revert the situation to before the "lifting of martial law." Tourist accidents can happen at Qiandao Lake as easily as anywhere else. A high-level Taiwan "economic ministry" official asked Taiwan businessmen to temporarily suspend mainland investment in the aftermath of Qiandao incident. The demand was opposed by high-level personnel with the "Society for Taiwan Economic Building," who believed Qiandao to be an "isolated incident," and cross-strait economic ties and trade are the trend of the times. He also said that it was too early to make the conclusion that the Qiandao incident would affect cross-strait economic ties and trade. The trend shows that cross-strait economic ties and trade should continue to develop on the basis of mutual benefits, and authorities can only play a facilitating role. I believe that the views of the above-mentioned two Taiwan personnel are quite perceptive and wise observations on the Qiandao incident. My wish is to see concerted efforts from both shores to increase mutual trust, so that the shadow cast by the unfortunate Qiandao incident on cross-strait relations will disappear, the benevolent dynamic between the two shores can be maintained, and cross-strait relations can continue to develop.
