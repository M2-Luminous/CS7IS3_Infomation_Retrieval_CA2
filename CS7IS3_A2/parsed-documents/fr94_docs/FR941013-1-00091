FR941013-1-00091 FR941013-1-00013 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 1827 and 1852 [NFS Case 940013] RIN 2700&hyph;AB72 NASA FAR Supplement; Assignment of Copyright in Software AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Acquisition Liaison Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This is a revision of the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), to allow the Contracting Officer to direct the Contractor to establish claim to copyright in computer software and assign the copyright to the Government or another party. Assignment to the Government can only be directed when the Contractor has not previously been granted permission to establish copyright on its own behalf. This is needed because existing contract clauses do not provide this authority for some types of contracts. DATES: Comments are due on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Acquisition Liaison Division (Code HP/Beck), Washington, DC 20546. Please cite HP number 940013 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nina Lawrence, (202) 358&hyph;2424, or David K. Beck, (202) 358&hyph;0482. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background FAR clause 52.227&hyph;14, Rights in Data_General, as modified by the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), currently allows contractors to establish copyright in software developed under the contract. The clause also currently requires contractors to obtain the Contracting Officer's permission prior to exercising this right. This revision will not restrict this right. However, if a contractor is not interested in obtaining copyright, or developing the software, and is unwilling to assign the copyright to NASA or its designee, no copyright can be claimed for the software. In many, if not most, cases this does not matter. However, in some situations where further development of software is needed before the software can be marketed, the U.S. private sector may be unwilling to invest in developing and marketing the software without the availability of copyright protection. This revision will provide authority to acquire assignments of copyright in such situations. It is NASA's intent to announce to the public the availability of licensable software and the criteria which will be utilized in selecting licensees. Exclusive and partially exclusive licenses will be granted only after public notice and opportunity to file written objections. FAR 27.404(g)(3) authorizes agencies to include contractual requirements to assign copyright to the Government or another party. The FAR further directs that any such requirements established by agencies should be added to clause 52.227&hyph;14, Right in Data_General. This authority is the same as is presently contained in FAR clause 52.227&hyph;17, Rights in Data_Special Works. That clause is specifically tailored for acquisitions where data is the main deliverable; it lacks many elements necessary in contracts involving a mix of deliverables. The proposed revision will result in a clause that more appropriately addresses NASA's needs in acquisitions involving mixed deliverables. Further, with the increased emphasis in recent years on promoting U.S. competitiveness and the commercialization of Government-generated technology, it is important that we take steps to protect computer software that has a significant technology transfer value. The availability of copyright protection will enable NASA to enhance U.S. competitiveness and more effectively transfer valuable computer software technology. This revision does not apply to or affect contracts for basic or applied research with a university or college (see NFS 1827.404(e)(1) or 1827.409(e)). B. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This regulation is needed on an urgent and compelling basis because valuable computer software developed under NASA contracts may become part of the public domain, and thereby lose its value, if the software is not copyrighted. Current regulations grant the contractor the right to request permission to establish copyright, but there is no procedure to force the contractor to exercise that right or to transfer the copyright to the Government. The regulation meets the need, i.e., provides protection for the software's value, by allowing NASA to direct the contractor to establish copyright and assign the copyright to NASA or another party. The potential costs for this regulatory action are limited to the nominal costs involved in establishing and transferring copyright. These costs may vary, but are estimated to be less than $100 per copyright, and it is anticipated that less than 10 contractors annually would each be required to incur this expense one time. Because the contracts under which valuable software is likely to be developed are usually cost-reimbursable research and development contracts, the costs for copyright and transfer would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the value of the protected software; this value cannot be measured, as it depends on future discoveries and developments. This value cannot be considered to be taken away from contractors, because it never belonged to them. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the NASA FAR Supplement do not impose any new recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or new collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act
