FR941230-0-00074 FR941230-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Part 219 [Docket No. RSOR&hyph;6; Notice No. 41] RIN 2130&hyph;AA81 Random Drug Testing; Reduction of 1995 Minimum Testing Rate and Post-Accident Toxicological Testing; Testing Kit Replacement AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT. ACTION: Notices. SUMMARY: The Federal Railroad Administrator (Administrator) has determined that the minimum annual random drug testing rate for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 will be 25 percent of covered railroad employees. This is a reduction from 50 percent to 25 percent and is based on data from 1992 and 1993 railroad annual reports which shows that good cause exists to decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees beginning January 1, 1995. This notice also provides interim procedures to be followed until FRA amends Appendix C to part 219 to modify its post-accident testing procedures, toxicology kits, instructions, and forms to accommodate mandatory urine split sample testing and optional breath alcohol testing. FRA intends to amend Appendix C and have new post-accident testing kits available by February 28, 1995. DATES: 1. Beginning January 1, 1995, the minimum annual random drug testing rate is 25 percent of covered railroad employees. This rate is the minimum rate for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995. 2. FRA will publish a notice amending Appendix C to part 219 to accommodate mandatory urine split sample testing and optional breath alcohol testing. For now, however, railroads should continue to follow the procedures contained in the current Appendix C. 3. As previously published, beginning January 1, 1995, the threshold amount of railroad property damage rises to $1,000,000 for major train accidents and $150,000 for impact accidents. 4. No later than January 10, 1995, railroads are asked to provide FRA with information as to the number of kits to be replaced, the mailing address where the new post-accident toxicology kits are to be sent, and the name and telephone number of a responsible officer at each location. ADDRESSES: Any questions or comments regarding this notice should be submitted to D. Lamar Allen, FRA Alcohol and Drug Program Manager, Office of Safety Enforcement, Operating Practices Division, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 8314, Washington, D.C. 20590.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Administrator's Determination of 1995 Random Drug Testing Rate On December 2, 1994, FRA, together with the Office of the Secretary, the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, published a final rule authorizing each operating administration to lower its minimum random drug testing rate to 25 percent if its industry-wide random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent for two calendar years while testing at 50 percent (59 FR 62218). The operating administration would return the rate to 50 percent if the random positive rate for its industry is 1.0 percent or higher in any subsequent calendar year. The industry-wide random positive rate for each transportation industry would be calculated from data submitted to each operating administration and announced yearly by each administration's respective Administrator.
