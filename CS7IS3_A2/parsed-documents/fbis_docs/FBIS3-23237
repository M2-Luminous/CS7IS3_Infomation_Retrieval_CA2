"Since we look Jewish, our squad has one single objective -- to kidnap soldiers and civilians, and we have been training for that." The interview with squad members was held after numerous coordination attempts and under prearranged conditions. The place: a safe house in Gaza. The squad members: Muhammad Hasan, 22; 'Ali Salim, 24; and Ahmad 'Abdallah, 21. All the names are aliases. Ahmad 'Abdallah is the spokesman, and the other two squad members listen attentively without saying a word. Ahmad looks Israeli in every way. The three squad members are not fugitives, and are therefore free to operate inside Israel. Ahmad 'Abdallah is a product of the intifadah. Like many of his fellow Palestinians, he joined Fatah in the course of the intifadah. He says: "Even then, as a boy, I was very conscious of the need to liberate Palestine from occupation at any price." Like most of his friends, he was arrested in 1992, tried, and incarcerated for six months in Qezi'ot under administrative orders. The reversal in his life occurred in prison. One day his Fatah commander, who was also in prison, asked him to tell his Israeli interrogators that it was he who had recruited 'Abdallah to Fatah. 'Abdallah, an intelligent young man, understood right away what lay behind the odd request. During the intifadah, "recruiters" received funds from PLO headquarters for every new recruit to the organization. The money was intended for operational uses only, but 'Abdallah's commander sought to increase his list of recruited activists in a bid to make personal gains. "Did I throw stones and Molotov cocktails for money?" 'Abdallah asked him. "You are a traitor and you are greedy. I was a fool to trust you and to believe you were a good man. I made a mistake." There was a confidence crisis between them, and Ahmad 'Abdallah quit Fatah and approached the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] commanders in prison with a request to join their organization. "They told me: 'Finish your prison term, and then we will decide.'" In December 1992, 'Abdallah was released from prison. "About a month later, three people approached me. They told me they were from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, that they had been following me during that month, and that they liked me. They said I met their demands and asked me to become religious and to undergo some arduous training. At first, I was given simple tasks. At their request, I painted slogans on walls, but my aim was to be admitted into the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's operational activities. I did all they asked me. I wanted to realize my dream of becoming a fallen soldier." "In April 1993, they decided to recruit me into the organization's military system. Three people came to me and got me into a car. I was very glad. Afterward we would go out to practice in orchards. The training was hard. We did physical fitness training, learned how to use weapons, and they taught me hand-to-hand combat. I was happy. I felt I was doing something for my people. I wanted to excel. I would drive near Army outposts, following Israeli Army vehicle movements. We would see a soldier waiting for a lift and plan how to kidnap him." Question: Why did you want to join the Hamas? 'Abdallah: The Hamas Islamic movement and the 'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squad are the right party. I heard about their activities, and I strove to be admitted into their ranks. Their work has quality. They are people of principle. In 1989, three organization members -- Muhammad Nasir, Mahmud Mamduh, and their commander Muhammad Shurayha -- kidnapped soldier Ilan Sa'adon. After that operation, the Israeli Army managed to capture the squad commander, Muhammad Shurayha. The other two squad members managed to flee Israel. The kidnapping of Ilan Sa'adon and Avi Sasportas totally confused the Shin Bet. They were unable to discover the whereabouts of Ilan Sa'adon's body. They were likewise unable to dig up any details from the squad commander, although four years had elapsed since the soldier's kidnapping. Question: Do you know where Ilan Sa'adon's remains are? 'Abdallah: There are rumors among 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members that the two squad members who managed to escape, took the body with them, and it is in either Lebanon or Syria. Question: What do you mean, rumors? 'Abdallah: That is what people in 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam are saying. Question: Does it sound plausible to you that they should tote Sa'adon's body along outside Israel? 'Abdallah: I told you, that is what organization members have been saying. I can say nothing beyond that. Question: How are contacts between the squads and the commander established? 'Abdallah: There are three to four members in every squad. There are dozens of such squads. Contacts between them are established by squad commanders only. Squad members do not know about the existence of other squads or about the people who control any particular squad. Thus, if any one of the squad members is arrested, he will be unable to disclose any names except those of his fellow squad members. Question: And how is the contact with the commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad, 'Abd-al-Fattah Sattari, established? (Reporter's note: 'Abd-al-Fattah Sattari, alias the Engineer, was unofficially appointed commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad after organization commander 'Imad 'Aqil was liquidated by the security forces in the course on an operation in the al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood on 25 December 1993.) 'Abdallah: Fattah al-Sattari is not the commander. He is an important figure in the organization, but we have another commander. Question: Who? 'Abdallah, evasively: I don't think I know that. Question: What is the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad's ultimate goal? 'Abdallah: The squad members have a deep sense of the need to liberate the occupied lands of Palestine. The enemy security forces tried every way to prevent us from carrying out attacks and to stop our activities. But they failed. We aim to liberate the land of Palestine from the Israeli occupation, to cleanse the holy land from Jewish filth. We are doing it for the sake of the Palestinian people and so that we may all go to heaven in the next world. After Nasir Namrutti, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad commander, was killed while being pursued by enemy soldiers near Rafah, a unit named after him was established. Members of the squad decided to avenge his death by carrying out a shakedown attack: kidnapping a soldier, hiding him, and demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners, most notably the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. Members of the squad dressed up to look Jewish. They had all the resources for that. They spoke Hebrew as well as any Israeli, and they found a Peugeot 305 with yellow license plates. The squad had an excellent driver. He was bearded, and with a yarmulke on his head, he looked like a typical settler. No one would suspect him of being Muslim. Another squad member had fair hair. He was tall. A third member had a moustache and short hair. They set out early in the morning of 18 September 1992. They drove around, looking for a Jewish soldier. They reached the Morag settlement, but could not find a single soldier. Neither did they find a victim in the moshavim of Gan Or, Neve Deqalim, or Ganey Tal. In Moshav Netzer Hazani, they saw two soldiers at the gate, but they did not stop. They were looking for another victim. Near one of the moshavim, their car almost crashed into a local car. One of one fighters put his head out of the window and started cursing the Arab driver in Hebrew, because soldiers and settlers were standing at the gate of the moshav, and he wanted them to think our fighters were Jewish. Then they proceeded toward Gaza. Near al-Nusayrat they saw soldier Alon Qarawani standing all alone. They stopped, and Qarawani asked whether they were going to Ashqelon. They said they were only driving as far as the Erez checkpoint. The soldier agreed and got in the car. As they were driving, one of our fighters took out a gun and asked the soldier: "Do you know us?" He said he did not. The squad members told him they belonged to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the sons of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. The soldier started crying. They tried to calm him, they said he should not worry. "We only want your weapon," they told him. The soldier told them: "Take it, I don't need it. I have parents and a family, don't kill me." The fighters told him: "We too have mothers and fathers and friends, and you are killing them." The soldier answered he was not on combat duty, that he only repaired Army cars. Further down the road, our fighters drove into an orchard and ordered him to take off his clothes and keep on only his shorts. Then they stabbed him with knives. They thought he was dead, and they tied him to a tree. They took his identity card and all his equipment and left the place. Palestinians who saw the soldier summoned the troops, and later we learned that he had not died, but was only badly wounded. Question: Did you participate in that operation? 'Abdallah: No. Question: Then how come you know so many details of the event? 'Abdallah: I did not participate in that operation. Question: How do you enter Israel? 'Abdallah: We dress up like Jews. No one stops us. We enter with a car with yellow license plates and drive through roadblocks without being stopped. Sometimes we even enter as Arabs. We are not fugitives. Question: What do you think of the Fatah Hawks organization? 'Abdallah: Fatah is divided into two parts -- those who support the peace process and those who oppose it. We respect them and we hope they will continue their military operations against the Zionist enemy. At this stage, we all have to take up arms and act together to release our lands. The Palestinian people does not have to obey 'Arafat's orders. The only way for us is to win the war, and God will decide who will live in this land. Question: Are you associated with the Fatah Hawks in any way? 'Abdallah: There is cooperation between us, but only with activists who oppose the peace process and would like to take up arms against Israelis. We help and encourage them. But the link is not strong. We show them respect. Question: Will you try to assassinate 'Arafat if there is peace? 'Abdallah: I do not think 'Arafat will ever get to come here. There will be no peace and no autonomy. And if there is autonomy, God forbid, I think the Palestinian people will judge 'Arafat by his deeds and start a revolution. If we kill 'Arafat, we will lose our people's love. Question: How many activists are there in the 'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squads? 'Abdallah: The number is unknown. Some of our members are also active in Fatah. Everybody knows they to belong to Fatah, but in fact they operate under cover, and they belong to 'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam. Also, there are some who do not pray and look secular, to prevent people from knowing what organization they belong to.
