Solidarity Chairman Marian Kraklewski said that the demonstration today is solely a component in the struggle for welfare rights. However, he added that if the government does not fulfill the trade union postulates, Solidarity will organize successive demonstrations, this time directed against the government. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] In the view of the organizers, at least 40,000 trade unionists came to Warsaw. The police spoke of 30,000, but everyone was in accord in stating that the demonstration was an enormous one. The demonstrators demanded the cessation of increased energy and gas prices, an increase in expenditures on social welfare benefits, an active struggle against unemployment, the adoption by 15 March of laws relating to the pact on the state enterprise, and a 2-percent increase in remuneration within the productive sphere. Solidarity Chairman Kraklewski warned that if the government does not take into account these postulates, then the next demonstrations will have a political character. [Krzaklewski] [video shows Krzaklewski marching in demonstration, talking to correspondent] If the government does not fulfill the social welfare and economic tasks in accordance with economic tendencies, and with the expectations of society, then the next stage is a demonstration against the authorities which are incapable of implementing something such as this. This is natural. Such is the course of affairs in democratic states. However, today's demonstration is not against the government but against the decisions and plans of this government. It is (?grinding us down). The next might be political. [Correspondent] What do you think about the postulates contained in the Solidarity petition? [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] It is difficult for me to agree with many of them. For instance, the shock increase in prices. The union is here doubtless thinking of the increase in the price of energy. Well, precisely. Instead of two large increases there will be three smaller ones. The rate in the increased prices of energy carriers is less this year than it was last year. Or else there is the accusation that the government is not implementing the earlier Solidarity postulates, normally when it is the pact on the state enterprise that is being spoken about. The laws comprising the pact have been sent to the Sejm. Two of them have already been adopted. The rest are at the disposal of the Sejm Extraordinary Commission. I think that they will shortly be adopted. To sum up, many of these postulates are quite simply being implemented. [Correspondent] The demonstrators walked down the Royal Way, from Pilsudski Square to the office of the Council of Ministers [URM]. However, not all the trade unionists got there; when the head of the march was holding a rally before the URM, the end had not yet left Pilsudski Square, a few kilometers away. [passage omitted] The demonstrators also chanted before the seat of the government, Left leg there, fear God there, and Red rascals. After a few minutes, a trade union delegation entered the URM and presented URM Head Michal Strak with the Solidarity postulates. [Strak] I accept this stance. I will pass it on to Prime Minister Pawlak. I wish to say that this government knows why and by whose votes it found itself here, where it finds itself. [Correspondent] After the talks, Minister Strak tried to go out and meet the demonstrators. [passage omitted] The demonstration ran its course calmly. Nonetheless, its size meant that traffic in the center of Warsaw was paralyzed for several hours. [end recording] [Announcer Malgorzata Szelewicka] Are you pleased with the course of the demonstration? [Krzaklewski] I am pleased. I am edified by this enormous turnout and the determination shown today by union members. I do not agree of course with the figures that were given. [passage omitted] [Szelewicka] Two days ago Premier Pawlak said on the Wiadomosci program that the government ought to break with the liberal policy of the previous governments. What is the union demonstrating against? [Kraklewski] Well, we have demonstrated against obvious facts. Against the draft budget law, that in effect, according to our experts' stance too, will bring about a successive year of impoverishment for workers and their families. In addition, other families, those of pensioners and others. We cannot agree that in the third year of economic growth, the incomes of Polish families again decline. Such a rule, to the effect that with economic growth there is an increase in the incomes of employees and the incomes of families, is a certain fundamental rule of market systems, economic and social. It cannot be other than thus, for in that case when are the incomes of the populace to increase, if not with such a large economic growth as has been signalled in 1993, as is being signalled in 1994? [Szelewicka] You said that the time might still come when there will be a struggle for power. When? [Kraklewski] The time will come, above all, for the presentation of a stance toward the government, a political stance. At the moment, the government does not reflect upon this demonstration. I listened to the statement by Mr. Miller. It frightened me, especially after such a demonstration. I saw this enormous charge of tension, charge of hurt. After all, these people came in such numbers. [Szelewicka] Why did that statement frighten you? [Kraklewski] It frightened me because of its inaccurate reflection, on the evaluation of the mood that has accumulated in relation to this government policy. [Szelewicka] The mood? [Kraklewski] The mood is very radical. People came in such numbers because they really do feel bad. After all, they would not come because someone ordered them to. They feel very bad. They clearly feel this burden on their own backs. And we had to apply much of our authority and many measures putting things in order so as to control this enormous feeling. We controlled it thanks to the fact that these were trade union structures. If this had been a political demonstration, by everyone against the government, then I don't know what it would have looked like. [Szelewicka] Many politicians of the right took part in the demonstration. Is this a foretaste of cooperation? [Krzaklewski] I don't know if there were many. In relation to the number of demonstrators this is a very small percentage. We did not forbid anyone attending. [Szelewicka] [Words indistinct] a significant number? [Kraklewski] Yes, but in relation to almost 100,000 demonstrators, according my calculations, a dozen or so or a few dozen politicians? These are, above all, politicians who supported this demonstration as a demonstration not only in favor of social welfare solutions, but as a demonstration for another economic program, one that the government ought to present. [Szelewicka] Thank you very much. [Kraklewski] Thank you very much.
