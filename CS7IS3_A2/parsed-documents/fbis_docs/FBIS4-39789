It was signed by Petro Kaban, deputy minister of foreign economic relations for the Ukrainian side, and Han Su-kil, deputy chairman of the Commission for External Economic Affairs of the DPRK. Kaban said the agreement would promote trade and economic cooperation between the two countries on the same scale as when Ukraine was in the Soviet Union. Deputy Minister of Industry Hryhoriy Osaulenko has been nominated to head the Ukrainian staff at the commission who are to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Han Su-kil said that the DPRK was mainly interested in importing equipment from Ukraine for its mines, generators, and rolled metal plates, and in Ukraine's assistance in the development of oil fields and oil extraction. Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign economic relations said Ukraine had already set up such joint commissions with Poland, Hungary, Vietnam, Mongolia, China, and other countries. An agreement with the DPRK pointed to renewal of Ukraine-North Korean economic relations. Kolos added that Ukraine had the resources to develop oil fields in the DPRK. Negotiations at this stage concern the method of payment for Ukrainian services, whether it will be made in hard currency or on terms of barter supplies. The joint Ukrainian-Korean commission for trade and economic cooperation is provisionally planning to hold its first meeting in September in Pyongyang.
