Callejas, who met with Discua today to examine the report issued by the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights [CNPDH] concerning 183 missing people, pointed out that the request made by the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh) concerning the temporary suspension of the military chief "has no legal validity." According to Callejas, Cofadeh cannot "level accusations or establish responsibilities" concerning the people who disappeared during the past decade; he said the preliminary report issued by CNPDH head Leo Valladares concerning the disappearance of individuals should serve to "build, not destroy, and to unite, not divide." The president expressed concern because attempts are being made "without legal validity to lay the blame and responsibility" on civilians and military people implicated in the forced disappearances. He added that the courts of justice are the only ones that can establish responsibility for any crime. In his 29 December report Valladares said that civilians and military people were responsible for the disappearance of over 100 people. He recommended that the state acknowledge those violations, apologize to the relatives, and initiate an investigation. Among other military men, Cofadeh points to Discua as the person responsible for certain disappeareances because in 1984 he was commander of the "3-16" counterinsurgency battalion. Discua has denied any involvement in the disappearance of people and as he entered and left the presidential palace today he avoided reporters who were expecting answers from him concerning the Cofadeh's request. On Friday, Cofadeh will ask the Legislative Assembly's permanent commission that Discua be temporarily suspended from his post and subjected to an investigation concerning the disappearances. Cofadeh Coordinator Bertha Oliva told ACAN-EFE that "it is not necessary to have legal status to identify individuals responsible for the disappearances," and that "what President Callejas wants is for us to forgive and forget." "If the president had a missing child, brother or any relative, he would be at our side demanding justice" added Oliva, wife of Tomas Nativi, who disappeared during the 1980's. Callejas underscored that the right thing to do regarding the missing people is to "end this phase of recriminations, ill will and differences within Honduran society in order to establish a process of national reconciliation that will be constructive and not destructive." The president also said that Honduran society "must not create permanent wounds," the events that have taken place "must result in something, and an admission should be made to the missing people's relatives." "When we are told where the guilty parties are and when they have been punished, we will be able to forgive and forget," Oliva added.
