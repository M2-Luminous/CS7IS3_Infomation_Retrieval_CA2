The meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will deal mainly with territorial issues. Elisa Wasch reports on the negotiations. [Wasch] Both sides today stressed that they finally want to put an end to the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past months, the Muslim government units in central Bosnia managed to conquer six towns; about 70,000 Croats are surrounded there. As a result, over the past days threats have come from Zagreb. Both President Tudjman and Defense Minister Susak spoke of a potential Croatian military intervention in Bosnia if the Muslims do not cease their offensive. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who participated in today's talks, denies that there are any plans for a Croatian intervention. [Begin Granic recording, in English with superimposed German translation] We do not have any plan to make a military intervention. We will talk about how we can put an end to the fighting, about a cease-fire, and about future relations between Croats and Muslims. [end recording] In addition, Granic said that Croatia continues to be willing to negotiate access to the Adriatic Sea, which is demanded by the Muslims. However, Zagreb no longer wants to talk about the Adriatic port of Neum, which the Muslims want to have. [Being Granic recording] Croatia is ready to discuss access to the sea but not Neum. [end recording] The Vienna talks are still going on and will be continued tomorrow. [passage omitted]
