He said Indonesia should work hard during the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, summit so Indonesia and the other developing nations will benefit from decisions reached by the developed nations at that summit. He also stated that Indonesia will not make superfluous requests during the upcoming APEC summit because Indonesia and the other developing nations have never suffered any losses as a result of the decisions taken by the developed nations. President Suharto, however, cited an example where the recent decisions taken by the developed nations caused the appreciation of the Japanese yen. Indonesia did not benefit from that decision because it now has to eke out an additional U.S.$2 billion for its loan repayments as a result of the yen appreciation. The upcoming APEC summit, which is scheduled to be held in Bogor in the middle of November, is considered appropriate for Indonesia because it will involve developed industrial countries and their developing counterparts. Speaking during a dialogue session with Golkar party participants to the workshop session, the head of state said that Golkar need not make any request for added funds for state-owned agencies. According to President Suharto, the party has sufficient funds in state-owned agencies, which range from one to 15 percent, meant for small-scale entrepreneurs.
