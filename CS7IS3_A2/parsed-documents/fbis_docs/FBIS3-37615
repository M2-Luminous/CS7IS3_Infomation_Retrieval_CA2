Republic of Crimea President Yuriy Meshkov Answers MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Questions"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bogomolov] If the Crimeans vote for the republic's independence, would you risk challenging Ukraine in order to comply with their will? [Meshkov] There is no need to do so, because the question of the referendum has been formulated as follows: "Are you in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in a union with other states?" Note, the word "union" is not capitalized. This is one part of the answer to your question. The second part is that the Republic of Crimea has been restored as a subject of the Union Treaty or, quoting literally: "a subject of the Union and a participant in the Union Treaty." So, now the republic can be considered a subject of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It is from these facts that the top authorities of our republic had to proceed in their activity, but they did not do so. [Bogomolov] That is, legally speaking Crimea may be considered independent? [Meshkov] There is a legal framework for that, but in order for it to receive a requisite confirmation we need to resort to a referendum. [Bogomolov] Observers single out two statements of yours with regard to the Black Sea Fleet problem: that the fleet should belong to Russia, and that its fate should be resolved at a meeting between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Many people see these two statements as mutually exclusive. Is this really so? [Meshkov] One does not contradict the other. Under the Massandra agreement, the presidents in fact agreed that the Black Sea Fleet belongs to Russia, and it will pay Ukraine compensation for the part of the fleet that in theory was to be taken over by Ukraine in the form of specific warships. Naturally, it follows from this -- both from a legal point of view and from the point of view of elementary logic -- that the Black Sea Fleet is Russian and that it will be based in Sevastopol, because there has not been any talk about changing its deployment area. [Bogomolov] Do you hope that your supporters will also win in the 27 March elections for the Crimean Supreme Soviet? [Meshkov] Judging from the first round of the presidential elections, which were contested by all the key political forces, this hope is justified. [passage omitted] [Bogomolov] Crimea has a strong communist movement. What is your attitude to it? [Meshkov] Basically, I have a dual attitude to the communist movement. We should distinguish between the communist ideology and the methods of putting it into practice. The communist ideology is everlasting, as religion, as any other form of a widespread philosophy of life. In its pure form it comes down to a desire to create a perfect society, an abstract, perfect model of human existence. What brings the communist idea close to Christianity is the fact that after all they both are founded on love of your neighbor. The natural and ineradicable human aspiration is to live better, and numerous lives have been sacrificed to confirm this desire. How this idea is fleshed out is another matter; the methods are different everywhere: from Cambodia to Cuba and from Albania to our country. [passage omitted] [Bogomolov] Both Russians and Crimeans are concerned about one thing: Will Crimea return to the ruble zone? [Meshkov] In theory, this has been agreed on with the Ukrainian leadership. This is possible. As for the problems of implementing this plan, this is a technical matter; the only thing we need here is help from specialists. [Bogomolov] What is your view on the creation of a free economic zone in Sevastopol? [Meshkov] You know, this is a somewhat idealistic desire. Sevastopol's historical and actual situation as a naval base is not conducive to this. How all advantages of the Sevastopol port and all its bays should best be used is another matter. But this problem should not necessarily be tied to the status of a free economic zone. [Bogomolov] Finally, about the problem of the Crimean Tatars. What solution do you see to it? [Meshkov] The main problem here is logistic support. As for purely ethnic problems, the Crimean Constitution has enshrined the equality of all nations living in the peninsula. This is from where we proceed.
