Sergeyev; place and date not given: "Parliament's Potential Will Be Realized"] [Text] [Sergeyev] Viktor Petrovich, you were a member of the previous Supreme Council and have now become deputy chairman. Is it possible maybe six weeks since the start of business to evaluate the degree of readiness for work of the present deputies? [Mezhak] It is quite high, in my view. It can be seen even now that it is not a "pocket" parliament, as some critics had predicted it would be. A polarity of views on many political issues may be traced distinctly. On the other hand, the deputies find a common language perfectly well when socioeconomic problems are tackled and are exacting toward the government and see as its main role Crimea's extrication from the crisis and an enhancement of the living standard of each Crimean. [Sergeyev] Your last observation does not coincide very well with the topic of conversation during the Presidium sitting, when the program of targeted subsidies was rejected. [Mezhak] Such a view (it is being disseminated by various news media, unfortunately) is fundamentally mistaken. Neither the Presidium nor the deputies at the session under any circumstances rejected the principle of targeted subsidies for the needy, which could today help to a considerable extent both a stabilization of the economy and the preservation of funds in the Crimean budget. The Presidium sitting proposed, on the contrary, support for a program of targeted subsidies and the corresponding amendments to the budget. But, a program! And when no one from the government could intelligibly explain how the idea would be realized, when findings of the specialists whom it would concern are lacking, and when it is unclear where the funds for the preferential payment of targeted subsidies would come from, what is there to support? The Supreme Council not only is not opposed, it aspires to work and examine all necessary innovations of the government. But in six weeks the government has, strictly speaking, not once availed itself of its right of legislative initiative. On the other hand, it conferred, under the cover of the Supreme Council, the right, in fact, to raise the price of bread.... The electorate would not understand us and would be right. And neither party nor geographical nor departmental sympathies or antipathies have anything to do with it here. A most important task of the legislature is to guard the interests of the electorate. And no deputy, I am sure of this, understands it as a desire to prevent the executive from working. But reforms, even the least reforms, need to be implemented more visibly. Which is what we are trying to ensure. [Sergeyev] Many of the news media have reported the huge privileges specified by the law of the Republic of Crimea "Status of the Deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea" that was adopted recently. What is the truth here? [Mezhak] The truth is that the deputies should have an opportunity to function normally. I have not encountered in a single newspaper a comparison of what you termed privileges for the Crimean deputies with the corresponding Ukrainian, Russian, Tatar, or other laws. But should we seriously be discussing the problem of whether the deputy should be running to the telephone booth to get through to a government official that has bogged down a voter's problem in bureaucracy? I would very much like to read in a newspaper or hear on the radio a competent, balanced evaluation of the law, not a desire to play in populist fashion on the morbid strings of the Crimeans. Our deputies currently have one privilege--working by the sweat of their brow. But unless provision is made for the realization of this privilege, the people of Crimea will be the loser. So, if I were a journalist, I would take a look at this problem from this side as well.
