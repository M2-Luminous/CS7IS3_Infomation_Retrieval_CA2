The participants in the meeting focused on the political situation in the country and tasks of the communist faction in the State Duma, the lower house of the new parliament, the constitutional crisis in Russia, issues concerning the formation of the apparatus of the Federal Assembly and ways to resolve the economic and political crisis on the country, the Federal Assembly press service said. The meeting was attended by party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, Valentin Kuptsov, Anatoliy Lukyanov, Vladimir Isakov, Sergey Glazyev, as well as representatives of other parliamentary factions and some independent deputies. The Federal Assembly will convene for its first session on Tuesday, January 11. Both houses, the State Duma and the Federation Council, will seat separately since the new Constitution does not provide for joint sessions. However, the lower and the upper houses may get together in several cases, including to hear out presidential addresses and messages of the Constitution Court, speeches by leaders of foreign states and witness the inauguration of a new president. The Federation Council, the upper house, which is comprised of two representatives from each subject of the Federation, is expected to convene at 10:00 in the former house of the press at Pushkinskaya Street, 26. Simultaneously, the State Duma will gather at Novyy Arbat street, 36, in the former Comecon headquarters. For the first time in the history of Russia, the 450-seat lower house will be represented not only by independent deputies, but also election blocs and parties which have cleared the five per cent threshold as required by the law on elections to the State Duma. The political spectrum is very diverse and represents practically all forces from democrats- reformists from the Russia's Choice election bloc, on the one hand, to the Communist, the Agrarian and the Liberal Democratic parties, on the other hand. In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the first session of the upper house will be opened by the president. Well-informed sources in the Kremlin that there will be no "big opening address." Most likely, the president will give a brief speech laying the guidelines for the Council's future work. The source said that Yeltsin is preparing a big speech which he will deliver at a joint session of the two houses some time after the Federation Council begins working. The speech will touch upon the economic, political and social aspects of reform in Russia. So far it is unclear whether the president will address the parliament personally or send a message.
