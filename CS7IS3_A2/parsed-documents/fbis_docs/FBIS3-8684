Addressing a session of the Moslem government in Sarajevo, Ljubijankic rejected the idea of granting cantonal status to western Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources say. Cantonal organization modelled after the one in the Swiss confederation is envisaged in a Croat-Moslem deal on forming a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which would subsequently enter into a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. The deal was signed in Washington on March 1 under strong U.S. pressure. Radical Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, who has sent troops to western Bosnia to force it to abandon the idea of autonomy, accuses Abdic of breaking up Bosnia. Ljubijankic urged Bosnian Croat officials to suspend all aid to Abdic and cut off land routes to western Bosnia, arguing that this would help win over Abdic's followers for the government in Sarajevo. Abdic, who believes that the Bosnian crisis should be resolved in talks with the local Serbs and Croats, has repeatedly accused Izetbegovic of continuing the war in an attempt to create an Islamic state and of sacrificing his own people to achieve this goal.
