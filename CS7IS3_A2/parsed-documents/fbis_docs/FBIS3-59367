Authoritative analysts believe that this winter and next spring, grain and oil prices will tend to rise. We can expect wheat prices to rebound. Presently wheat prices in localities throughout the nation are essentially in a slump. The price of some three white wheats on the Zhengzhou market is 0.76 yuan per kilogram, 0.02 yuan lower than corn. The price of wheat on the Jinnan market is about 0.72 yuan, and adjusted sales are not smooth and the market is not active. Several other grain producing regions are wavering at only about 0.64 yuan. The wheat price situation of such areas as Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shanghai is a little better, floating around 0.80 yuan. The China Grain Trading Company forecasts that in the short-term wheat prices still could waver in a low valley, but by this winter or next spring or at a little later point, wheat prices could rebound to about 0.90 yuan. Corn prices continue to rebound. The corn market has maintained a two year high temperature without retreating and has not suffered an impact from new corn. The price, after a slight decline, will continue to rebound. In some regions the price approaches or exceeds the price of wheat. In East China, Hubei and Hunan, South China, and the Central Plain, the price of corn has remained at about 0.80. In such places as Chongqing, Nanning, Chengdu, and Kunming in the southwest, it has broken the 1 yuan barrier, and the Kunming Market has reached as high as 1.17 yuan. There are three reasons that corn receipts are huge and quotations are not declining: The first is that corn is full of nutrients and resistant to disease. The second is that the scope of its use is widespread and its uses are constantly expanding. The third is that feed requirements are increasing and international quotations look good. Sales of other grains are active and prices will remain high and stable. With increases in agricultural and agricultural byproduct purchasing prices, the sales prices of small grains on various markets will stabilize at a rather high level. Based on information from more than thirty markets, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, this July the price rise for red beans over the same period last year was the highest, reaching 225 percent, rising from 2.40 yuan to 7.80 yuan. The rise for mung beans also reached 122 percent, rising from 4.50 yuan to 10.00 yuan. The small grain market continues to be active, and although new grain coming to the market will have an impact, the effect will not be great. The price of mung beans on the southern and western markets is still 4.00 yuan or more. The Shanghai market has reached as high as 4.60 yuan. In some regions of north China and the northwest, it remains at 3.20 yuan and above. Because of the rapid development of the livestock and the feed industries and the soaring development of the vegetable oil processing industry, soybeans are always in very tight demand, and although prices float down, they still stay high and do not decline. This year the area in the country planted in soybeans was greatly increased. So, after the new grain comes on the market, the price could stabilize at a high level. There is a ready market for oil products and price rises are obvious. Because the area planted in rape, peanuts, and cotton was greatly reduced, peanut oil reserves have declined 30 percent to 40 percent from the same period last year. In addition, customers from various localities are pouring into Xinjiang and the price of productive land has reached about 4.50 yuan, causing oil product markets throughout the nation beginning this year to constantly rise. Jinnan wei [5898] oil has now reached 5.50 yuan or more and in Hebei peanut oil has reached as high as 5.90 yuan and rapeseed oil, wei oil, and soybean oil have all broken the 5 yuan barrier. Henan's price for peanut oil within the province has reached 5.70 yuan and the price outside the province has reached as high as 6 yuan. And palm oil is 5.30 yuan or more. Rapeseed oil is 4.80 yuan or more in both Shanghai and Jiangsu. On Hebei's Laohekou Market, the prices of scarce rapeseed oil and soybean oil have risen to 5.40 yuan and 5.60 yuan, respectively. On the basis of the current domestic grain and oil market situation, all business units should pay close attention to market information in formulating business tactics.
