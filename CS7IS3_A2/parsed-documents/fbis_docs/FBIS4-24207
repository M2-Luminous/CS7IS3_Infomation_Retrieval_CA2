Perhaps it is only a section of the NP that thinks along those lines, or a section of the ANC. Nonetheless, such a development is still politically significant. It focuses attention on the NP's total opportunism. Firstly, the NP turned its back on the right wing, and then adopted the old program of the United Party. But that was not leftist enough. It then went on to hijack the political platform of the Democratic Party, to a point where there was virtually no difference between the NP and the DP. Through the referendum, the NP completely swallowed up the DP. It would then only be in keeping with the trend if the NP united with the ANC. There are no differences in principles between the two parties. The difference lies only in color. The ANC is a party for blacks and Indians, while the NP is a white-led Colored party. There is another reason to lead one to suspect that there could be something in the rumor. This is in keeping with plans for the left-wing's "new South Africa," concocted since 1973 by the ANC and the money powers. The primary objective had been the destruction of the Afrikaner's political power. To succeed in keeping it powerless, and to prevent any existence of an opposition, the new structures have to be made as inclusive as possible; not only the new multiracial state, but by implication also its governing party. The next logical step will then be to promote an NP/ANC coalition, which will eventually lead to the country becoming a one-party state.
