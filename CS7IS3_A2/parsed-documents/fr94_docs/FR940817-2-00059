FR940817-2-00059 FR940817-2-00043 As a result of these factors, Ethyl and EPA entered into discussions concerning a possible extension of the deadline for a decision. Ultimately, an agreement between Ethyl and EPA concerning such an extension was implemented on November 30, 1993, and notice of the agreement was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64761). The agreement provided for an extension of 180 days in the deadline for final action by EPA on Ethyl's waiver application for HiTEC 3000. 5 EPA was thus required to take final action either granting or denying Ethyl's resubmitted application by May 29, 1994. For purposes of the resubmitted application, the EPA Administrator determined that Ethyl had demonstrated, as required by section 211(f)(4), that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified. 6 The Agency stated clearly in the December 9, 1993 Federal Register notice that this determination would not preclude any subsequent regulatory action based on emission effects under Clean Air Act section 211(c) or any other provision of the Clean Air Act in the event that the resubmitted Ethyl waiver application were to be granted in the future. The Agency also made it clear that this determination would not apply in the context of any other new waiver application concerning HiTEC 3000 or MMT which might be submitted in the future if EPA were to deny Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application on other grounds. Further review of Ethyl's application during this 180 day period focused in particular on the issues relating to the potential health effects on public health if EPA were to permit use of MMT as a fuel additive. 5 To implement this agreement, Ethyl withdrew its July 12, 1991 waiver application, as remanded by the Court of Appeals, and immediately resubmitted the application. 6 As is explained in section IV of this document, this decision was based primarily upon application of the previously used statistical tests to the submitted emissions data. As is also explained in section IV, the Agency believes that these tests may be outdated and is considering a formal change in its method of analysis of such data.
