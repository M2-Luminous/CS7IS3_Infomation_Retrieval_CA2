Uranium Mill Tailing Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) activities 1,449,000 Surcharge 170 1Annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee held, during the fiscal year, a valid license with the NRC authorizing possession and use of radioactive material. However, the annual fee is waived for those materials licensees and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses prior to October 1, 1993 and permanently ceased licensed activities entirely by September 30, 1993. Annual fees for licensees who filed for termination of a license or for a POL during the fiscal year and for new licenses issued during the fiscal year will be prorated in accordance with the provisions of §171.17. If a person holds more than one license, certificate, registration, or approval, the annual fee(s) will be assessed for each license, certificate, registration, or approval held by that person. For licenses that authorize more than one activity on a single license (e.g., human use and irradiator activities), annual fees will be assessed for each category applicable to the license. Licensees paying annual fees under Category 1.A.(1). are not subject to the annual fees of category 1.C and 1.D for sealed sources authorized in the license and licensees paying annual fees under Category 2.A.(2) are not subject to the annual fees for Category 2.A.(4). 2Payment of the prescribed annual fee does not automatically renew the license, certificate, registration, or approval for which the fee is paid. Renewal applications must be filed in accordance with the requirements of Parts 30, 40, 70, 71, or 72 of this chapter. 3For FYs 1995 through 1998, fees for these materials licenses will be calculated and assessed in accordance with §171.13 and will be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment. 4A Class I license includes mill licenses issued for the extraction of uranium from uranium ore. A Class II license includes solution mining licenses (in-situ and heap leach) issued for the extraction of uranium from uranium ores including research and development licenses. An ``other'' license includes licenses for extraction of metals, heavy metals, and rare earths. 5Two licenses have been issued by NRC for land disposal of special nuclear material. Once NRC issues a LLW disposal license for byproduct and source material, the Commission will consider establishing an annual fee for this type of license. 6Standardized spent fuel facilities, Part 71 and 72 Certificates of Compliance, and special reviews, such as topical reports, are not assessed an annual fee because the generic costs of regulating these activities are primarily attributable to the users of the designs, certificates, and topical reports. 7Licensees in this category are not assessed an annual fee because they are charged an annual fee in other categories while they are licensed to operate. 8No annual fee is charged because it is not practical to administer due to the relatively short life or temporary nature of the license. 9 Separate annual fees will not be assessed for pacemaker licenses issued to medical institutions who also hold nuclear medicine licenses under Categories 7B or 7C. 10This includes Certificates of Compliance issued to DOE that are not under the Nuclear Waste Fund. 11No annual fee has been established because there are currently no licensees in this particular fee category.
