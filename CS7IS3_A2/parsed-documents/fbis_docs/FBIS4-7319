The sources said that in the China-Mongolia Treaty on Friendly Relations and Cooperation, which will replace an earlier bilateral treaty dating from 1960, each side will pledge not to join military or political groups directed at the other. Nor will they conclude any agreement with a third country which threatens the other country's sovereignty or security, according to the draft treaty. The treaty, to be signed Friday between Li and Mongolian Premier Punsalmaagiyn Jasray, further says that neither country will allow a third country to use its territory to threaten the sovereignty or security of the other, the sources said. Mongolia normalized ties with China in 1989 after years of hosting Soviet forces hostile to China. Li will be arriving in Ulaanbaatar for a two-day visit after visiting the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
