Martin Leka was yesterday sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, while editor-in-chief Aleksander Frangaj left the courtroom not guilty. Officer Bashkim Feta's one month in detention was considered punishment enough and he was released, while Romeo Licaj, who provided the newspaper with the document that was considered secret, was sentenced to four years imprisonment. We have no reason for joy, and can only shed tears over this insult and humiliation. We have been humiliated because Martin Leka was pronounced guilty because of the coffees he drank with the officer Romeo Licaj, because of the car with the Lezhe license plate that brought the defense minister's document to the editorial office, and for working in the Lezhe bank alongside Romeo Licaj's wife. Martin Leka did not return to the editorial office yesterday. He was sent to Tirana prison together with Romeo Licaj as an accomplice in revealing secrets. The court considered to be a secret the minister of defense's order for officers to hand in their personal weapons. According to a decree signed by Adil Carcani in 1982, the bench considered Safet Zhulali's order to be a state secret. Presiding Judge Arben Ristani did not consider the defense's evidence, but pronounced Martin Leka guilty, considering him as having encouraged the revelation of a secret. The fact that Martin Leka drank coffee with Romeo Licaj cannot be either a legal or a logical argument, still less when Romeo Licaj denied having talked to Martin Leka about Zhulali's order. They might have talked about Zhulali's portrait or about NATO membership. However, the court did not prove this. We therefore say that Martin Leka was sentenced for unverifiable collaboration on the basis of speculation. It cannot be proved that Martin Leka encouraged Romeo Licaj to reveal the secret. We therefore feel insulted and humiliated by the court's spiteful decision, because Martin Leka's profession, to which he has devoted his life and for which he sacrificed his freedom, was ignored. He was not tried as a journalist. Martin would have agreed to become a sacrificial lamb for the gods, if he could have believed that justice would thereby become a god for the Albanians. However, the facts are otherwise. Martin Leka's sentences show that for a long time yet the Albanians must mourn forcibly sacrificed lambs.
