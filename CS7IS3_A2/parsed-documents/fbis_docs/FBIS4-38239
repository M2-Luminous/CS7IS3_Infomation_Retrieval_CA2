The northern party was represented by 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani [minister of planning and development] and the southern party was represented by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas [prime minister of the government declared in south Yemen]. The meeting was attended by the UN envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, who called on them to set a date for cease-fire. Al-Iryani, however, did not have full authorization from Sanaa to make such a decision, as Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said in his statements to reporters following the meeting. The meeting was not in vain, because it brought closer the two sides' viewpoints on the formation of the committee which will supervise the cease-fire. REUTER cited Abu-Bakr al-'Attas as saying: We have almost reached an agreement on the Arab, African, and Asian countries which would participate in this committee. Al-Iryani suggested that both France and the United States participate in this committee. Both sides agreed -- through al-Iryani and al- 'Attas -- that the observers operate under the supervision of Lakhdar Brahimi with the assistance of a military attache. The obstacle, however, was represented in the southern party's insistence that the observers operate under the UN flag. [passage omitted]
