Cavallo voiced his desire that Chile join Mercosur, together with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as of the first day of next year, when the common foreign tariff will be established by the member countries. Cavallo believes Chile is "much closer to a trade agreement than four years ago," when President Patricio Aylwin's government was seriously against an integration process. The Argentine minister made this statement yesterday during the seminar "The Southern Cone Dialogue," held in this city and attended by ministers and officials of countries of the region. The Argentine official said Chile "can no longer doubt the Argentine stabilization process," that turned out to be even "more effective" than the one implemented in Chile, which is currently governed by Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. Regarding Brazil, Cavallo mentioned a lack of "political decision" to implement reforms like the Argentine convertibility plan, because "growth can only be attained with stability." Moreover, he said that Chile must recognize the progress made by Argentina in the field of the deregulation, infrastructure, and free trade rules that were one of the obstacles for a trade agreement. "Chile should prefer Mercosur to NAFTA," said Cavallo, referring to the Chilean Government's intention to join NAFTA. Today Cavallo is scheduled to visit the Mining Fair where more than 1,000 leading companies in the world in the mining field will exhibit their goods. He will visit the fair accompanied by Mining Secretary Eduardo Maza and Jorge Escobar, the former San Juan governor and current national deputy, who accompanied Cavallo to Chile. The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela will exhibit at the fair. Cavallo will later meet with Chilean President Eduardo Frei, with whom he will discuss joint economic projects. Cavallo and Frei will thoroughly assess the possibility of Chile joining Mercosur during the first meeting between the new Chilean president and a top ranking Argentine Government official.
