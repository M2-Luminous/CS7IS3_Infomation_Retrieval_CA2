During a recent trip to Taxkorgan County on the Pamirs Highland, reporters learned that none of the county's 22,000 Tajik people was a trader in the mid-eighties. Herdsmen living on the Pamirs Highland toiled to raise livestock throughout the year and refused to sell them even as the animals grew old and died. They lived a poor but contented life. In 1986, the county's Hongqilafu border port was formally opened to third countries. Later, a 420-km road linked it with border ports on the highland, making Hongqilafu one of the most important and busiest trading ports between our country's western region and Central Asian countries. The endless stream of visiting merchants broke the long-existing silence of the Pamirs Highland. Seeing that businessmen of the Uygur, Han, and Hui nationalities became well-off one after another, the Tajik people could no longer sit still. By the end of 1993, some 150 Tajik individual households and private enterprises had emerged in Taxkorgan County. They opened shops, restaurants, hotels, and video shops in towns, border ports, as well as along the Sino-Pakistani highway. Some of them bought automobiles especially to transport goods between border ports and Kashi city, or directly engaged in transnational border trade. Some people even teamed up with Pakistani businessmen to open restaurants in towns which did a brisk business. Farmers and herdsmen living near towns changed their tradition of not engaging in vegetable farming, and started to grow vegetables extensively for market sales. Subsequently, a group of large vegetable farming households emerged. Today, Taxkorgan has numerous shops and stores. As reporters went to remote villages, they frequently met Tajik merchants engaging in various trades as well as peasants and herdsmen engaging in precious stone mining. Some jewelers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan buy precious stones in remote mountains and valleys here throughout the year. A group of previously poor peasants, such as Mairepu and Tayier, have now become specialized households and private mining enterprise owners with tens of thousands of yuan in assets. The first border trade company in Taxkorgan County was established in 1992. The company actively linked peasants and herdsmen together to participate in border trade. The export and import value in the first year alone reached $900,000, making it the company in the county with the largest income. To cope with tens of thousands of visiting Chinese and foreign businessmen, the county invested in building the Pamirs Hotel as well as developed local tourist attractions, scenic spots, cultural relics, and historic sites to establish a tourist industry. In 1993, the county's income from the tourist trade reached 750,000 yuan. County chief Mierzhayi told reporters that village and town enterprises have grown rapidly from nothing. The Tajik people have shaken off the restrictions of a pastoral life and established a group of village and town enterprises, such as a mineral water bottling plant, a precious stone plant, an iron mine, and a brickyard. The output value of the entire county's village and town enterprises was 330,000 yuan in 1992. However, in 1993, the output value of the Pamirs Mineral Water Bottling Plant and the brickyard alone exceeded 1.3 million yuan.
