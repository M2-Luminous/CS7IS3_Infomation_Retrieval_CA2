Kaysin, under the rubric: "Questions of Theory": "Developing Naval Command and Control Theory"] [Text] The Navy's combat readiness is formed in peacetime and its improvement is a continuous process. In the process, the underestimation of just one of the elements of combat readiness can result in such consequences that are at times impossible to correct during the course of a war. Proceeding from that, the Navy's leadership is making heightened requirements to the activities of commanding generals, commanders and staffs in this sphere. The capability of command and control organs to bring themselves and subordinate units to readiness to accomplish combat missions in a timely manner and also the skill of commanding generals, commanders and staffs to firmly command and control subordinate forces during the course of preparing for and conducting military operations is one of the primary elements of naval forces combat readiness. Military history knows quite a few examples when units or formations, that had a powerful combat potential, lost battles and engagements to an enemy who was equal in forces and sometimes weaker precisely due to the absence of operational, continuous and reliable command and control. Our Navy's operations on 22 June 1941 serve as a positive example. Having manifested vigilance and based upon information obtained on the change of the operational situation at sea and in the air, the Navy's command authorities issued the order to shift fleet forces to full combat readiness several hours prior to the enemy attack which permitted them to successfully repel a surprise attack. As a result, on the first day of the war, our Navy did not lose a single ship or aircraft. The experience of the latest local wars and armed conflicts also objectively confirms the need to prepare the command and control system for the complex conditions of entry into war. So, according to foreign press information, during the course of Israeli Armed Forces aggression into Lebanon (in 1982), the Israelis managed to reveal the Syrian troop formations' command and control and communications system which permitted them to conduct accurate strikes against the revealed targets already at the beginning of the conflict. As a result, they managed to completely or partially disrupt command and control of Syrian troops, their aviation and air defense systems. In the Persian Gulf, during the first two weeks of combat operations of the United States and its allies against the Iraqi Armed Forces, approximately 25 percent of the command and control organs were destroyed and 50 percent were rendered inoperable which permitted them to practically paralyze the Iraqi Armed Forces command and control system and to dramatically reduce coalition forces losses. It is characteristic that one of the reasons that caused the defeat of the Argentine Armed Forces in the Falklands (Malvinas) Islands (1981) were the shortcomings of their command and control system that reduced the reliability and stability of the leadership of combat operations. All of this attests to the need to maintain the command and control system at a high degree of combat readiness during peacetime and to ensure its transition beforehand to combat readiness when a threat emerges and also its role in the attainment of victory in wartime. Definition of Command and Control Theory The content of military practice has perceptibly expanded under contemporary conditions. The significance of military theory has also correspondingly increased. Therefore, the role of military scientific research and also the significance of the timeliness of the introduction of their results into the practice of military structural development have substantially increased. We know that theory sheds light on the path of practice and practice is the driving force and the goal of the development of theory. Naval theory -- this is the system of scientific knowledge that reveals the laws and patterns of armed combat at sea, the principles of structural development of the Navy, its preparation and employment in the system of the armed forces both during the course of a war and also during peacetime. While defining the prospects and directions of naval development on a scientific basis, it is a part of military science and is in subordinate dependence to it. In turn, naval command and control theory permeates all of the elements of naval theory. In the Soviet Military Encyclopedia, the concept of ground (naval) forces command and control is interpreted as the activity of commanding generals (commanders, superiors), staffs, services and other command and control organs for the maintenance of the combat readiness and combat capability of ground (naval) forces, preparation of operations and combat operations and their leadership while accomplishing the assigned missions. At the same time, it indicates that in a broader sense troop command and control encompasses all of the activity of strategic leadership, commanding generals (commanders, superiors), and staffs both for command and control in a combat situation and also for the development and combat improvement of ground (naval) forces, the organization of operational and combat training and service of the troops, maintenance of discipline and high moral spirit of personnel, and ensuring continuous combat and mobilization readiness of the troops (naval forces). However, in our view, we must examine command and control theory as one of the components of military science that has an independent sphere of research that is based upon the common laws and principles of command and control of the Armed Forces. In the process, the provisions of naval command and control theory certainly must take into account and reflect the specific features of the Navy while resolving the missions of armed combat at sea and in turn be part of all of the components of naval theory. So, its own private theory, that takes into account the specific nature of this activity, is being developed based upon the general provisions of command and control theory. From what has been stated above, we can arrive at the conclusion that contemporary naval forces command and control theory must be developed as naval command and control theory on the whole. Let's dwell on this in more detail. In our view, the activity of the command authorities and command and control organs during preparation of the Navy for the armed defense of the state and the employment of forces during the course of military operations, that are being conducted both independently and also jointly with other services of the Armed Forces, is the object of study of this theory. Its subject are the laws, patterns, principles and categories of command and control, the organized forms and methods of functioning of the naval command and control system under various conditions and while accomplishing various missions with the employment of contemporary technical command and control systems. The structure of naval command and control theory must examine all of the specific features of the peculiarities of command and control of forces while preparing for and conducting operations and combat operations, the management of construction, operational, combat, moral-psychological training and education of personnel, and also scientific research and other types of naval activity. In our view, it consists of the following elements: the foundations of naval command and control, command and control organs, systems and equipment, and organization and methods of command and control. The laws and principles of the science of command and control of the state and the Armed Forces, that are being employed while taking into account the specific nature of the missions, organization, and forms of utilization of naval forces, are its methodological basis, like all other sciences. Furthermore, it broadly utilizes the information of the natural and technical sciences, based upon which the continuous improvement of command and control methods and systems is being carried out. Development of Naval Forces Command and Control Theory The art of command and control of naval forces had already emerged in ancient times. We know that in the 5th Century B.C. ships in the Greek Navy had already been formed into detachments for convenience of command and control in battle and the naval commander had several assistants which we can consider to be the beginning of the birth of the organization of command and control of forces. It was improved over the course of many centuries along with the development of naval forces and naval battle tactics. The first naval charter of 1720, in which the combat experience of ship operations in the Northern War was summarized, played a large role in the establishment in our country of the theory and practice of command and control of naval forces. The appearance of a steam-powered navy required the development of both new tactics and also the organization of the command and control of its forces. Headquarters of formations were created in the Russian Navy in the 1880's as a result of the increase of the volume of command and control functions. The introduction of the radio became revolutionary in the matter of the command and control of naval forces. So, the experience of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 pointed out that command and control had attained the significance of an important factor that determines the attainment of victory in armed combat at sea and its excessive centralization and Vice Admiral Rozhestvenskiy's underestimation of the capabilities of command and control using radio were noted among the causes of the defeat of the 2nd Pacific Squadron in the Battle of Tsushima. Furthermore, the absence of a full-fledged staff under the commanding general had a negative impact on the quality of command and control of forces during this battle. After the Russo-Japanese War, the question on the reorganization of the naval leadership staff was urgently raised. In 1906, the Naval General Staff was created with the functions of operational-strategic leadership of the Navy because the Main Naval Staff that had existed prior to this was involved only with administrative-management activities. During the course of the First World War, objective conditions for the emergence of a new form of combat activity of the fleet -- the naval operation -- developed as a result of the appearance of new branches of forces (submarines and aviation) and the increased scale of combat operations at sea. Its introduction into the practice of armed combat at sea began to be implemented thanks to the increased capabilities of fleet and staff commanding generals for command and control of forces at great distances using radio communications and also for planning large-scale operations with the involvement of operational staff organs. The expansion of the missions, the qualitative and quantitative composition of the Navy, the forms of its combat employment, and the introduction of new technical systems rendered a substantial influence on the development of naval forces command and control techniques. Having absorbed the accumulated domestic and foreign experience of command and control of forces in the First World War and the Civil War, the theory and practice of command and control of forces found its expression in an entire series of interim guidance and instructions and, in 1925, in the first postwar general military regulation. Furthermore, the military reform of 1924-1925, having affected all spheres of activity of the Armed Forces, resulted in the reorganization of the central staff. One-man command was introduced and special research was conducted to improve command and control of forces at all levels. In 1937, the People's Commissariat of the Navy was formed for the direct leadership of fleet forces. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, it introduced a number of documents that regulated the combat activities of the fleets and contained requirements and recommendations for planning and organizing combat operations and the leadership of their conduct. The war years were an important stage in the improvement and development of the naval forces command and control system and principles. The provisions of command and control theory underwent combat verification. Much attention was devoted to summarizing and disseminating combat experience in those years. In the process, the new dimensions of the nature of fleet operations during the course of the Second World War had an impact on the development of the theory and practice of command and control of forces, the most important of which were: the spatial scale that encompassed enormous spheres of the seas and oceans with active combat; the increase of the role of the most universal branches of fleet forces --submarines and aviation (especially, carrier-based aviation) in armed combat; the increase of the significance in attaining the common goal of joint operations of the Army and Navy, their coordination in defensive and offensive operations (which found its expression, in particular, in the increase of the number of amphibious assault landings), during which the fleets were operationally subordinated to the troop coastal combined formations or the creation of a single command authority was stipulated, joint development of combat documents was conducted by staffs, command and control was organized from a single or closely-located command posts, the exchange of staffs by operational groups, etc.; and, the increase of the number of major naval operations and engagements, especially with the participation of carrier-based strike formations. During the course of the Great Patriotic and Second World wars, the staffs of various echelons and other command and control organs, radio communications and situation coverage systems received significant development. The experience of these wars and the new trends of development of the theory and practice of command and control of naval forces lay at the foundation of the resolution of the problems of the leadership of the activities of the fleets right up to the end of the 1950's. During subsequent years, the leading naval powers, including our country, developed qualitatively new ocean navies based upon the achievements of science and the military-technical revolution and modern and fundamentally new command and control systems were deployed to realize the combat potential of these ocean navies. Naval Forces Command and Control Theory at the Current Stage The history of navies, like military history on the whole, does not provide and cannot provide prepared recipes for the resolution of today's problems. Its main value is in the capability to reveal the general patterns of development and to provide a scientific analysis of the phenomena of past wars and to extract object lessons from them. Under contemporary conditions, various types of automated command and control systems, using special software, are being widely utilized for the collection, analysis and transmission of information. This permits them to shift to the automation of the most important process of command and control -- working out a decision. If a decision is the meaty basis of command and control, the command and control system, the main elements of which are command and control organs and facilities, communications and automated command and control systems, and also the system for extracting and gathering information on the situation, serves as its material basis at the present time. Automation of the command and control of forces is normally understood to be the process of developing and realizing the required system of technical equipment that permit accomplishing certain command and control functions automatically, without the participation of man in command and control organs (staffs and command posts). Actually, at the present time it does not appear to be possible to effectively control many spheres of activity, including naval forces, without utilizing automated command and control systems. But nevertheless man still remains the main figure in the command and control process. Really command and control is first and foremost anticipation. Machines can only ease and accelerate the process but are presently incapable of replacing the creativity of the intellect. The decision made by the commanding general (commander) is the basis of command and control of forces. Command and control is structured on its basis and must ensure effective utilization of the combat capabilities of forces and successful accomplishment of missions by them within the prescribed time periods under any conditions of the situation. Therefore, unswerving observance of the principle -- teach staffs and naval forces what is required in war -- as before is the main requirement made toward the activities of commanding generals, commanders, staffs and command and control organs during the planning, organization and conduct of operational and combat training measures. The existing structure of the naval forces command and control system, which was developed in peacetime and includes the command and control organs and facilities, communications and situation coverage systems, and also automated command and control systems, permits us to accomplish the important functions of supporting the conduct of combat operations. It's obvious that, on the one hand, under all conditions the system must ensure stable, uninterrupted, operational and concealed command and control of its own forces and, on the other hand, provide the capability to carry out disruption of the enemy forces and weapons command and control systems by employing men and equipment to disable enemy command and control facilities, communications hubs, navigation systems, etc, or to achieve disruptions in their operation. However, it is not simple to accomplish all of these missions. At the present time, there is an objective need to increase the quality of all training of command and control facilities because its shortcomings reduce the quality of the assessment of the situation which, in turn, does not promote the correct prediction of its development. In the process, this can result not because people are unskilled but because the existing direction of their training and also the level of organization of coordination of command and control facilities combat crews does not always promote success in operations in a specific situation. While considering what has been stated above, steps have already been taken in the fleets to increase the quality of training for the command and control of forces but there still remains a significant sphere for initiative. In the process, in our view, first of all we need a scientific approach to the problem of improving the combat training of command and control facilities, the goal of which must become increasing the combat readiness level of the entire command and control system and its capability to withstand any unpleasant situations under the most varied conditions. Here, in our opinion, along with the resolution of a number of technical problems, we need to increase the quality of individual training of officers of command and control facilities, to precisely ascertain the list of methodological and guiding documents that regulate training for command and control of forces and the performance of operational alert duty and also the selection of the most optimal organizational forms of training utilizing computer systems. Developed at the end of the 1980's, the naval forces command and control system corresponded to the composition, structure and missions being accomplished and on the whole supported command and control of naval forces and also combat and operational training of forces and staffs. In the process, the primary provisions of the new military doctrine on the whole did not affect the principles of its formation. Analysis of the operational training inspections and measures that were conducted in the 1993 training year indicated that, despite a number of deficiencies that were revealed, the Navy's command and control organs are capable of accomplishing the assigned missions. However, the change of the state borders partially affected the effectiveness of the Navy's command and control system. At the present time, the command and control organs themselves have also been subjected to a substantial reorganization and experience shows that a drastic reduction and change of the structures of command and control organs has always been reflected in the qualitative indicators of their functioning. We must also take into account the fact that the entire load of work not only for the command and control of forces but also for the reorganization lies on the command and control organs. Moreover, at the present time we can precisely see the naval powers' navies' increasing role in maintaining peace and stability, accomplishing peacekeeping functions, conducting foreign policy actions under the aegis of the United Nations, rendering assistance to the population in emergency situations, etc. This, in turn, entails the need for a comprehensive analysis and rethinking of a number of directions in the training of command and control organs. With the increased probability of the outbreak of regional conflicts, in this training we need officers to expand their study of the political, economic, and social processes that are occurring in these regions. Here we have touched upon only the most general issues that are associated with the development of naval forces command and control theory. We would like for the chiefs of staff of all levels to participate in the development of its individual issues and to share the experience that has been accumulated in the process on the pages of the press. This will certainly promote the strengthening of the Navy's combat readiness. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.
