Practice over the past 10 years proves that this "Military Service Law" has made important contributions to enhancing the whole nation's awareness of national defense, strengthening the modernization of national defense and the Army, safeguarding state security and social stability, and enabling socialist modernization to proceed smoothly. It is in line with our national conditions, the conditions of the Army, and the general circumstances at home and abroad. The enforcement of the "Military Service Law" as a basic law governing the modernization of national defense has always been and will always be closely bound up with Army building and the building of reserve defense forces. The fact that, over the past 10 years, the building of national defense and the Army has consistently enjoyed a fine atmosphere and care and support from the whole society is a result of the conscientious implementation of the "Military Service Law" by party and government organs at all levels, organizations, enterprises and institutions, and all circles of society. The nationwide enlistment drive has long stayed at high tide and batch after batch of outstanding young people reaching enlistment age vie with each other to join the Army and loyally execute their honorable obligation to defend their motherland. The personnel of our Army have always been young and strong, the services have been able to keep a large number of mainstay technical personnel, efforts have been made to align the building of militia and reserve services with the requirements of people's warfare under modern circumstances, the mobilization capacity of reserve forces has continuously expanded, proper arrangements have been made for large numbers of armymen transferred to civilian work and ex-servicemen who play a positive role in economic construction, and military training work for the broad ranks of students in institutions of higher learning and senior middle schools has moved ahead vigorously. All of these have benefited from the implementation of the "Military Service Law." It is also a result of the mobilization and education provided by the "Military Service Law" that the building of militia and reserve services has strengthened in an all-round way and has played an important role in safeguarding social stability and promoting the building of the two civilizations. In short, the positive influence of the enforcement of the "Military Service Law" on the building of the Army and reserve forces as well as the building of the entire country is multifaceted and of profound and far-reaching significance. There is an important experience in the 10-year enforcement of the "Military Service Law" that deserves to be carried forward: Making a good job of the implementation of the "Military Service Law" under the new circumstances not only depends on the standardizing function of the "Military Service Law" itself, but in the meantime cannot go without propaganda and education on the strategic significance of implementing the "Military Service Law" and all relevant stipulations. The officers and men of our Army and the broad ranks of personnel in the militia and reserve services should continuously enhance their consciousness of national defense and firmly establish awareness of their obligation to enlist in the army through in-depth study of the "Military Service Law." Making a good job of education in national defense and enhancing the sense of national defense is an issue which the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have time and again emphasized since the beginning of reform and opening up, especially since the 14th party congress. This is because it is an ideological foundation for strengthening the building of national defense and the Army and guaranteeing the implementation of the "Military Service Law." This point is ever more important in a peaceful environment. If a country or nation lacks a strong sense of national defense, it is bound to plunge into no end of crises and may even suffer national humiliation and forfeiture of sovereignty. If an army or an armed force has a weak sense of national defense, even if it is well equipped, it will not have a strong fighting will or high combat effectiveness and will not be able to win a war. Making a good job of education in national defense and enhancing the sense of national defense is not only an important aspect, but a primary precondition in the implementation of the "Military Service Law." Education will help each armyman on active service, militiaman, and member of the reserve service to foster patriotism and revolutionary heroism to a greater extent in themselves and conscientiously make their due contributions by discharging their sacred responsibility to protect state security and safeguard social stability and by providing a powerful security safeguard for the deepening of reform and economic development. Compulsory military service is the main body of the military service system and is the basic military service system of our country. Firmly establishing an awareness in people's minds of the importance of performing military service and of executing their duties according to the law is the most fundamental prerequisite for enforcing the "Military Service Law." In the context of the development of a socialist market economy, it is of especially important significance to emphasize this issue. Only by being firmly duty-minded can one correctly understand and treat the adjustments to various interest patterns and interest relations caused by social changes, consistently put the country's security and state interests above everything else, and regard performing military service and executing one's duty according to the law as the most honorable sacred responsibility. Only with this can we effectively resist the influence of money worship and various erroneous ideologies and selflessly dedicate our youth and blood to the glorious positions of army building and protecting our motherland. Only with this can the broad ranks of militiamen and reserve service personnel seek prosperity while being vigilant against possible dangers, take an active part in military training, conscientiously perform various duties in preparation for war, truly become capable assistants to the People's Liberation Army and a strong reserve force, and give better play to their role as a mainstay force in promoting and protecting socialist modernization. Since the "Military Service Law" was promulgated 10 years ago, local governments at all levels and the general public have done a great deal of fruitful work to strengthen the modernization of national defense and have created many favorable conditions for army building and the building of reserve defense forces for which we would like to express our deepest respect and gratitude. We are determined to do a better job in studying, propagating, and implementing the "Military Service Law" under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and, together with the people of all nationalities in the country and under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue to make new contributions to speeding up the modernization of national defense.
