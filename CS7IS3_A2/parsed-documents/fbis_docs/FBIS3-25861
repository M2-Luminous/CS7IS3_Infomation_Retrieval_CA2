"It is Japan and Western Europe that the US Government and businesses should square up to," said Zhou Shijian, Vice President of the Institute of International Trade Research at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and economic Co-operation. He attributed the US's ballooning trade deficit mainly to the country's lacklustre competition with Japan and Western Europe in capital-and technology-intensive projects. "The deficit with China is the result of a reshaped US industrial structure, which encourages the import of labour-intensive products from the country," he explained. The US would have even higher costs if it reduced such imports and relied on domestic production, he added. "The imports, although producing trade deficits, help the US to direct more of its resources to high technology development," he said. The US has moved a large chunk of its labour-intensive projects overseas since the end of World War II to take advantage of cheap local labour. "This shift can only be conducive to the American economy," Zhou said. A similar advantage arises from the US policy to import natural resources such as oil, rather than to use its own. Although the imports fuel its trade deficit, they effectively preserve the US's own natural resource reserves, Zhou argued. It is estimated that, each year, the US consumes about 30 percent of the world's natural resources, including 26.6 percent of oil production. "As the world's second largest oil producer, the US could well reduce its imports by exploring for more domestic crude oil and natural gas. But this runs counter to the US policy to use foreign oil first," Zhou pointed out. To cut the trade surplus with the US, Japan has proposed to import oil from Alaska, but the offer was rejected by the US. In short, the imports of large amounts of resources and daily consumer goods form an integral part of the US economy and support its economic growth, Zhou concluded. "What poses the real threat to the American economy is the competition from Japan and Westem Europe in such high-tech areas as computers, automobiles, silicon semiconductors and so on," he said. By 1992, Japanese-made sedan cars had dominated about one-fourth of the American market, pushing the US Big Three--General Motors, Ford and Chrysler--to order intermittent layoffs. "The US has to come up with a serious strategy for this problem," Zhou said. As a result of teetering productivity in the 1970s to 1980s, the US economy stagnated. Indeed, US productivity in the manufacturing sector has trailed that of most Western countries, a fact which eventually led to the US's first trade deficit in 1971 since 1888 A rising US dollar has also contributed much to the country's growing deficit, Zhou said. As for the US's claims of a huge deficit with China, he said, the figures are bloated. What with more Japanese, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwanese and South Korean companies investing in China, their trade surpluses with the US have been concealed and unjustifiably calculated into the Chinese accounts. These companies create huge margins of profits by exporting their Chinese-made products to the US. But the US regards all this profit as rolling into China's pockets, because US trade statistics are based on a product's country of origin. "In fact, more than two-thirds of the US deficit since the 1980s has been caused by direct and indirect trade with Japanese companies," Zhou pointed out. Similarly, the US has calculated much of the profits earned in China by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese investors as China's revenues. China actually has received only processing fees from the companies financed by these regions, Zhou said. Foreign-invested enterprises account for more than 20 percent of China's annual export volumes. Much of their exports have ended up in the US market, inflating China's trade surplus with the US. Moreover, many US multinationals, such as Nike, ship most of their Chinese-made products back to the US, with revenues lining American pockets. But the US regards these sales as China's exports, Zhou pointed out. "If the US had clearer statistics for the internal trade of its own multinationals, we could say that the US enjoys a trade surplus, not a trade deficit, at present," he said. Meanwhile, the US does not include its income from arms sales-- valued at an average of $20 billion to $30 billion each year--into its trade figures.
