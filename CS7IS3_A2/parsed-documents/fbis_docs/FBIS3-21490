With the creation of the Civil Engineering Regulatory Organization, the distribution of [the engineering] workforce throughout the country will become equitable. An ABRAR correspondent reports that, yesterday, Engineer Seyyed Reza Hashemi, deputy minister of Urban Development and Architecture Affairs of the Ministry of Housing, in an interview with journalists, said that the second elections of the Civil Engineering Regulatory Organization will be held simultaneously in 25 provinces. He added: Throughout the country there are 25,000 engineers in different fields, at least 50 percent of whom are in Tehran and the rest of them are in rural areas. Hashemi also said that with the completion of these elections, which will be held simultaneously during the month of Esfand [20 February-20 March], an organization and a management council to handle engineering affairs will be established in each province. He added: The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development enacted national construction regulations five years ago, and these regulations have been arranged in 20 chapters, seven of which have been approved by the cabinet council. Of course, the government is not able to be both legislator and enforcer. For this reason, from now on, these provincial organizations will inspect and investigate violations of construction regulations. In response to ABRAR's question of whether the Civil Engineering Regulatory Organization is considered a branch of the Ministry of Housing or if it will be independent, Eng. Hashemi said that the government and the Ministry of Housing must support such organizations and supervise their work, but he said that on the whole this organization will act independently. Our correspondent asked: If it is considered independent, then why does the Ministry of Housing interfere directly in its elections? The deputy minister of housing answered: We [the Ministry of Housing] will hold the first elections, but future elections will be their own responsibility. During this same interview, Musa Firuzi, the public relations director of the Ministry of Housing, said: the Ministry of Housing, with an allocation of 150 billion rials, has undertaken 48 university projects that will cover an infrastructure of 400,000 square meters, with a capacity of 50,000 students--10 projects of which will be ready for use during the 10 Days of Dawn. He added: During the same time, 92 development projects, which will include rehabilitation and physiotherapy centers, and security stations, 83 housing units and 175 classrooms, will be ready for use. In conclusion, Firuzi said: 50,000 lots are also being prepared, which after completion will be delivered to those who had applied for them.
