FBIS4-27208 "dreas104_a_94041" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan DSP Head Likely To Resign DSP Head Likely To Resign OW3105064594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0549 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105064594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The head of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) is likely to step down soon over his part in a political maneuver that ended up leaving the ruling coalition without a Diet majority, party officials said Tuesday [31 May]. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi is tilting toward resigning, possibly by the weekend, and Takashi Yonezawa, party's general secretary, will probably succeed him, they said. The DSP, a centrist component of the ruling coalition, will hold an emergency meeting of its policy-making board this week to discuss the issue, they said. Ouchi has been under fire from rank-and-file party members and supporters for his role in creating the new Diet bloc Kaishin, which excluded the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party in the previous coalition government. The SDPJ walked out of the coalition immediately after it helped to elect Tsutomu Hata as prime minister on April 25 as it saw the Ouchi-initiated move as a plot to reduce its influence on policy- making. The parliamentary debacle greatly undermined Hata's political standing, and he has been the constant target of opposition calls for his resignation or snap elections since he came to office. Ouchi has talked with the DSP leadership about the Kaishin and as a result is close to deciding to quit, party insiders said. Party officials, however, are concerned that if Ouchi resigns to take responsibility for the Kaishin fiasco it could have unpleasant repercussions for the coalition. Key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- the other prime movers behind Kaishin -- could also come under fire, they said. That would further shake the already-sputtering coalition, they said. Some young party members, on the other hand, are demanding that Ouchi make clear his responsibility for the Kaishin debacle. Ouchi said at a Tuesday press conference that he is still consulting party colleagues and has yet to make a final decision on the issue.
