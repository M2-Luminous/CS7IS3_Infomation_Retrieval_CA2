Jacques Chirac, former French prime minister and mayor of Paris, and his colleagues at the office of the Council of Ministers. On this occasion H.E. Hun Sen talked about the current situation in Cambodia. He asked the French Government to assist Cambodia in the fields of agriculture, water policy, communication lines linking cities and rural areas, electricity, and professional training. H.E. Hun Sen also suggested that France, cochairman of the Paris international conference on Cambodia, help push signatory countries to quickly implement their pledges to provide appropriate aid (?in accordance with) the territorial integrity and Cambodia's rehabilitation. Concerning the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Hun Sen said that the stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] remains the same, that is, it is always keeping the door open for the Khmer Rouge to join in the country's construction as government advisers or even member of the royal government, if a majority of the National Assembly agrees by amending the constitution. He also said that the Khmer Rouge have shown no intention of being reconciled with the nation and taking part in the rebuilding of Cambodia. On the contrary, they have intensified their activities in attacking the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] more vigorously. H.E. Hun Sen stressed that the RGC can accept the Khmer Rouge only when they properly respect the three conditions set by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, namely, the cease-fire, the demobilization and inclusion of Khmer Rouge troops into the KRAF, and the handing over of the territory being controlled by the Khmer Rouge to the RGC. H.E. Hun Sen said that if the Khmer Rouge continue to fight and talk at the same time, the RGC cannot accept this. H.E. Hun Sen also appealed to the French Government to use its influence to prevent infiltrations by the Khmer Rouge along the border. H.E. Jacques Chirac promised to do all he could to continue providing garbage trucks, help Phnom Penh City to have sufficient electricity, assist in providing clean water to the city, and help train Cambodian students who have just finished their studies. As for the RGC's request for the French Government to help build a park along the Tonle Sap River in front of the royal palace stretching to the base of the Chrouy Changva bridge, H.E. Jacques Chirac said studies would be conducted with the Phnom Penh City side first.
