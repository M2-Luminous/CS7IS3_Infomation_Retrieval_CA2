Kim issued the directives at a breakfast meeting with members of the Unification-National Security Policy Coordination Council that was established on his orders last month, his senior aide Chong Chong-ok said. He asked the military to be on constant alert against events like an increase in the frequency of North Korean military exercises, while emphasizing that the council should seek to formulate policies in unison under new Deputy Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. One inside source described what he said were North Korea's attempts to disband the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). North Korean members to the MAC Secretariat had been on resident duty but Pyongyang withdrew them as of April 29, the source said, an indication that it is trying to nullify the commission all together. The source saw the move as part of Pyongyang's insistence to the United States that the Armistice Agreement of 1953 should be replaced by a peace treaty. This source also reminded of an unexpected military exercise on April 30 when 15 to 20 North Korean air force planes took off from Pyongyang and flew as far down South as near the demarcation line. The president added that the council must try to regain the public's trust by demonstrating unity and cooperation. Monday's breakfast meeting was the first gathering of the council members since Yi took office last Saturday. The members shared their views on pending issues, including the North Korean nuclear dispute and resettlement of North Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps.
