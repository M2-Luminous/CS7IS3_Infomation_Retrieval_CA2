FR940414-1-00046 FR940414-1-00010 Products that are formulated, packaged or repackaged contain various percentages of one or more of the 272 active ingredients considered in the survey for this regulation by EPA. Some products may contain less than one percent of active ingredient by weight, while others may contain over 95 percent of active ingredient by weight. The five active ingredients that had the highest estimated use in products that were formulated, packaged or repackaged are listed below: •Atrazine is a herbicide used to control various weeds mainly on corn and sorghum crops. An estimated 278 million pounds of atrazine were used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by water-using pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in 1988. •Alachlor is used as a preemergence herbicide to control certain grasses and weeds in a variety of crops such as corn, cotton, soybeans, and potatoes. An estimated 141 million pounds of alachlor was used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by the water-using pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in 1988. •Cyanazine is used as a preemergence or postemergence herbicide for corn, or as weed control on fallow cropland. An estimated 107 million pounds of cyanazine were used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by the water-using facilities in 1988. •Methyl Bromide is used as a space fumigant to control insects and rodents in greenhouses, grain elevators, and other areas used to store various commodities. It may also be used as a preplant soil fumigant to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds. An estimated 95 million pounds of methyl bromide was used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by the water-using facilities in 1988. •Glyphosate is a non-selective, non-residual post-emergence herbicide used on grasses, sedges and broad leaved weeds. An estimated 86 million pounds of glyphosate was used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by the water using facilities in 1988. Production lines range from complex configurations involving numerous formulating and packaging steps to simpler lines that transfer product from storage to a marketable container. Typically, facilities that formulate and package products operate lines that include one or more storage tanks, one or more formulating processes such as mixing, blending, grinding, milling and filtering, and a final packaging process. Facilities in Subcategory C that solely package products typically transfer a product from a storage tank into a marketable container, and facilities that solely repackage products transfer product from one marketable container into another marketable container. Facilities that merely relabel a product's container are not under the scope of today's notice. The average market value of a production line is estimated to be $216,000 and the median value is estimated to be $10,000. The gap in magnitude between average and median is representative of the fact that most of the facilities attach a relatively modest market value (half estimates a value less than $10,000) while a relatively few facilities attach very high market value to their production lines bringing the average up to $216,000. The number of products formulated, packaged or repackaged on each line varies from line to line and from facility to facility. Some lines are dedicated to one product while others may handle ten or more. Certain lines produce a variety of pesticide products that contain the same or a similar pesticide active ingredient, while other lines produce pesticides that contain a variety of different active ingredients. Some lines are also used to formulate, package or repackage products that have different formulation types. The questionnaire requested facilities to specify those months each pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging line was in operation in 1988, and to estimate the total number of days and hours each line was in operation in 1988. Most lines (66%) are operated 80 days or less in the production of registered products that contain one of the 272 active ingredients covered by the survey. A high proportion (28%) of lines are estimated to be in operation 10 days or less per year. 2. Repackaging Performed at Refilling Establishments (Subcategory E) This subcategory applies to repackaging of agricultural pesticide products done by refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sales, for the purpose of this preamble these facilities will be referred to as refilling establishments. The term refilling establishment is defined by the proposed 40 CFR part 165 rule as an establishment where the activity of repackaging pesticide product into refillable containers occurs, and encompasses a broader universe of facilities than the previous description and than this proposal will apply. When it became apparent that refilling establishments are so numerous, and among themselves very similar but very different from the formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities, EPA decided to segregate refilling establishments into a separate subcategory. The distinction of refilling establishments from repackaging activities is that refilling establishments use a refillable container as the receptacle of the repackaged product. Refilling establishments perform a single operation that is covered by today's notice: repackaging agricultural pesticide product. As a group, refilling establishments are very similar to one another. They differ from pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in the following ways: (1) Locations_refilling establishments of agricultural pesticides are mostly in rural areas or small towns while formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities are frequently urban; (2) SIC codes_refilling establishments are in 5191, which characterizes establishments as ``primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of animal feeds, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, pesticides, seeds and other farm supplies except grains'', whereas PFPR facilities reported being classified in SIC code 2879; and (3) customers_refilling establishments are retail establishments, selling directly to the end user (i.e., the farmer), while formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities sell to distributors or retailers. EPA's approach to developing effluent guidelines and standards is different between the two groups due in large part to the nature and origin of the wastewater, as explained below. Refilling establishments of agricultural chemicals repackage pesticide products from bulk storage tanks into smaller portable containers commonly referred to as minibulk or shuttle tanks. These refillable containers are constructed of plastic and typically have capacities ranging from 100 to 500 gallons. Minibulk containers may be owned by the refilling establishment, the pesticide registrant, or by the end user. Refilling establishments do not formulate a registered pesticide product. Refilling establishments may also offer additional pesticide services such as custom blending and commercial application. Pesticide products are usually blended with water or other carriers and applied to farmers' fields using trucks equipped with application equipment. Of the estimated 1,134 refilling establishments estimated by the 1988 data, 935 are estimated to provide application services of registered pesticide products. Today's notice does not apply to facilities that offer custom application services unless they are also refilling establishments of agricultural pesticide chemicals. Refilling establishments frequently provide fertilizer sales and application as well as selling seeds and other farm supplies. Refilling establishments are usually located in small towns and serve rural agricultural areas. The largest concentration of refilling establishments is in EPA Regions V and VII which contain most of the midwestern agricultural states.
