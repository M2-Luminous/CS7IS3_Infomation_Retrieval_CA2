In this month of China's most important holiday, consumers' strong buying mood is exerting severe pressure on the government's effort to control inflation, said Wang Shiyuan, Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring. However, Wang noted, "I am still confident that the government will attain its goal of containing inflation within 10 percent this year." Despite Wang's confidence, the State Statistics Bureau reported that in December inflation in the 35 largest cities rose to a record 23.9 percent. Some Beijingers doubted the government would be able to cap inflation at 10 percent. One resident, Li An, said the government's latest financial reforms--including the unified exchange rate, the consumption tax and the new accounting system--might undercut effective control over the rising cost of living. Wang Shiyuan said the government has foreseen possible side-effects of its reform and will take measures to keep inflation at bay. The most important step in easing inflationary pressures is to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of goods, he added. The government also intends to restrain economic expansion this year by keeping growth in the gross domestic product to 9 percent. In addition. it will strictly supervise bank lending for investment in fixed assets. Wang said several factors pose a threat to the government's efforts to control inflation: --Production costs for industry and agriculture have risen over the past few years as a result of government price increases for various production materials. --Last year's 19.6 percent rise in the national cost of living has already created conditions that hamper the government's campaign against inflation. --Apart from unifying the dual-rate exchange system, which effectively raises the cost of imports, the government also plans to deregulate the prices of other product some time this year. Increased financing during the fourth quarter of last year to stimulate industrial production has had a notable impact on production, but also on inflation, Wang added.
