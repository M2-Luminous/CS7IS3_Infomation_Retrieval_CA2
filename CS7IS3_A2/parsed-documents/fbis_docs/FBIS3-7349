Statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: Following its abortion of the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks, the United States was recently maneuvering to put military pressure on us while unjustly kicking up commotions with regard to nuclear inspections in the international community. While babbling that it would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which it had decided to suspend, the United States decided to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea. Forty-eight Patriot missile launching pads and a missile unit of more than 800 men are moving to South Korea from Texas, the United States, on orders from the U.S. President on 21 March, and they will reportedly arrive in South Korea toward the end of April. This proves that, from the very beginning, the United States had no intention to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiations but has used the "nuclear problem" as a means of isolating and stifling the DPRK. We sternly denounce the U.S. shipment of Patriot missiles to South Korea as a deliberate act to openly break the agreed point of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement on refraining from nuclear threat to the other and push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. The United States is bringing Patriot missiles to South Korea, laying the blame for the collapse of the dialogue at the door of the DPRK. This is a deliberate, dangerous military action to make the military situation of the Korean peninsula all the more unstable and, further, cause another war. Though the U.S. authorities are now claiming that the Patriot is a "defensive weapon," they cannot justify its deployment in South Korea with any pretext. From the topographical point of view, the Patriot missile can be used for the purpose of strike at any place of the Korean peninsula, which is not large. It is known to everyone that its target can be changed by the kind of the warhead it is tipped with. The U.S. shipment of new-type Patriots in South Korea is nothing but an open aggressive act to threaten the DPRK militarily and make a forestalling strike at it. The United States reveals its intention to keep hold on South Korea indefinitely as its forward base in the Far East and continue to play the role of the MP [military police] in this region by deploying the improved missiles. Our people and Asian people express a great worry over this reckless military action by the United States which threatens overall peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Asia in general. The decision of the United States to deploy the new-type Patriot missiles in South Korea is an illegal act of wantonly violating the Korean armistice agreement and ignoring the armistice machine. The armistice agreement clearly stipulates that military equipment and combat materiel shall not be introduced into the Korean peninsula. In the past days, the United States shipped into South Korea nuclear arms and many other kinds of equipment of new types in a covert manner, fearful of the armistice agreement. This time, however, it openly declared the deployment of the new-type of Patriot missiles in South Korea and is forcing it in broad daylight. This shows that the U.S. authorities pay no heed to the armistice agreement and armistice machine, and they throw away any international commitments like a pair of worn-out shoes if it is to attain their aim. It must not be overlooked that the South Korean authorities, wearing their own nuclear helmet under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella," officially asked for the deployment of the Patriot missiles, clinging to the coattails of outside forces as ever. This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have joined the United States in the nuclear kickup to stifle the DPRK and that they are not interested at all in the implementation of the "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula". The behaviour of the South Korean authorities makes it plain that they are more zealous in frustrating the DPRK-U.S. talks than in realizing the exchange of special envoys. The United States must immediately stop the deployment of the missiles posing a great threat to peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the Far East, and the South Korean authorities must discontinue at once their treacherous acts harming the fellow countrymen. If the United States finally deploys new-type missiles after turning a deaf ear to this just demand of ours, it would entail grave consequences. The United States must ponder over this. 28 March 1994, Pyongyang
