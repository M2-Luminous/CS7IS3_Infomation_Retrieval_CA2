In a statement on the sidelines of the Second Conference for Solidarity and Cooperation in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, scheduled to open in Cairo Saturday, he said that this statement, which was broadcast over Israeli Radio, if it was truly made, is considered a violation of the Security Council resolution on Jerusalem and former U.S. administrations' stances, which considered Jerusalem as occupied territory. He noted that such a statement will lead to confusion and harm the peace process, especially at this time when we are talking of a fair and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy's resolutions, primarily Resolution 242, and of former U.S. President Bush's call for the exchange of land for peace. He pointed out that the Arab and Palestinian stand affirms that what applies to the occupied territories applies to Jerusalem. Tawfiq Zayyad, member of the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality and Nazareth mayor, who is participating in the conference, said that East Jerusalem will remain the eternal capital of a Palestinian state and that any other thinking is a figment of one's imagination. He said that the Arab population of Nazareth, which has been part of the occupied territories since 1948, launched a mammoth uprising and general strike in the wake of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that occurred in Ramadan. He noted that these people clashed with Israeli police, which arrested 60 to 70 people, including four of his own sons. It should be recalled that a Palestinian delegation is participating in the Second Conference for Solidarity and Cooperation in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, scheduled to begin in Cairo tomorrow.
