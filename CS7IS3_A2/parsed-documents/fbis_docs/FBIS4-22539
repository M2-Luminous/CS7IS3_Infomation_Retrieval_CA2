A Triptych of Two Ministers and One Vice President": date not given] [Text] Nothing original about it--a banal situation expressed in a banal way: the Kiev airport was socked in by fog. An hour after taking off, our big bird was forced to land in Donetsk. All the city airports in Ukraine closed down on 11 January, and the Georgian government delegation was stuck between Tbilisi and Kiev. We had all kinds of time. Immersed in the murk, nobody was in any hurry, owing to the "meteorological conditions," and it therefore became possible to talk about economic problems with three professionals, very frankly, on a subject that was very popular and not very dangerous. "Was it a mistake for Georgia to introduce the coupon, and if so why? The answer to this question began the interview with Murtaz Zankaliani, the minister of trade and supply. The First Raiment [Zankaliani] The trouble with our economists (I'm an economist so I'm speaking mainly of myself) is that we are wise after the fact. None among us in Georgia could have predicted it. It is after we come to the abyss that we find we've chosen the wrong path. That was the case with the coupon. I voiced my own skepticism toward it in Parliament. But that's not the main thing. The main thing is that after we introduced the coupon we had no other choice. We had no other currency, and of course we couldn't leave people without pay. [Saneblidze] Were there previous mistakes that brought us to this predicament? [Zankaliani] Our mistake was that we should have stayed in the inflated ruble zone until we were kicked out. We should have had the coupon and the lari [the proposed Georgian national currency unit] ready the way many republics of the former USSR had their own currency. We were too hasty, rejecting the Russian ruble prematurely, although by October 1992 no more rubles were coming in from Russia, and all of our government's attempts to get rubles were futile. The reason was that in August 1992, in Bishkek, where the question of whether to remain in the ruble zone was being decided, we did not have a clearly formed position, although Russia's representatives easily read between the lines and knew that we would be the first to quit the ruble zone. That's why they cut us off from the ruble supply source. We had in effect quit the zone too quickly. In March and April 1993 we had no Russian money at all, so we had to introduce the coupon whether we liked it or not. [Saneblidze] The political background? Didn't it influence that decision? [Zankaliani] Anti-Russian sentiment, of course, was one of the main reasons. We realized later that that categorical stance, which I criticized at the time, was wrong. We had been integrated in the Soviet economy for 70 years; for 200 years we have not run our own country as we saw fit, with our own resources. Any minister in that period, for example, working according to Soviet instructions, was virtually a robot. And not just ministers, either. Things were like that on all levels, in every sector. We should have learned to run our country first, we needed a kind of adaptation period. But we tried to do everything at once. There is probably not a man in Georgia who thinks that Georgia does not need absolute political independence, but economic independence cannot be achieved just by revolution and breaking up the old order. Georgia was so much integrated into the former unified Soviet economic complex--raw materials, supplies, components, energy, standards (an electric locomotive assembled in Tbilisi could only be operated, for example, within the former USSR), and, finally, the marketing system--that breaking up the ties without having something new to replace them was tantamount to cutting vital arteries. Experience has once more confirmed this sad truth. Economic independence requires gradual preparation; being hasty is like building a house from the roof down. That's what we tried. [Saneblidze] There was probably a political motive behind this? [Zankaliani] Of course, but I'm sure that the politicians who were so vehemently opposed to these ties and relations have now realized the error of this position. [Saneblidze] Let's return to the coupon as an attribute of our economic independence.... [Zankaliani] The coupon did work for a few months. The biggest plus was that it was accepted by the market and the peasant. For the domestic market, for the closed-cycle economy (from the producer to the consumer within the borders of Georgia), the coupon seemed to be adequate. But that economy is extremely small. We have to import energy, raw materials, and supplies from outside, you know. When our supplies ran out and we had to bring in more, the coupon couldn't do it. Neither agriculture nor the peasant could work. Worse, the peasant couldn't even bring his crops to the city to sell. The situation required Russian currency or some other foreign currency. Inflation skyrocketed. In a few months, the coupon-to-ruble ratio rose from 1 to 10 to 1 to 100. The coupon became worthless. [Saneblidze] What do you think of circulating the coupon and the ruble on an equal basis within the republic? [Zankaliani] I'm a little ambivalent. We have got together several times with Vice Premier Amiran Kadagishvili to discuss the problem. Two positions have emerged. The first is to permit parallel currencies--rubles, dollars, francs and others--along with the Georgian coupon (or lari). The second is to seek ways and means of keeping the coupon as the sole medium of payment. I have not yet formed an opinion, although I do lean toward the parallel idea, because, like it or not, we have to import supplies and raw materials which the coupon cannot buy. Our governmental delegation intends to conclude agreements with various countries on trade and economic cooperation. A special place in this package is held by clearing relations. If Ukraine agrees to such a relation* (*Footnote: Readers of SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA know that the Ukrainian government, in an agreement concluded with the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers on 12 December, made a sole exception for our country and decided to engage in cashless settlements--commodity clearing--for Georgia alone.)--Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and others have already made that decision--it will strengthen the coupon to some extent. But the ties we are arranging on the inter-state level are still too small, because basically everything goes on in the non-state sector, on the level of direct relations, and making parallel currencies official will constitute acknowledgment of the actual situation. Officially, the coupon is the sole medium of payment. This decision is not backed up by any law or normative act, so the state cannot punish violators. What shall we do? Let us legalize the existing situation, but... a portion of Georgia's population, you know, is classified as socially unprotected. For a certain period, at least, the country won't be able to pay wages and pensions to these people with Russian currency, even in part. For that reason, I'm a little afraid of my own proposal to introduce parallel currencies. But if the agreements we get on these trips of ours enable us to give absolute guarantees to Georgia's socially unprotected population that we will accept their coupons for bread, sugar, shortening, salt, matches, and so on, also rent and utilities, if we accept only coupons on public transportation--if we protect their vital interests in this way--then we can introduce parallel currencies. This will not be as frightening as some think. In many countries, including Ukraine, the coupon is the national currency, the sole medium of payment. In parallel fashion, there are two-way currency exchange offices, and nobody makes a fuss over it. We distort things: Hey, take your coupon and try to exchange it for a ruble and see what you get. That's another reason parallel currencies are needed. [Saneblidze] What about doing away with the mafia's ability to make money with money? [Zankaliani] Yes, their ability to make money from money is a distortion of the classical formula of money-commodity-money (without which even the classical banking country cannot exist). We will never get a market economy that way. Sorry to say, Georgia does not yet have any real major businessmen and major entrepreneurs. No one has even opened a tiny shop to produce combs. A real businessman would generate so much capital in his business that he would have 10 to 15 percent profit at the end of the year. What is happening in our country is abnormal. There are those who think that buying butter cheaply in Moscow and selling it dear in Tbilisi is real business.... [Saneblidze] How do you see the problem of the parallel currency proposal and our entry into the ruble zone? [Zankaliani] I know that some countries (Belarus, Tajikistan) are headed that way. But I also know that Russia's economists are definitely not in favor of that idea. Specialists in Moscow assured me that if Belarus returns to the ruble zone it will require printing up an additional trillion rubles, which will spark a 10-percent rise in the Russian currency's inflation. Even if we were to try very hard to get back into the Russian ruble zone, they wouldn't accept us, and rightly so. Nevertheless, entering the ruble zone is not ruled out. It depends on what the West actually does to support us--if there is an increase in aid, financial injections and investments, if the situation in the country calms down, and if our economy revives according to the program whose foundation we are laying with these visits, a different situation may take shape. But if none of this happens, the situation will get so much worse that we will have to beg Russia on our knees to take us into the ruble zone. As a Georgian and a citizen of my country, I don't want that to happen, because when another country's currency is in your country, that country calls the shots. We need to take the roundabout route. But I greatly fear that we will end up having to join the ruble zone. [Saneblidze] So reviving our economy, making it work, is one way to establish a national currency. Do I understand you correctly? [Zankaliani] Yes. A Georgian currency needs Georgian commodities. The Japanese, who have no real natural resources, have put their wit to work. We are poor too, we have counted it up and all our efforts can't even meet one-fifth of our needs. In such a situation, the state, the government will have to manage a certain portion--perhaps 30 percent--of our resources in the transition stage; the other 70 percent can be allocated by the market economy. Well, now we are organizing that management in the Cabinet of Ministers. We will put the clearing method into action, export what we have and import what we need. Our ministry and the services which we have created will be the catalysts of coupon sales. This will reinforce the coupon. [Saneblidze] You said in one interview that other countries in our position have introduced their own national currency or a substitute for it and, to stabilize it, received 60 million dollars in credit from the World Currency Fund. How about us? [Zankaliani] They have treated us badly. They gave 60 million dollars to Kyrghyzstan so that country could introduce its own som. For us they couldn't even spare 60 dollars. I know that the National Bank and the Finance Minister are working on these problems, and maybe something will work out, especially considering that we have been given the status of a developing country. We have to work on that. An interesting detail: just 20 million dollars would be enough to retrieve the mass of coupons that have been issued to the public; that's how high the coupon's inflation is. If we do that, maybe it will enhance wages paid in coupons. We really do need to make coupons the sole medium of payment in Georgia. We have to work on that too. [Saneblidze] That is the only solution. Now, another problem--the managed 30 percent of our resources, the rest for economic reform. How can these two extremes--centralization and reform--coexist? [Zankaliani] The non-state sector is the only way to develop the country, its future. But the state must make the effort to support it. In France, for example, the state sector makes up 53 percent (meaning the form of ownership). The decision has to be made whether this store or that enterprise belongs to a company, a joint-stock company, or the state. And whoever owns it has to run it. If we do not provide the people with social protection, they won't allow us to build a market economy. Hence, the economy cannot exist without state regulation. Anyone today who is thinking of amassing money and living in Georgia is making a big mistake. If you have money, put it to work, use it to create jobs. Businessmen and entrepreneurs need to give careful thought to these matters. It is entrepreneurs of the Saradzhishvili type who will save Georgia. In conclusion, it should not be hard, going by world experience, for these seemingly mutually exclusive forces--structures operating by the principles of centralized, state management and those of the market economy--to coexist. Generally, however, discussions of these problems, for some reason, go by the closed-circle principle: bankers sit by themselves, entrepreneurs sit by themselves, and supply specialists sit by themselves. We need to look for integrated approaches. [Saneblidze] I'll take that advice, and I want to ask your opinion about the 32 percent, which remains an unresolved problem in the argument between the banks and the entrepreneurs. Why can't they agree? [Zankaliani] That is called currency/foreign exchange earnings. A country which converts to its own currency passes a law that business concerns, and so forth, which have foreign currency coming into their accounts have to give the state a certain percentage by exchanging it for the local currency. That law was passed last April, but to this day not a single ruble has come in. Quite apart from private firms, even our state enterprises are leaving the money they earned from product sales in Russia. That money is circulating there and benefitting Russia's economy. That's one of the reasons for our misery. If we could regain this money by way of expert appraisal, it would add up to about 40 billion rubles, or 5 to 10 million dollars. There are ways to correct the situation, and we ought to do so.
