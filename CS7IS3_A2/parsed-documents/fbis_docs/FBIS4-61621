"The Federal Counter-Intelligence Service has detained an ex- staffer of the Moscow Regional Interior Department's Punishment Execution Division (dismissed in April 1994) and a senior investigator of the Russian Interior Ministry's Investigation Committee on charge of currency rules' violation (Article 88 of the Russian Criminal Code), abuse of office (Article 170) and bribing (Article 174, part 1). They have been arrested," says the document. "A staffer of the bar has been arrested on charge of bribing (Article 174, Part 1). His case will be investigated by the Russian procurator general's office. All the three were charged on May 6. None of high-ranking staffers of the Russian Interior Ministry is involved in this case," it stresses. "The Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the Interior Ministry would like to draw attention to joint actions of the Service and the Ministry as regards this case. This is a regular practice. The stand of Service and Ministry heads on corruption, abuse of office and other crimes committed by their staffers is clear: Reliability and pure morals of staffers and security of services are topical for the whole law-enforcement system. "Exposure and prevention of corruption in the law-enforcement bodies and other state structures are direct duties of counter- intelligence and interior bodies, their work to ensure national security envisaged by the current legislation. "Coordinated efforts of the law-enforcement bodies and secret services, interaction and close cooperation of interior bodies and counter-intelligence are the main condition, obligatory and natural element of their successful measures, in particular those against dangerous crimes. "Staffers of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter- Intelligence Service have held a number of successful joint operations to stop activities of many dangerous criminal groups involved in illicit drug trafficking, arms sales and antics contraband. The comprehensive operations of Putina, Tral and Arsenal were a success. "In this connection public relations centers of the Russian Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service think that rumors claiming confrontation and the "war of monsters"--the Ministry and the Service, are nothing but a provocation that affects the common cause, measures against crime and corruption, provision of security of individuals, society and the state," says the statement.
