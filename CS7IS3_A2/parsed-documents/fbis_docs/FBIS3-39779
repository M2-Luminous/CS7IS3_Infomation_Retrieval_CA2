During his talks with Antonin Baudys, Golhan stated that the initiative did not reflect the present situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Turkish side opposed above all the supposition that the conflict in this former Yugoslav republic was religiously motivated. According to the Turkish minister of defense, Ankara was aiming above all to preserve the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state that had been recognized by the United Nations and by the international community. The Baudys initiative is, on the contrary, alleged to envisage the split of the republic.
