The bus was packed with passengers, suitcases, and, worst of all, cans of gasoline and in seconds was turned into a crematorium furnace. Out of the 58 passengers, 31 died in the fire. The rest suffered various burns of various degrees of severity. Eleven are hovering between life and death. According to information from the temporary administration of the state of emergency zone, this incident is an unfortunate accident and is not connected in any way with the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. However, it is assumed here that the affair is linked to Ossetian terrorists who were taking revenge for the murder of Marat Khugayev and Boris Kabisov, inhabitants of Sunzha, a village in Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon, the day before. Incidentally, their death has already had tragic consequences. Last Thursday a detachment of troops assigned to the temporary administration were traveling in two armored personnel carriers while combing the forest where Khugayev and Kabisov were killed. The soldiers stumbled across a group of armed strangers. When told to stop, the latter replied with automatic fire and grenades. A battle ensued. The gunmen escaped into the heart of Ingushetia. Aleksandr Grishko, a compulsory-service servicemen of the Russian Federation Internal Troops, was killed; two staffers of the Ingushetia MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] -- Sergeant Yevkoyev and Junior Lieutenant Dobriyev -- were seriously wounded. On Saturday administration troops, carrying out the leadership's order to clear the security zone of the opposing sides' armed subunits, demanded the removal of an Ingush permanent observation post located on Ossetian territory. The reply was sporadic fire. An operational investigations group of the Russian MVD has investigated all these incidents.
