He added [words indistinct] that what has become known as the "Lockerbie" crisis, which was made public in a sudden and planned manner on 1 November 1991, and despite the numerous efforts and initiatives...[agency ellipses] the three Western countries insisted on transforming a legal conflict into a political issue to achieve [word indistinct] against the Great Jamahiriyah, and resorted to the UN Security Council and issued three resolutions, 731/92, 748/92, and 883/93. Despite that, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah agreed to deal with Resolution No. 731/92 and took practical measures to respond to [word indistinct] condemning terrorism in all its forms...[agency ellipses] complete readiness to cooperate with any quarter combating terrorism, affirmed that there were no camps for training terrorists, and repeated its call for the UN secretary general to send a fact-finding mission to investigate that. He added: "The only remaining part to complete the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 731 was that the two suspects appear before justice. As it is the case in all countries of the world, laws stipulated that the nationals of a given country should not be handed over for trial in other countries. Nevertheless, the Basic People's Congresses issued a decision stating that they did not object to the two suspects appearing before a fair and transparent court to be agreed upon." [passage omitted] He stressed: "The Great Jamahiriyah insisted that the venue for the court must have all objective conditions required in any just court, because what was reported by Western media, what was written by a former CIA agent in his book, and what was announced by the director of the Swedish electronics firm that manufactured the timing devices refuted the main point in the charges against the two Libyan nationals, against whom the Western media had issued a verdict condemning them in advance. We would like to say here that this conference, in its 59th session, had called for a fair trial in a neutral venue. He said for the sake of showing justice, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah did not object to the suspects appearing in front of a just and honest court that had all the psychological and legal requirements in order to achieve the truth, and to do the victims and their families justice. He added: "You might agree with me that the style of the three countries [words indistinct] in tackling the case has caused us clear damage and injustice, and is not helping to solve the crisis in a satisfactory way." He said: "In this context we would like to point out that international legal experts have studied the idea of trying the suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice. [Word indistinct] and that the suspects' lawyer has agreed [word indistinct] to end the efforts to impose additional sanctions that will increase the suffering of the Libyan Arab people who have endured great losses as a result of the unjust sanctions of the UN Security Council Resolutions 748 and 883."
