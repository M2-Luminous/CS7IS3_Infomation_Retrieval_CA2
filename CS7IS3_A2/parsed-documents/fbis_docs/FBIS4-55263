Cvetkovska: "11 Enterprises Fully Privatized"] [Text] The privatization in the state has formally started. Although not yet officially, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has gotten its first 11 state enterprises transferred to private ownership. These are mainly small and medium-sized enterprises which started the ownership transformation under the old federal laws (the law on state capital and the law on personal incomes from the time of Prime Minister Ante Markovic). Here are the names of the enterprises: Solun, Gevgelija; the copyright agency Tutun, Skopje; the Agricultural Combinat, Skopje; Metal, Skopje; Makmarket, Skopje; Skolit, Skopje; Gradinar, Skopje; Economic Press, Skopje, as well as two more cooperatives, one from Kicevo and the other from Skopje (which, according to nonofficial information, have been liquidated in the meantime). These enterprises started privatization according to Ante Markovic's law, by buying up the enterprises through internal shares and making payments to the former Development Fund. As the manager of the financial sector of the Privatization Agency Evgeni Zografski explained, although the privatized enterprises have not yet received an official report on the accomplished privatization, the ownership is known and the owner defined. On the other hand, at the time they started the ownership transformation (in 1990) they applied the legal procedures of that time, which means that their accountancy was calculated (as the laws required then). They were denied the discount allotted by the law on state capital and on the other capital subject to privatization, the shares were issued and bought with money paid to the former Development Fund (the purchase sale contract was done between the enterprise and the Fund), and later on they were registered as private enterprises. Most of them were exposed to the control of the former Government Auditing Office in order to see whether the capital of the enterprise and the discount allotted to the buyers under the old laws were accurately calculated, and whether the taxes for the internal shares were paid in cash. According to the agency there are some enterprises that have really given cash money for the shares, but there are also others which have just made accounting transactions by purchasing the shares according to Article 4 of the law on salaries (of that time). If they do not do it in a defined term, they will not be entitled to that part of the privatized capital. However, as Zografski says, that is not going to happen, because there is just a small amount of money to be paid, and they will certainly do it. Namely, since they are truly private companies (which means that the present law on limitation of salaries is not valid) the income they realize can be transferred to payments for the shares, thus the owners will definitely buy up the company. As far as the values are concerned, the capital is calculated in the value of that time (the so-called accounting value of the company), valorized for the period that has passed after the issuing of the shares until the day the tax payments were made (today it is 290 times greater than it was in December 1990). According to the present Privatization Law that money must be paid in three months' time after the Government Auditing Office control. These companies are still waiting for the reports on their privatization also because of some other unsettled formalities, as is the public disclosure of the former owners, which will remain in the competence of the agency until the Denationalization Law is enacted. As we were informed by the Privatization Agency, the first 100 privatized companies will be known in June (those that have started privatization under the old federal laws), and they are on the list of the 1,468 companies which entered the first phase of privatization under the new Macedonian law on transformation. Besides these 11 enterprises, the mixed companies -- foreign Macedonian (from the former Yugoslav republics) will be the first in their turn, and they have until 28 June to decide about their transformation, like the contract organizations. There are some 50 to 100 companies of mixed capital -- foreign and domestic, which will be transformed immediately, because their owners are known. All they have to do is make previous agreements on transformation with the foreign owner and make their privatization legal. If they themselves do not do it before June, the Privatization Agency will have to do it, according to the law.
