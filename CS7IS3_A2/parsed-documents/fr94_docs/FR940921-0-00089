Section 86.098&hyph;10 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1)(i) introductory text, (a)(1)(i)(B)( 2 ), (a)(1)(ii) introductory text, (a)(1)(ii)(B)( 2 ), (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii), and by adding new paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(C)( 3 ), (a)(1)(ii)(C)( 3 ), (a)(1)(v) and (a)(1)(vi), to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;10 Emission standards for 1998 and later model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles. * * * * * (a)(1) *␣*␣* (i) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, and intended for use in all vehicles except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this paragraph. * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* ( 2 ) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas and utilizing aftertreatment technology: 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle. (C) *␣*␣* ( 3 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its liquified petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all of the NO X averaging, trading or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.094&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. (ii) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, and intended for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 pounds. * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* ( 2 ) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas and utilizing aftertreatment technology: 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle. (C) *␣*␣* ( 3 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its liquified petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all of the NO X averaging, trading or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.094&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. * * * * * (v) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines intended for use in all vehicles except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (A) Nonmethane hydrocarbons. 0.9 gram per brake horsepower-hour (0.33 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. (B) Carbon monoxide. ( 1 ) 14.4 grams per brake horsepower-hour (5.36 grams per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. ( 2 ) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment technology. 0.50 percent of exhaust flow at curb idle. (C) Oxides of nitrogen. ( 1 ) 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. ( 2 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all of the NO X averaging, trading or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.094&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. (vi) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle engines intended for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 pounds. (A) Nonmethane hydrocarbons. 1.7 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.63 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. (B) Carbon monoxide. ( 1 ) 37.1 grams per brake horsepower-hour (13.8 grams per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. ( 2 ) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment technology. 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle.
