The paper quoted head of the government administration Vladimir Kvsov as saying that the first to move to the building were the Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and all of his deputies. Chernomyrdin has taken over the office of former Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was arrested for organizing a violent confrontation with the government of President Boris Yeltsin in October last year. Kvasov added that the office of former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy, also arrested after the confrontation, was occupied by an ordinary government department. The third floor of the "White House" is ready for Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his staff, Kvasov said, explaining that this is necessary "for a closer contact of the president with the government." However, the main office of the president and his administration remain in the Kremlin, Kvasov noted. He said that the government staff will be reduced by 20 percent. "today it can be definitely stated that those departments will be abolished which are outdated in the present economic conditions," he pointed out without elaborating. The "White House" was initially built as the headquarters of the government of Russia when it was a Soviet republic. The building became the headquarters of Yeltsin during the "August 19" event in 1991. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian government moved to the premises of the former central committee of the Soviet Communist Party in Staraya Square in Moscow, while the parliament remained in the "White House." On October 4, 1993, Yeltsin ordered tanks to pound the "White House" to suppress the headquarters of the armed opposition headed by Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. Soon after the event Yeltsin ordered the government to move to the building and provided two other buildings for the new legislature elected on December 12. For the time being the newly-elected parliament is to work in the former COMECON (or the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance) buiding and in the house of the Russian press. However, a special building will be constructed for the new legislature, Kvasov said.
