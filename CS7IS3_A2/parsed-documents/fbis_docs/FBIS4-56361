The traditional joyful spirit of the Cuban people was present at the parade staged by thousands of workers, representing the many production sectors of Pinar del Rio. The younger generations were also present at this honorable function of the nation to reaffirm our revolutionary conviction. In an opening speech, Bernardo Oliva, secretary general of the Pinar del Rio chapter of the Cuban Workers Federation, said more than 40,000 people from Pinar del Rio were doing voluntary agricultural work. Pinar del Rio has recently shown a certain degree of improvement, as manufacturing increased by 26.2 percent and services grew by 35 percent in comparison with the first quarter of 1993. Local industry, in accordance with the current trend, has grown by more than 92 percent and the child mortality rate has been lowered to 8.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. The Pinar del Rio workers movement has donated more than 1 million pesos in aid for financing of territorial militias. This again demonstrates the Cuban workers' determination to defend their achievements with their own blood, if necessary. The weather on this beautiful, tropical day was kind to the men and women who marked International Labor Day on 30 April, so they can follow the sessions of the National Assembly of the People's Government on 1 May via the local radio and television stations. Workers from other parts of the world also marched in Pinar del Rio to celebrate their day with us today. One such group is the U.S.-based Venceremos Brigade, which is working on the tobacco harvest in protest of the embargo against our country. In conclusion, I would like to say the most significant thing here is the contagious, joyful spirit of the Pinar del Rio workers as they celebrate 1 May.
