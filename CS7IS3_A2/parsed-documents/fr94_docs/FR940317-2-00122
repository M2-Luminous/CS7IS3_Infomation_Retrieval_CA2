FR940317-2-00122 FR940317-2-00076 Another focus of this program could be to identify international students having leadership potential whose experience in this program could make a substantial contribution to mutual understanding and communication between the U.S. and their home countries in the future. In this regard, workshops to develop such leadership skills as public speaking and conflict resolution for future international leaders should be included in the program. Organizations must provide a program outline demonstrating their ability to enlist the participation of informed lecturers, keynote speakers, and/or recognized experts whose credentials and experience are evidence of in-depth knowledge of workshop topics. Guidelines Proposals should include a listing of names and titles, of the executive officer(s) of the organization and of the person(s) directly responsible for the project. Resumes or curriculum vitae of key personnel should be provided. Organizations should demonstrate the ability to recruit and maintain the necessary cadre of volunteers required to participate in program events. Proposed Budget Organizations must submit a comprehensive line-item budget for which specific details are available in the application packet. Budget will not exceed $35,000. Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E. Cost sharing and matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution.
