FR941013-1-00063 FR941013-1-00010 b. Municipal Solid Waste Combustion Units. Municipal solid waste combustion units would not be subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Congress directed the EPA to address air emissions from municipal solid waste combustion units under authority of CAA section 129, as amended by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 2. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act The EPA establishes rules for the management of solid wastes under authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under authority of subtitle C of RCRA, the EPA has established rules regulating the management of solid wastes determined to be hazardous waste (refer to 40 CFR Parts 260 through 271). Municipal solid wastes and other types of nonhazardous solid wastes are regulated by rules established under authority of subtitle D of RCRA (e.g., refer to 40 CFR Parts 257 and 258). a. Definition of Waste. For the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, the EPA is proposing definitions of ``waste'' and ``recoverable materials'' that are consistent with the definitions used by the EPA for other air rules promulgated under the CAA (selection of this definition is explained further in section IV.A of this notice). These definitions define the types of materials considered to be a ``waste'' or ``recoverable material'' in a broader context than the definition of ``solid waste'' that the EPA has historically used for RCRA rulemakings. The proposed definition of ``waste'' for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP includes all materials defined to be solid wastes under RCRA rules including hazardous wastes. In addition, materials excluded from the RCRA definition of solid waste such as recovered materials recycled back to a process unit and used oil reprocessed for sale as a fuel are included in the definition of ``recoverable material'' proposed for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. As a result, certain off-site waste and recovery operations exempted from RCRA rules may be subject to the requirements of the NESHAP rule proposed today. b. Duplicative Requirements. At many facilities where hazardous wastes are managed and wastes are received from off-site, both the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today and existing RCRA air rules under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 would likely be applicable to the facilities. At these facilities, some operations would be subject to either air emission standards under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP or the air emissions standards under the RCRA air rules. However, in certain situations, some operations would be subject to air emission standards under both sets of rules. The CAA requires that the requirements of rules developed under the Act be consistent, but avoid duplication, with requirements of rules developed under RCRA. Certain testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other requirements of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP also would be required under the RCRA air rules. The EPA believes that each of these requirements is necessary to assure compliance with and enforce the rules. However, it is unnecessary for owners and operators of those facilities subject to both the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and the RCRA air rules to conduct duplicative waste testing, keep duplicate sets of records, or perform other duplicative actions for the same waste or recoverable material operation. Thus, the EPA requests comment on how applicable requirements under the RCRA air rules should be incorporated into the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP to allow owners and operators to demonstrate compliance with both rules without having to repeat duplicative requirements. 3. Pollution Prevention Act The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq. , Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, November 5, 1990) establishes the national policy of the United States for pollution prevention. This act declares that: (1) pollution should be prevented or reduced whenever feasible; (2) pollution that cannot be prevented or reduced should be recycled or reused in an environmentally-safe manner wherever feasible; (3) pollution that cannot be recycled or reused should be treated; and (4) disposal or release into the atmosphere should be chosen only as a last resort. Opportunities for applying pollution prevention to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP are basically limited to pollution treatment prior to disposal or release into the atmosphere. By definition, the off-site waste and recovery operations source category consists of operations used to manage materials that have already been generated at other locations such as a manufacturing plant. Thus, there are no pollution prevention practices such as modifying the manufacturing process to reduce the quantity of materials containing organic HAP generated or to recycle the materials back to the process which can be implemented once the material arrives at an off-site waste and recovery operations facility. The EPA has incorporated the pollution prevention policy into the proposed rule by requiring wastes and recoverable materials containing organic HAP be treated to remove or destroy organic HAP prior to management in units open to the environment. Thus, to the extent possible, pollution prevention has been considered in the development of this rulemaking. Today's proposed NESHAP for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category is consistent with the pollution prevention policy.
