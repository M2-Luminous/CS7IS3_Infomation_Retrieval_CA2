The platform stresses that the RS is asking the international community -- before any peace talks take place -- to meet its obligations toward Serbs regarding the suspension, i.e., abolition of sanctions. The RS sees the Croat-Muslim Federation agreement and the agreement on a confederation with Croatia as the realization of the rights of these two nations to freely decide on their political and state status. At the same time, the Assembly maintains that the creation of a new federation and its entering into a confederation with Croatia means a formal and legal suspension of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. By not being included in the talks, the RS has in fact been recognized as a state entity. The RS cannot join the Croat-Muslim Federation because conditions do not exist for a joint state, the platform stresses. Since the new Croat-Muslim state can engage in hostile activities against the RS, the RS must -- in the interest of lasting peace and stability in the region -- secure just and defendable borders that will encompass Serb ethnic areas, the platform says, adding that when conditions for the continuation of talks are created the RS will maintain a stand that the negotiating process be conducted in stages. The first stage is to conclude peace and freeze all military activities without prejudging territorial solutions or the nature of future interstate ties. This would be followed by demarcation and the final establishment of borders between the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Srpska republic, and the recognition of the sovereignty and independence of the Srpska republic. Talks on mutual relations between these states, together with the review of possibilities for the establishment of different ties between the newly created and former Yugoslav republics, would be the last stage. The resolution of the crisis, it was said, should be guided by scientifically established facts about the Serbs, Croats, Muslims, and their territories, as well as by international documents on the creation of Yugoslavia. The platform also proposes an alternative order of stages, as recognized by the international community -- including the United States -- when Yugoslavia was founded in 1919 [sentence as received]. In the first stage, apart from the already recognized Croat- Muslim Federation, the international community should also recognize the Srpska republic and leave territorial questions for some later date. The second stage would be to resolve territorial issues peacefully, while the third would be to examine possible ties between the states.
