SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has proposed to require additional precautionary labeling relating to the flammability of total release fogger pesticides (59 FR 18058, April 15, 1994). EPA expects that the additional flammability label warnings will reduce the potential for fires and explosions by alerting consumers to the dangers of total release fogger and providing specific directions for proper use of these products with minimal cost to industry or consumers. The comment period on this proposed rule expired on June 14, 1994. Based on a request from S.C. Johnson Son, EPA is reopening the period for comment on this proposed rule for 90 days in order to receive as much input as possible. S.C. Johnson is conducting a market/consumer study to test the effectiveness of the proposed language in commmunicating to users the hazards associated with these kinds of products. This research will be conducted within the 90&hyph;day comment period and the results will be provided to the Agency for consideration.
