PETERSBURG (ETA). Estonia's money supply must be reduced, or it will cost Estonia dearly, said Finance Minister Heiki Kranich. Kranich told ETA on the last day of the annual meeting of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] that he is planning to discuss the matter of reducing Estonia's money supply with Bank of Estonia's president Siim Kallas. "Inflation should be pushed back," Kranich said. "Should the Bank of Estonia maintain that inflation is a normal phenomenon, Estonia may wind up paying dearly for it," Kranich emphasized. If the 1993 inflation indicators could be considered normal, then the rate of inflation during the first few months of 1994 has been too high, said government advisor Madis ŬÆurike. The principal cause for inflation, according to ŬÆurike, is increased money supply, which is partly the result of Estonia's successful export activity. EBRD president Jacques de Larosière had remarked, at his meeting with representatives of the Estonian delegation, that such a situation can be one of the drawbacks of great success, ŬÆurike told to a group of businessmen assembled for a presentation held in connection with EBRD's annual meeting. To reduce the money supply, securities should be issued so that people will have a chance to invest, Kranich said. To the question how reduction of the money supply would affect Estonia's population, both Kranich and ŬÆurike said that a rapid rate of inflation would have a devastating effect on the poorer segment of the population. Securities, however, would provide an investment opportunity for those who have money left over.
