This is not a scene from wartime. I chanced upon it quite recently in a corner of the harbor of Baltiysk, the Baltic Fleet's main base. As local officers explained to me, some bigwig here in Brezhnev's time got it into his head that ships that were written off could not be left afloat while waiting to be cut into sections and melted down. So old cruisers and destroyers were sunk in a secluded corner of the bay. But the years go by and no one is in any hurry to process them. How many more graveyards like this are there across Russia? I also recently visited an air defense unit stationed in a forest outside Moscow. In the unit itself everything gleams with cleanliness; armed with cloths, the soldiers polish and shine the missile launchers' various brass mechanisms. But the landscape around the unit looks as if it has been hit by a nuclear apocalypse. Carpenter should make his movies here. No props are needed. Tonnes of stomach-churning garbage are piled in sandpits. Its army origins are betrayed by the presence of oil, petroleum residue, old boots, gas masks, and broken, bent parts of military equipment. Complaints against the former Soviet Army for defiling nature have now grown to enormous proportions. Many millions of dollars in compensation for environmental damage are being demanded by the Baltic peoples, Hungarians, Poles, Czechs, and Germans. International conferences and seminars were even held recently in Berlin and Budapest to discuss measures to overcome the environmental damage done in Eastern Europe by the Soviet Army. Exhausted by endless economic and political crisis, Russia and the other CIS countries are keeping quiet at present. But a huge scandal is inevitable. In an attempt to forestall it, the Russian Defense Ministry has proposed that the Russian Federation Armed Forces set up an environmental service and eliminate any ``imperfections.'' It is clear even from the information doled out by Colonel General V. Toporov, Russian deputy defense minister and member of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety, that the crisis has come to a head. According to him, 9 million hectares of Russian land are polluted simply as a result of operating space rocket complexes (fuel components and metallic fragments of detachable rocket stages). Because of the complex environmental situation, the administrations of Altay Republic, Omsk Oblast, Tomsk Oblast, and Arkhangelsk Oblast have banned the launch of space vehicles and rockets until environmental certification of regions where detachable rocket stages have landed is complete. The serious radioactivity situation in the seas and on the territory of a number of garrisons (units) is the result of activity by the Navy and Defense Ministry test sites and institutions. Because of the poor technical state and low level of maintenance of fuel depots at military airfields built in the fifties and sixties (Engels, Mozdok, Yeysk, and other cities), soil and groundwater pollution occurs on a significant scale. In virtually every garrison, as much as 45 percent of sewage is untreated. According to Deputy Minister V. Toporov, fines imposed on military units for pollution of the environment in 1992 amounted to 43.5 million rubles [R] at today's prices. This year, however, one air garrison in the city of Engels alone has been fined more than R24 billion! Moreover, the recycling and destruction of nuclear, chemical, and conventional weapons are leading to even greater ecological pressures on the environment. And if you consider the sinking of nuclear-powered vessels' nuclear reactors and containers of radioactive materials, the dumping of toxic waste, and so forth!... The Defense Ministry feels that the main reasons for the serious environmental situation in the Army and the Navy are the lack among the troops of a developed system of environmental organs, forces, and material and financial resources. It cites the example of NATO armies, which try to protect nature. It is proposed to set up an environmental service in the Russian Federation Armed Forces. The Russian president has already prepared the relevant draft edict. The Finance Ministry is told to allocate considerable resources for this purpose. But there is one vital shortcoming in this good venture: The environmental service will be a subordinate body whose financing and promotion of officers will depend on the defense minister and lower-ranking military officials. Will this not lead to the covering up of accidents and to a situation where the extent of the damage caused by Army sites is ``glossed over?'' Perhaps the most acceptable option would be for the Russian Federation Armed Forces environmental service to become an independent, economically accountable body financed from the national budget and led not only by the Russian Defense Ministry, but also by the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and the Security Council under the president's personal control?
