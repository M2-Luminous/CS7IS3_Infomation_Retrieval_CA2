Let's hear from him: [Cico] Thank you Tefta. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. As announced by our colleague Radi, both presidents have just ended their news conference in the Palace of Congresses. Without waiting for the last news edition, we thought we would provide a summary of the news conference. At the beginning of the conference, both presidents made a short statement. First, President Sali Berisha took the floor. He stressed that Albanian-Maltese relations are very good and that both countries are determined to further develop the political, economic, and cultural cooperation in the future. President Berisha continued saying that we will cooperate in the field of tourism, petroleum, and agriculture. Regarding foreign policy, Berisha said that we explained to our Maltese friend the goals of our policy, which are: the integration of Albania into Europe; the solution of the national question; and the prevention of the conflict [in former Yugoslavia] from extending to the south of the Balkans. Berisha also attached special attention to the problem of Kosova, saying categorically that there is no Balkan solution without the resolution of the Kosova problem. In this aspect, we request assistance from Malta and the whole international community. A very important statement by President Berisha was the one I will now cite: The option of the division of Bosnia is absolutely hopeless in ending the war. The last massacre in Sarajevo best testifies to this viewpoint. Today, more than ever, it calls for the use of punitive blows against its Serbian authors, President Sali Berisha declared. On his part, Maltese President Mr. Tabone publicly showed gratitude for the invitation and the hospitality he found in our country. The Maltese president said that we are united by the same humanitarian aims as well as security issues. Mr. Tabone assessed that bilateral relations are very good and that they will be strengthened in the future, because this is a desire of both countries and our two politicians. Further, Mr. Tabone pointed out the fields of cooperation. At the end, according to the statements they made, both presidents were of the opinion that, beside the defined fields, other fields of cooperation exist, which will be studied by experts in the near future. Later they answered questions. Questions and answers were, of course, numerous. We have set apart some of them. A reporter asked Mr. Tabone about air strikes in Bosnia. Mr. Tabone replied that the question of air strikes in Bosnia is very complex and belongs both to NATO and the United Nations. That is why, he said, I cannot give you any kind of opinion regarding this problem. Another question addressed to Mr. Berisha was: What will the Geneva regional conference, in which our Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi will participate, bring about? Mr. Berisha said that this is a consultative conference and it will serve to sensitize all institutions, and particularly NATO, to undertake actions that have been trumpeted for a long time ago, such as selective air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia. Another question was addressed to Maltese Foreign Minister Guido De Marco. The question was this: You have been to Albania three times. Do you see any political and economic changes? He answered very categorically: Yes. I see great political and economic changes. This is the desire of the Albanian people, De Marco continued, who have reached these great progresses due to democracy. Another question, which seemed important to us, was that addressed to Mr. Berisha regarding the siting of two U.S. planes in Albania. Berisha gave this answer to the question: We have cooperated and continue to cooperate with NATO, the United Nations, and we have signed a memorandum of cooperation in the military field with the United States. Berisha said there is nothing new, because NATO ships that patrol for any violation of the embargo imposed against Serbia and Montenegro have sailed, and continue to sail, in Adriatic waters. Thus, the setting up of two planes was considered by Berisha as a remarkably normal thing in the framework of the cooperation between Albania and NATO, Albania and the United Nations, and Albania and the United States. This was a general view of the news conference that just ended at the Palace of Culture.
