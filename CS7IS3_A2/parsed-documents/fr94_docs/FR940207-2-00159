FR940207-2-00159 FR940207-2-00074 As discussed above, PCC's rules and procedures must be designed to ensure the safekeeping of securities and funds in PCC's possession or control or for which it is responsible. To achieve this aim, PCC designed certain of its rules, procedures, and operations in a manner that makes them consistent with those of other registered clearing agencies and adopted for its own use certain methods of operation and systems which previously have been approved by the Commission. For instance, PCC is instituting the use of a clearing fund similar to other clearing agencies and will use the same clearing fund formula that is used by NSCC, a formula which the Commission has acknowledged is consistent with a clearing agency's safekeeping responsibilities under the Act. 23 In addition, because PCC's rules and procedures are designed to be consistent with those of other market participants, PCC is fostering cooperation and coordination with others engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and is removing impediments to and helping perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions as required under Section 17A of the Act. 23 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32547 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36491 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;4] (order approving modifications to NSCC's clearing fund formula). As discussed above, PCC's revised rules and procedures present a more accurate reflection of PCC's current operations as a clearing agency. The Commission stresses that it is of the utmost importance that clearing agency rules and procedures be maintained so that they present an accurate reflection of the clearing agency's rights and responsibilities with regard to its participants. Such administrative maintenance helps to ensure that disputes that may arise between clearing agencies and their participants are fairly and quickly resolved. Precise written rules and procedures also eliminate uncertainty in the daily interactions between participants and among participants and the clearing agency. Should PCC decide to modify its clearance and settlement activities, PCC must file with the Commission a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act prior to implementation of any such changes. In addition, PCC, as a registered clearing agency, is required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a&hyph;22 to submit to the Commission all material it issues to its participants or to other entities with which it has a significant relationship. 24 24 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;22 (1993). III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A thereunder. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 25 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PCC&hyph;92&hyph;1) be, and hereby is, approved. 25 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 26 26 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
