A decision by U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina departs from the principle agreed on when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was set up that no troops of neighbouring countries, as well as of countries whose presence was not acceptable in these areas for historical reasons, would be deployed in the territory of former Yugoslavia, a statement issued from the Yugoslav Secretariat for Foreign Affairs a copy of which was given to TANJUG said. The Turkish Ottoman Empire ruled from the 14th until the end of the 19th century in the area which is now former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and then a Slav (predominantly the Serb Orthodox) people had undergone Islamization. Turks ruled much of the Balkans until the early years of this century. The issued statement warned that by its lack of objectivity and one-sidedness Turkey had a continual negative effect in the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that was why Turkish troops were unacceptable as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina on any grounds. Under the U.N. Charter, the U.N. Security Council and U.N. secretary-general were directly responsible for peace and international security and in case of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, they have to do everything possible to reach a lasting peace as soon as possible, and not to contribute to escalation of the conflict, the statement said.
