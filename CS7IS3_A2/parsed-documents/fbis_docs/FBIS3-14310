The signing of the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Accord between the PLO and the Zionist regime in September was the most important development in the Palestinian and Middle East crisis not only during the past year but during the five decades of Arab conflict with the Zionist regime. The signing of this accord encouraged Washington to reactivate its Middle East diplomacy and a meeting was held between the Syrian president and his U.S. counterpart in Geneva in a bid to reach other compromises in other areas of the Middle East crisis. But the failure to implement the PLO-Tel Aviv accord destroyed the grounds for other accords and placed a question mark over the implementation of this accord as well. Political analysts believe the most important reason for the failure of the 'Arafat-Zionist accord is that Israel's wishes alone have been fulfilled in this accord. Implementation of the major articles of the accord has been postponed, which means the PLO has granted Israel extensive privileges without reaping anything for itself. The implementation of one part of the accord, the withdrawal of the Israeli military forces from Gaza and Jericho, was foreseen a month ahead of the accord's signing but it did not take place at the set date. Still, Israel propounds various pretexts and is not ready to implement this part of the accord. The most important outcome of the Gaza-Jericho Accord is the legitimization of the usurping presence of the Zionist regime. After gaining this big concession, Tel Aviv started its extensive blackmail of the Palestinians and the Arabs and every country, demanding that the Arabs end their economic sanctions and establish diplomatic relations with it. It also called on the Western countries to extend more economic aid to it in view of this compromise. This accord, which was signed under pressure of the equation of the superiority of the Zionist regime and the United States, regionally and internationally, and quickly received international support, has faced numerous failures during the past few months because of the absence of the main elements that are needed for its continuation. Political analysts believe that the massacre of the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque has revealed the contradictory aspects of this accord. Its implementation is almost impossible without fundamental adjustments. 'Arafat's insistence on gathering up some Zionist settlements and disarming their residents, Israel's agreement to limit the activities of some extremist Zionist groups, and the dismantling of some Zionist settlements show that despite their varying views, the two signatories of the Gaza-Jericho Accord seek ways to save this accord from total failure. The continuation of the intifadah after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule pact is considered one of the major elements leading to the failure of the accord because, although some time after the signing of the Oslo Agreement, 'Arafat ordered his forces in the occupied territories to set aside their fight against the Zionist regime, the intifadah intensified. And although 'Arafat's forces were faithful to organizational commands at first, once they knew the details of the accord and saw the Zionist regime conitnuing its hostile attitude toward them, they joined the Muslim combatants. Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord strongly polarized the combatant forces in the occupied territories, contrary to the expectations of the Zionist enemy, the outcome benefited the intifadah and gathered together the combatant forces under the banner of Islam. Remarks by a U.S. official that reaction by Muslim Egyptian society to the tragedy at the Ibrahimi mosque may lead to the overthrow of the Cairo regime reveals that the struggle against the Zionist regime, which is declining among the ranks of the Arab governments, is rising among nations and that if the joint struggle of the Muslim nations and societies is organized, the current disgraceful equation in the Middle East will cease to exist.
