He pointed out that some Arab countries such as Iraq and Sudan are directly involved in the northern forces' war against our country. The brother prime minister said that the northern forces' war against our country is exactly similar to Iraq's invasion of the fraternal state of Kuwait in 1990. In both cases there are misplaced ideas claiming the annexation of a part to the motherland. The brother prime minister confirmed that the objective behind the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Yemen was to prevent the breakup of Yemen into numerous smaller states.
