The intensive shelling of Doboj in the past two months has left 20 civilians dead, five of them children, and more than 60 wounded. The shelling is a prelude to an all-out Moslem attack on that Serb town, which has been openly stated by the Moslem commanders, with the aim of cutting the vital corridor along the Sava river which links the western and eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic. The Bosnian Serb army on Tuesday repelled three heavy combined artillery-infantry attacks by the Moslems on Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia. The Moslem attack was backed by U.N. Leopard tanks, Bosnian Serb military sources say. On April 30 in the region of Moslem-held Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia, Nordic U.N. troops for the first time backed a Moslem ground attack on Serb positions which left nine Serb soldiers dead and five wounded. The Bosnian Serb army says that the Moslems have also been attacking Serb villages in the Mt. Ozren area. In the area of Teslic, Bosnian Serb troops have neutralized a Moslem commando team, it adds. The Moslems are launching a major offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic while their leaders are negotiating a general cessation of hostilities in Geneva.
