FR940725-0-00011 FR940725-0-00002 Currently, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series engines on the U.S. Register. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it will require approximately 60 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD is estimated to be $3,300 per airplane. Additionally, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G/H series engines on the U.S. Register at this time. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it will require approximately 30 hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD is estimated to be $1,650 per airplane. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.
