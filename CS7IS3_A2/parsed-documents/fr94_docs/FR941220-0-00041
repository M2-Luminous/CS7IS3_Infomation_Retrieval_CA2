FR941220-0-00041 FR941220-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Part 16 [CGD 94&hyph;106] RIN 2115&hyph;AE95 Programs for Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing of Commercial Vessel Personnel; Delay of Implementation Dates AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard announces a delay in the effective date of regulations governing drug testing, insofar as those regulations would require testing of persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government. Under this final rule, employees would become subject to testing no later than January 2, 1996, unless the Coast Guard, in the meantime, publishes regulations indicating otherwise. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on December 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referred to in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant Commander Mark Grossetti, Project Manager, Marine Investigation Division (G&hyph;MMI), Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection, (202) 267&hyph;1421. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR Mark Grossetti, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection, and Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Background and Purpose On November 21, 1988, the Coast Guard, along with other agencies of the Department of Transportation (DOT), adopted regulations requiring pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable cause, and random drug testing. Those individuals required under Federal law or regulation to have periodic medical examinations were also required to undergo a drug test at the same time. The drug testing required by the rule applies to some persons located outside of the United States. However, the rules provided that they would not apply outside the United States in any situation in which application of the rules violated foreign local laws or policies. At the same time, the Coast Guard stated that the DOT and other elements of the government would enter into discussions with foreign governments to attempt to resolve any conflict between our rules and foreign government laws or policies. The Coast Guard stated that if, as a result of those discussions, it was found that amendments to the rule were necessary, timely amendments would be issued. An amendment was issued on December 21, 1989, and published on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53286). Under that amendment, drug testing for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government was scheduled to begin by January 2, 1992. A Final Rule was published on April 24, 1991, delaying the implementation date to January 2, 1993 (56 FR 18982), and another Final Rule was published on July 14, 1992, delaying the implementation date to January 2, 1995 (57 FR 31274). During the past few years, discussions with other countries have been held, and the difficulty of achieving effective bilateral agreements has become clear. Although the Coast Guard could allow its regulations to take effect in foreign waters, the Coast Guard continues to recognize that: (1) It would be difficult for U.S. carriers to effectively implement the regulations without cooperation from foreign governments; (2) in response, foreign governments could impose restrictions on U.S. operations; and, perhaps most importantly, (3) there are distinct advantages to be gained in aligning foreign measures and U.S. measures, especially as they relate to international transportation operations. For these reasons, the Coast Guard is continuing to consider whether it would be appropriate to apply the requirements of part 16 to operations in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government in the event that agreements with other countries are not reached. In order to allow time to further consider these issues and formulate a decision, the Coast Guard has again determined that additional time is necessary. Another additional delay of approximately one year should provide sufficient time. Accordingly, the Coast Guard has determined to postpone again the date by which testing programs would commence for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government.
