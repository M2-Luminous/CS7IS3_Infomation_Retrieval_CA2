He said this act reflects the true face of Zionist terrorism. Shaykh Shams al-Din said: Israel committed this unjustified aggression at a time when Lebanon is regaining its stability and rebuilding its institutions. He stressed that the Israeli act represents a blatant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as all international norms and laws. This step, Shaykh Shams al-Din said, exposes Israel's false claims during the negotiations and its schemes against Lebanon and its independence. In his statement, Shaykh Shams al-Din said: We urge the United Nations, the Security Council, and the human rights organizations to act promptly to end such bestial attacks and insure the release of al-Haj al-Dirani.
