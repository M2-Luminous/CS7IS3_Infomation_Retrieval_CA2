The talks had a formal but also an informal part. Did you learn anything of interest for Slovakia? [Huska] We have obtained information that is impossible to obtain under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, we must self-critically acknowledge that Slovakia does not have enough politicians of a statesmanlike nature. This is a result of the fact that it was the object rather than the subject of its own history for too long. I would like to alert those who so enthusiastically welcome the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party and expect some "new" accommodating steps from it to the fact that, speaking in Heidelberg in mid-March 1994, Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn deliberately and unfavorably referred to Slovakia as "a country that belongs not to Central Europe but to the Balkans." Some left-wing politicians in Slovakia present Horn as a possibly more acceptable alternative for the improvement of Slovak-Hungarian relations. We must quickly get rid of this illusion. Any Hungarian politician, irrespective of his "faith" and political orientation, whether he be a conservative, a socialist, or a liberal, will promote in his practical policy the selfish, solely Hungarian geopolitical interests. I am drawing attention to this now so that, because of the proverbial Slovak propensity to make concessions, we do not let ourselves be hoodwinked by the honey-sweet statements of Hungarian politicians. It is naive to believe that a Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest "socialist axis" might be some kind of a rescue for the Slovak Republic. This is not a solution for the state or national interest of the Slovak Republic. Defending the territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic against external pressures must remain our primary interest. [passage omitted]
