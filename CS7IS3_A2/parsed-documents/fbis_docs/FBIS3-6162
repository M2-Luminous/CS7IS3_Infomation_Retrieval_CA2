Uthai said: "If France continues to use such unfair measures against us, we must plan to reciprocate as France exports mostly luxury goods to Thailand. If we do nothing, France will treat us like that again." The commerce minister disclosed that other countries suffering from the French action include Indonesia and the Philippines. France, by so doing, has claimed that these countries have no specific quality control agencies for their fish products. Meanwhile, the European Union has set the end of 1994 as the deadline for all its members including France to do away with such protectionist measures.
