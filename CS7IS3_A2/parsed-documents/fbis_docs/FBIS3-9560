Dr. Bukoshi, who started a three day visit to the United States, called on world authorities once more not to ignore the explosive situation in Kosova, but to undertake preventive measures before it will be late. "We demand an international presence in Kosova which will help prevent Serbian abuses, which may lead to a large conflict with destructive consequences for the peace in the region", Mr. Bukoshi said. He reiterated that sanctions towards Serbia should be conditioned with the correct resolution of the Kosova question. Mr. Bukoshi said that the peaceful policy of the Kosova leadership may loose its credibility among the Albanian people on both sides, and this peaceful approach may be considered by Belgrade as a challenge to the increasing repression. Mr. Bukoshi said that this stand of the Albanians may be considered by the international community as a reason to ignore the situation in Kosova. "Kosova fulfills all premises to be an independent state like other republics of former Yugoslavia. It is the richest region and with sufficient human potential. We are not demanding unification with Albania and this is the greatest compromise we are as a people. [sentence as received] We do not demand a violent change of the borders," Mr. Bukoshi said in a response to a question "Is Kosova able to be an independent state and will it demand a unification with Albania?"
