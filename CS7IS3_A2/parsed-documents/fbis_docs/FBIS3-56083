However, few such countries fail to take care of its storage in advance. Lithuania has been forced into a situation where no storage facilities for particularly radioactive fuel waste have been built at the Ignalina nuclear power plant over the 10 years of its operation. The space left in the special water reservoirs, where waste fuel cassettes have been stored for 10 years, is enough to last the plant for only a year. If no new storage facilities are built over this time, the first block will have to be shut down. It is not difficult to imagine what an energy crisis may hit the country receiving even 90 percent of its electric energy from the nuclear plant. However, this danger has been removed by the government adopting a decision on the storage of radioactive waste in special dry containers. Currently, the so-called intermediate "wet" (water) nuclear fuel storage is more common in the world. The government based its decision on the conclusions of Lithuanian nuclear energy specialists and the Swedish firm SKB. A contract with the German firm GNB is nearing completion today. SKB Director (Bo Gustafsonn) has actively participated in this work. We have asked him to detail how the issue of storage choice was settled. "Sweden concluded a contract with the Lithuanian Energy Ministry on this matter more than a year ago," said Bo Gustafsonn. "Two- thirds of the expenses were covered by Sweden, and the remaining part -- by Lithuania. In the beginning, six countries participated in the tender, but later there remained only three -- Germany, Canada, and the United States. Assessing their projects, we primarily considered their security, the fact whether the production of a firm has already been used and what the response is, and whether a firm will manage to manufacture the necessary amount of containers in short order. Certainly, we also thought about the price. The production of the German firm GNB met all of these requirements, except the last one." [Skatikaite] It is the price that encouraged the Canadians to raise objections to the commission's choice. Are their containers really $100 million cheaper? [Gustafsonn] This sum is concocted. (We have learned from other sources that the price of one GNB container is 600,000 German marks [DM]. The decision endorses the purchase of 60 containers for DM36 million. Thus, even the total sum is only around $20 million -- the author). The containers of the Canadian firm "Ontario Hydro" are really cheaper, however, they weigh an even 100 tonnes, and their transportation requires special vehicles. Their unloading and the purchase of shipment containers would require a special building. If we add all these expenses to the price of the Canadian containers, the latter will differ little from those of the German production. [Skatikaite] What countries have bought GNB containers? I am addressing this question to the German firm GNB representative (Dieter Schonfeld). [Schonfeld] Our firm has sold 500 containers to Canada, the United States, Sweden, France, the Czech Republic, and South Africa. Currently, we have a contract for another 100 containers. Our firm has engaged in this business since 1978. We perform the design work, while containers are manufactured at different enterprises. [Skatikaite] Currently, there are 800 tonnes of HM [expansion unknown] stored at the Ignalina nuclear power plant, while Russia has 3,900 tonnes, that is, 1,000 tonnes less than in special storage facilities. Does Russia plan to begin production of its own "dry" containers? [Negrivoda] A plant in Izhora is planning to start such production. According to primary estimates, one container would cost DM210. Even if the price climbs to DM300, it would be twice cheaper than the GNB containers. If the Izhora plant speeds up the realization of its project, we will have a broader choice. As long as the Ignalina nuclear plant operates, we will need 40 containers annually in the future. Radioactive fuel waste is stored in dry containers for 40 years. Lithuania must decide over this period of time what is to be done with such waste -- to bury it for good or to recycle. Whatever the decision, this will be a costly process. Thus, those 40 years is a time not only for contemplation but also for the accumulation of finances.
