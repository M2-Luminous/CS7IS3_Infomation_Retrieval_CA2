According to the bill, the sentences range between 12 and 20 years of imprisonment and there is no room for procedural benefits. In the Andean Jurists Commission's (CAJ) opinion, this openly contradicts the so-called "Fujimori thesis" that was included in the 1991 penal code and no longer classifies cultivation as a drug trafficking crime. The executive branch's bill intends to radically eradicate this fairly new crop. The CAJ claims that if peasants raise this crop, it will be because its price is competitive and not because of fraudulent intention. The CAJ also claims that the punishment will not be a deterrent as long as poverty in the area prevails. The CAJ claims that the punishment might, rather, contribute to increasing prices and cases of corruption and abuse by producers, and an overwhelming growth in the prison population.
