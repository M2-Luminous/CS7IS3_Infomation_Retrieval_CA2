Addressing a number of fighters, who participated in the liberation of al-Faw City six years ago, his excellency revealed that the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France summoned Iraq's representative at the United Nations on the day in which the incident involving the two planes took places and informed him that their countries would patrol the Zakho-Fa'idah highway without revealing the purpose of this. The president noted that a memorandum from the Foreign Ministry following the meeting between Iraq's representative and the three ambassadors indicated that the language of the ambassadors was hopeful and reassuring and that the objective of their countries' deployment of the patrol was not provocative and that they have no intention of waging a confrontation with Iraq. His Excellency President Saddam Husayn emphasized that the meeting among the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France and the ambassador of Iraq at the United Nations took place following instructions from their governments. He said the meeting was designed to serve an evil action whose nature he hoped will be become clear later. He said the meeting must have had a connection with those who were aboard the two downed helicopters. His excellency pointed to the questions that were raised by many political observers about the mission of the helicopters, the identity and specialty of those who were on board, and what they may have had been carrying. His excellency the president called the downing of the American helicopters by American fighters a scandal that has exposed a moral, spiritual, practical, and humanitarian weakness in the nations of the alliance led by Washington. His excellency the president drew attention to the objectives of the enemy circles and the intentions they had in common with the media and propaganda organizations they control and manipulate so as to promote their interests and objectives. He said the premeditated goal of the operation became apparent as soon as the incident occurred, when certain suspect radio stations put out press statements claiming that Iraqi aircraft had downed two American helicopters. His excellency said it was likely that if it were not for the fact that there were other casualties besides the Americans and the fear that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, the media would have stuck to the allegations and used them as grounds to level charges against Iraq as they have done in the past and continue to do now. President Saddam Husayn recalled the chapters of Iraqi confrontation against Iran's hostile scheme and the pictures of Iraq's victory over these evil objectives. He said that the liberation of al-Faw was the first step on the road to victory. He said that the enemies were very concerned with entrenching a fact that is alien to Arab heritage, but which they have become known for by others recently -- namely, the land that is taken from Arabs will not return to them and that Arab armies cannot launch counterattacks to liberate their lands. The president concentrated on the role of the Zionist quarters in spreading despair among the Arabs. He said that Zionism is working in this direction in all its activities and moves, and with all its branches and potential. The president stressed that the liberation of al-Faw foiled all these false theories. He said: For the first time in contemporary Arab history an Arab country liberated its land without any political bargains or compromises. This was achieved in the liberation of al-Faw. President Saddam Husayn added: Al-Faw was the beginning, where wills clashed. A city was liberated without any political intervention or foreign factors. Victories were then achieved when every inch on which the aggressors encroached was liberated. His excellency shed light on the military lesson crystallized by Iraqi determination on the ground of confrontation against the Iranian enemy to liberate al-Faw and every inch of Iraq's territory. He said: No army, in a long war, can claim that its enemy will not achieve any victories on the front because the enemy can become stronger and superior and can benefit from other factors that will take this army by surprise. In light of this lesson, His Excellency President Saddam Husayn urged the commanders not to belittle any field action, combat front, or move no matter how small. He underscored that it is these small moves and steps that add up to the final result. His excellency the president cautioned, however, that the forest should not be overlooked for the trees, and that small factors should not distract the commander from the determination that the final strategy and results must be to his advantage. He reaffirmed the importance of handling small moves on the front on the basis of this overall strategy. His excellency the president expressed his confidence that the practical implementation of this concept is possible not only in the military field, but that it is also possible to translate this concept into practice in the areas of politics, economics, social life, and security matters. His Excellency President Saddam Husayn expressed his faith and conviction that the leadership in Iraq is capable of effecting changes in the overall situation if the pressure increases and the situation becomes vulnerable. If such a thing were to happen, the Iraqi leadership, the president added, would also be capable of introducing new factors into the picture, factors that could absorb any additional elements that might be brought into play by the enemy. His excellency the president expressed his full confidence in the future of the confrontation between Iraq and the U.S.-led alliance, saying that the enemies' anti-Iraq posture can be likened to a man seizing the sword by its blade. When the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the adversary will find himself compelled to either release his grip around the sword or risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have to release the sword.
