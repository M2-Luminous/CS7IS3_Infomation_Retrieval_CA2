FBIS4-30236 "dreas122_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 South Korea Draft Agreement on Summit Time, Place Viewed Draft Agreement on Summit Time, Place Viewed SK2406083794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0741 GMT 24 Jun 94 SK2406083794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul plans to offer a draft agreement to Pyongyang at the summit preparatory contact on June 28, a strategy aimed at minimizing the number of necessary contacts before the inter-Korean summit actually takes place, according to officials here. The draft, tentatively named "the agreement on opening a South-North Korea top leaders' meeting," must be tabled at the first preparatory contact on June 28 so that the two sides can get right down to setting the time and place for the summit and then sign the agreement at the next contact, the officials say. The government is said to have already completed the draft, which is most likely to establish the number of delegates, accompanying assistants and the size of the press corps. They would have to cover protocol for both sides, the itinerary, the actual site and facilities for the summit meeting, a guarantee of the personal safety of all visitors, and arrangements for their trips. The officials say they will not demand that every little detail be written down on all of the above procedures in the draft agreement so that the date of the summit can be arranged as soon as possible. Instead, they envision separate working-level contacts on these details after the overall agreement is signed. At least one week of careful planning is thought to be required before the summit date. This gives Seoul approximately two weeks of minimum required time, one week to work on and sign the agreement on the summit and another week to settle on the details. Seoul then could propose the summit date around July 10 or by mid-July at the latest. As to where the top leaders will meet, the officials said they will go ahead and propose the South Korean capital of Seoul. But as long as North Korea agrees to hold the summit as soon as possible, the South is willing to meet in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, according to officials. "We will ask for Seoul, but if that doesn't work out, then Pyongyang is a possibility," said one official. "There has been talk of a third place, like the case of Germany, but we have to take into consideration that there are not many facilities suitable for a summit meeting in North Korea other than Pyongyang," he said. But there is one case in which Seoul will not compromise on -- if North Korea insists on meeting Aug. 15, the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule and also a date that North Korea commonly uses for its political propaganda. In that case, officials said they will demand Seoul as the meeting site. If Pyongyang refuses, then they will think about the neutral zone -- the truce village of Panmunjom -- or a third place in South Korea. Considering all these factors, South and North Korea will both probably have to make concessions, one side on the place and the other side on the time. As stated before, Seoul officials plan to make agenda-setting as general as possible to lessen the chances of bickering over agenda topics. The proposed agenda will be very comprehensive, according to the officials, covering immediate issues confronting South and North Korea and other matters proposed by the top leaders, or ways of removing political and military confrontation including the nuclear problem and implementation of wide-ranging exchanges and cooperation. On arrangements for bodyguards, entourages and the press, Seoul intends to include these terms in the overall agreement if North Korea does not object but is willing to leave it to working-level contacts.
