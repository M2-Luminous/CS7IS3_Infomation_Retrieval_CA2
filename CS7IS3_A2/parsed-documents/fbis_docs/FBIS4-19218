"Like I said yesterday" Speroni told the press this morning, "I am not taking part in today's meeting because there are people there I don't want to having anything to do with, at least until they change their style." "In order not to create any obstacles on the path towards federalism" he announced, "I withdraw my candidacy. This because of the untrustworthiness of the alleged majority, which is unable to guarantee its unity in a secret ballot." The speakers for the new parliament, Speroni predicted, will be Carlo Scognamiglio for the Senate and Irene Pivetti for the House. Speroni then went on to confirm his, as he put it, "complete disgust for the party-politics with which some, but not from the League, carried out the negotiations... I will ask my party leadership not to be given tasks which imply having to have political contact with those behind this sleazy run-around." For Senator Marcello Staglieno, however, Speroni remained the Northern League candidate for Senate Speaker and it was "logical" that the Northern League get the speaker's chair in the Senate and Forza Italia the House speakership. Senator Staglieno also said he was against Roberto Maroni, of the Northern League, becoming House Speaker, preferring that he be deputy premier and Interior Minister. This, he said, would be a real break with the past since the interior ministry has been held by Christian Democrats for the past fifty years. Speroni's withdrawal from the Senate speaker race was, according to Fini, a demonstration of the Northern League's readiness to come to a government agreement not only in word but also fact. Fini went on to define Carlo Scognamiglio, the candidate of Forza Italia for the Senate chair, as "authoritative" yet recalled how there were others adding, however, that the decision will be known today.
