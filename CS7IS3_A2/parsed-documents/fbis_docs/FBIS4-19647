Jakobs; place and date not given] [Text] [Jakobs] Herr Teichmann, according to your professional colleague Ruediger Pohl of the Haller Institute for Economic Research, the supplementary tax being demanded by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] will have a "harmful effect on the economy." A tax such as this would drive investors out of Germany--is this a serious assessment or is it scaremongering? [Teichmann] Whether or not this is scaremongering, I cannot judge. I do not believe that the will to achieve would be decisively weakened by a supplementary tax of 10 percent, which, because of the tax increase being planned by the government for those in the higher income brackets, would actually lead to an increased tax burden of only 2.5 percent. This same weakening would also have to result from the 7.5 percent solidarity contribution that has been decided upon by the government. [Jakobs] You do not fear an economically counterproductive overtaxing of the so-called achievement sustainers? [Teichmann] One must consider that a three-tiered (1986/88/90) major tax reform has taken place. It was especially those in the medium and upper income brackets who profited from this tax reduction program. For a single person with a yearly income of 50,000 German marks [DM], the maximum tax rate went down by 16 percentage points as a result. With the surcharge being discussed now, persons in this income group would lose only a small portion of what they gained through the tax reductions of the past. Compared to the plans of the government, the SPD proposal would equate in this income group to an increased burden of DM27 per month. Circa 85 percent of those paying taxes would pay no surcharge at all in the event the SPD plans were implemented. [Jakobs] The government wants to place the tax burden on all, the SPD only on those with gross incomes of more than DM60,000 or DM120,000 [single or married taxpayers]. Which of these would be more appropriate for the promotion of the economy? [Teichmann] The SPD plans would be better suited to strengthen the economic situation, since the consumption-intensive lower incomes would not be burdened, in contrast to the proposal of the government. In the upper income bracket, on the other hand, the savings quota would be higher. [Jakobs] Former Munich Lord Mayor Georg Kronawitter (SPD) has made a plea for placing a greater tax burden on the enormous "unearned capital gains" being realized by owners of real estate. Would that be a practicable course to take, and how much revenue would it generate? [Teichmann] In view of the public financial need, I view the greater taxation of such assets as appropriate and just. Especially if one takes into consideration the fact that the standard values serving as the basis for taxation have been set far too low. A doubling of the standard values, for example, would lead to two-digit billion [DM] increases in wealth and property tax payments.
