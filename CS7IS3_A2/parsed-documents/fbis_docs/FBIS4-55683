FBIS4-55683 "dreeu097_i_94011" FBIS-EEU-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbs: UN Forces Supporting Muslim Attacks Serbs: UN Forces Supporting Muslim Attacks LD1805225294 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2241 GMT 18 May 94 LD1805225294 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Doboj, May 18 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces were on Wednesday [18 May] attacking Bosnian Serb positions on the fronts in northeastern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb army command in Doboj reported the most violent attacks as being on the Teslic front in the northeast, where Moslems launched two abortive infantry attacks. Doboj's residential areas came under artillery fire, which fortunately claimed no casualties. Moslem troop movements were reported south of Doboj, on the Ozren front and along the Banovici-Olovo line. The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is increasingly blatantly supporting the Moslems, the statement said. During Moslem attacks on Tuesday night, UNPROFOR armoured cars would light the Serb positions in the Bradinja area, which would then be subjected to strong small-arms fire, the statement said. The Moslem offensive on Mt Majevica in the vicinity of the U.N.-designated Moslem 'safe area' of Tuzla shows no sign of abating, with civilian facilities becoming the favourite targets, the local Bosnian Serb army command said. On Wednesday, the eighth day of the Moslem offensive on Mt Majevica, the Moslems fired more than 200 shells on the Stolice television relay and intensified artillery and infantry assaults on other points in the area. Bosnian Serb positions were not moved, however, nor were there casualties among the Serb troops. The statement further said that the Moslem offensive was receiving wholehearted support also from NATO, whose planes buzzed the area on low-flying reconnaissance missions, breaking the sound barrier. The area of Bijeljina in the east, 20 km from the border with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), was on air-raid alert until around 8 P.M. In central Bosnia, two Moslem units attempted attacks on the Serb positions 15 km from Kupres in the morning, but sustained heavy casualties and retired in disorder in the direction of Bugojno in the southwest. The local Serb army had no losses in life or limb, army sources said.
