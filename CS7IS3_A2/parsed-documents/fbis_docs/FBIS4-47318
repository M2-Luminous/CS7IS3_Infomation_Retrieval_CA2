The local soil is pregranulated and dried in reactors equipped with electric arc plasmotrons. Optimal granule size must be determined, as well as the thermal processing parameters. High-temperature processing of granules in gas streams generated by electric arc plasmotrons involves complex radiative and convective heat exchange. This paper attempts to consider radiative and convective heat exchange in the heating of spherical soil particles in a stream of low-temperature plasma. The temperature distribution over the radius of the spherical particle is determined from the beginning of thermal processing. The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the soil was determined experimentally in the 20-1200ï¿½C range and can be tracked for a specific initial temperature of the sphere and gas medium temperature. It was found that for a wide range of radii the movement of the thermal pulse from the surface to the center of the particles occurs at an approximately uniform speed. Radiative heat exchange plays a significant role in radiative-convective heating of the particles. Other aspects of thermal processing are examined. Further research is needed to determine optimal parameters. Figures 2; references 6: 5 Russian, 1 Western.
