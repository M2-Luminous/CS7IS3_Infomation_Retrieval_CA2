Vyazovkina, I.V. Engels* and A.V. Lebedev, Novosibirsk Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences; *Institute of Organic Chemistry, J.W. Goethe University, Frankfurt-am-Main; UDC577.113.6.088.53:543.422.25] [Abstract] Two-dimensional NMR ROESY spectroscopy was employed in assessing the configuration about the P atom of 16 pairs of deoxydinucleoside methyl phosphonates with the general formula [MeO)[.sub]2[/]Tr]Np-(CH[.sub]3[/])N'(Ac) and the unnatural -O-P(CH[.sub]3[/])(O)-O- internucleoside bond. In the formula, N- and N' indicate the base protected dinucleosides. Cross-relaxation data on interaction of P-CH[.sub]3[/] protons with the 3'-end nucleoside revealed differences only in the case of H(3')- and H(4')-protons of pyrimidine nucleosides. These interactions were more pronounced in the case of the S[.sub]p[/] isomers. Accordingly, the spectral variations between the diasteroisomers were due to conformational differences predicated on the nature of the heterocyclic bases in the dimers.
