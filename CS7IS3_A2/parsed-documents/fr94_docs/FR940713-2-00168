Instructions for Part IV_Program Narrative The program narrative will comprise the largest portion of your application. This part is where you spell out the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your proposed project. Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the selection criteria. Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative should follow the order and format of the criteria. Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition. Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order. The Secretary strongly requests you limit the program narrative to no more than 30 double-spaced, typed pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider your application if it is longer. Be sure to number consecutively ALL pages in your application. You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this program competition. You are advised that: (a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking applications for funding consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package are not considered in the review by the technical review panels. (EDGAR Sec. 75.217) (b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain commitments which pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.
