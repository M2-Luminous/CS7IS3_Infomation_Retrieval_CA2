FR941202-0-00108 FR941202-0-00011 EPA disagrees with the commenters' contention that it is inappropriate for EPA to require Oregon to implement section 112(g) until after EPA has promulgated implementing regulations. The statutory language in section 112(g)(2) prohibits the modification, construction, or reconstruction of a source after the effective date of a title V program unless maximum achievable control technology (MACT) (determined on a case-by-case basis, if necessary) is met. The unambiguous meaning of this provision is that the prohibition takes effect in a State on the effective date of title V in that State regardless of whether EPA or the State has promulgated implementing regulations. Furthermore, implementation of section 112(g) by a permitting authority is a requirement for receiving approval of its title V program (See 56 FR 21722 (May 10, 1991) and the April 13, 1993 memorandum entitled, ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for Section 112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards). EPA's approval of Oregon's title V program is based upon Oregon's commitment to implement section 112(g) upon the effective date of its title V program. EPA has acknowledged that States may encounter difficulties implementing section 112(g) prior to promulgation of final EPA regulations ( See June 28, 1994 memorandum entitled, ``Guidance for Initial Implementation of Section 112(g),'' signed by John Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards). EPA has issued guidance, in the form of the proposed regulations implementing Section 112(g), which may be used to determine whether a physical or operational change at a source is not a modification either because it is below de minimis levels or because it has been offset by a decrease of more hazardous emissions. See 59 FR 15004 (April 1, 1994). EPA believes the proposed rule provides sufficient guidance to Oregon and sources until such time as EPA's section 112(g) rulemaking is finalized. EPA is aware that Oregon does not have a program designed specifically to implement section 112(g); however, Oregon does have several preconstruction review programs that can serve as procedural vehicles for rendering Federally enforceable case-by-case MACT or offset determinations. Oregon's preconstruction review programs may be used during the transition period between title V approval in Oregon and EPA approval of Oregon regulations to implement Section 112(g) to grant relief from the prohibition imposed by section 112(g). EPA believes Oregon's preconstruction review programs will be adequate in most, if not all, cases because they will allow Oregon to select control measures that would meet MACT, as defined in section 112, and incorporate these measures into a Federally-enforceable preconstruction permit. Although it is true that the preconstruction review programs in the EPA-approved Oregon state implementation plan (SIP) apply only to criteria pollutants, Oregon should be able to impose Federally-enforceable measures reflecting MACT for most, if not all, changes qualifying as a modification, construction, or reconstruction under section 112(g). EPA believes this to be the case because most section 112(b) hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are also criteria pollutants, and moreover because measures designed to limit criteria pollutant emissions will often have the incidental effect of limiting non-criteria pollutant HAPs. In those instances where a section 112(g) modification, construction, or reconstruction is entirely outside of Oregon's SIP preconstruction review programs, for example, where the change results only in non-criteria pollutant HAP emissions, sources may be able to utilize either one of two new provisions of Oregon's rules which have been submitted to EPA for approval under section 112(l) of the Act. Upon EPA approval of these rules, sources would be able to utilize Oregon's provision for voluntary HAP plant-site emission limits (see OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;1050(2)(b)) or permits to construct or modify major sources of HAPs ( see OAR 340&hyph;32&hyph;500 and 4500) to make case-by-case MACT or offset determinations Federally enforceable.
