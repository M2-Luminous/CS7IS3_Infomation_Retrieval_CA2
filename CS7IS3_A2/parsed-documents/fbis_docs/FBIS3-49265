The Poznan weekly writes that GUC's former president, Mariusz Jakubowski, was replaced by "the politician and entrepreneur" Ireneusz Sekula, who is an advocate of lowering customs duties in order to make smuggling less attractive and thus increase customs revenues. WPROST also reports that the 50-year-old Sekula completed his studies for a master's degree in psychology in 1965 at the University of Warsaw, where he later earned a doctorate in political science. Following a stint with the Polish Scout Union (ZHP), he began his professional career in state administration, working for the Ministry of Industrial Machinery and the Ministry of Labor, Wages, and Social Service Affairs. From 1983 to 1988, he was president of the Social Security Agency (ZUS). Sekula was minister of labor and social policies in Zbigniew Messner's government (mid-198O's) and served as deputy premier in Mieczyslaw Rakowski's government (the last communist government, which preceded the Mazowiecki government of 1989). From 1966 to 1990, Sekula was a member of the ruling communist party, the Polish United Workers Party, and currently belongs to Social Democracy of the Polish Republic (SdRP), where he serves on the Executive Council. Sekula has been a deputy in the last three Sejms: the last Sejm that included communists, elected in 1989, and the Sejms elected in 1991 and 1993--in the latter two representing the Democratic Left Alliance, of which the SdRP is a leading partner.
