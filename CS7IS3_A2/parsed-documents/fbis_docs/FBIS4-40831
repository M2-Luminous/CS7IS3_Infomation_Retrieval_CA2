This was reported to INTERFAX on Monday by the command of the Russian military transport aviation. Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes are to carry the battalions formed on the basis of two peace-making divisions stationed in Leningrad and Volga military districts. At the Defence Ministry INTERFAX was told that two more battalions from the Russian contingent in the Caucasus are expected to enter the zone on their own vehicles. Deputy Defence Minister Grigoriy Kondratyev denied reports about the possible participation in the operation to separate conflicting sides formations of the 345th Air-Borne Regiment stationed in Gudauta. He said the regiment would be used only for guarding the joint staff of the peacekeeping force in Sukhumi. At the end of last week engineering units were transferred to Abkhazia, in particular sappers and a signal office. This required 15 flights of Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes. Officials at the ministry stressed that this is only a preparatory stage of the peacekeeping operation: the area is being clear of mines and communications established between the staffs of the peacekeepers, Georgians and Abkhazians and the UN mission in Georgia. The operation to separate conflicting sides can begin only after the Russian Council of the Federation passes an appropriate resolution. The upper house of the Russian parliament is to discuss the matter on Tuesday.
