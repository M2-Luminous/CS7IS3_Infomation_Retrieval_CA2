It's an internal affair of Ukraine. It's essential not to give the radical-minded politicians in Kiev a pretext for playing "the Crimean card" for the purpose of aggravating the confrontation in relations with Moscow, a senior Russian diplomat dealing with Ukrainian problems told Interfax. In comments on President Leonid Kravchuk's decision to cancel the Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov's decree to carry out a referendum on relations with Kiev, the Russian diplomat said: "So far the Ukrainian leadership has no weighty legal arguments. After all no one can forbid the Crimean president to hold consultations with the populace. As a matter of fact, this does not signify the Crimea's secession from Ukraine. A referendum may have no direct legal force." According to Interfax's interviewee, it's necessary to take into account the circumstance that Leonid Kravchuk's statements as to Simferopol's responsibility "for the possible complications" in its relationship with Kiev may play "a destabilizing role."
