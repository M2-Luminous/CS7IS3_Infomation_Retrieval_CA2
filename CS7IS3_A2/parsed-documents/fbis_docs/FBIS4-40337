In line with a decision by the republic's government that was promulgated today, import duties of 200-400 percent are being brought into effect on imports of alcohol, tobacco products, furniture, carpets, motor vehicles, and domestic television and radio equipment. According to competent bodies, the duties will also affect goods brought in across the border by tourists for personal use, even if this is just a single item. Although these measures are of a temporary nature, if the decision is to be believed, local businessmen make no secret of their concerns. Experience shows that there was nothing more permanent in the former Soviet Union than temporary decisions.
