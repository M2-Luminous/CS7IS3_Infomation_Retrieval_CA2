"I had hoped he would come on time," by the end of May, al-Hariri told AFP. "I am not happy by the delay and I hope he will set a date as soon as possible for his visit to Lebanon," al-Hariri said. The pontiff's visit to Lebanon would be "a very good thing for the Lebanese and the Christians in particular," al-Hariri added. The papal nuncio in Lebanon Monsignor Pablo Puente told a news conference earlier Monday that the pope had decided to postpone a long-promised visit to Lebanon, which has been hit by recent bombings. Puente did not say when the visit would take place. A source close to the government said the visit was delayed because of a lack of progress in Arab-Israeli peace talks, a senior source close to the Lebanese government said on Monday. The source, declining to be named told AFP that the pope, whose visit would have been the first by a pontiff to a Middle East country since 1964, hoped his Lebanon tour would "crown positive achievements in the peace process." Faruq Abu-al-Lam', a former ambassador to France and supporter of renegade Christian General Michel 'Awn, said the postponement "clearly marked a disavowal of the (Lebanese) regime." "He is not coming because of security reasons. They should stop telling us stories about the government's positive achievements to date," Abu-al-lam' told AFP. The secretary general of the right-wing Christian Phalange Party Karim Paqraduni told AFP the pope's decision to postpone his visit to Lebanon was "regretable." "It's a big disappointment for all Lebanese and a blow to Lebanon's image abroad."
