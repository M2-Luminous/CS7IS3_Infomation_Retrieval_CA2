FR940128-2-00007 FR940128-2-00004 Respondent's argument that the Department used the further manufacturing cost totals on the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales tape at the preliminary determination is unavailing. At the preliminary determination, the Department used the further manufacturing totals from the C&hyph;1 sales tape only because respondent did not provide a means to link the C&hyph;1 and E&hyph;2 tapes in time for the preliminary determination. Since there was no way to link these tapes (until after the preliminary determination, when we received new tapes in response to the Department's request), and since the total product further manufacturing costs were the same on both the E&hyph;2 and C&hyph;1 databases, we simply used the total cost figures on the C&hyph;1 database. This was not the case at the final determination, where a way to link these tapes was available and where we had to adjust certain cost elements on the E&hyph;2 database. On January 10, 1994, petitioners alleged that the Department made three clerical errors in the final determination. First, petitioners alleged that the Department miscalculated the test which ensures that selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are not less than ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM). Specifically, petitioners stated that the Department's instructions require COM to be multiplied by one percent and not ten percent. We agree that this error is a clerical error. In attempting to make sure that SG&A expenses were not less than ten percent of the COM, we mistakenly multiplied the COM by one percent instead of ten percent. Therefore, we corrected this error by multiplying the COM by ten percent. Secondly, petitioners alleged that the Department failed to include United States commissions in the value-added tax (VAT) readjustment calculation, pursuant to which we made a deduction from foreign market value for purchase price comparisons. After a review of petitioners' allegation and the Department's new VAT calculation methodology, we have determined that this was a clerical error. Therefore, we have included commissions in the VAT readjustment calculation. Finally, petitioners alleged that the Department double counted home market indirect selling expenses when deducting this expense from foreign market value during comparisons of constructed value to exporter's sales price. The Department agrees that the double deduction of indirect selling expenses from foreign market value during comparisons of constructed value to exporter's sales price was a clerical error. To correct this error, the Department eliminated the separate variable for indirect selling expenses from the foreign unit price string. For further discussion of these clerical errors, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated January 25, 1994.
