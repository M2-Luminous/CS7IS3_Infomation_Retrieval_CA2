ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes to amend the Federal Acqusition Regulation (FAR) cost principles concerning lobbying costs. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 15, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;6 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contract the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;6. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This FAR case was opened to address issues raised by the OMB SWAT Team concerning the requirement to maintain records which are in addition to normal records maintained to record lobbying costs under FAR 31.205&hyph;22(f). The proposed FAR rule would delete 31.205&hyph;22(f) because it conflicts with the recordkeeping requirements in 31.201&hyph;6(c), 31.205&hyph;22(e), and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) 405, Accounting for Unallowable Costs (48 CFR 9904.405&hyph;50(a)). In addition, the Councils believe that 31.205&hyph;22(f) is inconsistent with the clause at 52.203&hyph;12, Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, which requires contractors to disclose lobbying activities. The reporting of such activities must necessarily be based upon certain contractor records which support the disclosures. The proposed rule also removes the prohibition against reimbursing executive lobbying costs at 31.205&hyph;50 and adds it to the list of specifically unallowable lobbying costs at 31.205&hyph;22(a). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. The cost principles apply only to contracts for which cost or pricing data has been submitted. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 93&hyph;6), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 31 Government procurement. Dated: September 13, 1994. Albert A.Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 31 be amended as set forth below: PART 31_CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 31 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. Section 31.205&hyph;22 is amended by revising the section heading; at the end of paragraph (a)(4) by removing the word ``or''; at the end of paragraph (a)(5) by removing the period and inserting ``; or''; by adding paragraph (a)(6); and by removing paragraph (f) and redesignating paragraph (g) as (f) to read as follows: 31.205&hyph;22 Lobbying and political activity costs.
