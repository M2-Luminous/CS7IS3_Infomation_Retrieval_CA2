Reservations were expressed only regarding the white paper's implementation. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Theodhoros Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister and president of the Council of Ministers, presented the Greek presidency's program to the European Parliament's plenary session. Pangalos particularly stressed what could be expected from a presidency in an international environment that is very unstable, experiencing serious crises, and suffering clashes. In his address, Pangalos stressed that the Greek Government attaches particular importance to implementing the white paper on employment and development. He said he hopes this will not be hindered by financial obstacles. Discussing the European Union's [EU] expansion with four new members from the North, Pangalos referred specifically to Cyprus' application. Referring to EU initiatives on common foreign policy, Pangalos mentioned the Greek presidency's sensitivity toward promoting peace and security in the Balkans and working toward resolving the tension in the former Yugoslavia. This position was accepted, the Greek presidency indirectly clarifying that it will not exploit the presidency to promote a national policy on the Balkans. This is why Pangalos carefully avoided mentioning Skopje or Turkey's policy toward Greece, something that was criticized by KKE [Greek Communist Party] Eurodeputy Efraimidhis. Replying to Efraimidhis, Pangalos said he was speaking for Greece as the EU president, not as a Greek nationalist who could satisfy his own wishes. [end recording]
