For Paulin Murayi, the Brussels-based representative of President Habyarimana's MNRD [National Revolutionary Movement for Development], things are clear: The RPF, and only the RPF, is responsible for blocking the Arusha peace process. Having said that, President Habyarimana is certainly no angel, and he has done everything to ensure that the Arusha negotiations with the RPF will be stymied as much as possible since the agreement that was finally reached and that is now seven months old reduces his powers in favor of power sharing with the RPF, which unleashed a war in Rwanda in October 1990. In the meantime, Habyarimana took an oath on 5 January as "transitional president." In doing so, he is, in actual fact, the only existing institution resulting from the implementation of the Arusha agreements. Neither the enlarged government, which will include five RPF ministers, nor the transitional parliament, in which the five coalition parties will have a seat, has been set up because within the MDR [Republican Democratic Movement], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PSD [Democratic Socialist Party], three opposition parties that already have a seat in the government, old scores between supporters and opponents of the RPF are sometimes settled in deadly ways. Quite a few observers believe that Habyarimana has stirred up this opposition, faultlines which run along ethnic, i.e. Hutu versus Tutsi, dividing lines, within the political parties in order to block the RPF's path to the government because, after the power sharing arrangement, there must follow a fusion of the government's existing army and the RPF forces after which Habyarimana will no longer enjoy a power base. Paulin Murayi (MNRD-Brussels) turns this analysis around: The dissent within the MDR, PL, and PSD will make it impossible for the RPF to manipulate the Arusha government, and therefore the RPF no longer sees any point in the peace agreements. He quickly glossed over the fact that according to UN observer Jacques Roger Booh-Booh the regime is widely distributing arms among Hutu farmers in order to concentrate primarily on the arms race which the RPF has,it says, begun. Independent sources also confirm that the RPF is buying arms in Eastern Europe and in Belgium, according to Murayi. FN-Herstal In this regard, he pointed to an unexplained matter at FN-Herstal: After the coup d'etat in Burundi in late October 1993, Burundi officers of the Tutsi ethnic group have presented themselves at the Liege-based arms factory with a major arms order. The Burundian Embassy in Brussels denied that this is an official order and the Belgian Government has denied that an export license has been issued. It was assumed that the officers in question were sent by the Tutsi putschists in Burundi. Paulin Murayi, however, maintains that the RPF high commander, Paul Kagame, was part of the group that knocked on the door of FN-Herstal. There are said to be reliable witnesses to this. Hence, the failed arms order was actually intended for the RPF. It is an open secret that the RPF, which recruits primarily among Tutsi exiles in neighboring countries, can count on much sympathy in the Burundian Army, which is still comprised almost exclusively of Tutsis. Land Mines According to Murayi, the several thousand land mines that the RPF used to seal off the front line in northern Rwanda were made in Belgium. He does not know how the RPF got hold of these mines: It was initially thought that perennial troublemaker Libya had delivered them, but because of the fact that these mines were smuggled via Cairo and Mobutu is no friend of al-Qadhdhafi, the suspicion does not appear to be well-founded. In addition to British-Ugandan weapons, the RPF also has access to American arms, the supplier of which is unknown. Murayi says that the fact that the RPF recruits many young Tutsis in the neighboring countries of Zaire (especially in North Kivu), Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania, something that has been confirmed by other sources, is clear proof that the RPF has moved away from the Arusha peace process toward an offensive military strategy. "They do not want to share power. No, they want to monopolize power. They still believe in the myth that they were born to rule, and that makes it impossible to live with them."
