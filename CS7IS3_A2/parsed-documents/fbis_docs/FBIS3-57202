The Supreme Soviet's presidium discussed this issue in Kiev on Monday. Leader of the Ukrainian parliament's working group on preparations for ratification of the START-1 treaty, Environment Minister Yuriy Kostenko, said on Monday that he saw neither economic and military "interests of Ukraine" nor guarantees for security in the statement. He believes that "due to this the Moscow statement should be considered properly and receive a juridical evaluation." Kostenko explained the fact that the document was signed in a form of a statement requiring no ratification by the parliament as "juridical intriguing" and demanded that deputies determine "whether the Moscow statement was useful for Ukraine." He added that the Moscow trilateral statement proposed "in fact a new scheme for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, which differs from the one worked out by the parliament." "We are moving towards a non-nuclear status. However, we do this in conformity with the interests of Ukraine. The events in Moscow represent not only a military but also an economic and political split within the country rather than nuclear disarmament," the minister believes. He also stated that Ukraine had already withdrawn to Russia tactical nuclear weapons together with approximately 10 tons of high enriched plutonium and 90 tons of high enriched uranium. In his words, 1 kilogram of plutonium will cost about $1 Mn and 1 kilogram of uranium up to $100,000 on the world market. "This means that today Russia is Ukraine's debtor and not vice versa. Russia must compensate Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons with account taken of the equivalent exchange of the cost of uranium for oil and gas."
