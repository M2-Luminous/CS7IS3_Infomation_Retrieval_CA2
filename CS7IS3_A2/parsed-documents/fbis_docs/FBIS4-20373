Analysis Of Basic Trends Direct foreign investment in China has soared in the past two years, resulting in another surge in the utilization of foreign investment, the second since the 1980's, and ushering in a new era in foreign investment. A number of new trends is detectable. 1) Scale Of Investment In terms of the overall scale of foreign investment, 40,264 projects were approved nationwide in all of 1992 with a total negotiated value of $57.51 billion, while the amount actually invested was $11.3 billion, up 180 percent, 280 percent, and 60 percent, respectively, from a year ago. The rapid increase in the overall scale of foreign investment has been accompanied by an increase in the scale of individual projects. According to preliminary statistics, the average negotiated investment of a project in 1992 was $1.2 million, compared to $900,000, the average four years ago. In the three provinces of Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Shandong, all leaders in the utilization of foreign capital, there were 254, 200, and 152 large and medium-sized projects, respectively, each with a price tag over $10 million. The simultaneous expansion of the overall scale of investment and the scale of individual projects is one of the salient features of the latest surge in foreign investment in China. The major causes of the surge in foreign investment are not external but have to do with changes in China's internal economic climate. While economic growth in the rest of the world remains sluggish, trade imbalances widen, and funds are short in recent years, the Chinese economy has been racing ahead full steam, its economic system beginning to operate like a socialist market economy, its large- and medium-sized enterprises transforming their operating mechanism with despatch, its other economic sectors booming, and its foreign trade flourishing. All of that has vastly improved China's investment climate, further tapped its market potential, and created even better conditions for foreign investment. 2) Investment Mix Guided by the adjustment of the nation's industrial policy, the composition of foreign investments also changed substantially in 1992. Foreign investment in the infrastructure, in basic industries, in capital- and technology-intensive industries, in technological transformation, and in the tertiary sector, including banking, commerce, tourism, and real estate, rose proportionately, thus broadening the area open to foreign capital. In the geographical distribution of foreign investment, the trend is for foreign capital to move north and west. The coastal economic region, anchored by Pudong, Shanghai; the economic zone surrounding Bohai, with its relatively sophisticated industrial structure; and many provincial capitals and border areas have become the new hot spots for foreign investors. All in all, although the generalization that foreign investment is concentrated in the southeastern coastal region and in processing industries remains basically valid, we can see trends toward dispersal and diversification. Changes in the direction and composition of foreign investment are a function of the implementation of China's across-the-board open policy, the decision by the government to ease restrictions on foreign investment in some areas, and, most important, on shifts in comparative advantage at home. Already China has set up a whole range of foreign investment preferential zones, including special economic zones, economic and technical development zones, opened ports along the coast, rivers, and borders, economic development zones, and tax protection zones; and further delegated the power to examine and approve foreign investment projects, the result of which is to narrow the comparative advantage of one locality vis-a-vis the next in policy power. Changes in the costs of capital goods like labor, land, and resource, in particular, have forced a number of localities which have been major destinations of foreign capital to accelerate industrial upgrading and outward dispersal. Hence the objective trend of an increase in scale leading to structural upgrading. 3) Forms of Investment Of all direct foreign investment in China in 1992, Sino-foreign joint ventures accounted for $6.1 billion, or 55 percent; Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, $2.1 billion, or 18 percent; wholly foreign-funded enterprises, $2.5 billion, 22 percent; and others (including cooperative development, international leasing, compensation trade, processing and assembling), $500 million, or 5 percent. If we look at the various forms of investment one by one, Sino-foreign joint ventures first constituted over 50 percent of total investments in 1987 and have always fluctuated between 50 and 55 percent ever since. Wholly foreign-funded enterprises accounted for a minor share of total investment throughout the 1980's and have shown notable growth only after 1990, rising from less than 10 percent in 1989 to 25 percent. The absolute value of Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures consistently hovered around $700 million between 1986 and 1991. As the overall scale of foreign investment expanded, however, its share of total investment headed downward only to rebound sharply in 1992, climbing more than 178 percent. Changes in the other forms of investment have been insignificant because they account for a tiny share of all investments. The above analysis shows that there are three major forms of direct foreign investment in China, namely the Sino-foreign joint venture, Sino-foreign contractual joint venture, and wholly foreign-funded enterprise, which between them make up 75 percent of all foreign investment. At present, foreign-funded enterprises in the north are more likely to be Sino-foreign joint ventures, while foreign investment along the southeastern coast typically takes the form of wholly foreign-funded enterprises. This also reflects on an objective level the differences between north and south China in economic structure, institutional characteristics, and degree of openness. 4) Results of Investment China utilizes direct foreign investment in order to expand the scale of capital formation, raise the enterprises' product standard and technical level, increase foreign exchange-earning exports, enhance national income, and learn managerial and administrative experiences. Judging from the present situation, it has achieved these objectives to varying degrees despite much unevenness in development. To begin with, as its scale expands, direct foreign investment is playing an increasingly important role in supplementing fixed assets investment in all society. Actually utilized foreign capital accounted for 3 percent or so of all social fixed assets in the 1980's, rose to 4.5 percent in 1991, and exceeded 8 percent in 1992. Secondly, the three kinds of enterprises either partially or wholly foreign-funded that are already in business have filled part of the void in China's lineup of industry, boosted the upgrading of the industrial structure, and greatly narrowed the technical gap between China and the world. The southern Chinese coast, where the manufacturing industry used to be relatively weak, is now the nation's leader in some processing technologies, product design, and other areas. By attracting foreign funds and importing foreign technology, 63 percent of the technical equipment in Beijing's industrial enterprises have now reached the international standards in the late 1980's, leaping through 30 years of technological progress in less than eight years. The utilization of foreign capital has striking effects in the technical advances China has made in optical fiber and cable communications equipment, automated instruments and meters, color kinescope, elevator, large-scale integrated circuitry, microcomputer, automobile, new building materials, and drugs. Thirdly, the three kinds of enterprises that are either partially or wholly foreign-funded have spurred the development of China's foreign trade. In 1992, they accounted for 26 percent of the nation's total exports and imports, or $41.8 billion, an increase of 51 percent, including $17.4 billion in exports and $26.4 billion in imports, 20 percent and 44 percent, respectively, of China's total exports and imports. Finally, following the expansion of the production scale of the three kinds of enterprises, the state is also collecting more revenue--$10.7 billion in 1992, up 53 percent over 1991--generated by foreign economic activities. Meanwhile, employment at the three kinds of enterprises has also been climbing year after year, accompanied by a notable increase in workers' wages. As of late 1992, almost 140,000 people were on the payroll of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises in Beijing, their per capita wage exceeding that of their counterparts in domestic enterprises of the same industry by more than 30 percent. Xiamen Shi has adopted regulations explicitly mandating that wages in the three kinds of enterprises exceed those in comparable Chinese enterprises by more than 20 percent. The three kinds of enterprises have become a key avenue for workers in pursuit of higher incomes. Then there are the many intangible ways in which the three kinds of enterprises have been a boon. With their management model based on the market economy and depending on their source of capital, they provide a good example for Chinese enterprises trying to transform their operating mechanism. By serving as a bridge linking the domestic and international markets and disseminating information, the three kinds of enterprises are helping to shape public thinking and mode of conduct. 2. Major Problems Substantial progress has been made in the utilization of direct foreign investment. However, as the national economy develops and the macroeconomic situation changes, the further development of the three kinds of enterprises still faces many problems that need to be worked out. 1) While the scale of foreign investment has expanded rapidly, the composition of investment is less than sound. According to statistics, it was the industrial sector soaking up foreign capital in a big way that accounted for the sharp jump in the utilization of foreign capital since the 1980's. In 1985, the negotiated amount of direct foreign investment was $6.333 billion of which $2.384 billion, or 37.6 percent, went to industry. Corresponding figures in 1990 were $6.986 billion $5.943 billion and 85 percent, respectively; and in 1991, $12.422 billion, $10.055 billion, and 80.9 percent, respectively. Within the industrial sector itself, direct foreign investment is concentrated in labor-intensive processing and manufacturing industries. This investment pattern changed somewhat in 1992, with the tertiary sector gaining strength relative to total investments, but there has been no basic shift in the overall situation. According to the conventional development theory of the utilization of direct foreign investment, it is necessary for the production sector to dominate the investment mix. However, two points are noteworthy. First, the mix of foreign investment should be compatible with the stage of economic development the country is in at a given time. In other words, when foreign investment reaches a certain scale, other fields should gradually be opened up and made more attractive to foreign capital. The comprehensive planning capability of the three kinds of enterprises should be enhanced. Second, the mix of foreign investment must not be considered in isolation from the constraints of the domestic economic structure. At the present stage, most of such constraints are found in the basic industries and the infrastructure. Make use of foreign capital to relieve the bottlenecks instead of pursuing ill-considered development that will wind up exacerbating the bottlenecks. Direct foreign investment in the processing industry these days is increasing too rapidly, objectively requiring us to further broaden the scope of investment. In particular, we should step up measures to make the infrastructure and basic industries more attractive to foreign investors. It is also worth noting that of all direct foreign investment in traditional industries, most goes to the finished products of the processing and assembling industries while relatively little goes to capital goods and intermediate products. We can get a glimpse of this pattern from the imports and exports of the three kinds of enterprises that are either partially or wholly foreign-funded. In 1992, those enterprises ran up a deficit of $9 billion in their foreign trade. Most of their imports were machinery, equipment, raw materials, and parts and components. This also shows that China's utilization of foreign capital is concentrated in downstream industries with the upstream industries lagging in development. 2) While foreign-funded projects are hotly pursued, there are no coordinated measures to manage a project after the deal is clinched. Against a backdrop of runaway growth, every locality strapped for funds looks to foreign capital to close the gap in its funding sources. At one point all jurisdictions were scrambling to introduce preferential policies to attract foreign capital and delegate power to manage foreign projects. In a certain sense, preferential treatment and delegation are inherent in China's drive to open itself up to the outside world, attract foreign capital, and advance economic development. But this does not mean that we should go easy on management and pursue projects to the exclusion of everything else. In our investigations, we discovered there is indeed a tendency everywhere to scramble for projects. Some even set a specified number of foreign-funded projects as target to be fulfilled by the levels below. How well they meet the targets has become the yardstick by which their performance is judged. Major problems that occur after a deal is struck are: First, while the amount of foreign investment negotiated is large, the sum actually realized is on the low side. Many contracts are drawn up and signed, but the percentage that opens for business is not high enough. In the Beijing area, for instance, direct foreign investment amounted to $8.11 billion on paper by 1992, but only $3.95 billion, or 48.2 percent, were actually realized. During the same period, Beijing approved a total of 3,769 projects involving the three kinds of enterprises either partially or wholly foreign-funded. In reality, a mere 942 companies opened for business, for a business start-up rate of 25 percent. In Fujian Province, only 30 percent of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises were fully capitalized in accordance with the terms of their contracts. In Zhejiang Province, the contract investment compliance rate is just 45.7 percent or so. Furthermore, land is being occupied illegally and there are no economies of scale. To attract foreign investors, some localities have been treating land as a cheap resource, setting land prices in development zones at excessively low levels. Farmland is being taken in a big way and the interests of local peasants are not properly safeguarded. Some localities have even introduced investment incentive policies under which an investor is free to "decide its own project and pick the plant site." There is no overall planning. Many small-time and highly opportunistic foreign investors take advantage of policy loopholes at every turn to profit themselves. The result is a scale of operations that is highly uneconomical with no external economies. In addition, losses are mounting and tax under-reporting and evasion are widespread. By 1991, over 2,500 enterprises either wholly or partially foreign-funded were in operation in Fujian. Of these 2,500 enterprises, more than 1,200, or 48 percent, were losing money to the tune of 400 million yuan in all. By 1992, 2,338 foreign-funded enterprises had opened for business in Zhejiang, of which 37 percent were unprofitable, their combined losses amounting to almost 100 million yuan. Meanwhile, 50 percent of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises in Beijing were losing money. There are various reasons for the unprofitability of foreign-funded enterprises, some policy-related, some having to do with the way they are operated and managed. However, a good number of these enterprises claim to be losing money but are actually making a profit. By falsifying their books and importing at high prices and exporting at low prices, they hope to evade paying taxes. In an audit on 1,311 enterprises either partially or wholly foreign-funded, the tax department in Shanghai identified 447 tax cheaters, or 34 percent. 3) The importation of "hardware" is stressed, but the importation of "software" is neglected. In particular, there are no mechanisms for absorption, assimilation, innovation, and dissemination. A key objective of the utilization of direct foreign investment is to import advanced foreign technology and introduce into China advanced foreign managerial experience. Only when such "software" is mastered can we consider the utilization of foreign capital to have basically achieved its objective. Judging from the reality in the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the infusion of foreign capital has indeed introduced into the country a considerable amount of advanced machinery and equipment. However, most of this equipment consists of processing and assembling production lines. Apparently what we have been getting is the final product, not technology or management. This leads to a host of problems. First, it increases the import content of the final product. To a large extent, it is our desire to increase exports and earn more foreign exchange that lies behind the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises. But since both capital goods and intermediate products consist heavily of imports, they in effect cause us to spend more foreign exchange, thus lowering the foreign-exchange-earning rate of exports. Second, it multiplies the costs of attracting a project. Without absorption and assimilation, it is very hard to avoid project duplication and excessive competition in the utilization of foreign capital. To facilitate the effective application of "hardware," we are also forced to increase the importation of related materials and parts correspondingly. Third, it lowers the efficiency with which hardware is applied. Advanced machinery and equipment need to be backed up by advanced management. In China, the operating mechanism of enterprises is less than perfect and the level of enterprise management is low. If the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises cannot break new ground in these areas, then we would have trouble realizing the benefits of the utilization of foreign capital. The dissociation between technology and management may even cause an enterprise to lose money and go bankrupt. 4) The distribution of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises is over-concentrated and the geographical division of labor does not make much sense. By and large the three kinds of enterprises are over-concentrated in south and east China, which is consistent with the objective reality of uneven economic development in China. But this is not the only problem. Even more serious, the three kinds of enterprises everywhere share a basically similar structural distribution. As power is delegated, moreover, development zones and opened zones, with their heavy concentration of foreign capital, also tend to converge functionally. Local characteristics are being overlooked and the lines of division of labor are being blurred, problems that will only continue to worsen. The adverse consequences of this kind of regional division of labor are twofold. On the one hand, there is no coordination between one region and the next when it comes to development. On the contrary, they impose a blockade against one another and engage in cut-throat competition. For the most minor local benefits, they would launch a project helter-skelter, without considering whether it is within the capability of the macroeconomy. Hence the overcapacity in some foreign-funded enterprises, worsening the bottleneck effects in the macroeconomy as a whole. On the other hand, it has prevented the many potential strengths of the localities from being tapped. The interior abounds with resources, but since only a tiny trickle of funds makes its way into the interior and it lacks processing capability, its edge in resources has not been converted into a strong industry that will back up the development of the entire economy. Furthermore, although the heavy and chemical industries of north China are a leader in the nation, the absence of funds to finance technological transformation and the lack of foreign capital to overhaul the mechanism have prevented them from generating as much profits as they should, which, in turn, has complicated their effort to adjust the industrial structure or upgrade the export mix more successfully. The nonspecialization tendency of the three kinds of enterprises in the various economic regions may exacerbate the inter-regional development imbalance, complicating industrial development planning and macroeconomic management, and possibly enable foreign investors to "fish among troubled waters." 3. Future Strategic Choices All in all China's macroeconomic environment has now changed enormously. Under the stimulus of the market mechanism, the national economy has been growing by leaps and bounds, new industry hot spots have been springing up endlessly, traditional industries are coming under mounting competitive pressure, and the existing infrastructure and basic industries fall far short of meeting the requirements of opening China to the outside world. Changes in foreign economic relations too seem to have been just as striking. To speed up its accession to GATT, for instance, China has taken a number of new steps that would bring itself more in line with international practices in such areas as market accessibility, intellectual property rights, imports-exports management, national treatment, and service trade. Meanwhile, new moves are constantly being made to prepare a coherent body of laws pertaining to foreign economic relations, overhaul government functions, and improve foreign capital service organizations. It was precisely against this backdrop that the utilization of direct foreign investment in China entered a period of runaway expansion. How should we review our experience, overcome existing problems, and step up guidance, regulation, and control to enable it to continue to grow healthily in a sustained manner in balance with national economic growth? This is an issue that every quarter should pay close attention to. Given the present situation, we believe we should adjust the way we utilize foreign capital and develop the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises from a strategic high ground. Instead of quantitative growth and extensive management, we should go after qualitative upgrading and intensive management. Enhance the economic and social benefits of the utilization of direct foreign investment across the board and lift the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises to a new plateau. 1) Based on the changes specific to a particular stage in the opening of China, we should replace the unitary strategy of foreign capital utilization with one that is diversified. There are three basic points. First, preserve and further the key role played by labor-intensive processing industry in attracting foreign capital, expanding exports, and earning foreign exchange, but take care to improve quality and increase added value so that the industry performs even better as a source of accumulation. Second, increase the proportions of direct foreign investment that go to the infrastructure, basic industry, technological upgrading, and the tertiary industry. Improve the industrial distribution of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises as a way of upgrading the industrial structure. Third, encourage the two-way flow of funds. Localities and enterprises with the necessary wherewithal should be allowed to develop multinational operations and set up joint ventures overseas. Increase the mobility of capital goods to tie in with the all-out opening of China. 2) Strive to improve the geographical distribution of foreign capital even as we adopt a diversification strategy to balance its industrial distribution. At present the most popular destinations of foreign investment remain concentrated in the southeastern coastal region. As the rivers and borders become more and more open, therefore, foreign investors are poised to strike out in a northern and western direction. Accordingly, we should take advantage of this trend and consider offering liberal preferential policies in the north and the interior so that the foreign investment fever now centered on the Zhu Jiang delta, southern Fujian, and the Chang Jiang delta would soon spread to north China and the interior, with more foreign-funded enterprises emerging in the backward areas in the 1990's. In the course of seeking balanced regional development, we should pay attention to regional characteristics and practice specialization and division of labor on an economic regional basis. Make the areas around Bohai and northeastern China the focus of the "northern push." The development strategy there is to use the existing edge in chemical industry, heavy industry, and electrical machinery industry to develop in a big way export-oriented and capital- or technology-intensive enterprises that are either partially or wholly foreign-funded, upgrade the industrial structure, and effect import substitution. [As published] The development strategy is to rely on central cities, exploit its ample resources, go all out to make the region along Chang Jiang and the Gansu-Hainan railroad the focus of the importation of foreign capital and technology, develop foreign-funded enterprises of the resource-processing type in order to enhance China's own resource-supplying capability, and manufacture capital goods and intermediate articles domestically to substitute imports. 3) To bring about strategic adjustments in the utilization of foreign capital, we should make more extensive use of the industrial policy as a guide. This essentially means three things. First, encourage large-scale projects, technology-intensive projects, and high-added-value projects. Scale back and perhaps abolish preferential treatments for low-grade low-end industrial projects in order to make good use of the policy of utilizing foreign investment. Second, to carry the industrial policy through, the state may consider gradually changing the examination and approval of a foreign-funded project by scale to examination and approval by industry (product), and cut back on projects in industries that need to be curbed while thoroughly deregulating those projects in industries that need to e encouraged. Support may be given at a policy level to projects that would help ease the bottlenecks hampering economic development. Evaluation work in the utilization of foreign capital should put more stress on the profitability target and quality target. Avoid the tendency among grassroots units to pursue quantity exclusively through administrative intervention at cross purposes with the industrial policy. That way, the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the construction of development zones, and the introduction of preferential policies would become more compatible with the requirements of the industrial policy. 4) Turning to the methods of foreign investment utilization, we should concentrate on the Sino-foreign joint venture format. In particular, we should encourage large and medium-sized state enterprises to form joint ventures with multinational corporations. The Sino-foreign joint venture is the one form of cooperation in the utilization of direct foreign investment where its management is most amenable to the influence of the Chinese partner and where the Chinese side can gain access to technology and managerial experience. Large and medium-sized state enterprises embody the level of technology and management direction at home, in the same way that multinational corporations embody the level of technology and development direction globally. Accordingly, joint ventures combining the two can result in the upgrading of foreign-funded enterprises and make the utilization of foreign capital a more powerful stimulant of the national economy as a whole. Change the methods of foreign capital utilization, from small to large, from low-end to upscale. The idea is to put an end to a pattern of conduct--short-sighted and speculative--existent in the three kinds of enterprises, namely "emphasizing importation but overlooking absorption and assimilation"; accelerate the transformation of the operating mechanism of large and mid-sized state enterprises; and give them greater development strength to open up the international market. 5) Invigorate the management of foreign capital utilization in the later stage and carry through with the foreign investment strategy centered on the increase of profitability to the point where it really matters. On the one hand, simplify and standardize the examination and approval procedures for the three kinds of enterprises and improve work efficiency so that both the Chinese side and its foreign counterpart get the project off the ground without delay in accordance with the contract. On the other hand, set a firm date based on the circumstances of the case by which a foreign funded enterprise must go into operation. If the enterprise fails to do so, its business license may be revoked in accordance with the law. Alternatively, the department in charge may review its application. A corresponding effort should be made to revise the pertinent policies, laws, and regulations. Furthermore, where management policies are discriminatory in nature, for instance, disparities exist between the preferential policy of one region and that of another or when the setting of foreign sales ratios is discriminatory, we should proceed to even up or eliminate the disparities and gradually achieve national treatment for the three kinds of enterprises in accordance with international practice, creating an orderly competitive environment with a level playing field. 6) Improve the basic climate for attracting foreign investment and better comprehensive services for the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises. Essentially this will involve the following: First, set up without delay a unified nation-wide information service network which foreign-funded enterprises can tap into for a fee. The network should provide the enterprises with information on overseas market movements and on prices of raw materials and products to help them make the right decisions. It will also help the Chinese manager familiarize himself with the situation and effectively prevent the foreign managers of foreign-funded enterprises from importing at high prices and exporting at low prices and shifting profits around to avoid paying taxes. Second, raise the standard of management and administration at foreign-funded enterprises. Augment training for Chinese managerial personnel. On the one hand, we should take pains to review the managerial experiences and methods of different kinds of foreign-funded enterprises. Work hard to assimilate and innovate upon them to benefit tangibly from the utilization of foreign capital. On the other hand, we should tackle the improvement of the quality of Chinese managerial personnel as a basic task in foreign capital utilization. Offer on-the-job training for the personnel of foreign-funded enterprises in a variety of ways and at all levels to meet the requirements of achieving a new high in foreign capital utilization. Third, accelerate the socialized management of foreign-funded enterprises. In areas with a heavy concentration of foreign capital, in particular, we should create an economy to go with the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises by doing a good job in regional planning and social service coordination, thereby making things more convenient for the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises in daily life, health care, education, and culture. Fourth, accelerate fiscal reform, financial reform, and foreign trade reform. Sort out the relations among tax rates, interest rates, and exchange rates step by step in accordance with the requirements of the development of a market economy. Optimize the macroeconomic climate so that foreign-funded enterprises can operate and do business in a better institutionalized and statutory environment.
