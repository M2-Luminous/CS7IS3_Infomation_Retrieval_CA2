This was a 14 per cent rise on the 1993/94 budget. Development remained the single largest area of government spending. The minister announced a 25.3 per cent rise in budgeted expenditure for devlopement to R520-million. Mr Malie said the large increase demonstrated government's commitment to create jobs. Some 35 new projects had been approved for the current financial year, he said. Education took the second largest slice of government expenditure recording an increase of nearly a third to R332-million (R226-million). Other government department budgets included: public works, road construction and repairs -- R204-million (R169-million); health -- R124-million (R118-million); agriculture -- R103-million (R83.5-million) and defence -- R90.3-million (no previous figure). Lesotho's share of customs revenue from the Southern African Customs Union remained the largest source of revenue, budgeted to total R841-million (R747-million) or 60 per cent of the 1994/95 budget. The rise was due to the continued importation of goods used in the construction of the Lesotho Highland Water Project. However, the minister warned revenue from these imports would taper off in the next few years as the main construction work on the water project was completed.
