FBIS4-129 "drafr063_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 31 Mar South African Press Review for 31 Mar MB3103175794 MB3103175794 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Black Empowerment in Mining Sector -- "For decades, not to say centuries, blacks have been barred by economic and historical forces from ownership of South Africa's top layers of business: the mining and industrial sectors," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 March in a page-14 editorial. "Today, both justice and economic realism demand that this imbalance should be urgently redressed." Consequently, Anglo-American's "plan to unbundle its 40 percent-controlled JCI [Johannesburg Consolidated Investments], enabling black investors to acquire significant blocks of shares, is a highly promising move," while "a black-run mining house would be the cherry on the top." BUSINESS DAY Financing the ANC's RDP -- The Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 31 March in a page-14 editorial warns that "it is becoming increasingly clear that South Africa's post-election government will be fiscally challenged. The TEC's [Transitional Executive Council] promise to the IMF that budget deficits will be contained by curtailing expenditure rather than by increasing taxes will be a major constraint, if it is kept," because the BUSINESS DAY questions whether major reductions in current spending are "really feasible at a time of affirmative action and creation of new government structures? In time, rationalisation opportunities will present themselves, but it is wishful thinking to count on too high an 'apartheid dividend'." "It is difficult to see where the savings can be made in the short run to finance the massive investment promised in the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program]." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN `Battle of Johannesburg' -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English in its 31 March to 7 April edition in a page-16 editorial states that the Zulus who died in front of the ANC's Shell House in Johannesburg were not "lambs." "They had come looking for trouble. Nevertheless, it was impossible to escape the impression that they had been led to the slaughter, victims in an increasingly cynical political game of oneupmanship. They were men who had become more valuable to their leaders in death than they could ever have been in life." Concluding, the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN blames the police for the "complete failure of public order." "This was first and foremost their disaster," states the editorial. THE CITIZEN Johannesburg Violence -- "In a country of endemic violence...we suppose we should not be shocked by what happened in central Johannesburg yesterday, but we are," begins the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 29 March in a page-6 editorial. THE CITIZEN is "deeply shocked" because of "snipers who killed marchers like they were shooting at a flock of birds." Inspite of this "horror" now is "not a time for overreaction, not a time for retaliation, not a time for reprisals. It is a time for calm. A time for an awareness of what violence is doing to this country." In conclusion the paper states that it has "over and over again" said "let there be peace." Meeting of National Leaders -- "We are pleased that Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini will attend a meeting with State President de Klerk, KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, next week to discuss steps to contain violence and to seek solutions to Zulu aspirations" because "the ugly events in downtown Johannesburg have sinister implications not just for the election but for peace itself," begins an editorial on page 6 of the 30 March edition of THE CITIZEN. Regarding the declaration of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu, THE CITIZEN states that "since the ANC, which dominates the TEC, has condemned previous states of emergency, it is hypocritical to support one now." "The solution does not lie in introducing Draconian measures, but in reaching an understanding on the holding of the election without interference, intimidation or violence." Later the paper states "we expect the government to act firmly but evenhandedly," and to stop "treating the Zulu issues as an aberration on the part of the king and Chief Buthelezi. The Zulu demands are deep-rooted and cannot simply be ignored." In a final demand THE CITIZEN states that "the ANC must stop protesting its innocence about the events in downtown Johannesburg."
