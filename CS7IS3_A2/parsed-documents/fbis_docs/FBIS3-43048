P. Krasitskiy, M. Ya. Marov, Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics; UDC 523.31-852] [Abstract] The model used in this study covers altitudes from 0 to 60 km and considers chemical and photochemical processes involving O, H, C, N, and Cl. The temperature and density used in the model are representative of March at 45ï¿½N. The model is one-dimensional and yields global average daily vertical profiles of atmospheric components. There is a satisfactory agreement between the theoretical models and observational data in most cases; however, there are substantial divergences in the concentrations of several components at various altitudes. For example, the models used here yielded excessive amounts of NHO[.sup]3[/], much less H[.sup]2[/]O, and at higher altitudes, noticeably less CH[.sup]4[/] and H[.sub]2[/]. This may be due to problems with the chemical scheme of the model due to a poor description of vertical transfer, as well as incorrect treatment of turbulent mixing. Further study is required to identify physical and chemical processes responsible for these divergences. Models and observational data can be more accurately compared by using two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Individuals ections of the article discuss active and inert components, HNO[.sup]3[/] and O[.sub]3[/]. Figures 22; references 8: 2 Russian, 6 Western.
