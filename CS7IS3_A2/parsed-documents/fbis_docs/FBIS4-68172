The police intervened late Sunday as Fatah Hawks leader Ziyad Gharman and nine other activists armed with M16, Uzi, and Kalashnikov machine guns, fled an Israeli patrol lying in wait on a road between Gaza City and Nusayrat, the official told AFP. The PLO men took refuge in a farmhouse which was surrounded by troops. Palestinian police were informed and after intensive talks the army agreed to let the men go. The militants were taken to the police headquarters in Gaza where a senior Palestinian officer advised them "to stay in hiding and not to move" as long as the Israeli army was present on the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian police last Wednesday started to take over the strip, in line with the May 4 PLO-Israel agreement on limited self-rule. "We don't want to lose you in the final moments of the occupation," the officer told the Hawks. The Israeli army spokesman said he was unaware of the incident.
