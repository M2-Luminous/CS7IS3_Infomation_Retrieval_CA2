FR941207-2-00092 FR941207-2-00064 According to the Phlx, absent spread priority, inter-currency spreads can be executed as contingency orders pursuant to Phlx Rule 1066. For example, an FCO floor broker would quote a French franc market as well as a Swiss franc market, in each respective trading crowd; then, the floor broker would announce ``99 bid for 99 Sep 99 French franc calls if i can sell 99 Dec 99 Swiss franc puts at 99.'' However, each component of the spread, however, must be bid/offered individually, which, according to the Exchange, generally means that each component is executed at a price better than the established bid/offer. In addition, the Exchange believes that because each leg must be executed between the established market, such contingency orders are more likely to be broken up by market interest in one leg, such that the end result may be a different number of contracts for each leg. Rule 1066(f)(1) defines a spread as an order to buy a stated number of option contracts and to sell the same number of option contracts, in a different series of the same class of options. The Exchange now proposes to adopt Rule 1066(f)(1)(A) to define inter-currency spreads because the existing definition requires that both orders be for the same class of FCOs, which does not allow for spreads involving FCOs in different currencies. The Exchange believes that executing inter-currency spreads subject to a spread priority provision is appropriate for several reasons. First, inter-currency spreads provide a trading strategy for FCO market participants based on the interplay between the currencies of two countries, similar to the advantages and opportunities associated with cross-rate FCOs. The Exchange believes that the availability of such strategies should enhance liquidity in existing FCOs. Second, the Phlx emphasizes that inter-currency spreads are not a new trading strategy, as they are currently executable as two separate, contingent orders. Instead, inter-currency spread priority is intended to facilitate the execution of such orders, which, according to the Exchange, often proves to be difficult. For example, the execution of inter-currency spreads as contingency orders may present a logistical problem as floor brokers must, in exercising due diligence, shuttle between two trading crowds or, to prevent a trade from occurring while the floor broker is in the second crowd, utilize two floor brokers to execute such an order. The requirement in proposed Phlx Rule 1033(i) that each leg of an inter-currency spread be executed at or within the market for the individual leg, and that at least one leg is executed at a price which improves the established market, should, according to the Exchange, protect investors and the public interest as well as prevent manipulative acts and practices. The Exchange states that this requirement is also consistent with Phlx Rule 118 which provides that when a bid/offer is clearly established, no bid/offer outside that price shall be established. The Exchange further believes that spread priority for inter-currency spreads should facilitate a more simplified execution procedure for such orders. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), 7 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
