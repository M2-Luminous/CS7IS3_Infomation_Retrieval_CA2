FBIS4-27110 "dreas104_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 North Korea Papers Denounce Inspection Visit Papers Denounce Inspection Visit SK3105050094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0429 GMT 31 May 94 SK3105050094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Papers here today denounce the traitor Kim Yong-sam for whipping up a war fever during his "inspection" of units of the puppet ground, naval and air forces. An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: The traitor Kim Yong-sam recently "inspected" units of the puppet Army and incited confrontation and war, crying for "establishment of an iron-wall alert posture against the North." This fully revealed the treacherous nature of the "civilian" warmaniac who seeks a way out in opposing fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. The traitor is these days letting no chance pass by without giving a shriek, as if invasion from the North were imminent. But no one lends an ear to his outcry reminding one of the guilty party filing the suit first. The Kim Yong-sam group is openly having confabs with bellicose quarters of the United States for a war against the North and unhesitatingly talking about "retaliatory punishment" and "opportunity of unification," while raising outcries over "nuclear suspicion" against the North. The South Korean puppets have even worked out with the United States a war scenario against the North codenamed "New Operation Plan 5027." Judging from this, their current movements are very ill- boding. The traitors bereft of reason, driven to a blind alley, might ignite a war any moment. However, it cannot be a way out for them but and will only precipitate their own destruction. A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns: The Korean people and People's Army are always vigilant against the military moves of the puppets and, if they attempt to harm fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces, will sternly punish them.
