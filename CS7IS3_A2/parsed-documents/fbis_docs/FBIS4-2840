The two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on transportation, shipping, agricultural, power, and telecommunications projects. Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and Ibrahim Bin-Salamah, a deputy minister and vice chairman of the Saudi Arabia Basic Industry Cooperation, inked the accord. This was the first vice ministerial-level conference in Taipei since the two countries severed diplomatic relations in July 1990. During two days of discussions, the two countries tentatively agreed to sign an investment guarantee pact and an agreement eliminating double taxation. They also agreed to reduce tariffs, increase private exchanges, and clamp down on pirated computer software. The committee will hold its next annual meeting in Riyadh, but the time has not yet been fixed.
