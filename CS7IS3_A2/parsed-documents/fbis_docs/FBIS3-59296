As for the "great contract" in the rural organization system, along with popularization of the responsibility system of production, rural political power since 1984 has taken the road of standardization marked by establishment of town governments and village committees. This development in China's rural economic pattern and organization system has brought with it some obvious changes in township revenues and expenditures, which can be summarized as: 1. The implementation of contracted revenue system for all levels started in 1990 with the "separated responsibility" of revenue and government which linked local revenue income and expenditures bringing clearly practical benefits to all levels of local government, and initiated an economic development model which has a special plane in the history of world economic development -- one which is centered on the local government. 2. The traditional rural revenue and expenditure system in China consists of internal budget revenue and external budget revenue; at the end of 1982, although there were 20,000 people's communes in China which had established a commune level revenue and expenditure system, it was a revenue and expenditure administration system which relied chiefly on "unified collection and distribution." As development of the market economy provided the chief impetus to the continuous development of local economies, all sorts of contradictions which had built up under the traditional revenue and expenditure system grew increasingly acute, and produced a new type of revenue and expenditure -- extra revenue and expenditures for dealing these contradictions, and, as soon as this one was born, it spread rapidly and wildly catalyzed all manner of contradictions. We define revenue and expenditure here as the collection and application by the authorities of capital to support government activities, using their legal enforcement powers, in accordance with the practical situation of current local revenue and expenditure operations in China. All free capital collected by the enforcement powers of authorities by township governments are revenue income of this level of government, while all costs for all kinds of activities of township governments are expenditures of this level government. According to this broad meaning of revenue and expenditure, we divide revenue and expenditures into internal system revenue and external system revenue. The former refers to the internal and external budget revenue under the current financial administration system. The latter refers to self collected capital by township governments through all kinds and forms and to governmental expenditures caused by these. Along with continuous reform of the revenue and expenditure system and the constant development of the rural economy, the extra revenue and expenditure of rural township governments has extended rapidly, increasing at a pace which has surpassed that of internal revenue and expenditure. In 1990, the gross income of township revenue nationwide was 48.5 billion RMB, a 1.1-fold increase over 1986, with an annual average 20 percent rate of increase. Included in this was 36.1 billion RMB internal budget income, and 3.1 billion RMB external budget income, and 9.2 billion RMB in towns' self-collected capital income, increases of 86 percent, 181 percent, and 241 percent respectively from 1986.(Footnote)(Xiang Cai: "Strategic Study of China's Rural Revenue and Expenditure Development," CAIZHENG No.5, 1992). From 1990 to the present we taken representative samples in areas which had different levels of development. The evidence showed that external revenue and expenditure has occupied a decisive position in the overall township revenue and expenditure. For instance, in 1989, in a town in suburban Beijing which has well developed township enterprises, out of a total of 61.25 million RMB gross yearly revenue and enterprises income, extra revenue and expenditure accounted for 77.4 percent, while budgeted income only accounted for 21.4 percent. In a town in Zhejiang Province in the same year, out of a gross yearly revenue income of 902,000 RMB, extra revenue and expenditure accounted for 72.5 percent, while budgeted revenue and expenditure accounted for only 27.5 percent.(Footnote)(Sun Tanzhen, Wang Zhaocai, Yaogang, Sanbenyumei: "China's Economic Development and Agricultural Revenue and Expenditure," published by the Japanese Institute of Asian Economy, as No.92 in the Special Overseas Joint Research Report Series, 1991. This report's analysis showed that these towns' extra revenue and expenditure amounted to very little at all.) In 1991, in a town in suburban Guangzhou, out of a gross yearly revenue and expenditure of 4.3 million RMB, extra income accounted for 91.6 percent, while budgeted income for only 8.4 percent; of the gross yearly expenditures of 4.026 million RMB, extra expenditure accounted for 91.2 percent. In a town of Dalian in the same year, the budgeted revenue income was over 17 million RMB, while extra expenditure was over 50 million RMB. In a suburban town of Shanghai, the gross revenue income was 4.06 million in 1991, of which 67 percent came from extra revenue, while 59 percent of the gross expenditure of 4.49 million RMB came from extra expenditure. Even in areas in which the agricultural economy is the dominant factor, extra revenue and expenditure still occupied a considerable portion. According to our representative sample, a town in Hunan provides a good example: of its 1991 gross revenue income of 1.077 million RMB, 41.3 percent came from extra revenue; of the gross expenditure of 1.012 million RMB, extra expenditure accounted for 41.7 percent. In one town in Zhejiang, out of a gross revenue income of 808,000 RMB in 1989, extra revenue income accounted for 49.8 percent. Because extra revenue and expenditure have played an increasingly important role in developing township local economies and in bringing township government into full play, therefore analyzing the causes and the operating system of township extra revenue and enterprises will aid in correctly grasping the current township revenue and expenditure system in China's rural areas, and in adopting correct policies to make township revenue and expenditure play a bigger role in rural economic and social development. 1. The Causes of Extra Revenue and Expenditure The rapid expansion of rural township extra revenue and expenditure in China was produced by an increasingly acute contradiction between financial system reform which was lagging and rural economic development which was increasingly focused on a market economy. It can be analyzed from the two aspects of supply and demand. We will look at supply first: A) The currently operating financial administration system creates supply insufficiencies. The rural financial administration system has taken four basic forms in China: (1) the system of "united collection and distribution"; (2) the system of "fixing income and expenditures, handing over revenues to higher authority, partially sharing income according to a certain rate, allocating expenditures, not re-supplying those in deficit, and reserving surpluses"; (3) the system of "checking and ratifying revenues and expenditures, linking up revenues and expenditures, sharing the gross amount at a certain rate, and sharing part of excessive revenues at a certain rate"; (4) the system of "dividing revenues and expenditures, checking and ratifying cardinal numbers, contracting revenues and expenditures." Looking at development, towns which operated under the "united collection and distribution" two line system of revenue and expenditures showed a steady decline, while those towns which carried out linkage of revenues and expenditures showed a progressive increase. By the end of 1990, there were 32,700 towns which had operated under the latter two systems, and this was more than 60 percent of all township financial offices.(Footnote)("Accelerate Development of Township Revenue and Expenditure to a New Level," CAIZHENG YANJIU ZILIAO No.32, 1991) These two systems expanded the jurisdiction of township revenues and expenditures, aroused the enthusiasm of township governments to organize financial income and reduce expenditures. However, because most township economies are still focused on agriculture, and with a few exceptions are at a lower development level in the rural areas of China, so the gross amount of budgeted revenue income which is focused on industrial and commercial taxes is low, and the tax resources unstable. Relevant documents show that in 1990, there were about 25,000 towns with budgeted revenue income between 800,000 and 1 million RMB, 21,800 towns with budgeted revenue income between 100,000 and 800,000 RMB, and about 10 percent of the total number of towns were below 100,000 RMB. (Footnote)(Meng Chun: "Strategic Studies on China's Township Development" in: Collected Essays on Township Revenue and Expenditure in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, 1992) Because most of the township governments have lower budgeted internal revenue income, according to the rules of the current revenue system their revenue income is severely limited. Meanwhile, although many towns have now implemented a financial management system in which the towns themselves control that part of the excess profits above a base figure which is handed up after contract completion, still, it is also true that implementation of "handing up all revenue income to higher authority, allocating expenditures by checked and ratified amounts," etc., is obviously off the track of "united collection and allocation." In addition, most towns did not fix a state reserve, and therefore, indeed, the budgeted revenue income which can be supply to towns for their own use will be discounted for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, it is extremely inconvenient to use township level financial capital, while at present, the means and the rate at which capital is shared has not been systematically or legally stabilized, so is affected by such things as changes in policy, town leaders' negotiating ability and the attention paid to their personal careers as officials, etc. This is highly unstable, and has led to a situation wherein controllable revenue income of township revenue and expenditures has not changed regularly along with changes in tax collections, etc., so that the surplus funds are often insufficient, while revenue income shortages continue to exceed the base. So the imperfection of the budgeted revenue management system presents a serious obstacle to building and developing township revenue and expenditures, which leads township governments to try creating other financial resources to break out of the limitations of the budgeted financial system. 2. The imperfections in the tax collection administration system currently in operation induces local governments to expand extra revenue income. China's local revenue chiefly depends on taxes collected from local enterprises. These are the three types of industrial and commercial taxes, that is, products tax, business tax, and value added tax. These three taxes constitute the largest proportion, and divided into central and local taxes; meanwhile, current policy provides that local governments share certain tax deduction rights, which leads local governments to convert this kind of revenue sharing into a benefits system for local revenue. With this motive, local governments take full advantage of tax deduction rights, and put tax resources into the principal taxable economic entity. Township governments of each locality use every possible means in the attempt to get favorable tax deductions for township enterprises, especially for collective township enterprises, so that enterprises pay less taxes or none at all. They then use other means to turn tax resources into township self collected capital income; an example of this is turning over township enterprises benefits and administration fees, fund raising, apportion, strong financial support, etc. 3. The development of local economy has expanded sources of extra revenue and expenditure. Since 1978, the development of local economy as represented by township enterprises has been the most vigorous and distinct. In 1991, the gross output of township enterprises reached 1,162.17 billion yuan, an increase of 20 times that of 1979, and with a 29 percent average annual rate of increase. The rapid development of rural economy represented by township enterprises created wide financial resources for township extra revenue. This has especially been the case in some township enterprises developed areas, where township governments have directly gained considerable extra revenue from profits turned over to them by enterprises. In addition, from the standpoint of needs, what is required for development of the local economy and society's self development, population growth, inflation, and new types of consumption which have appeared along with the development of the economy, etc., have all caused expenditures to increase rapidly. Especially rapid has been the development of local economies and expenditures related to the supply of public products and the need to deal promptly with external economic influences. Because the nature of public products is manifested in "nonexclusivity" (meaning it is impossible to collect usage fees or ask excessive costs) and "noncompetitiveness" in consumption, so, under market economy conditions, the supply of public products can only be resolved by governmental means through financial expenditures. As for dealing with external influences under market economy conditions, when there are inconsistencies between the societal cost of a product or service and the individual cost, and between societal usage and individual usage, it demands that government do something to deal with those external influences. In the current situation, the following are the reasons for requiring that township revenue and expenditures increase in rural China: (1) The population tends to be urban. With development of township enterprises and the rural economy, the development level of townships and market trends in the countryside have improved greatly. The developing tendency of township and market has led to an increased demand for social capital-type products; for example, the demand for telecommunications facilities, sewers, park constructions, etc., has been vigorous. (2) The educational level has improved. With the income level of the peasants improved, their educational needs are increasing daily. Meanwhile, because society's usage of education is far bigger than individual usage, so, in addition to farm families bearing part of the educational costs, the government has to bear a substantial part of educational costs as well. (3) With deepening reform and the progressive establishment of a market economic system, there has been a constant need to maintain the basic framework and order of socio-economic life; for instance, legislation, law enforcement, public security, statistics, resource management and general executive affairs, etc. (4) The short supply and dispersal of private capital, the peasants' love of consumption and savings combined with their weak knowledge of risk investment, forms pressures on the conduct of direct investment and expansion of township economy development by government revenue and expenditure. (5) Township leaders have an affinity for pursuing short term profits, official achievements, and all sorts of "reaching standard" activities, etc., cause increases in every kind of nonconstructive costs. (6) The scale and standard of expenditure for every type of cost which is fixed in the revenue and expenditure regulations currently in operation are far lower than the practical needs of each locality; for some projects, higher authority promised to increase such revenue allocations, as the wage subsidy, grain price subsidy, transport subsidy, etc., but did not do so, which required that the townships add expenditures. All these pushed townships to look for sources of extra revenue and expenditure. 2. Sources and characteristics of township extra revenue and expenditure. At present, township extra revenue in rural China comes chiefly from the following several sources: 1) Profits and administrative fees handed over by township enterprises. In 1991, the net after-tax profits of the two levels of town and village from collective enterprises had reached 28.47 billion RMB. (Footnote)(China Statistical Yearbook 1992 China Statistics Publishing House) A guess at the gross income ratio of town-run to village-run enterprises would be that half of the net after-tax profits must come from town-run enterprises. Meanwhile, because of such factors as untruthful reporting, the actual profits are far more than the statistical figure. Profits and administrative fees which are handed over to township governments by town-run enterprises constitute the main body of extra revenue and expenditure. In addition, enterprises run by villages, associated families, and individual industrial and commercial families, etc. should all hand over a fixed amount of administrative fees to township governments. 2) Capital uniformly collected by townships, including revenue collected by township governments according to state regulations. Up to 1990, there were as many as 149 projects which were authorized in documents of every state ministry and commission to collect funds from peasants. These included chiefly: educational fees, family planning fees, fees to provide special care to family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, training fees for militiamen, subsidy fees to rural cadres, construction fees for social public affairs, etc. 3) All types of fund raising and monetary contributions. This includes enterprise and personal fund raising and monetary contributions on the township scale, as well as from overseas people and organs, e.g., contributions of money from countrymen residing abroad, etc., This type of revenue has recently been on the increase in many localities. 4) Incomes from various kinds of fines and confiscations. During the period of establishing, maintaining, and implementing a new economic system and social life, this type of income will tend to increase. Through analyses to actual surveys in some localities, we know that the extra township revenue and expenditure in rural China differs in nature from budgeted revenue and expenditure. 1. In areas with differing levels of economic development, the extra revenue and expenditure structure differs as well. Generally speaking, in economically developed areas, those with stronger collective economic power, not only is the extra revenue and expenditure at a high level, the resources are also relatively concentrated. Revenue is reliant chiefly on profits handed over by collective township enterprises, administrative fees, and united capital collection by townships. For instance, in 1989, the extra revenue from a town in Beijing was 47.425 million RMB, including 30.093 million RMB which was handed over by township enterprises, 63.5 percent of the total. In 1991, the extra revenue from a town in Guangzhou totalled 3.936 million RMB; included in this was 2.282 million RMB from enterprises, which was 58 percent of the gross revenue, and 1.43 million RMB united capital collection by townships, which was 36.4 percent, and these two revenues together constituted 94.4 percent of the gross income. In 1991, the extra revenue from a town in Dalian was 2.96 million RMB, including 1.65 million RMB from enterprises, which was 55.7 percent of gross revenue, and 920,000 RMB in united capital collection by townships, which was 31.1 percent, these two incomes in total constituting 86.8 percent of total revenue. Indeed, in many areas where the collective economy developed to a higher level, the townships' united capital collection came chiefly from collective economic profits handed over by village-run enterprises, and this extended the extra revenue from enterprise profits, both in amount and rate. In areas where the economy is undeveloped, extra revenue and expenditure are at a low level, chiefly reliant on direct resources from townships' united collection of capital which comes from budget income of farm families and land contract administrative fees and other temporary fund raising, monetary contributions, etc. Take Yunnan as an example: in 1990, 20 percent of the province's township self-collected capital came from profits of township enterprises and institutes, which was concentrated in a few areas where the level of economic development was higher; all items of united capital collection usually constituted about 75 percent.(Footnote)(Chen Yingxuan: "Gradually Perfect Construction of Township Revenue and Expenditure to Promote Comprehensive Development of Rural Economy," YUNNAN CAIZHENG YANJIU, No 10, 1991) Take Hunan as another example: in 1991, the extra revenue totalled 445,000 RMB, and of this, 130,000 RMB was from enterprise profits, which was only 29.9 percent, far lower than the rate for the same type of revenue in economically developed areas; the townships' united capital collection was 106,000 RMB, which was only 23.8 percent of the total. Fund raising of various kinds and contributions of money came to 80,000 RMB, which was 10 percent of the total; penalties of all kinds and confiscated income came to 80,000 RMB, which was 18 percent. The extra revenue structure in this town was very representative of the current situation in the undeveloped areas, that is, a low level of income, highly scattered resources, and enterprises which find it difficult to constitute a main revenue and expenditure entity. 2. Prerogative is characterized by the authorities using their powers to collect capital as they choose. But, a township government operates at one level of governmental power, and this kind of enforcement power of the authorities is often executed through direct or attached relationships, and is usually characterized by prerogative and subjectivity. As for township enterprises, because of a lot of these enterprises are run by collective investment, their property rights are very unclear, so that the township government then truly become the owner of enterprises, and leaders of the enterprises are appointed by government. Township governments take advantage of this special status and executive privilege, so they not only can establish the rate and standard of profits and administrative fees for enterprises to hand over as the governments will, the can also assign quotas and fund raising to enterprises. This also was the major reason why at present township extra revenue is the easiest to collect from township enterprises. Speaking of township united capital collections, township governments have collected this capital through village cooperative economic organs. Although the state has already fixed a certain rate and standard for this capital to prevent adding to the peasants' burden, it has been hard to restrain the actions of some township governments, while peasants have such strong dependence on township executive organs, which makes it hard to restrain either. Based on a nationwide rough estimate of rural economy supervision departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, the average peasant's cost for executive fees, all kinds of penalties, fund raising and quotas, etc., which are countable, amounted to 13.8 RMB in 1991, which was 2.5 percent of the average peasant's income. Reserves of directly assumed collections and united collective fees by peasants came to 29.2 RMB per peasant, which was 5.3 percent of last year's average per peasant income.(Footnote)(Cooperative Agricultural Economics Guidance Office of the Ministry of Agriculture: "Comprehensive Analysis of the Burden on China's Peasants" in: NONCUN HEZUO JINGJI, Supplementary Issue, 12 June 1992) Among the burdens listed above, in addition to those parts which were withdrawn, reserved by higher level departments or village committee, quite a substantial share became township extra revenue and expenditure. 3. Lack of continuity and stability in yearly and specific revenue projects. The reasons are: first, extra revenue is determined to a large degree by the profit situation of township enterprises. As the state cancels all kinds of favorable policies to develop township enterprises, enterprise development is facing increasingly fierce market competition, their advantages are steadily disappearing, so that within the scope of a township, enterprise profits are always unstable, which causes yearly fluctuations in extra revenue. Second, because extra revenue is often collected according to the demands of temporary expenditure, so there is a lack of continuity in specific income. 3. Functions and Uses of Township Revenue and Expenditure In the process of building a socialist market economic system, the rural township government is the basic authority organ of the state, and plays an absolutely essential role in developing the rural socialist market economy. International experience has proven that under market economy conditions, the following several functions must be assumed by government which represents public benefits. 1. The function of supplying public products and dealing with external effects. This function of government revenue and expenditure acts to rationally allocate resources between practical benefits and future benefits, individual benefits and societal benefits, in order to satisfy the greatest need for public benefits by the whole of society's members. 2. The distribution function. This function serves chiefly to guarantee fairness in income distribution to those members of society who are at the lowest living standard, especially under the conditions of a market economy operations system, to resolve the problem of unbalanced income distribution that is caused by this, reducing the gap between rich and poor; it also includes implementing protective policies for special industries such as agriculture, carrying out regional redistribution to reduce regional variations. 3. The function of stability. In this, the government maintains the employment level and price stability through its macroeconomic management of gross supply and demand, for example, such adjustments as the currency supply, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and tax rates, etc. to bring about stability in macroeconomic activity and social life. 4. The function of promoting economic growth. In developing countries, it directly drives economic development in developing areas by means of the government's investment action to compensate for the restrictions of such factors as a lack of essential capital and weak risk knowledge among the microeconomic main body. But, there are definite divisions of labor and emphasis placed on the aforementioned governmental functions by the central and local governments, and the various levels of local governments. Generally speaking, the stability function plays a lesser role in rural township government public revenue and expenditure. Speaking of the distribution function, in economically developed areas the peasant standard of living has improved considerably due to development of township enterprises. Although there certainly are income differences among farm families, the phenomenon of absolute poverty has been basically eradicated, and governments need to provide only a part of transferred expenditure for a few households which enjoy the five guarantees. In some towns where the collective economy is at a higher level of development, governments limit expansion of the gap between rich and poor through the united distribution policy inside the collective economy. The distribution function of township revenue and expenditure in areas of this sort is enacted chiefly through the policy of subsidizing agriculture by industry, to level the income gap inside the collective. In economically undeveloped areas, it relies chiefly on various kinds of relief money and poverty assistance funds from the state and higher levels of government to resolve the poverty of peasants. Township governments need not do this, nor do they have the ability to supply more transferred expenditure. Speaking of the stability function, only the central government can make adjustments in currency issuance, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, tax rates, etc.; it is impossible for local governments to be involved with these matters. But looking at the functions of supplying public products, dealing with external effects, and promoting economic growth, we see that local governments can grasp various kinds of information better, because residents in society's different regions place differing stresses on different public products, and make different selections as to type of economic and social development. Therefore, local governments can better supply public products and deal with external effects, so township government's effect in this regard especially has potential. Investigation of the current operational situation for China's rural township revenue and expenditure shows that extra revenue and expenditure play a very important role in supplying public products, dealing with external effect and promoting economic growth. At present, there are three major types of rural revenue expenditure: 1) expenditure for development, which chiefly includes investment in fundamental facilities, expenditures on investment to township enterprises, and on support for agricultural production; 2) expenditures on administrative matters, which mainly consists of operational and administrative fees for each department of township government; 3) expenditure on societal affairs, which chiefly include culture, education, health fees, social welfare, etc. In the scope of the above listed expenditures, extra revenue obviously differs in nature from budget revenue, so it shows its positive effect in township economic and social development. 1. In many towns, the distinct, constructive character of extra revenue and expenditure in supplying public products and dealing with external effects, makes it the main body of public investment. At present, among the first class township budget expenditures in rural China, fees for cultural, educational, and health affairs predominate, reaching more than 70 percent in many towns. But these expenditures are totally consumable, of consumption, going chiefly for population fees and daily costs, so it is necessary to use surplus capital on constructive investment. The situation is different for extra revenue and expenditure, where the rate of use on such capital construction as public facilities, etc., is higher. For example, in a certain town in Hunan Province, several million RMB were expended on establishment and enlargement of the township people's hospital's clinic building, bridges, etc. Other than a part of these projects which were aided by higher level departments, this was handled for the most part by township extra revenue. In 1988, a certain town in Dalian put ten million RMB into construction of a middle school, and most of its capital was provided by the township's own fund raising. At present, major public expenditures of township extra revenue include social service type investments such as school buildings, hospitals, etc., and construction of infrastructural facilities such as roads, bridges, telecommunications, etc. 2. Expenditure on productive construction. No matter whether in towns which are economically developed or undeveloped, budget revenue is rarely expended on township enterprises and agricultural production, but extra revenue has had a distinctly positive effect on promoting economic growth through its investment activities. This is effect is even more prominent in economically developed towns. For example, in 1991, among the extra expenditure of a Dalian suburb, direct investment on agriculture and industry was up 1.69 million RMB, which was 37.1 percent of the total extra expenditures; in 1991, a Guangzhou suburban town's invested 1.208 million RMB on township enterprises, which was 32.9 percent of the total extra expenditure. In many Chinese towns, because of the severe shortage and scattered nature of private capital, the peasants' strong emphasis on consumption and slight knowledge of risk investment, plus their being in a lower income situation, kept financial organs undeveloped and caused a serious shortage of productive investment in rural areas, which restricts economic development. Therefore, township government concentration on extra revenue for investment must play a role in strongly pushing local economic development, and this has already been proven by practice in some economically developed areas in China. 3. It plays an important role in supply public products concerned with establishing, maintaining and operating a new order. Since 1978, the state has added or strengthened organs related to economic activities, such as statistics, law enforcement, public security, technical quality supervision and service, township enterprises administration and resources management, etc. Among all these new organs and their increased staffing, a part of them were obviously consistent with the functions and work assignments of government bestowed on it by the new economic system. Among expenditure of this sort, extra revenue took on quite a bit. In 1991, in a certain town in Shaanxi Province, our investigation of organs and employees added since 1978 showed that among these newly added organs and employees, those employees who worked in the public products listed above and whose sphere was concerned with economic activities constituted 94 percent of the total of new employees. Newly added employees inside the state's budget occupied only 40 percent, 30 percent were budgeted by county revenue and expenditure, and the remaining 30 percent were borne by extra revenue and expenditure of township. In 1991's investigation of a town in a Guangzhou suburb showed that among organs newly added since 1978, except for the township party school and the township office of the national congress, all organs were related to economic administration, legal services, urban residents' life services, and administration functions. In this town, employees newly added since 1978 constituted 69 percent of all township cadres, and of these, cadres who were employed by township self collected capital occupied 44 percent of the total of newly added employees. Practical investigations in other, different type, areas (such as Dalian, Shandong, Beijing, Zhejiang and Shanghai, etc.) had similar results. 4. Conclusion 1. At present, there now are a great deal of problems with extra revenue and expenditures, including the common criticism that there is a lack of an efficient system of supervision and administration. This makes it easy to form a "small treasury" of township leaders, and produce a "breeding bed" of regulation violations. According to our understanding of relevant documents, since three major investigations were launched in 1985, analysis of the volume of money involved showed that 90 percent of the problems were related to this part of the capital. (Footnote)(Li Jinwen, et al.: "Reflections on Several Problems Related to Township Revenue and Expenditure," CAIZHENG YANJIU ZILIAO No 31, 1991). However, the aforementioned analysis showed that extra revenue and expenditure was the product of a contradiction between development of the market economy and the regressiveness of financial system reform. It has the characteristics of being productive, supplying public products and dealing with external effects, and plays an important role which cannot not be ignored in the process of developing local economic and social development; thus, we cannot simply add denials and restrictions to it. 2. As for the expenditure type of extra revenue, it is an important part of supplying external public products and dealing with external effects. Theoretically, local governments in different localities can determine their expenditure actions according to demand for public products in their own local areas, whatever is best for meeting the demand to deal with external effects, for meeting the people's needs, and for maximizing the public welfare of the residents of that local society. Especially if the concern is only with a relatively small area of towns, it is easier to do it. But, due to various shortcomings in the current Chinese administrative system, the short term actions of local grassroots level leaders, and some other factors, this has often led to governmental actions deviating from what is favorable to the members of their local society, twisting resources allocation, and adding to the peasants' burden. This, then, is a problem demanding conscientious study and resolution: how to supply public products and collect capital for dealing with external effects according to what is favorable to and capable of dealing with the burden on societal members. 3. Because most rural township enterprises have strong attachments to the rural community executive organs in China, they lack the power to restrict government activities, which causes extra revenue and expenditure to be quite unstable and subject to whim. Under the conditions of limited rural domestic income and average income level, if re-allocation to enterprises and peasants after they have handed over taxes to the state is done at will, it must have unfavorable effects on the economic activities of enterprises and peasants, and ultimately lead to a reduction in revenue a weakening of the revenue function. One of the options for improving this situation is to convert a part of the extra revenue and expenditure projects into local taxes, regulate it through legal means, and allow it to be budgeted by local governments.
