FR941007-0-00071 FR941007-0-00019 48 CFR Parts 209, 225, and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Award to Foreign Controlled Contractors AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement a statutory prohibition against award of a DoD contract under a national security program to an entity controlled by a foreign government. DATES: Effective date: September 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Michele Peterson, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This amends and finalizes an interim rule published as Item VII of DAC 91&hyph;5, at 58 FR 28458, on May 13, 1993, that implemented 10 U.S.C. 2536. 10 U.S.C. 2536 prohibits award of a DoD contract under a national security program to an entity controlled by a foreign government, if access to proscribed information is required to perform the contract. Section 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) amended 10 U.S.C. 2536 by revising the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' to exclude organizations and corporations that are owned, but are not controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a foreign government if the ownership of the organization or corporation by the foreign government was effective before October 23, 1992. This final rule differs from the interim rule in that it (1) revises the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' as required by Section 842 of Public Law 103&hyph;160; (2) revises the definition of ``effectively owned or controlled'' for clarity; (3) revises the definition of ``foreign government'' for consistency with the regulations of the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control at 31 CFR Ch. V; and (4) contains minor clarifying revisions. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of Defense certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because the rule only applies to a small number of contracts and companies. No comments were received on the impact of this rule on small entities during the public comment period. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. The information collection requirement in this final rule is approved through December 31, 1996, under OMB Control Number 0704&hyph;0353.
