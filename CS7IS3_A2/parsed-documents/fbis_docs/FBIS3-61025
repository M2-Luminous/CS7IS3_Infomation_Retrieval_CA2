Sharnauskas: "Aviation Command and Control in Combined-Arms (Operations)"] [Text] Army Aviation is rightfully considered the most mobile arm of the Ground Troops and moreover possesses a high fighting strength. In the hands of a skilled commander, it can significantly influence the course of combat operations. The experience of combat and operational training of troops and staffs indicates that due to low effectiveness of command and control, in most cases its capabilities are only half realized. By command and control we mean the purposeful activities of commanders and staffs to maintain combat readiness of aviation units (subunits) of the Ground Troops, preparing them for a battle (operation), and leading them when performing assigned missions. Its organizational and technical basis is a command and control system which today is viewed as a command and control subsystem of the Ground Troops. A close analysis makes it possible to talk about the existence of serious problems in the structural and functional configuration of command and control bodies and facilities if Ground Troops aviation does not conform their capabilities to modern conditions. For example, in questions of efficiency and quality of command and control, requirements today are being satisfied at less than two-thirds the optimal level. In our view, this situation is largely explained by the fact that at the front-regiment echelon, two independent systems of control posts exist to this day: Ground Troops aviation and Front Air Army [FAA] aviation. Elements of the first are: In the front--front aviation command posts [KP]; in army-level formations--army command posts. Each includes tactical control groups [TCG], a vectoring and target designation post [VTDP], and a forward air controller control post [FAC CP]. It should be emphasized that the control posts of Ground Troops aviation are a component part of command posts of combined-arms formations. Command and control of frontal aviation large units and units is accomplished, as before, through the FAA KP and the FAA tactical control center [TCC], which today also include their own VTDP, TCG, and FAC. Thus, the timeliness of receiving (transmitting) information is decreased, and it is more difficult to organize and maintain coordination not only between air components but also with ground units. What is more, centralized planning of combat employment of aviation is disrupted. The second problem I would like to touch upon is equally timely and concerns equipping control posts of Ground Troops aviation with communications and automation equipment. Unfortunately, the existing equipment does not provide the necessary efficiency, and the capabilities for processing, storing, and transmitting information to interested echelons are insufficient. There is virtually no system of information and operational-tactical computational tasks. Thus, communications equipment at the army-division echelon provides high speed in the telegraph and telecode mode at 50-75 bits per second, time stability, and information reliability of 10<sup> -2</sup> ...10<sup> -3</sup> . Is it not a paradox that at the regiment-battalion level, the forward air controller is deprived of equipment for communications with combined-arms subunits, precisely in whose interests aviation is performing missions! The radio allocated to the forward air control for communicating with helicopters (aircraft) has a limited operating range and is not resistant to jamming. This fact makes it extremely difficult to organize coordination of aviation with ground units (subunits) and does not meet the requirements of security of joint combat operations. The situation is no better with command and control bodies and facilities being equipped with automation equipment. The "Manevr" automated command and control system (front-regiment) includes only the aviation combat control group MP-23 command and staff vehicle; other levels of the Ground Troops command and control system do not have them. Unclear differentiation of the functions of command and control bodies and facilities of Ground Troops aviation and front air army aviation, and incomplete definition of the duties of control post officials in organizing combat employment of aviation and command and control of it during an operation (combat), also have a negative effect on aviation command and control. Incidentally, similar problems also had to be solved by U.S. Army command authorities in the early 1980's when army aviation was made an independent combat arm. Over the course of several years, three interrelated levels were created in the U.S. Army Aviation command and control system: Command, coordination of operations in the airspace, and air traffic control. The Army Corps [AC] Combat Operations Control Center [COCC] has army aviation squads from the operations office of the corps headquarters and an airspace operations coordination team. The division COCC includes an airspace operations coordination group [AOCG]. Combat support groups (which organize coordination with army aviation) and a brigade staff aviation officer, coordinating operations in the airspace over the combat operations area, are located at the brigade command post. The coordination group is formed when the antitank helicopter battalion is transferred to the operational subordination of the combined-arms brigade. At the battalion's command post are a fire support coordination officer and a staff representative of the motorized rifle battalion (tank battalion). The composition of the COCC and AOCG includes an air defense officer, tactical and army aviation officers, a field artillery officer, an electronic warfare [EW] officer, an air traffic control officer, and also support personnel, who all together participate in organizing and accomplishing coordination. To increase the effectiveness of command and control, army aviation created its own ATMAC automated control system (similar to the 485L tactical aviation automated control system). In the future it is planned to equip tactical and army aviation aircraft and helicopters with a new system for determining the location of troops, installations, and communications--the PLRS/JTIDS, which will enable airborne objects to determine their location with an accuracy of up to 25 meters and to exchange information in the data transmission mode using the automated control system. (There is virtually continuous coordination with the control post of the Ground Troops and even with individual objects--tanks, self-propelled artillery mounts, surface-to-air missile systems, self-propelled antiaircraft guns, infantry fighting vehicles, and so forth). It seems that it is also time for our army aviation to determine the directions of improving the command and control system. These directions are seen as conducting a set of measures of a military scientific, technical, and structural nature aimed primarily at increasing the functioning effectiveness of the aviation control post system of the Ground Troops. In the author's opinion, it is necessary to reorganize the system of command and control bodies and aviation control posts of the Ground Troops. In particular, it makes sense to make wider use of the modular principle of building the control posts. The primary module in a motorized rifle (tank) regiment may be an aviation control team [ACT] made up of 4-5 people (ACT chief; coordination officer; officer for collection, processing, and analysis of information on the air and ground situation; and 1-2 guidance and target designation officers). In a division (brigade) it is desirable to create an aviation control group [ACG] of 18-20 people. Several independent groups can be assigned from it, each of which would include a position for a tactical control officer [TCO] of the front air army operations group. The ACG must be equipped with a radar with an operating range of up to 40 km. In a combined-arms formation (army corps, army) it is advisable to have an aviation control center [ACC] with 30-36 people, in which a front air army operations group [OG] also works. For increasing the timeliness and quality of aviation command and control, closer coordination with Ground Troops units, and centralized command and control of weapons of the combat arms, it is necessary to locate all the above aviation command and control bodies together with the control posts of the missile troops and artillery, air defense, and electronic combat. It is also necessary to form a main Combat Operations Control Center [MCOCC] at a front, a Combat Operations Control Center [COCC] at a combined-arms (tank) army, a Combat Operations Control Group [COCG] at a division (brigade), and a Combat Operations Control Team [COCT] at a regiment. A structural model of the proposed system of aviation control posts is shown in the diagram. Structural Model of Proposed System of Aviation Control Posts </graphic> Aviation tactical control complexes [ATCC] can make a significant contribution to increasing the effectiveness of command and control of aviation in a battle and operation. Equipping them with advanced communications and data transmission equipment will ensure complete technical compatibility of the ATCC with aviation ground control posts of the Ground Troops deployed on the base of the "Manevr" automated command and control system and its effective use in the interests of both organic and supporting aviation. In addition, for vectoring helicopters to ground and airborne targets, it makes sense to install a special radar on the ATCC's, which would provide an information field for command and control of combat formations of Ground Troops aviation in the zone of operations of the combined-arms formation. Use of the ATCC could ensure not only detection of enemy offensive air weapons but also reconnaissance of moving ground targets. Practical implementation of the proposals outlined above, in the author's opinion, would make it possible to reach a modern level of command and control of Ground Troops aviation and would ensure maximum realization of the combat capabilities of units and subunits. In conclusion, let us emphasize this thought. In our time, command and control, including of forces and assets of Ground Troops aviation, is becoming perhaps just as important a factor of success as the number of troops (forces) and weapons, and the correlation of command and control capabilities of the opposing sides often decides the outcome of a battle.
