The Board of Governors' meeting of the IAEA on June 10 demanded opening of our military sites on the pretext of the nuclear issue and adopted an extremely unreasonable "resolution" on the "suspension of the agency's assistance" to our country. This is obviously the agency's "sanctions" against us and, in essence, a prelude to UN "sanctions". With the adoption of the "resolution" the plot of the United States and some quarters of the agency's Secretariat to isolate and stifle our Republic on the pretext of "a solution to the nuclear issue" has at last entered into a reckless stage of practice. As is known, we have made every possible well-intentioned effort to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities even in our unique status. However, as we have accepted more inspections by the agency, pressure on us has increased and things have got all the more complicated, and the security and sovereignty of our Republic now are exposed to threat hourly. Some quarters of the agency's Secretariat have escalated their moves to stifle our Republic, ignoring all our good intentions and leniency, and finally brought the situation to such an extent where they took "sanctions" this time. In this the United States and the IAEA Secretariat openly revealed their attempt to encroach upon our sovereignty and stifle us by using the leverage of inspection. The conclusion at which we have arrived today when some quarters of the agency's Secretariat have chosen an undisguised exercise of strong arm is that pressure on us increases and our peaceful nuclear activities hit a bigger snag while we are bound to the unfair framework of the agency. Ours is not the sort of people who reconcile themselves to humiliation even with their national sovereignty and dignity violated. That the Secretariat of the agency tried to impose its total inspection on us by threatening us with "sanctions" is an intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as what keeps them alive. When pressure and "sanctions" are imposed on us, our will grows stronger and our peaceful nuclear activities become all the more free. In face of the folly of the IAEA which has taken unreasonable "sanctions" against us and, moreover, is attempting to intrude even into our military sites, the DPRK Foreign Ministry has been authorized to declare as follows: Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" adopted by the agency with regard to our issue up until now and will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency hereafter. Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities. Secondly, we declare that the inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed. Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed till it has been decided whether we return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or completely withdraw from it. Hence, the agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do any further in our country. Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that UN "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible. It is our inevitable option to counter expanded "sanctions" by hostile forces with expanded self-defence measures. This stand of ours will never change until our nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation. We will keenly watch the development of the situation in the days ahead.
