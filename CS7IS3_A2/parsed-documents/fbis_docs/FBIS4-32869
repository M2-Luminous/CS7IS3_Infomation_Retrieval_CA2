He was murdered by more than 15 machine-gun bullets in Colegio District, in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The PM major was in his car and was attacked when he stopped at a traffic light. According to Lieutenant Colonel Paulo Cunha, commander of the 9th BPM, the major had found a witness who could prove he was not guilty of the charges being pressed against him and also had discovered that his name had been unduly included on the list. The courts on 24 May ordered that six of the eight numbers game kingpins serving their sentences in the Vieira Ferreira Neto Institute Penitentiary be transferred to another jail. The decision resulted from irregularities that had occurred at the institute, where the criminals continued to control the irregular game via the phone. The six criminals will be sent to three different penitentiaries.
