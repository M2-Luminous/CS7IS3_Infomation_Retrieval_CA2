Alfonso on migration policy, entitled: "Open or Closed Doors." Following are some of its most important aspects. Stating that migration laws are customary, and more than that, necessary in any contemporary state, she notes that these laws vary according to political, economic, social, military, and other interests, and that Cuba is no exception to these general conditions. Carmen Alfonso states in her analysis that our case cannot be ignored when analyzing the migration issue and its complexity within the Cuban-U.S. conflict, taking into account that a large number of Cubans have traditionally migrated to the United States because of its geographic proximity and economic development. In addition to those who travel to other nations for work or for other official reasons, there are also those who travel for personal reasons. Among them, we can mention three categories: those who wish to leave and return; those who definitely want to reside in another country; and those who request residence authorization abroad. At present, temporary leave is authorized for those over 20 years of age, although men up to the age of 26 or 27 years old who wish to reside abroad must first fulfill their military obligation. Minors under 18 must be authorized by one of their parents. It is appropriate to mention that last year, Cuba authorized temporary leave for 100,000 people, but only 40,000 managed to leave the country because the others had their requests denied, usually by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. There are also conditions for Cubans who already left the country. Those who left before 1959 must use the consulate of the country in which they are residing, and those who left after 1959 also have the chance to return to their native country through various programs devised for that purpose. However, U.S. Immigration policy toward Cuba has an essentially political nature, which justifies the exceptionally privileged treatment of Cuban immigrants, especially those who violate the laws that are in effect in our country. Nevertheless, an agreement signed in 1984 provides for the annual granting of up to 20,000 visas for those who wish to live in the United States. But the failure of the U.S. to fulfill this agreement has been notorious. Paradoxically, the TRABAJADORES article notes, risky, illegal departure is facilitated without exception or restriction of the number of immigrants.
