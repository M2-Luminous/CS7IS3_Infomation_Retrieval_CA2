After an attempt to regain power which soon proved abortive, Mutalibov left the republic on board a military aircraft and has not gone back to this day. On 17 June 1993, as a result of an armed rebellion raised in Ganja by Colonel Suret Guseynov, the newly elected Azerbaijani President Abulfaz Elchibey was forced to leave Baku secretly and return to his home village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, where he still is. On 3 October 1993, by a nationwide vote, Geydar Aliyev came to power in Azerbaijan, and he is presently exercising the powers of head of state. All three consider themselves the legitimate president. All three lay claim to the role of father of the nation. Each of the three has his own view of the situation in the republic and his own action program. I recently met with all three. Audiences In Moscow: I was helped to find Ayaz Mutalibov, who lives "somewhere near Moscow," by better informed colleagues. Secret contacts came into play, invisible threads were pulled, and soon, on the strength of a pledge to report the planned interview without bias, I was instructed to stay by the telephone for the next 15 minutes. Mutalibov himself called. He said he was willing to meet, and dictated the address, on the condition that it was not to be handed over to anyone else. Half an hour later I found myself in a spacious, well-appointed, pleasantly furnished apartment almost in the center of Moscow, where, according to Mutalibov, relatives of his live and where he periodically meets with people he wants to see. So I too was unable to visit the dacha near Moscow which a businessman friend has rented for Mutalibov. The ex-president, his wife, and their son and his family have found shelter at that dacha for nearly two years now. The out-of-town house, whose whereabouts are known only to a very narrow circle, can probably be regarded as a place of political asylum too, since a criminal charge still stands against Mutalibov for failing, as president, to prevent the seizure and destruction by Armenian gunmen of the Azerbaijani city of Khodzhaly. "Aliyev says I could go back to the republic as an ordinary citizen and live there freely, unoppressed. That is not true. As soon as I turn up in Baku they will promptly arrest me." We each drank a glass of Azerbaijani "Goy Gel" cognac and ate a slice of bread with black caviar, ignoring for the time being the expensive candies, nuts, and fruit. Then I gestured interrogatively toward the dictaphone, and my host nodded: "Switch it on." In Keleki: Barely had the plane from Baku, arriving in Nakhichevan eight hours late, come to a halt on the tarmac, when I was intercepted at a passport check right there on the ramp. Having been escorted to the chief of the commandant's office, I was immediately subjected to questioning: Why had I come? To see whom? My newspaper accreditation only heightened this vigilant interest, as the Baku organizers of my meeting with Elchibey had warned me beforehand: Press attention toward the disgraced ex-president is not encouraged by the authorities; better keep quiet about who it is you have come to see, or else they will send you straight back on the same flight. Having taken these instructions on board, I spoke very vaguely about the purpose of my visit, and as soon as they let me go, I made my way to the People's Front headquarters within 20 minutes; from there Elchibey's comrades delivered me to the rayon center of Ordubad. There in Ordubad, in the building of the former KGB rayon directorate, is the stronghold of the ex-president's bodyguard, with two armored carriers in the yard and, on duty around the clock, unshaven men in camouflage uniform carrying automatic weapons. In the guardroom, no bigger than a lobby, I counted eight portraits of Elchibey, next to an "iconostasis" lovingly arranged on a wall made of empty cigarette cartons. As night approached, in pitch darkness, we left for Keleki. Five people were crammed into a fully equipped UAZ jeep, including a man with an automatic weapon who hid under a tarpaulin. Three times there suddenly emerged from the gloom along the way a trailer perched on the roadside or some other kind of checkpoint, from which armed men sprang out, barring our vehicle's path. They demanded the password, asked who was being transported and what for, and, satisfied with a brief report, withdrew into the darkness. The residence of Mr. President (I was instructed to address my lofty interviewee as that, and nothing else) turned out to be a village building apparently intended for public use, some kind of club or office -- frankly I could not make it out properly, because there was not a glimmer of light around it; the blockade.... Here, I was told, the president works from very early morning until late at night (by the light produced by a small generator, or a kerosene lamp), receiving the information he needs by telephone, and also "from other sources." Nobody specified exactly what sources, but it was said that regular visits are made to Keleki by a few former staffers of the presidential apparatus who have remained loyal to Elchibey, retired ministers, and certain members of the Azerbaijani parliament. Moreover it was stressed particularly that the "legitimate president of Azerbaijan in exile" maintains contact, as is proper, with foreign diplomats and statesmen. Apart from numerous relatives, Elchibey has with him in Keleki his wife and two school-age children. I was instructed to present for inspection the bag holding my journalist's equipment. Then the chief bodyguard searched my pockets and the folds of my clothing with his own hands. Finally the audience took place. Abulfaz Elchibey sat at a desk on whose smooth surface not a single object was to be seen except for the telephone and an ashtray. The entire expanse of wall behind my host's back was occupied by a map of Azerbaijan, and next to it the state flag of the republic was hoisted. "I am pursuing a course of resisting the rebel power," Elchibey said, in his native language, from which he never once departed in a 90-minute talk simultaneously interpreted by an aide. In Baku: At about two o'clock in the morning, the head of the press service cut short my wait: "The president will be working for another hour or hour-and-a-half, he sends his apologies." This could also be taken to mean that, at least until the time indicated, the state secretary, prime minister, head of parliament, ministers, and leaders of all the services of the president's apparatus also would not leave their offices. This work schedule was usual for Aliyev while he was, for 14 years, at the head of the republic, and it resumed when he returned to power. Be that as it may, at the second attempt I was admitted to the official presidential apartments, which -- unlike Mutalibov's and Elchibey's surroundings -- I consider it superfluous to describe. "I don't give interviews," Aliyev said, after a firm handshake, "I don't have the time." That was how our two-hour talk began.... Now, having, by means of a newspaper device, placed the holder of real power on the same footing as two political recluses who have lost that power at the whim of dramatic circumstances, I am clearly not safe from objections on the part of Geydar Aliyev, whose status is undeniably not to be compared with the status of Ayaz Mutalibov or Abulfaz Elchibey, who, although they consider themselves presidents, are free of the burden of state decisions and the responsibility for them. This difference in the positions of three well-known Azerbaijani politicians, whose judgments and opinions, by creating a stereoscopic effect, help us to approach a calm, unbiased understanding of what is happening in the republic -- this crucial difference should, I urge you, be kept in mind hereafter. By Wartime Laws On 2 November Geydar Aliyev addressed the people, presenting a detailed explanation of the reasons for the heavy defeats in the war, and called on citizens "to defend Azerbaijan from aggression by Armenian armed forces." Three and a half weeks later the republic National Assembly tightened up -- with the stipulation "for the duration of the war" -- the operation of a number of articles of the Criminal Code. Henceforth, evasion of the military draft carries the threat of five to eight years' imprisonment. For evasion of mobilization, a prison term of seven to 10 years is stipulated, or 10-15 years where there are aggravating circumstances. For absence without leave from a military unit at the front, there is 10-15 years' imprisonment, or even the death penalty. Those are the wartime laws adopted by the Azerbaijani parliament and approved, according to December's figures, by one out of every two people polled by the sociological group of the republic State Committee for Statistics. The warring Azerbaijani clans and groupings build their relations by these same laws, having thoroughly grasped, for instance, this law: that a defeat in war is a defeat in politics. So does that mean that losses and casualties at the front would suit some people in the republic? A. Mutalibov: "I would give a straight answer if I had the facts available, but in any event nobody in Azerbaijan will be surprised by this question. A power struggle is going on. And some people will stop at nothing in this struggle." G. Aliyev: "We are constantly observing a desire on the part of some political forces to reap benefits for themselves from our military defeats. These forces -- first and foremost People's Front forces -- are engaged in carrying out provocations in the Army, going out to rayons close to the front line and intimidating the population.... These forces have especially tried to create the conditions for the seizure of Azerbaijani rayons by the aggressors. We have information that these forces, as the main culprits to blame for the situation in which Azerbaijan now finds itself, wish to regain lost positions and wreak revenge...." A. Elchibey: "I categorically reject such accusations against the People's Front. Geydar Aliyev is distorting the truth, to put it mildly. He must know that it was when we were in power that international efforts to settle the conflict became more active and the UN Security Council resolution providing for, in particular, the withdrawal of Armenian troops from Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, was adopted. Incidentally, this was the only rayon captured during my leadership of the republic. Whereas under Aliyev six rayons have already been occupied, and it is clear to everybody that the new authorities are unable to ensure the country's defense and incapable of crating a strong, professional army." As of today 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is under occupation. The country has 1.2 million refugees, providing for whom has already cost the republic budget 5 billion rubles, whereas several times this amount is required. Refugees are not given jobs. They are not paid benefits and pensions on time. Concentrations of refugees have unprecedented disease and death rates. As yet the new authorities have come up with very few successful ways to ease the fate of these unfortunates, unless you count the option suggested by the newspaper AZERBAIJAN, which is more than respectful to the president: "Guest houses, schools, and hostels do not need to be emptied to house refugees. The coziest refuge for a million refugees is Geydar Aliyev's heart." G. Aliyev: "I consider that every family in Baku and other cities and rayons could take a refugee family. This would be very charitable. Some people have enormous houses and big apartments. Let each one of them house a refugee family. For my part, I recently instructed the Cabinet to take additional measures." A. Mutalibov: "No measures will be of any help so long as the Karabakh map is a bargaining chip in the political game being played by the Azerbaijani clans, groupings, and individuals waging a bitter power struggle." Reforms by Installments A Baku black marketeer, who responded with alacrity to my request to be driven to Government House, explained to me his interpretation of the difference between the previous and the present authorities: "A year ago a traffic cop would sting you for 50 manats, whereas now the going rate is at least a thousand." This has nothing to do with the change of authorities, of course. The scale of graft is also about the same as it was. It's just that the scale of prices is now different: inflation.... It has reached a rate of 40 percent a month. At the end of November bread and gasoline prices were raised 750 percent by presidential edict. In response to a question from sociologists "how do you react to this," 29.2 percent of those polled answered: "Negatively -- the edict will have no effect in terms of stabilizing the economy." G. Aliyev: "Prices for the most important products should have been regulated at the right time, considerably earlier than a year ago. Rather than people engaging in populism. Azerbaijan has close economic and simply human links with neighboring states. The difference in prices between here and there had a painful impact on our already crisis-ridden economy, which, furthermore, is largely geared to defense. Measures had to be taken." Only after bread in Azerbaijan started costing 22 manats (220 rubles) did the waiting lines for it diminish appreciably, but they have not yet disappeared. There are no waiting lines for meat, but it is rationed in the state trading network. As are sugar and butter. Admittedly "August" butter was only distributed in December, and there has been no meat since July. The consumer shopping basket costs 6,000 manats as against an average wage of 2,500. A. Elchibey: "The whole point is that following the insurrection and my removal from power the National Assembly did not adopt a single law opening the way to market reforms. My edicts on privatization and the development of enterprise went unfulfilled; they were removed from circulation, as it were. At the same time uncontrolled privatization is steaming ahead. Mafia clans originating, as a rule, in the former party nomenklatura are getting their hands on plants and factories in exchange for big bribes.... Corruption has assumed a catastrophic scale." A. Mutalibov: "Elchibey hoped that, severing ties with Russia and other neighbors, Azerbaijan would resolve its economic tasks by means of radical reforms. But this is impossible. Market reforms must be implemented simultaneously in all the countries of the former Union; it impossible to destroy what are virtually centuries-old economic links and break everything up at a stroke. I am a supporter of gradual and cautious entry into the market. Although I believe that the state hat which the republic's enterprises are currently forced to wear is preventing them from developing freely. This is the other, equally destructive extreme." G. Aliyev: "Who is preventing, and whom? I even banned MVD and Prosecutor's Office organs from checking the financial and economic activity of state and commercial enterprises. Henceforth such checks will be carried out only by the tax inspectorate. I repeat: Our point of reference is a market economy, a combination and interaction of various forms of ownership. In the very near future parliament will again examine the question of privatization...." According to data from a poll conducted by the "Mirror" ["Zerkalo"] republic newspaper, 70 percent of Azerbaijan's highest-profile entrepreneurs regard present conditions here as unconducive to private business. And to the question "How do you assess the prospects" 62 percent answered: "They will develop, but slowly." Here 48 out of the 50 people polled said that the decisive condition for the development or, conversely, the diminution of enterprise is the government's attitude to it. And they were practically all agreed that one of the main obstacles to the free and civilized development of private business is the corruption among state officials, who are continuing to struggle for power and spheres of influence. The nature of this struggle is evidenced, in part, by the fact that two-thirds of the entrepreneurs only agreed to participate in the study after being firmly assured that the poll would be anonymous. In the Open and Behind the Scenes Political skirmishes in Azerbaijan continue to take place in the open and behind the scenes. But now there is less shooting. The opposition, whose ranks contain several parties of varying degrees of radicalism, is not reticent. The front-runners here are the People's Front, whose chairman is still Abdulfaz Elchibey, and the "Musavat" party, headed by former parliament speaker Isa Kambarov. Both organizations regard Elchibey as the lawful president and Geydar Aliyev as an inveterate political intriguer who seized power through an insurgence. In Isa Kambarov's view, Aliyev "is trying to govern an independent state using the same methods he used to govern a former Soviet republic." The "Musavat" party chairman also believes that, by refusing cooperation with any influential political force and relying solely on the apparatus, Aliyev is narrowing his social base and risks losing power within a few months if the round of military defeats continues. G. Aliyev: "I am open to cooperation with all political forces. But you see what happens.... I offered National Independence Party Chairman Etibar Mamedov a choice of four state posts, particularly the post of foreign minister. He refused. Meanwhile there are representatives of various parties working successfully in the government, including people with a People's Front background.... Recently I held a meeting with party and movement leaders. Everybody came except representatives of the National Front, while the 'Musavat' party sent an observer as if we were having a meeting of some kind of official international body. This is all a joke...." A. Elchibey: "How can you talk about any kind of cooperation with these authorities when human rights are being trampled underfoot. First a citizen is handcuffed right in the parliament chamber, then a few days later the question of stripping him of his deputy's immunity is raised. That was how National Assembly Chairman Isa Kambarov was arrested; that was how former republic General Prosecutor Ikhtiyar Shirinov was taken into custody.... Former Defense Minister Ragim Kaziyev was arrested and accused of corruption; former First Deputy Minister of National Security Sulkhetdin Akperov is behind bars.... There are currently around 40 political detainees in Azerbaijan." G. Aliyev: "I don't know how many. This is criminal activity, not politics." This -- if not more so -- is the pitch at which the confrontation at the top in Azerbaijan goes on, out of sight of the public at large. By carrying out a ruthless purge of the government and the presidential apparatus Geydar Aliyev strengthened his power by precisely the same extent as he undermined it by squeezing out his rancorous opponents in the shape of the vice premiers, power ministers, and other state officials put into retirement or into the dock, each of whom is backed by influential clans and groupings. But the main source of discomfort for Aliyev, of course, is Suret Guseynov, the rebel colonel who successfully swapped his combat enthusiasm for the premiership in June. The new cabinet head's incompetence seems to be obvious to everyone in the republic, from State Secretary Lala Gadzhiyeva, who asked me not to ask her questions about Guseynov, to a semi-literate peasant tea-picker. G. Aliyev: "He was appointed following a proposal from me and is working." This was the briefest presidential answer during our interview. A. Elchibey: "Aliyev cannot remove Guseynov yet. That would mean admitting that what happened in Ganja was nothing but an insurrection -- that is, Aliyev obtained power from a rebel and them formalized it via a nationwide vote. Guseynov, on the other hand, is a puppet figure. He contents himself with his lofty title without having real influence. The ministers of defense, national security, and internal affairs are subordinate to the Defense Council, which is headed by Aliyev. He controls all the key posts in the government. Aliyev and his people will never concede anything to us. They will fight to the last drop of power." "Who Else?" This is the general feeling. No matter who I spoke with anywhere in Azerbaijan (state officials and politicians aside), they almost all said the same thing: If not Geydar, who else will help us? They trust him. Or rather, they trust in him. This desperate, maybe last-chance faith in a political messiah, a politician who will bring them salvation from the universal trials and tribulations, is already close to religious in some respects. To the question "who do you trust in the current crisis situation?" 77.8 percent of participants in a December poll answered: "Azerbaijan President G. Aliyev." He has to his credit: entry into the CIS, the restoration and strengthening of relations with Russia, the initiation of contacts with Iran and France, first successes in building a national army, the stopping of the separatist movement in the south of the republic, and the relative stabilization of the sociopolitical situation. On the debit side there are the six occupied rayons. Nobody here would be forgiven that number of defeats. For the time being Aliyev is being forgiven. A. Mutalibov: "He is undoubtedly a highly experienced politician capable of skillfully controlling people and therefore the country. So when I became leader of the country I did not obstruct his return from Moscow and reacted calmly to his decision to return to politics. Unfortunately, counter to expectations, our relationship did not develop, in my view because of some of his past opponents, who managed to come between us...." The people's trust in whoever is national leader is not boundless, however. At the presidential elections Abulfaz Elchibey obtained 59 percent of the vote, but last fall 98 percent of those who participated in the referendum gave him a vote of no confidence. Barely a year had passed! Disillusionment with democracy? A reversion to type, to the old pattern of life? Neither. In Aliyev Azerbaijan sees not a former member of Brezhnev's Politburo but first and foremost a highly experienced politician, a ruthless pragmatist, and a competent administrator. In Azerbaijan, Russia, and other republics which survived the disintegration of the USSR people today are less and less interested in ideological labels. They are less and less interested in the color of the flag and more and more interested in bread prices, the size of wages or pensions, and guarantees of peace and tranquility. And there is increasing revulsion everywhere to a power struggle for its own sake, irrespective of who is involved or under what slogans. The experience of our troubled times brooks no delusion about the speed with which the last drop of power becomes far from the first drop of blood.
