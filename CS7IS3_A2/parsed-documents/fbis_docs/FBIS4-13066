FBIS4-13066 "drnes074dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas, Fatah Heads in Gaza Discuss Cooperation Hamas, Fatah Heads in Gaza Discuss Cooperation Fatah Official: `No Cooperation on Terror' TA1704093294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0705 GMT 17 Apr 94 TA1704093294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "prominent Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip," by Shalom Oren, place not given; from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live] [Text] [Oren] We heard this morning that Hamas considers cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on continued terror attacks inside the Green Line boundaries. What did you reply? [Abu-Zayidah] I believe there was nothing new in this morning's report by Moti Amir. That is, no new situation was created today which did not exist a week, a month, or a year ago. [Oren] The recent attacks inside Israel, however, do create a new situation. [Abu-Zayidah] I am speaking about our negotiations with Hamas, not about the location of terror attacks. We hold constant discussions in a bid to preserve the peace process, as Palestinians, as PLO members. [Oren] What do you tell them when the say: We will cooperate only if we are allowed to go on with terror attacks in return? [Abu-Zayidah] Obviously, there are serious differences between us and Hamas regarding the road we should take. We have covered quite a distance on the road to peace, the peace process. They do not believe in this way, and it is no secret; everybody knows this. There is no argument in which they say: You cooperate with us on terror, and we will cooperate in the negotiations. This is self evident. They have their way and we have ours. [Oren] How, then, do the two organizations -- one of which wants peace and the other does not -- negotiate? [Abu-Zayidah] There are many things we discuss. For example, both parties are not interested in a head-on collision between the two on the ground. Naturally, we both seek to prevent a civil war in the strip. We share an interest on this issue. Another example concerns the future of the process: Soon there will be a Palestinian rule here -- this is a fact! Knowing this, they know they will have to go along with the new situation, and discuss their incorporation in it. [Oren] When autonomy is set up and there is a Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, what will you do if, God forbid, terror acts are perpetrated inside the Green Line? [Abu-Zayidah] As Palestinian members of the PLO, we will do whatever is required. We will implement and observe every agreement we sign. [Oren] Will you arrest Hamas members when required? [Abu-Zayidah] We will have our laws and it is clear that Hamas and PLO members will be arrested if they violate them. Anyone who violates the law will put himself in jeopardy. This is the way it is being done in every organized state, although we do not have a state yet. We will have our rule, which is clear, and it will have its own laws, and the citizens will have to observe the laws. [Oren] But there is cooperation between Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [Abu-Zayidah] On what, for example? [Oren] For example, speaking on the anniversary of the death of Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir], Muhsayn Abu-al-Ata, a Hamas leader, spoke about such cooperation. [Abu-Zayidah] Look, there are no taxes on words, as you say. Let me tell you -- there is no cooperation on terror. We know that the terror attacks aim at damaging the peace process. How can we cooperate with this? We will, for example, cooperate on education. [Oren] Do you have any bargaining chips with Hamas? We know that Hamas receives aid from Jordan while Fatah has financial problems. Hamas has arms, while Fatah handed over some of its weapons to the Army. [Abu-Zayidah] You bet we have. We will be in charge. We will have a police force, money that we have, and money we are yet to receive. The rules of the games will change. [Oren] What is your reaction to the report that Hamas is making cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on the continuation of attacks inside the Green Line? Do you absolutely reject this? [Abu-Zayidah] We are not only rejecting this, we do not allow them to even say this. This request means sabotaging the peace process. Do you believe we will commit suicide? It is impossible. Anyone who thinks this way is insane. Believe me, they have never raised this condition. [Oren] Do you deny that they did? [Abu-Zayidah] They did not raise this. They cannot raise this. They know our policy.
