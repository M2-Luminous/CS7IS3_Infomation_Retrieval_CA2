This was apparently a bid to stop soldiers from the Makoanyane barracks from coming into town. It was soldiers from Makoanyane who held four cabinet ministers hostage on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Sello Metsi Baholo was shot dead in a bid by soldiers from a section of Lesotho's Army to storm his house, Mr Sarutla said. Automatic rifle fire was heard from the hill early Friday morning, but Maseru was otherwise calm and residents appeared to be going about normal business. Prime Minister Itsu Mokhehle was scheduled to address Lesotho's Parliament and Senate on Friday morning. Mr Sarutla said Thursday's killing and kidnapping could be an attempt to separate the prime minister from his cabinet and so render him ineffective. He said Lesotho's one year-old government under the Basotho Congress Party was still looking for clarity on long-standing pay demands from the military, but was determined not to give soldiers any increases above those received by other civil servants.
