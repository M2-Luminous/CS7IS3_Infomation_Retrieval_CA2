Following a lengthy discussion, the House decided to devote its session on Wednesday to the government's food and medicine policy. [passage omitted] Answering a question by Deputy Bassam al-'Umush, Tourism and Antiquities Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Affash al-'Adwan denied what was reported by some newspapers that there are tourist activities between Jordan and Israel in the Petra area and that companies are arranging such matters. The minister said: These allegations are baseless. He said that there are no contacts at all with the Israelis in this regard and no companies are arranging for this. Deputy Bassam al-'Umush announced that he was not convinced with the minister's response, particularly in light of the visit of 83 rabbis, who desecrated the land of mobilization and steadfastness and the soil of Jordan when they walked on the streets of al-'Aqabah, Amman, and Petra. Al-'Umush added: They were about to meet with a senior official, but they were kind enough to excuse him because he was very busy. Deputy al-'Umush said that some Jewish rabbis took part in the recent Islamic-Christian dialogue held in Amman. [passage omitted] Deputy al-'Umush said: We still hear every now and then about the calls on the private sector to make investments, particularly in Petra, because tourists are coming now secretly with U.S. passports. He added: Tourists will come openly in the future, particularly since the Jews are using the name Petra to propagate tourism in the region through world media which are under their control. We cannot accept the excuse that we receive foreigners because they carry foreign passports. A Jew, he said, remains a Jew regardless of his citizenship.

A statement, signed by 29 members of the House of Representatives, says: "We, like our people, were shocked by the rabbis' visit because it is something that was previously not allowed and they want to make it become something normal."]
