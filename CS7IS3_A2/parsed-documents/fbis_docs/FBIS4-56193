FBIS4-56193 "drlat084_c_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 MEXICO NAFTA May Be Used To Settle U.S. Tuna Embargo NAFTA May Be Used To Settle U.S. Tuna Embargo PA3004043294 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 28 Apr 94 p 51 PA3004043294 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Patricia Munoz] [Text] Yesterday, the Secretariat of Fisheries [Sepesca] said Mexico has not ruled out the possibility of resorting to NAFTA to settle the tuna embargo imposed by the United States on the country, which has caused economic damages estimated at approximately $50 million to date. It reported 70 percent of the national fishing cooperatives have gone into debt to balance their financial situation, and 60 percent of them have been forced to restructure their debt with the banks. This past year, the number of cooperative boats in the Pacific has been reduced 25 percent and the number of private fishing boats has also been reduced by an equal percentage. By contrast, the number of foreign investment projects in this sector is increasing, particularly as regards to the development of aquiculture and fishing in territorial waters. Juan Jose Moreno Sada, Sepesca federal delegations coordinator, and Geronimo Ramos, director of International Fishing Affairs, made the aforementioned statements at a news conference, in which they also announced the 94 International Fishing Fair, from 8 to 12 June at Boca del Rio, Veracruz. Moreno Sada explained there is an encouraging outlook in the fishing sector, because the recovery of this economic activity began in 1993. That year, production increased 3 percent, basically from the reactivation of shrimp fishing and higher domestic consumption of tuna. In 1994, this sector is expected to maintain its rate of growth and exports, which total about $500 million, will grow by 20 percent throughout the year, reaching $750 million in the next three years. He said fishing cooperatives are steadily recovering and may even be capitalized because 310 of these companies have received financial backing to support their reactivation. Of the $250 million the fishing cooperatives owed to date, $150 million have been restructured, leaving only 40 percent of the credits to be renegotiated. The importance of this lies in the fact that the bread and butter of approximately 300,000 families comes from fishing cooperatives, and that last year the number of boats in this sector declined from 600 to 450, namely one out of five boats stopped operating. Geronimo Ramos, director of International Fishing Affairs, addressed the difficult topic of the tuna embargo. Regarding this topic, he said Mexico has worked hard to reduce the accidental death rate of dolphins, to the point it reached a statistical rate of "zero." This is because in the last few months, a 0.4-percent dolphin accidental death rate was achieved for tuna fishing, thereby achieving international standards in tuna fishing; however, the elimination of the U.S. embargo has not been obtained. Asked if Mexico will resort to NAFTA to negotiate the elimination of this commercial sanction against the country, Ramos answered that the authorities have not ruled out resorting to Chapter 20 of the Treaty regarding the solution of controversies to settle this problem. Meanwhile, the official explained that enormous interest by foreign businessmen to invest in the fishing sector has been observed. He stated there are currently a $100 million in projects to be made in the country with U.S. and European capital. The modification of the fishing law promoted two years ago paved the way for opening the possibilities for private capital participation and investments have flowed. For instance, this year there are projects involving such Spanish companies as Costa Brava, Nueva Galicia, and O'Farril Valenciana, the investors of which are particularly attracted to aquiculture projects and fishing in territorial waters, especially in Baja California Norte and Sur, and in southeastern Mexico.
