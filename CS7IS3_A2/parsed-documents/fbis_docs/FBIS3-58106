The 16 member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation must be prepared "to help the UN implement its resolutions by sending in additional troops and ensuring real protection in the safe areas," he said. Juppe said the Brussels summit on January 10 and 11 should enforce a European Community peace plan agreed last year by building up sufficient land forces. Under the plan, Bosnia-Hercegovina was to be partitioned into three ethnically-defined mini-states, with the Bosnian government controlling one third of the republic's present territory. Juppe urged NATO to examine a French proposal to reopen the airport at Tuzla as a means of supplying humanitarian aid to the stricken population of central Bosnia. He said responsibility for the war was shared among the three communities. "We must break out of the war cycle," he said. If the fighting continued, countries with troops in Bosnia would sooner or later decide to withdraw them, causing an "explosion of war" throughout the Balkans, he told the Europe 1 station. Late Thursday President Francois Mitterrand said the United Nations should resist mounting pressure to pull its forces out of Bosnia-Hercegovina. "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN troops because that would amount to abandoning the civilian even more than they are already," he said.
