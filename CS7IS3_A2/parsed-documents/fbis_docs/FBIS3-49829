At a news conference, he did not comment on the NATO threat to bomb the Bosnian Serb positions, but only said that "the threat is realistic." The DSK leader described as positive British Prime Minister John Major's statement on "the policy of prevention in Kosovo." Rugova said that the incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian border are "a provocation against Albania, but also against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo." Rugova did not elaborate further on any of these issues, nor on his habitual claim about "the repression against the Albanians in Kosovo."
