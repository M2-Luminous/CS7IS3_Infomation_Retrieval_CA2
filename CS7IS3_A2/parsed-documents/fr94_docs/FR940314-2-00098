Background. On November 24, 1993, the President signed into law the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;152. Public Law 103&hyph;152 extended the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program, and amended the SSA to require States, as a condition of receiving administrative grants, to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC for purposes of identifying claimants who are likely to exhaust UC and will need job search assistance to make a successful transition to new employment. The SSA was further amended to require States to disqualify an individual identified pursuant this profiling system if the individual fails to participate in reemployment services. In addition, Public Law 103&hyph;152 made a technical change to Title IX of the SSA. States have already been advised of those provisions affecting the EUC program in GAL 12&hyph;92, Change 6. This issuance is limited to those amendments to the SSA affecting the Federal-State UC program. These amendments are as follows: (a) a new requirement that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC; (b) a new requirement that State law require claimants identified as most likely to exhaust regular UC to participate in reemployment services as condition of UC eligibility; and (c) a technical amendment to Title IX of the SSA pertaining to the Unemployment Trust Fund. 4. Action Required. SESAs are requested to take the action necessary to assure consistency with Federal requirements as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;152. The effective dates for implementation of these amendments are found in Attachment III. 5. Inquiries. Inquiries should be directed to your Regional Office. 6. Attachments. I. Unemployed Workers Profiling II. Participation in Reemployment Services III. Draft Language to Implement Section 4(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;152 IV. Technical Amendment Concerning the Unemployment Trust Fund
