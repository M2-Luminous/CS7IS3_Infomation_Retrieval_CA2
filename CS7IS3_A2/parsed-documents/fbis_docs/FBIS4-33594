The senator added that Venezuela currently is not in the best of economic and social conditions to receive the Haitian refugees. She stressed that it was quite unexpected that a highly developed nation such as the United States has decided not to give the refugees asylum, and yet it has asked a country like Venezuela--a nation facing a crisis--to receive them. She added that what is even more unusual is that the Venezuelan Government has decided to accept the request.
