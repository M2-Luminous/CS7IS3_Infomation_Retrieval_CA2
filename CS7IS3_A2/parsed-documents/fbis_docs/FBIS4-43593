He said: The process should begin from the UN secretary general's latest report and, after seeking various options, aim at creating political will on the Turkish side. Mr. Mikhailidhis added: The Greek Cypriot side is interested in knowing the other side's position on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] so that the new process may offer us the possibility to deal with more vital questions. Such questions, he explained, are all those that affect Turkey's lack of political will, such as the presence of occupation troops in Cyprus, questions of security, guarantees of a possible solution, questions of settlers, and a series of other questions. Mr. Mikhailidhis said that he reiterated to his interlocutors the Cyprus Government's positions on the various aspects of the Cyprus issue and expressed his satisfaction of the UN secretary general's crystal clear stand on the 21 March document. Mr. Mikhailidhis added that he will brief President Glavkos Kliridhis today on the substance of his meetings in the United States and London. He noted that he will also brief President Kliridhis on the information he exchanged with Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou with whom he travelled from London. Mr. Papandreou and Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos concluded their contacts in London on behalf of the European Union's [EU] Greek presidency within the framework of preparations for the EU summit in Corfu. Referring to criticism on some of his visits, Mr. Mikhailidhis expressed his regret because, he said, some people should be a little patient until they are briefed on what actually happened. He also hoped that all the political parties would like to hear the views of the permanent and nonpermanent Security Council members, which will determine further developments.
