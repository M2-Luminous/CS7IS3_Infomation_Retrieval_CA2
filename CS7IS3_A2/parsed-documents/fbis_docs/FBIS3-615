Police have also confiscated radio equipment from the aircraft, saying there are no valid transportation permits for the equipment. The grounding was authorised by the district commissioner of Namibia's north-eastern region, Mr Ben Haingura, after a request from Angolan authorities. The Antonov-26's pilot, Mr Oleg Pantiuhia, denied the claims of supplying UNITA and said his employer, Ecomex, supplied medical equipment to "Angolan civilians".
