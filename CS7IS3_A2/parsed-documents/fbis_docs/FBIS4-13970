He added: On the whole the West believes that the Serbs should not only remain but should not be weakened either. And the Muslims should remain in the region too, but as a weak and scattered group that has to depend on daily assistance from Europe and the United States in all fields. Rowhani described cooperation among Islamic countries as very significant for the future of the region's Muslims. He went on: The Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with instructions of the esteemed leader and on the basis of its Islamic and revolutionary obligation, is determined to provide every assistance required and will continue its aid more than ever before. In conclusion, the participants issued a resolution asking all governments of the Islamic world, and particularly the Islamic Republic of Iran, to demonstrate the power of Islam once again by imposing sanctions against those who support the Serbs overtly and covertly. Also in this resolution the participants at the seminar announced readiness for any cooperation -- including military, medical, and cultural cooperation -- so as to safeguard the entity of the Islamic land of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
