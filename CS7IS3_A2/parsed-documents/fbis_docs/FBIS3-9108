Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is intelligent and cautious, does not flinch under fire when asked about his government's many inconsistencies in Bosnia, and does not believe in any Bosnian fundamentalism. "My spokesman will have told you that out of the dozens of interviews for which I have been requested over the past few days your newspaper is the only one that I am going to receive," he explained before going to Washington for the final signing of the agreement. [Villapadierna] Why has Zagreb fought more for Herzegovina -- part of another country -- than for eastern Slavonia itself, which remains occupied? [Granic] The foremost aim of Croatian policy is the real reintegration of the occupied areas within the Croatian state's legal and economic framework. When the UN Protection Forces' mandate ends, President Tudjman will send Butrus-Ghali our plan for reintegration on the basis of the existing resolutions. We wish to extend the air exclusion order to the occupied areas of Croatia and for it also to include an ultimatum in order to monitor the borders, as the resolutions stipulate. Regarding what you say about Herzegovina, I will remind you that the plan for a greater Serbia, against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, produced its strongest reaction precisely in Herzegovina. Without that reaction, there would not be a single free territory in Bosnia today. [Villapadierna] What has changed for you people and the Muslims to cease killing each other on the Neretva? [Granic] The conditions for the current agreement (between Bosnian Croats and Muslims) were being created for a long time in lengthy secret negotiations which began 14 September, and Croatia finally deemed the time ripe to accept and fully support this. Then it was a matter of finding strong international support, and this was Washington. The talks in Vienna have ended successfully, and the military agreement has been signed and will be ratified in Washington Friday, but nothing would have been possible without the United States. [Villapadierna] What is the significance of the other agreement with Belgrade, whose forces are still invading your country? [Granic] Croatia also wants a final normalization of relations, but with acceptance of its territorial integrity. The rapidity of that normalization will depend on Belgrade's attitude to the occupied territories and its observance of the resolutions. Only, communications have been restored and we can talk, and this represents an impetus to the commission seeking the 7,500 missing persons. [Villapadierna] Have you no guarantee of extending sanctions until reintegration? [Granic] We will continue to demand this. The total harmonization of thinking with U.S. ideas is our best guarantee. Croatia is prepared to speak with Croatia's Serbs within the framework of what is laid down by the Security Council, to cease firing immediately, and to establish transport and communications. Everybody now wishes to support a final peaceful solution; Churkin was here yesterday. Croatia is at its best point internationally. [Villapadierna] Will there be a referendum on the federation in Bosnia? [Granic] Everybody is in agreement on the federation except some people in the Serbian National Party. Regarding the confederation, our Constitution requires two-thirds of the Sabor and then a referendum. [Villapadierna] Can a southern Slav country be like Switzerland? [Granic] We have studied many models with the best U.S. and European legislators, but the main thing is not the cantons but the political agreement and equal rights for Croats and Muslims. Economically, Bosnia has been destroyed. It will need special assistance from the world; there are good signs of this. On the Islamic side, it is cheaper to help reconstruction than to send arms; on the European side, it is between 10 and 20 times cheaper to send back the refugees and help them here. And the economy is always a good reason. [Villapadierna] Will the "Srpska republic" be deactivated? [Granic] We have offered them entry into the confederation on the same terms. No concessions will be made on human rights. [Villapadierna] Are the United States and Russia alone able to restore peace to the Balkans? Has Europe thwarted their hopes? [Granic] It is very complex. Europe is very interested in this region -- the European powers are our neighbors. On my recent tour I secured considerable agreement on our negotiation and the resolution of the conflict, but Europe has no instruments or strong machinery: It cannot stop the Serbian aggression. The European conglomeration represents wealth, but also weakness. That is why we have dwelt on U.S. support so much. [Villapadierna] Why did the alleged German interests in Yugoslavia prove so unacceptable for the same Europe which now accepts the Russian intervention and interests in Serbia? [Granic] Throughout this period, Germany's stance has been very positive, especially in the humanitarian sense, and in promoting dialogue between Croats and Muslims. On the Russian presence, most of the powers agree on the influence which they exert over the Serbs. Germany has no influence over the Serbs, but it does over Russia. In addition, Russia's particular interest in the Balkans must be accepted. [Villapadierna] Why did Zagreb betray its alliance with Sarajevo, only to sign the confederation agreement after thousands of deaths? [Granic] Write that I utterly disagree with that, and I have been following this conflict for a long time. Since the aggression against Croatia, we have offered them a military alliance. I am saying this for the first time. The situation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was very difficult, surrounded on all sides, but they should have taken their decision earlier. Croatia supported independence, because the agreement was a decentralized country with equal rights for everybody. The (Bosnian) Croats were the best organized to defend their territory, and the Muslims received their first weapons from Croatia. [Villapadierna] The first convoys of weapons to defend Srebrenica were also stopped by the Croats. [Granic] What some Croat troops did with the Muslim convoys, the destruction of Mostar, or the massacres of Achmici and Stupni Dol, are another matter. I can also give you around 40 instances of the Muslims. On many occasions, it was Croats and Muslims together who stopped the convoys. [Villapadierna] People paid by secret services to worsen the conflict? [Granic] Clearly. It is strange that many of these crimes were covered immediately by some television channels such as CNN, while others which were much bloodier were not mentioned: There were interests. I assure you that what we are going to sign is the same thing that Tudjman and I proposed back in August without much response. [Villapadierna] President Izetbegovic also offered a confederation in Geneva. [Granic] This desire existed on both sides, but I tell you: I wish to speak to you not of specific mistakes -- that is history -- but of a global strategy. You know that the Muslims are not a homogeneous body: The majority are in favor of full cooperation with the Croats, but others are in favor of a separate Islamic state. [Villapadierna] Have you won support for your agreement in Moscow? [Granic] Moscow has been very active: The Serbs will join in the negotiations.
