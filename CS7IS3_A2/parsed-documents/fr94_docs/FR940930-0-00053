FR940930-0-00053 FR940930-0-00009 B. New Definitions This interim rule is adding the new terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography'' to ยง900.2 in order to clarify which breast cancer screening or diagnostic mammography activities conducted by a facility will render that facility subject to the provisions of and regulations issued under the MQSA, and which activities are excluded from regulation. Under the MQSA, Congress defined the term ``mammography'' as radiography of the breast, but provided no statutory definition for the terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography.'' This interim rule is adding the terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography'' to the definition portion of the regulations in order to clarify the scope of the regulated mammography activities. These definitions are based on definitions developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and the ACR, and have been modified as necessary for purposes of MQSA implementation. The term ``screening mammography'' is being defined as mammography performed on an asymptomatic patient to detect the presence of breast cancer at an early stage. In screening mammography, the patient typically has not manifested any clinical signs, symptoms, or physical findings of breast cancer. The screening mammogram is performed to detect the presence of a breast abnormality in its incipient stage and to serve as a baseline film to which future screening or diagnostic mammograms may be compared. The term ``diagnostic mammography'' is being defined as mammography performed on a patient with clinical signs, symptoms, or physical findings suggestive of breast cancer; an abnormal or questionable screening mammogram; a history of breast cancer with breast conservation surgery regardless of absence of clinical breast signs, symptoms, or physical findings; or, augmented breasts regardless of absence of clinical breast signs, symptoms, or physical findings. Diagnostic mammography is also called problem-solving mammography or consultative mammography. A diagnostic mammogram is performed because there is a reasonable articulable suspicion that an abnormality may exist in the breast. The diagnostic mammogram may confirm or deny the presence of an abnormality and, if confirmed, may assist in determining the nature of the problem. FDA has further defined the terms screening and diagnostic mammography to exclude breast imaging performed in a research setting as part of a scientific study to evaluate experimental mammography devices conducted in accordance with FDA's investigational device exemption regulations in 21 CFR part 812. Science has not progressed to the point where effective quality standards may be written for every category of experimental mammography device. Therefore, at this time these investigational devices for breast radiography will not be subject to the quality standards issued under the MQSA. However, any conventional mammography device used as part of the scientific study to provide baseline data from which to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental device would be subject to MQSA quality standards. In addition, invasive interventions which employ breast radiography devices to produce radiographic images of the breast in association with localization or biopsy (e.g., stereotactic x-ray) procedures have also been excluded from the definitions of screening and diagnostic mammography activities. In the future, when the science has advanced to a point where effective, national quality standards may be developed, FDA may regulate facilities that employ these invasive interventions or facilities that employ experimental devices for breast radiography to ensure their compliance under the act.
