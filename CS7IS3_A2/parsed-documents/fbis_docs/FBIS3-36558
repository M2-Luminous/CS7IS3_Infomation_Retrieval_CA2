Since 1 December 1993 their receiveables have grown from 46 to 78 trillion karbovantsi. At a meeting of the Presidium of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP] on 4 February, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov stated: Since the movement of payments has almost halted, "the state's financial and monetary system is paralyzed" and "industry is low." In his words, it was decided that there would be considerable financial "injections" in the economy. The government convinced Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch of the need for this move. It is now being coordinated what the plan for this will be; whether it will be done through index-linking of working capital or through emission. Vasyl Yevtukhov said he and Deputy Prime Ministers Valeriy Shmarov and Volodymyr Demyanov estimated that the total sum of money required was several tens of trillions of karbovantsi. In order to set monetary circulation in motion, the USPP proposed "to determine the karbovantsi sum that would ensure the first round of payments in goods manufacturing and banking and to channel it to restoring the production cycle. To do this, mandatory mutual offsetting of enterprises' debts through settlement by promissory notes via relevant banks should be carried out; the enterprises with a negative balance after mutual offsetting by promissory notes should be identified; priorities in the structure of the national produce should be set; the range of enterprises that have the right to state credits should be determined; and credits to sectors of the national economy should be prohibited legislatively by the Ukrainian president's edict. Should monetary emission be necessary in order to grant state credits to specific enterprises, it should be carried out." The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has decided that credits should be granted to separate sectors along the technological line: By granting credits to the metallurgy and the coking by-product industry, the government will enable them to settle their accounts with the coal miners and the coal miners in their turn will settle theirs with the power engineers etc. At the same time, it is providing funds subject to produce in real terms, rather than granting purely emissive credit, that is at issue. According to some data, the government will make ministries' and departments' primary officials personally responsible for returning the money. In Vasyl Yevtukhov's words, this scheme of credit provision requires 7-15 trillion karbovantsi, which is two times less than the sum that was discussed previously. Separate on the list is the agro- industrial complex, which requires 3-4 trillion karbovantsi. In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy confirmed that "the problem of offsetting mutual indebtedness should be tackled positively and immediately." He at the same time was categorical in denying claims that this would lead to considerable emission, since credits, in his words, will be granted "exclusively subject to the finished produce." Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on expert estimates forecasting initial emission to the amount of five trillion karbovantsi, the Ukrainian acting prime minister said: "No businessman will ever see such an emission in Ukraine." Ukrainian Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko told a UNIAN correspondent: "Better emission, or to be more precise, emissive credit, than mutual offsetting. The offsetting of mutual indebtedness will take one and a half to two months, while we need radical and prompt measures to increase the viability of industry. At present there is a disaster in every sector." Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, USPP Chairman Leonid Kuchma pointed out that the financial system could be unblocked by interbank promissory note offsetting, which would identify bankrupt enterprises. He spoke categorically against automatically offsetting mutual debts. According to the latest information, however, the government has rejected this USPP proposal, since the banks are inexperienced in working with promissory notes. Asked by a UNIAN correspondent about how well-grounded talk of emission was, Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek at his news conference on 4 February answered: "We shall seek to settle the issues of the budget deficit in the first quarter -- and I cannot be sure that there will not be any in the second one as well -- on a non-emission basis. This was one of the subjects of the talks by the Ukrainian Government delegation in the United States. The submission of annual financial reports by enterprises is a convenient time for enterprises to be cleared up. Address or point assistance will only be given to those who are the foundation of our export potential." Roman Shpek also said that delegations from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are coming to Ukraine next week.
