The new regulations embody the principles of the national law on this subject outlined in June last year. The city has now got a population of 250,000 returned overseas Chinese and their relatives. Seven out of ten joint-venture enterprises in the capital are funded by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots. The regulations confirm that the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives have rights to take part in social, political and economic activities and to get proper education and visit their relatives abroad. They are also ensured of their rights in dealing with personal property. The regulations go into detail on the issue of the private houses, one of the greatest concerns of the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, and formulate some preferential policies for them. The regulations have outlined a number of special policies to encourage the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to set up enterprises in their motherland.
