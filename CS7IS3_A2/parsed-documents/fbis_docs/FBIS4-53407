"The uprising made the South Korean people clearly see that the United States is an aggressor and murderer, not a friend," he said. "Unless the Americans are driven away, the South Korean people cannot get rid of colonial slavery nor can achieve the democratisation of society and the independent, peaceful reunification of the country." Cho Il-min further said: "We will wage the anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle more courageously, never forgetting the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the military fascist murderers in slaying in cold blood Kwangju citizens who courageously rose in the uprising for independence, democracy and reunification and turning Kwangju into a blood. "The United States must take steps to pull its forces and nuclear weapons out of South Korea, clearly seeing that there is no room for it to stay in South Korea where anti-U.S. sentiments are growing day by day and not making light of the unshakable will of the South Korean people to fight it out to defend the national sovereignty. "The United States must renounce its policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK over the `nuclear issue', sincerely seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through the medium of DPRK-USA negotiations and respond to the just proposal of the DPRK to replace the armistice agreement with a peace agreement."
