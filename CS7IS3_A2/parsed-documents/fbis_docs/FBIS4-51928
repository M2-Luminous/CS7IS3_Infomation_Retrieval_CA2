Earlier, the commission gave Japan a 31-point list requesting improvements in its regulation system, including liberalization of financial and other markets, investment stimulation, and import expansion. These matters were supposed to be discussed at the Japan-EU ministerial talks starting on 22 April, but the talks have been postponed due to the political chaos in Japan. Japan included deregulation in a guideline for external economic reform adopted last month, and plans to work out concrete measures for it by the end of June. By securing a channel of dialogue on deregulation, the EU appears to want to "monitor" Japan in making certain that its deregulation program is put into practice.
