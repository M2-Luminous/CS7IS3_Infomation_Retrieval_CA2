[passage omitted] Anatoliy Zlenko said that Ukraine expects $4 billion worth of aid as a result of its disarmament. As regards nuclear arms withdrawal which, according to Ukrainian People's Deputy Valentin Lemish, seems to have started already, Tarasyuk said: "I declare with all due responsibility that no warhead has crossed the borders of Ukraine as yet. Indeed, three warheads have been transferred to Russia for dismantling, but only because of their disastrous condition and in response to experts' demands."
